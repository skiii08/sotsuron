Kill Bill: Vol. 2," a fitting conclusion to this martial arts homage
","I've seen Vol. 1 on more than one occasion, but only vaguely remember having seen Vol. 2 once before.The 'Bride' is played again with great aplomb by Uma Thurman, but much kudos to her co-stars; Bill's brother (Michael Meaden) and El (Darryl Hannah) who do a fantastic job as the 'baddies'. The back story is further enhanced by detailing the bride's training under Pei-Mi.Of course the ultimate showdown between the bride and Bill concludes the movie, but what a ride!",8,0,0,28 March 2020
Kung Fu Panda," Enjoyable, entertaining film for all ages
","Kung Fu Panda is an enjoyable and entertaining movie and not overly long at an hour and 30 minutes.Not surprisingly for a film targeted towards children, there is a fair amount of moralising in the form of the triumph of good over bad and persistence in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. That said, those are lessons applicable for any of us!The pace of the story is good and character development more than adequate to carry the story convincingly. Definitely a film for all ages. Looking forward to watching later films in the series.",8,0,0,22 December 2018
Superbad," Coming of age comedy; original, but same vein as 'Porkys'
","So catching this in 2020, I'm well over the targeted age demographic for this movie.Having been a teenager in the 1980's the movie equivalent of this would have been 'Porkys' IMHO. To that end as a 'coming of age' movie, it does a good job. However, the recurrent themes were laboured (e.g trying to buy alcohol underage, losing one's virginity) and left me feeling that this could have been considerably shortened from its 1h 50 to 1h 30m.All in all, probably better suited (and indeed intended) for the teens to twenties age group",6,1,1,4 June 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Promising premise, good storyline, slightly confusing ending
","Caught this on C4+1 on Saturday on the last bank holiday weekend in August. I enjoyed the premise of the transformation of wimpy enlisted man to super solider. Also 'hydra' as a division of the Nazi war-machines special weapons development division was inspired. I thought there were elements of the film that would have benefited from greater development - i.e. notably the condensing of the 'energy' into cubes? especially at the end.The romantic thread with Hayley Atwell's character ('Agent ...') also add's an angle that doesn't stray (too often) into over-sentimentality. All in all, an enjoyable and 'retro-fitted' comic book genesis of a superhero.",6,1,1,25 August 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Extraordinary fantasy with bizzare and dark storyline (Spoilers)
","Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine).As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it.Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements:
1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines?
2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least.
3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot.
4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? 
5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise??Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.",4,4,7,19 May 2018
American Made," Solid (mostly fictionalised) storyline albeit based on a true story
","I enjoyed this movie insofar that Cruise plays a believable Barry Seal. The back story (i.e. US government involved in propping up anyone they see as their enemies-enemy) is also entirely plausible and no doubt now recorded as contemporary history.There are also add-ins to the story that are entirely fictional (e.g. Barry's brother in law). I find this a little disappointing and there was plenty enough 'meat' in the narrative to sustain the audience's attention, but hey-ho, I'm not a Hollywood exec. Worth a watch if only to remind yourself of mid-80's US foreign policy.",7,0,0,23 February 2020
Deadpool," The superhero movie played for its comedy value
","Poking fun at other superhero franchise's with fast paced and heavily ironic one liners delivered courtesy of Ryan Reynolds. However, there's still the action and plenty of tounge in cheek humour - some of an adult nature. Enjoyable, nothing too taxing, and still formulaic enough to obey (at least) some of the 'rules'.",8,0,1,17 June 2019
Spectre," Bond plot trajectory's segued here - robust fare in the Bond franchise
","I enjoyed this film on re-watch. Bond is familiarly reprimanded at the beginning of the film and predictably brought back into the fold when his hunch proves to be correct.The plot is,... well a Bond plot. Global evil intent is brought to heel by one man on the side of a former Imperial power fighting a just cause. The segueing of former characters into this plot was especially welcome to me at least and have the plot more credibility. I thought the actress playing the grieving widow was particularly good. The script was middling, although all the actors turn in strong performances. If you're a Bond fan, a must watch.",8,0,0,27 June 2020
