The Longest Yard," Sandler at his worst - almost!
","How many times must this plot be filmed? I'm not sure that Burt Reynolds was the first back in 1974, but that version was my personal favourite, even though fellow countryman Vinnie Jones did a worthy rendition with an English spin in 'The Mean Machine'. This attempt by Adam Sandler seems entirely unnecessary, somehow. The script remains almost word-for-word the same as the 1974 version and Sandler brings nothing additional to the part of Paul Crewe. Indeed, Sandler was far less wooden in his classic, 'Going Overboard', which also had the distinction of at least being original. (Let's give thanks for that!) Some excellent films have been released in the past year or so; this is most definitely not one of them.",1,1,2,2 March 2006
