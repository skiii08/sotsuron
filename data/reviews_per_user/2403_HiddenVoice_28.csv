The New World," A slow build up.
","This film is slow in many ways.It is more of a meditation on love and loss.Like his previous powerful epic Thin Red Line,Malick likes to slowly build up his story.The slow pace will distract audience but this is a piece of art that is to be enjoyed and Malick deserves to be praised for what he has achieved.Everyone is familiar with the Pocahontas tale,so I won't go into details.Instead I would like to focus on the direction.Unlike Munich this films length becomes pretentious.It doesn't grow on you but frustrates you.But you have to look beyond that to experience the real treasure hidden underneath.Malick has always focused more on the situation and the settings rather than the characters or the actors.It's more like exploring the world than telling a story about it.Slowly and painfully but beautifully.I enjoyed the film even if it was long and boring because I understood what Malick was trying to do.He wants us to feel for the new world that has been discovered and feel for it when it gets destroyed.I cannot say this is his best work but regardless of that it still is a gorgeous film,a wonderful achievement.An artistic drama that slowly builds up to the end.Farrell is not used as an actor but just as a figure who witnesses the sudden ,devastating changes that happen into this new world.The real actor however is the newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher.She excels in the role,she delivers a heartfelt performance and the director has more focus on this famous character rather than the lead hero.Bale also surprises ,who falls for Pocahontas forming a love triangle.The rest of the cast also have its moment.However the praise should entirely go to the Director.He handles every scene like a king.He presents us this new world with aching beauty and gorgeous sets.He makes the love story between the two leads even more emotional.His slowly building up of story is where audience will lose the film.They will rather find it irritating but if you look closer there's a lot going for it.On the whole THE NEW WORLD is gorgeous epic,a sort of a mess,a heartwarming emotional love story,and a heart stopping epic with not so many noteworthy performances or moments.But a meditated attempt.A film that tries to connect with the audience the hard and painful way ,in which,the reward is priceless.****/5",8,5,13,25 December 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The outrageously funny Method Acting ever reigned on screen.
","Sacha Baron Cohen went everywhere with his ,somewhat,split personality character,BORAT.He has promoted his film by staying within the character.He has been applying method acting to its most extreme.And I can't think of any other actor,if I can recall any,who could play Borat with this kind of genuine hilarity.Welcome a new kind of Comic King,one that is more winier and Divine than Jim Carrey.I can't remember a single moment in my life when I laughed this hard.It's perhaps my first time that I laughed out really hard and loud in a public place,that is in the theater.I couldn't help it.It was unbelievable.Every scene,every joke,every gag just threw me laughing until I heard a crack in my ribs.And believe me ,if you will,I guarantee you with everything that you will laugh your hardest.You have my word.You won't laugh any harder or louder anywhere.No movie, I can make sure of that, will make you laugh this insanely hard. My head was hurting once I stopped laughing,and my cheeks gave me severe pain. But mind you,this is the most offensive and racist comedy too.Its remarks and its suggestive content is gonna make at least someone in the crowd angry.The TV Reporter of Kazakhstan,BORAT introduces his country and all the great stuff you can do in his country.He shows you his hometown around.You can play ping pong,disco,have sex,curse,offend,sun-bathe,and all that,while introducing the #2 or 3 or 4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan,who happens to be his sister.He is then assigned to go to the country he loves, US&A,to discover the cultural and social world of the 'Best Country in the World'.He gets his documentary crew and heads to the States,and then begins his wild,insane,and silly encounters with the natives and their world,as a cultural Learnings for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.But instead of doing what he was suppose to do,he goes off searching for Pamela Anderson and to propose to her so that he could take her back to his glorious country.It's a merciless,shameless comedy.And I think this is something more original than anything I've seen in the last passing years.A comedy at 80 minutes plus,with every single minute worth a laugh.I say save all your money for this graphically offensive,explicit and the most insanely wild laugh riot.Because you may have go back and watch it again and again until you give up laughing.I've already planned to watch it again once it's officially released.And boy,what moolahs it will make.It's a phenomenon of a new kind.And you thought JACKASS was funny?Forget that,here's something that will not only come to you as a racist film but as a film that you won't find anywhere else,cuz no film will make you laugh this hard and be as daring and original as this. I think I'm going crazy.I've gotta go watch it again and I can't wait for it to release.Any more free screenings or festivals and I'm there if it's showing. The Dialogues are ingenious and utterly laugh out loud hilarious.It's phenomenal work.I loved the script.It's main purpose is to make you laugh like you've never laughed in your entire life watching a film.It's a miracle of a comedy.Cohen is ,I don't know,unbelievable?I see of no reason why he should be overlooked at the next year's Academy Awards.If not that,he will surely win the MTV awards for the sake of the audiences.Whatever's gonna happen to this film at the box office,one thing is for sure,it will break a bone or two after it ends.I know I broke a few while laughing my butt off.Truly original comedy with method acting at its best.So,please for the sake of Borat,look/see his movie-film or else he'll be execute by his government.",9,19,43,3 October 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Predictable Entertainment! Mission needs to be reassigned.
","'Just you wait....this is the movie that's gonna kick off summer.It's gonna send audiences flying off their seats.' And right he was!This is the film that will officially kick off the summer blockbuster season,with One word fit in your mind after watching it,UNBELIEVABLE! There was a reason why the producers refrained from exposing much of the plot in the previews ,because there are so many predictable moments and obvious twists that the plot is simple and flat.Nothing new and it rather is old-fashioned actioner.No movie so far this year has made me so thrilled.I've been waiting for this film a long time and here it is.This is definitely Tom Cruise's most exposed film yet.90% of the film he was reigning the screen.You see Tom doing this ,doing that yada yada and so on.....it's repetitive.And I thought they won't make movies like these anymore.There is only a rare chance that a summer blockbuster is not a summer blockbuster.I mean it contains a story that seems really complicated but beneath it ,it's simple and nothing new.Very old fashioned.It's got action that don't leave a lasting effect but it's big and exciting.The acting,well,there is only one actor here to judge,is quite fine. Here the chases have no meaning,there is one action set piece followed by another that really gets overdone and too much.There is no emotional value here.And there are far too many clichés to consider this film original.Most of the time you know what's gonna happen.It's simply straightforward.Ethun Hunt is getting married and he is still working for IMF,as one of his missions includes capturing a ruthless man named Owen Davien.But as it appears he escapes and kidnaps Hunt's wife.And from here on ,mayham and big explosions begin with a stupid and pathetic climax.Cruise and Abrams have given us the same old action film that we see all time,only this time it's a little twisted and differently presented.But trust me ,it is one big flat joke.I can't believe this film was so heavily publicized.Cruise should know his limits.I wanted other characters to speak but Cruise just won't leave.At least for a while let us see another character ,give the actors a chance.You'll either see him with them or you'll just see him.Of course ,Hoffman gives a little distinct look to his character which is underwritten.It's more like an Americanized version of Bond baddie.But the character is bland.It's only Hoffman who injects a little evil to it.Surprisingly ,Hoffman is one of the few actors who became famous for portraying comic characters,and when they portray dramatic or serious Characters,they show their actual talent.Another one is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter.The reason why I went to watch this film was solely for J.J. Abrams.Abrams and crew have really redefined this series and breathed new life into it,I mean given it a new look.Each film is different from one another.Abrams,a veteran when it comes to spy dramas,nails it ,having this being his feature debut with a jaw dropping budget of 150 million.And it never looks like a debut.This will surely put him to sudden rise in fame.He keeps everything intense, right on spot with the plot and performances.It is simply intense experience thanks to him.Cruise,Cruise ,and Cruise.I was just sick of him.From his media exposure with his love-life ,to Scientology.He really should know his boundaries.I mean he solely made this film for himself.It's not that it's a bad thing to watch him doing his own stunts and sprinting faster than ever.It's just that,there are so many other characters here that don't get a chance to be exposed.Given the brief time,the supporting cast does well.The stunts and action was the main focus here,and they are electrifying and expertly executed.But it was a little too overdone and unconvincing.Especially doing all the stuff he did in the film.From jumping rooftops ,to a elaborate sequence on a bridge.But the film gives you full satisfaction on the action level.It is thrilling exciting ,enticing with electrified explosions,But they won't blow you away as promised.They are sometimes too ridiculous to believe.Some were just pathetic to believe.I mean how can group of people get into a party without ID or whatever and then pretend they are one of their enemies and the enemies don't even give a damn.No suspicion?I mean don't they have any manifest or some kind of list to check ,or are they not at all familiar with their co-workers?It's just not convincing.And then there's a ridiculous ending/climax that really gives this film a dubious look.Well,all I can say is that this is one film that promises a lot but never lives up to its expectation.I was disappointed,knowing Abrams co-wrote the film ,I thought this could've redefined blockbusters.But it turns out it is the same old big ass film,and there is little hope for that to succeed.The Mission Impossible series have just been reintroduced!Given a new look.It can be called best in the trilogy,depending on how you take it.But it certainly is multiple times better than MI2 and those other big budgeted dumb movies before this and the ones coming soon.Sure fire entertainment.Well, for me,the first Mission was still the best.",6,1,3,25 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin is this year's KISS KISS BANG BANG!
","A twisted little film from beginning to end.The most fun you'll have playing with your mind.It will keep you constantly thinking and still you won't be able to solve the puzzle.Fantastic! A top notch script on the move ,able directing,splendid performances,and a pitch perfect cast.This sure is this years Twisted little KISS KISS BANG BANG!.A hugely satisfying funny entertaining film.Josh Harnett is a rising star and this film permits him a promising rise.Although, you don't get to see much of Bruce in the film but still it's a superb film.With an excellent supporting performance by Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman.A film worth watching for and a cast worth dying for.This really stunned me!",8,14,34,1 April 2006
Spartacus," The Legend of Spartacus.
","This is a Stanley Kubrick film and you know what that means.A film way ahead of its time. A film far superior than any swords and sandal epic you'll watch in the modern cinema. A powerful achievement. A film far better than the over-hyped ,produced ,cheesy and lame in terms of performances , but with glorious Production design and a chariot race,BEN HUR. Those 11 Academy awards should've gone to this film.For 12 million dollars of budget it creates a film with a scale that is unimaginable.No CGI effects used for its spectacular battle scenes. Those who say that Stanley Kubrick films lack emotion should watch this film. There were many touching and emotional moments in the film especially towards the end. With Scenes that look like as if they were shot in present days with modern technology rather than in the 60's.The Sets were elevating, and performances were strong.Kirk Douglas leads the whole film without trouble. At over 3 hours this film never feels like a boring film ,with the exception of some scenes that could've trimmed(Blame the writer).It is Kubrick that enriches every film of his.He brings the utter realism and beauty to every shot and never makes it look like a cheesy 50's film.This unrated Director's Cut is splendid and surpasses all swords and sandal epics we come across nowadays.Before there even was The Gladiator ,there was Spartacus.Although it is a major disappointment that this film wasn't even given as much nominations or awards as Ben Hur got and that performances in that film were lame and weak.",8,7,15,26 April 2006
United 93," Leaves you shaken.You are likely not to forget this one.Truly remarkable film-making.
","What happened on that plane can never be known.No film could possibly depict the exact situation on that flight.But United 93 uses that event as a back-story and dramatizes it.Paul Greengrass knows that he can't accurately depict the incidents that has taken place on the plane.So,he uses the limited information and gives a dramatic approach to that event with as much realism as he can.So that all that in the film could look real.I was unsatisfied the way he approached the incident.The sudden rise of the passengers to halt the plane,and the continuous praying of the Muslims.He doesn't know that.He couldn't possibly know if those terrorists really were praying in their last minutes,or the passengers really did join forces and came together to stop the plane so that they could get back to their loved ones.But what he does is that he uses all that and gives us a devastating drama.A drama that will hurt Americans.But it's also a drama that is to be seen by both Americans and the non-Americans.We see how far we have reached from that point to this.We are reacting to the situation with violence.America has come a long way now to eliminate terrorism.And they've failed,just as they failed when the President was informed about the situation and the government didn't take action until it was too late.Greengrass really is the man who gives a powerful,shocking and painfully disturbing story,regardless if it's true.It hits you.And in the end,you choose to accept all that happens on screen.These men and women just wanted to get back home.They fought back before they died.What did those men and women do to the Terrorists?But then again,what did all those men and women in Iraq and Afganistan and all those Muslim countries that America is fighting war with do.The reason also to watch this harrowing unsettling film ,in the way MUNICH was , is that the stark realism that is put on the film.It is impossible not to believe the events that were occurring on the plane ,even if they weren't precisely accurate.It's a startling achievement for Greengrass,and I don't care if he did to honor them or just thought of getting an Oscar.He gives you a towering achievement.This is grand and perfect film-making.He takes us deep into the Airline headquarters,and shows us all the operations in detail.How a normal ,regular day begins to unfold into a chaotic ,shocking day.The men both in the Airline traffic control and in the plane,are left totally shaken by the events and so will be the audience.The sheer intensity of the situations scares you at times.It started like any other day,and slowly it descends into a nightmare.The Airline officials couldn't do anything,they were hopeless.They couldn't get approval from their Government,resulting in further tragedies.It just grips you.It will be a nightmare for those families who watch this film.Especially the final 10 minutes.Which will never be forgotten.It's like a horror movie before you.And makes it even more scarier,because you know what the conclusion is going to be for these men and women.A look is definitely worth.",8,5,13,28 April 2006
Citizen Kane," Legend of Kane lives on after almost over 60 years.......
","Everything said about this ambitious and powerfully crafted Mastwork was true,and I mean every single thing.A fascinating human drama,character study and visual exploitations.Every shot here has a meaning and not a frame is wasted.From it's dialogues to it's directing and even the terrific performance by Welles is well examined and rightfully given the Honor of the most profoundly and finely made movie in America and perhaps the greatest in the worldwide cinema.It begins off with a brief biography about the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane.A newspaper mogul who have had fair amount of success and failure. Then we see a bunch of reporters trying desperately to find out the meaning of the last word spoken by Kane,'ROSEBUD'.So they interview one person after another who has worked or have know Kane.So as they interview them , his life is told in flashbacks,about how he became who he were and how he fell from grace.Kane was separated from his parents at a very young age,taking away the love of his mother.He is taken by a financier who becomes Kane's guardian.As Kane's hatred for his guardian grows ,he refuses almost everything he asks from Kane.So instead being the heir to his guardian Gold business,he instead decides to run newspaper,sounds fun for him.As his newspaper business becomes successful Kane has only one thing in his mind,that is to help the underprivileged.He spends all his young life to help the poor by insulting the rich through his newspaper.As years past by,he finds himself having everything but love.The love from his wives was never a true love,and the only friends he had were his partners.He was missing the love from his mother,that love made him a lonely man.Despite having everything he had nothing.He wanted everyone to love him,he did everything for the poor so that they could love him back.Instead they hated him in the end,after failing to be elected and keeping false promises. Kane builds a massive mansion for himself which he never completed,just like everything in his life.It was never complete.As he dies in his big mansion with the words ROSEBUD,which no one had a clue what it meant ,from the most influential newspaper chain owner.This film clearly was film way beyond its time.While in the late 30's,people use the same techniques to make a film,Welles broke new grounds.He gave a revolutionary and influential film-making technique that was followed years to come.A flawless ,pitch perfect film,where there's hardly a sign of flaw.Its dialogues,acting,editing,directing,especially its cinematography and even its music,the film is perfection.And aided by the terrific performance by Welles himself in the title role ,it's no surprise why this film was hailed as America's most accomplished works. Its unique camera work and fascinating angles really impressed me,people lurking in shadows,with their emotions mostly hidden in the dark etc.You only see Kane crying while everyone else seem to have been sentimental for him,as if there was no one in the world for him.A man in his mid 20's makes his debut in such an accomplished way,directing,co-writing and even acting in the title role,he really have achieved something with this.Pulling fine performances from the newcomers.He took courage to make something new.A character study.Though Welles,never even came close to have one of his films to be as successful as this one as a director,he still remains a master filmmaker.How many débutantes can hit the spot with their very first film ,especially when you're in your early 20's and the film is America's best film.It's hard to explain a film with such formidable qualities.Not my personal favourite,but it's on my top ten all time favourite list.",9,1,3,15 February 2006
Rang De Basanti," A coming-of-age story that should've been great.
","How many times has Bollywood made films about corruption,politics,patriotism and tried endlessly to wake India up and change its system?And here comes another one.But what sets this one apart from those is that ,it approaches that theme in a different way and in a rather effective,long lasting way.The film had a good story,but to develop that story and its characters, is not possible in Bollywood.And instead, it wastes a lot of time showing how these really old looking college kids have fun.Sue,a British Documentary filmmaker ,finishes reading her Grandfather diary about how intrepid Indians were during The British rule in India where her Grandfather served the English.So,Sue decides to make a documentary about those men who fought for their country's freedom and died at a very young age to spread their messages.So,she arrives in India.India ,as always,Corrupt, filthy and totally helpless.And Sue's friend ,who is also her guide,Sonia and tries hard to find the perfect actors to pull it off.Until Sonia takes Sue to her rebellious and free spirited friends,who are totally westernized.In these free spirited men,she sees her characters and those freedom fighters and decides to cast them in the roles.But these kids are the new generation of men,who defy culture,tradition and all patriotism and think that is a thing of the past.They take life for granted and all care about having fun with the time they've given rather than do something to improve a country that can't be perfect no matter what anyone does.They think they should leave it the way it is and move on,either get out of India or suffer in it.And they would pick the former.But somehow they agree and Sue also falls for one of them,and they start making the documentary .And during the process they start to realize that it is not just one's duty to change a country ,but it is everyone's responsibility to fix the country and most importantly themselves.Then the film takes a weak turn by the end ,and becomes unconvincing in its approach and rather implausible and ridiculous.But ,nevertheless, it leaves an impact that may awake a generation.It's not inspirational,when it is suppose to be.It does however asks a lot of questions that maybe relevant to youth of India.It may wake them up and temp them to change this over-corrupt and terrible country.But it doesn't get to it and doesn't succeed completely.It spends too much time on the five friends wasting their time ,hanging out and having fun. Instead of being a coming-of-age film ,it relies on patriotism and it's third act is what hurts the film most.It was preposterous and far fetched.A bad move,the film was finishing off well,and it was about to be a good film until that twist in the climax comes up and ruins the film.It becomes hard to connect with the characters and unconvincing.But having said that,I still think this is one of the first ever Bollywood film that I've seen that somehow manages to tackle the issues that Bollywood have been tackling, with perfection.This film may serve as a message to those youngsters and Politicians and let them know that it is time to wake up and change the system.And it succeeds in that attempt where many like this came and gone with no effect on people.But it suffers from poor development of the story,and characters are not well written.The screenplay doesn't make appropriate moves and doesn't succeed to make a stronger impact.It's yet another Bollywood film that could've been great if it tried harder and it does.One really smart technique is the intersection of the past and present. The events of the past,puts these youngsters to look at themselves and those men who gave up their lives for freedom and think of themselves as those men.They realize why they are doing this.The films moves at a easy pace,and it's entertaining and it is true to its depiction of India as it is and what it is trying to do.However,the biggest problem with the film was its climax.It was a really bad move.The film was finishing off well and would've been a really memorable film ,but its third act was preposterous.I found the film thoroughly enjoyable,never preaching patriotic issues and always focusing somewhat on its message of change.But it's climax leading to its ending was the worst move made by the filmmakers.They were doing good and they could've ended it well.But they had to evoke violence in the film.Letting youth assume that violence solves everything.It felt like as if the gang lost their minds and were poisoned with drugs or something and made a wrong move.Like most teenagers who don't yet understand the world do.It was a disastrous move.Alice Paten is the highlight of the film.She is really convincing and gives the strongest performance in the film.Her fluent Hindi accent and emotional depth is well realized.It's a understated performance.While ,Aamir khan was fine in his role.He is actually a surprise ,playing a slacker.And the rest of the gang is just fine,nothing special.The director presents something refreshing than something clichéd and old.He really brings the best parts of the script to the screen with generosity.His sincere effort is well established.This film does need an international recognition.And one of the very few films that I came to like in Bollywood.But it never tops Dil Chahta Hai,or Lagaan or Being Cyrus.It is as good as Asoka or Dil se.But it seems that Bollywood is finally looking at their films and improving them.Making them logical and realistic.But as always,films like these don't come along every time.In the end I started asking myself why didn't Sue just opted for making a Film about Gandhi,like her producers suggested, rather than provoking these idiots,who misinterpreted her message,and chose to be their predecessors and use their actions in todays world.Kids are always kids.",6,1,11,25 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Avast,Damn those Bloody Pirates,it's too hard to resist them Mate,they are so bloody fun!
","Man,these Summer Blockbusters keep getting better and better.One after another,each better than the previous ones.I'm sorry Superman,but those bloody pirates are just so damn good that ,you've got to fall in love with them.Pirates of Caribbean is the film that shows what Summer Blockbuster is all about.They don't make movies like these you know.It was endlessly entertaining,more entertaining and fun than anything all year.Not even the Man of Steel could pull this off.With all the cast returning and more,this is a joy ride that you have to pay twice to fully experience it and feel it.I was astounded and rocked.This film was awesome.The film begins with Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner being arrested just before they were about to get married.They are accused of letting Jack Sparow escape.So in return Will must find Sparrow to help himself.While Elizabeth tries to escape, follows Will.Settling down with his ship and crew, Jack Sparrow is pretty much hidding something himself.But things of course can't be well for a damned Pirate,when a squid like pirate Davvy Jones reminds Jack that he has an old debt to pay.So,of course ,the dishonestly honest Jack must seek help from Elizabeth and Will Turner and there we go again.Another wild ride that will simply leaves you completely satisfied.One hour to this film and I found myself completely clueless.All that was taking place on screen made no sense.With all its silliness and half baked jokes really left me terribly unsatisfied and disappointed.It filled me with doubt that the rest of the film is pretty much gonna be like this.But then by the start of the second hour,the film picks up like a person can spot a pirates lie.Then it enters back to territory that made the first film so endlessly enjoyable.The smartness and clever side of the script emerged and thrills,surprises and incredible effects with huge excitement totally made me change my mind.And an ending that will leave you dying to see the third part.All that pretty much assured me that ,this sequel is exactly what I had expected.There's everything here for everyone.The thing that Superman Slightly lacked.Colorful ,fun Characters,smart dialogues,great epic-sized action.And of course,some really ,really awe-inspiring CGI effects.There are twists and surprising turns,especially towards the end ,where the fun gets even better ,scene after scene.Something great is always popping up.Though less superior than its already splendid first installment,we all loved the first one.And it concludes with a cliffhanger to leave you thirsty for the third.It's the kind of cliffhanger that Reloaded gave us,but its final installment didn't live up to expectations.But I can say this much that ,this films finale,or final installment will rock the world.The Production designs,the sets were unbelievable!They were breath taking.They were so elaborate and detailed that they meet the standards of LORD OF THE RINGS films.It gives the film an other-worldly look.As if the characters were in some kind of a fantasy world.Thank someone,that we have a versatile actor like Johnny Depp.The only actor who I would thank.Having his presence throughout the film was like having a magician constantly pulling out tricks that are all satisfying.Depp,is the first and best reason to watch this film,just like the first one.Knightley is a surprise here.The first one didn't develop her character much,but here she elevates and pushes the boundaries.She really has a lot to do here.Bloom was just like he was in the first one.But his character discovers something that will leave the audience surprised.That is his father.What a surprise it was to finally see the legendary Bootstrap Bill,and Sarsgard was perfection.And then there is the always fabulous Billy Nighy.Where the first one had Geoffrey Rush,here we have Nighy to give you a great baddie.Who never had disappointed me with his performance.So goes for the rest of the cast with a few new additions,such as Naomi Harris.Kudos,to Director Gore Verbinski,and Producer Bruckheimer and Ted Elliot& Terry Rosio for their smart,witty writing.They all give you the very definition of 'sequels better than the original'.They give you a grand spectacle.They really give you everything you deserve to get from a summer Blockbuster.It's a film that we deserve after numerous Blockbusters that didn't fully satisfied us.This film boosts a better score than the first one too.This one is purely fantasy.The Squid looking Pirates are hardly believable,I mean did they ever existed in really world?Whereas the first one had a more believable Bad Pirates.In this film,the Pirates are more Fantasy-like.And somehow detaches itself from reality.It doesn't occur to you that this might've happened.I mean Pirates that look like squids can hardly be bought.It features a lot more weird creatures,that are actually pirates and more.Giant sea monsters and creatures that are very well created with CGI.And that's one of the few big flaws this film has.It doesn't make itself realistic,nor does it take itself too seriously.When there's something dramatic and serious is suppose to happen.And yes,it's a lot more darker than the first one. Way dark.Don't bring those kids of yours,or they'll hate pirates and their misadventures.Yet,this is a splendid entertainer.It's funny,exciting,fast-paced even with 2 hours plus length.It's simply great.This film features more than you could ask for.Those 2 and a half hours in the dark will keep you thrilled throughout.This year's greatest entertainment is here and will knock you flat.I've seen many Blockbusters, from V for Vendetta,to MI3,Da Vinci to X3 to Superman returns.But none could achieve the satisfaction as this Pirates sequel did.So,it's not all that risky to trust the bloody Pirates after all.",7,56,113,4 July 2006
Hot Fuzz," Ingenious!From the makers of 'Shaun of the Dead' give you another classic,original piece of cinematic breakthrough.
","Original,Hilarious,full of action,this is as hot as it gets.The smartly written script and witty characters make this a must see for action comedy fans.It breaks new grounds and reinvents the genre by giving us a whole new bunch of excitement over it.It's rated R and that makes it even better.Watch it and you'll feel rewarded after Hollywood's failure to come up with anything original in this genre.The continuous flow of crappy entertainments and very little,and rare originality coming only from Art-house flicks and sometimes Blockbuster films.I loved this flick.A-, 8.5/10, ****/5....I'll write the full review later.",8,1,2,21 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Sweeping Mountains.
","From this movie on Hollywood need not worry about the subject matters that concerns homosexuality.Everyone will be familiar with this lushly beautiful story in a month or two.This truly is the most heartbreaking and emotionally touching film told straight from the heart.It will make you cry , that is guaranteed.It has moments that only classics have.It is first and foremost a love story , not a sex movie , it does not contain any graphic sexuality, it is not shot in that way either.It is just a passion that emerges between two human beings.Not knowing what it is,a misunderstood ,unthinkable ,uncompromising love between two characters explored to the depths.It is the very definition of love.You don't know you're in love but you can feel.There is no difference whether your love is for the same sex or opposite sex.It's aching beauty will blow you away.The photography , the setting is just spellbinding.I was already looking forward to this film since I caught the preview.This is the reason why we go to the movies and Hollywood remains at the top of the world in the film-making category.This a piece of art that will wipe you out.It will strike you right at the heart with a conclusion that you will not be able to wash your tears off.It has performances that define Oscar contenders.The two leads just bring the characters to life.Its supporting actors completes the whole story.Ang Lee had this film in his mind long before he was making The HULK,and now I understand why.He presented a film with heartwarming, heartbreaking ,tear-jerking beauty.He just proved he is one of the most artistic filmmakers existing.He completes the film with his vision ,with his imagination.He never once let you feel that he is afraid of the films subject matter and he handles the whole thing with ease.He is the essence of this film along with the performances.I just hope Heath Ledger gets what he deserves and that is an Award.This was overall the most touching love story I've ever witnessed, made even more mesmerizing by its settings and its lush beauty.It ranks in the heights of CASABLANCA.This is a Hollywood classic.A tremendous masterwork of art.And it is not for audiences who don't enjoy slow,artistic works.This is a film for aspiring filmmakers, who want to be artistic.",9,19,33,9 December 2005

","Crash really goes deep to tackle the race issues.A thing that has plagued humanity.A thing that keeps driving men with power to manipulate those who are different and keep them under their foot.Even if it focuses only on a handful of characters,from which only some are actually widely discriminated,its issues are still universal.As it begins with a murder having taken place,and into the investigation,A character asks himself why we keep colliding with one another,even if we never come close to each other.As the story progresses,it becomes an urban drama with a murder mystery left to be solved.Lives of a group of people with different background comes colliding with each other resulting in consequences,surprises and redemption.In the following 36 hours,their lives will change and they will somewhat question their actions.A Persian store owner and his daughter who have problem with a Mexican locksmith fixing locks.A housewife and her DA husband's continuing quarrels over having mistrust in people who are not white, working for them.Two black carjackers,one who completely despises white people and pervasively accuses white people for everything.A black TV director who is accused by his wife of being a wimp and a coward towards a cop sexually and racially harassing both of them.A police detective investigating a crime and having problems with his partner who also is his lover and his personal life.A rookie cop who is put along with an experienced officer working for 13 years,who also have trouble taking care of his father, to learn from,who harasses non-white people.These men and women will learn why they are so intolerant to each other and find redemption within one another.Upon my first viewing,I was left sorely disappointed.You see,I really show deep respect to films that tackle racial discrimination with sensitivity.With Paul Haggis writing and making his debut,that further got me interested.But it wasn't what I expected.It does delves into those issues,but somehow it feels an unfocused attempt.Yes,it doesn't approach its racial issues in a straightforward manner.It rather includes a murder mystery into the whole story,but that's where the problem begins.It can't decide which does it want to be.An urban,mystery crime drama or a race drama.And it gets all jumbled and convoluted.And its direct speeches from the characters makes it look cheap,as any young filmmaker can pull that cheap trick off.It somehow steps into the obvious.As it takes a non-conventional take to its subject,it slowly enters to that obviousness.I would expect something more unconventional from Haggis.Despite its honest attempt and sensitively handled subject,it somehow lacks something.Something effective is missing.It somehow doesn't know how to end the whole film.It can't make up its mind.It remains ambiguous.It sometimes appears too preachy and corny and weak.The stories are uneven.And sometimes there are way too many coincidences.But having said that,I still regard this among the most thoughtful and important films in the Cinema world.One that every person must see.Its uncomfortable and hard look on race relations makes it impossible for you to look away.You are forced to view what we have become from what we once were.Where man once was of the same color/race,of the same species,and living on one continent and land,before separating into various continents and various colors and races,has now become so different from their own kind that we start questioning ourselves.What is going on?What's wrong with us?Why do we hate each other so much?Why does color or our background makes such a difference.Why all this hatred?Misunderstanding each other due to our different languages,given us by the ones who created us in this confusing world,is another thing.But misunderstanding each other even when we are able to understand each other,because we are different is something else.Like all films that tackle with really thought provoking issues,this film also leaves us with no answer,but just forces us to look at our ever-changing world from a distance and see what's happening.It ends with a notion that if we try to tolerate one another,if we just try hard enough,there might be a possibility that we may coexist even if we remain treating each other the way we have been,there might just be some hope.This film is not entirely or not even remotely successful to what it was trying to convey.But it comes close to stimulate our receptors to send signals to our head to come to our senses.But giving this film the best picture award over BrokeBack Mountain,I think that was unjustified.The film boosts fantastic score,and a melodious and beautifully written original track,IN THE DEEP.Impressive cinematography.The films main strength is in its ensemble performances.Every actor gives full justice to his/her character.In particular,Thandie Newton and Terrance Howard.Matt Dillon is really convincing as an enraged,anger filled cop.His nomination was well deserving.But I was surprised how Thandie Newton didn't get her nomination,when she gave a really deep performance.Howard was already great in Hustle and Flow,but here he shows his versatility.Ludicrous is really amusing and really makes you laugh at his character whenever he starts accusing white people.And Michael Pena also really shines.The entire cast does a fantastic job.You simply can't look at a single performance to sum it up.It's an ensemble piece and the credit should go to each and every actor.The reflective emotional moments are really well executed.Paul Haggis' first feature is a superb debut.He handles everything really well.His script is a strong point.The flaws in the script are clearly visible but the performances hides them well.But Haggis' screenplay should be given credit for approaching the subject in a different way.A well done effort.So,Crash may be another undeserving Best Picture like Chicago.But it certainly needs to be watched.7.5__B+__***1/2",7,1,7,6 September 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," What you can't see , can kill you!
","This film is genuinely creepy and effective.Mostly due to its atmosphere.The cinematography serves as an effective technique to scare people.Here is one film that is disturbing and fun at the same time. The story is quite interesting and thankfully not ruined by its execution.It doesn't play like the usual horror slasher ,where a madman starts slashing teens throughout the film with endless amount of gore.This movie is more of a psychological horror thriller.An American family goes on a trip where they are stranded in the middle of a desert.It just so happens to be a place where governments once tested atomic bombs.Little do they realize that this atomic zone has hidden eyes watching all over them.Slowly the tension rises as the deadly mutants ,who are obviously hungry ,are angry with their visitor breaching their territory leading the whole family to a horrifying conclusion.Throughout the film,I was hooked,especially from it's opening sequence and I knew I was in for something special.It was an interesting setting and the execution was impressive.The film Directed by Alexandro Aja, recently directed french thriller HIGH TENSION, really understands the basis of the film and gives you a frightening experience.The movie may just be too gory and disturbing but it's intriguing shots and effective cinematography and atmosphere makes it a stand out horror remake.The mutants are scary as hell ,especially when they come out of no where.It's also scary to see a family entering into the predators zone ,it's their territory and there is no escape for the prey.Leading them to a terrifying and gory conclusion.The empty desert is breathlessly scary.It's a fantastic setting for a horror film.A group of people in the middle of desert with no signs of life whatsoever,not knowing what their surrounded by.The writing is decent and acting is by the numbers,better than most horror films or remakes.This could be considered as cult horror remake.I enjoyed this thriller.Still the film relies more on gore than psychology.It is unnecessarily too gory at times.Though still not as gory as the interesting but disgusting horror film HOSTEL. An intense experience for anyone,quite possibly disturbing for everyone.Horror fans have been waiting for something like this.",6,89,160,9 March 2006
American Psycho," Pure Disturbing/Shocking character study with a touch of dark humor.
","A pure disturbing character study.It is a fantastic,brilliantly executed film.I watched this film so many times that I sometimes feel like Bateman does.Towards the end,the film gets really confusing,and starts to make no sense.Bateman's scenes and his actions towards the end don't relate to the plot and force you to scratch your head.But You have to pay strict attention to Bateman's narration earlier in the film about him being totally lost and not knowing how to fit in.Not knowing who he is from the inside.He reveals a part of him and why he is so confused.He may just be another corporate asshole and sometimes provocative person but deep inside,there is this sinister being trying to come out.Trying to take over him.His inhumanity desperately want to come out.And he loses control of that and becomes an entity,not a being like everyone,but just a lost entity.He is not in particular,scary.Unlike Hannibal or Norman Bates,he is more of a lost soul trying search for meaning of his existence in a wrong sense of way.He is funny and at times really out of control.He is never presented as terrifying character but only a character anatomy.His jealously towards others who are better than him makes him bitter from the inside.He hates to see people having the same things as he does,and if they are better than him,he just wants to kill them.He hates being touched,as he thinks his body is pure and clean.He wants to fit in,and be on top.He loathes seeing people being better than him.Getting better business cards than him.He adores what Ed Gein does.If he were a person of another race ,which may be less respected,then his actions would make sense.But he is like everyone else and yet he thinks he is not like everyone.He still thinks he is under-appreciated.There is this silent evil whispering in his body ,waiting to be unleashed.His favorite dish is women.There is humor surrounding him and that makes it ever more entertaining and enjoyable to watch Bale perform this character.Bale gives a riveting performance.It's impossible to think of any other actor playing that character.He has it all to relate to that character,both mentally and physically.He is the character.He continues to impress and the critics continue to under appreciate him or overlook his performances for an Oscar.This and the performance in THE MACHINIST was his towering achievement and he still doesn't get recognized by the Academy.This man is a striking actor.His portrayal of Bateman is the best inhumane and sadistic performance since Norman Bates.He was just simply pitch perfect in the role.His physique and psychology blends so well with the character.Genius! Harron has perfectly assembled a character study that is both disturbing and mesmerizing.It's an eerie stroke of genius.The script is powerful and stays true to its source.A fascinating blend of demon within and attractiveness.She presents Bate exactly how he should be presented.His character's essence is purely captured.Pure beauty of this beast.She goes deep into his thoughts and meditates on what his view of the world is.She brings you to a disgusting world of an ordinary looking man,who isn't as ordinary as it seems.It's well worth praising for her effort.A stroke of genius.This dark horror thriller with a touch of humor really is perfect for your appetite.That is of course,if you're as sardonic as Bateman himself.Highly Recommended.",8,2,5,11 September 2006
She's the Man," Sister Acts.
","She's the Man is a fresh and entertaining chick flick following the same league as MEAN GIRLS.

Gandhi," The Man who Taught us the meaning of Life of Unity
","First I want to point out one thing,that is, Indians should be ashamed of themselves.I mean their very own people could not write or make a film as unforgettable and powerful as this one about a person who was more than a GOD to them.It took one very honest English filmmaker to produce an epic film about an Ordinary person just like us who went on to achieve some extraordinary and remarkable things.A man with no power whatsoever single handedly freed a nation,causing stir around the world.The world need to know the significance of people like Oskar Schindler and Gandhi,what their quests were,what they wanted to achieve.Survival in the darkest hours of inhumanity.The will to do something that will change the way we think about one another.Schindler and Gandhi did that and showed that a single human being can make a difference and therefore prove that every race can coexist if we want.And for their effort these two historical figures should receive a NOBEL prize.But do the world give a damn.I mean take India and Pakistan for example.Did Gandhis lesson and message taught these two nations?Of course not,they are at war all the time,hatred is present between them.No matter how hard he tried ,even in his last breath he only hoped for Unity,in the end it all came back to the same place.Inhumanity,discrimination,hatred,racism all these things occur every day in our lives and yet we learn nothing from our ancestors.Sorry for being pessimistic but I had to let it out.Gandhi is one person who didn't believe in race or the difference in us.He believed in Love that could spread and that could be shared by everyone together as one.He was a form of Jesus,no matter how much people hated him he always showed his love in return.Like Jesus he did not use violence but he taught people not to use it.Attenborough succeeds in capturing the mans true spirit and Kingsley was the only person who could've done it.Not even an actual Indian could have portrayed Gandhi the way Kingsley did.He simply was a reincarnation of Gandhi.A remarkable achievement that will live on forever and hope people will understand its message.But Gandhi wasn't the only one who led to the freedom.It is unfair that he was widely considered the person who led India to freedom,in reality a lot people had their share.In the film Gandhi always referred to various races but he rarely refers to sikhs.Sikhs were the real heroes actually.They fought for their freedom by all means possible.Some used non-violent methods and some of course used violence.I'm not saying that they did the right thing to use violence but they should not have been forgotten.They were never once mentioned in the film since one of the scenes take place in Amritsar(the Massacre).Freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh, Subash Chandra Bose, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Udham Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Rajguru, Sukhdev etc. were involved in great deal of work to achieve freedom.The film is inaccurate in its portrayal of the politics.Gandhi may have shown us that the means of achieving freedom without violence and taught us the meaning of equality ,which is what I'm interested in, but he still was a politician.He was the reason why the partition took place but it was his failing.He didn't wanted that and somehow the politicians drove him to their side and he became a corrupt politician too.Giving Indians false hope in the end about Unity and forgetting the real heroes of the Independence.Gandhi's fame was mainly due to the media and there was nothing he could do about it.The sikhs were forgotten for their effort and that is why there is still so much hatred among the people of India.Living in the same country they still have conflicts.They hate each others race.Nevertheless,Gandhi's ideal approach of equality was what fascinates me.He tried to bring every one together.He treated everyone equally and that is what makes him an Iconic figure.And Sir Attenborough really captures that well.Indians made dozens of movies about Gandhi and not one of them were as epic as this one.In fact they were terrible and they think their movies are great.They should shut their Industry instead.",8,5,12,23 December 2005
Hellboy," Comic Book Movies are still wonderful.
","I love comic book based movies.They are awesome and wonderful escapism.Mythology luring on the screen and beyond those stories is something left for us to think. One of my all time favourite comic book movies include Spider-Man 2,Batman Begins,X-men and many more.The only comic books I've ever read are Spider-Man,Phatom,Batman Begins, Justic League.I'm familiar with most of the comic book characters from watching the animated series.I loved to watch those Animated series featuring my favourite characters.X-men to Batman to Superman and Spider-Man and etc.They are highly creative and fascinating dramas,based on the Characters driven from a comic strip.ButI only started reading comic books after I watched this film.I never even heard this Character before,until I watched the film.I never thought this film deserved a review or to be commented when I first saw it but now watching it a few more times,I found it really something different.Right after this I started to get my self familiar with the roots of these Superheroes and the very place they originated.Comic books are more than just Hand Drawn entertainment,or storyboard if you can say that.They grow beyond our imagination and beyond those pages.Those characters have such a definite description of themselves that you can simply relate to their situations emotionally and otherwise.Spider-Man for example,in the sequel there are various issues that teenagers come across,and there no other way to deal with that than watching how Peter Parker,despite having all those heavy burdens and pressures and troubles decides in the end to continue his path as a superhero,because he never gave up.And I think that really relates to every teen out there,including me.X-Men movies/Comic books can definitely relate to those people who fear of being neglected because of their diversity and their different background and how the world hates them.Here in the movies and especially in the Comics they give you a definite thought that just because you're different doesn't mean you don't deserve equality and this really elevates these movies.And here comes Hellboy.A fascinating Fantasy Action Adventure that looks so unique and outstanding that it's hard to compare it with other films.This is one of the better Comic Book characters brought to screen,unlike the mediocre Punisher and Fantastic 4.The makeup,the Sets, the looks and Characters are perfect.There so much humour and style here that it makes everything so much fun to watch.Although the plot is disappointing.But the fantastic Script and Ron Perlman as Hellboy makes it up for it.There is enough sizzling action and wonderful Adventure there that keeps the viewers satisfied.ALthough I wouldn't say this is one of the best Comic Book Movies,it certainly is a welcome addition into that genre,and I definitely love the way the Title Character is presented.This has flaws and plot holes,but that never comes into its way from becoming the ultimate fun-house entertainment.It doesn't really stretches your imagination or anything but this is definitely worth a look and I really liked it.I would be honest to say that Superman is my least favourite characters. I like those superhero characters that really could exist in real life.For example Spider-Man,there could be possibility for it to be infected by a spider and become a superhero.Then there is Punisher and Batman,both have no superpowers whatsoever,but they fight crime in a way anyone who thinks he or she should serve justice.Hulk,X-men,Phantom,Fantastic 4 and such.I like Superhero characters that are real but not fantasy based. Superman is a rare possibility and so is Hellboy.And I believe many other characters like these.But nevertheless,they become part of our lives,we worship these characters.We love who they are and we wish to become just like them.This film is none of that,but it is something different and definitely wonderful to look at.",7,0,2,29 May 2006
The Illusionist," The Power of deception.
","What you see is what you believe.Or is it?The Illusionist tricks the audience both in the film and the moviegoers.It is left to the audience to believe whether all that was all a trick or real? It's a solid entertainer.Two hours worth your time in the dark.You'll be hypnotized,mesmerized and fascinated by the Illusionist himself,as you continue to decide whether it's supernatural powers or it is real.The film leads to many suspenseful moments and intense drama until it reveals everything right before the end credits,and you are satisfied.Because it doesn't cheat you.Eisenheim the Illusionist started practicing magic when he was young,and in that very young age he falls in love with a young girl Sophie.As they are forbidden to see each other they still somehow find ways to meet up until they are separated forever.Returning 15 years later as a renowned magician performing in public,Eisenheim faces challenge and rivalry from Chief Inspector Uhl who is loyal to the Crown Prince Leopald.But as Eisenheim learns that Sophie is marrying Crown prince,Eisenheim starts to confront the crown price.And Sophie has already fallen in love with Eisenheim.As they both try to get together,the Inspector and Leopald must separate,or else they shall receive dire consequences.The film shifts to into a murder mystery,and the mystery leads to a satisfying conclusion that will have you smiling that it never cheated you throughout and that it was all in front of your eyes but you believed what you saw.The Illusionist may have a simple story about forbidden love and all but its execution makes it a more intriguing work.There is mystery,romance,politics,intrigue,drama,thrills,suspense,twists and turn all in one film.While suffering in many areas,the Illusionist still comes out as a winner with its splendid performances given by the actors and its deft direction.The film boosts a gripping and absorbing feel and atmosphere.The productions designing is well done and evokes the 1900s.The cinematography is rich and a brilliant score aids along.Slick editing aiding its magic tricks.And visuals that deceive your eyes.And a few tricks of magic really have you at awe.The film's magical tone will have you glued to your seat.Its magic tricks are really well executed and it really feels like you are watching a magic show with your host hypnotizing you ,making you believe what he wants you to believe.Its deceiving moves are really what makes the film an illusion.Director Burger has written a good script.One that relies on character development and one that has a brilliant plot.The story is simple but its development is terrific.He keeps his film from falling as there were many areas where it could've collapsed and you could've walked away from the film.As the film takes the mystery turn,it kind of drags a bit and becomes clueless.We don't understand what is going on.But as everything comes to focus and we slowly start seeing the big picture,we get our moneys worth.The director has a great vision and he is the ultimate illusionist.The film lacks strong emotional impact.You don't feel much for Eisenheim or Sophie,but you do care to see them together.Halfway through,the whole thing kind of got slightly predictable and obvious.I somehow realized the twist early on,lucky guess.And the film's pace is uneven and it looks old-fashioned at times.And some of the magic tricks are left unexplained.Edward Nortan is a versatile actor,and the films he has done in the past few years are amazing.He is terrific both as good and evil.And he is terrific in any role you give him.Here,he is at his absorbing best.You are hooked into the man that you don't know what his motives or plans are.He tries to make his character as mysterious as possible,and Norton looks dashing as an Illusionist,and he is very convincing with his accent even when he slips in that.Rufus Swell is an underrated actor,and though he has a larger role,he is given less credit than Jessica Biel.His character's jealousy is well portrayed.He makes his character's anger feel real and you wonder what he might do next to our lovers.Jessica Biel is a real surprise here.Not only does she handles her accent with decency,but she can act.Her small presence was felt as a beautiful and charming Dutches.Though,there is little romantic chemistry between her and Norton,and her character isn't well written,she still manages to leave her mark.The real star of the film ,however,is the multi-talented Paul Giamatti.His portrayal of an officer who is bound to obey the Crown Prince is excellent.His intense confrontation with Eisenheim is superbly executed.He brilliantly captures the confusion and guilt of the character.He has no clue how to arrest Eisenheim with no evidence and yet he wants to help Eisenheim.Like the audience he begins to question his power of perception.Like the audience he is unsure whether Eisenheim really have supernatural powers.And we as an audience are as surprised as he is when the big reveal is shown.His accent is well done and he plays the character with juice.A mesmerizing work.The Illusionist is one of those Hollywood films that makes Hollywood the best in the world.It has those Hollywood ingredients and feels like a big budget film,at its core its more independent and original.It's pretty much like an illusion.It's a perfect entertainer and you will likely be captured by the Illusionist himself.Good writing,brilliant directing.Strong acting and rich look makes this the years most worthwhile film.And if you ask me,I would say this is slightly better than The Prestige another film about magicians of that same era.As that film relies on tricking the audience than developing a good story.In a way,the Prestige is more complicated for no reason and has powerful twists and turns that you never see coming.Whereas,The Illusionist may seem simple,it pulls a trick or two to be able to compete with The Prestige.But on the whole,The Prestige somehow cheats the audience by playing with them,while this film grabs the audience's attention throughout and giving them satisfaction.I really liked this really good film that was really close to being great.Highly recommended.",8,1,2,2 November 2006
Blood Diamond," A message film trying to reach a wider audience through the conventional Hollywood formula.
","It's rare to find films like these in Hollywood nowadays.But they are still plagued by the Hollywood formula.So is the case with Blood diamond.A thoughtful and stunning action drama with a message to send out that gets bogged down by the Hollywood fatigue.Blood Diamond could've been a great film,but that was never gonna happen.The film for the most part was solid.It kicks off well and holds on until its second half becomes your typical Hollywood drama with a Hollywood ending.But nevertheless,it gets its message across in a really effective way.And that's only because of director Edward Zwicks sincere effort.Probably his best film since the LAST SAMURAI.He carefully balances the film's message and action and big budget adventure and still capture the shocking accounts of brute in Sierra Leone.Where kids are given guns to roam free and kill whoever they wish to,where laws are broken and country is torn apart by civil war.Danny Archer(Di Caprio) is a diamond smuggler who owes his boss and gets around to places quickly.He doesn't have a permanent home or location and he's really hard to trust or predict.But as he gets arrested for illegal smuggling he comes across another prisoner who is arrested for the wrong cause.Solomon Vandy (Djimon Honsou) is caught by the rebels while trying to help his family escape.He is forced to dig diamonds from the ground until Vandy finds the blood diamond,which he hides and keeps safe.As he is captured by the government he is pursued by Archer,who will help him find his family and get back his son from the rebels; only if he gets him his blood diamond.Along the way Archer meets an optimistic journalists (Jennifer Connelly) who is more interested in getting the information of how illegal diamond smuggling works than getting her share of the price.And only Archer can give her that information.The three embark on a deadly adventure through the torn Sierra Leone,where gunfire and killings are a routine and can come out of anywhere.But there are secrets Archer is hiding and he is desperate to have that diamond in his possession before others capture them.Sounds like your typical,old-fashioned action-adventure.But think again,this ones got a message and it's executed with unconventional sense until we reach its final third half.It's done with excitement and enough action to lure the average moviegoer into the theatres.Because that's the only way to get the message and horrifying events to its audiences to realize what their diamonds cost.But it also feels clichéd and old-fashioned in parts.The screenplay should've been way better and there was potential in it.But the writer opts for the usual Hollywood flairs.That is not to say that the script doesn't have strengths.It does have some really well written parts with strong lead characters.And it tells a very honest story.But it could've worked a little more.It's the Director that keeps everything afloat and Zwick is best at these kinds of films.He is not afraid to show us what Sierra Leone was really like a few years back.How it tore itself apart due to the civil war.And how the world didn't gave a damn about it even if they said they do.The world is just there for the benefit.The governments promise help and they just never provide any.Either they are limited or they don't get what they want.It's the political side of it that destroys and promotes the kinds of things that went on in Sierra Leone and that is true even now in other parts of the world,like IRAQ.What would an average moviegoer say about films like these?He'll think about it a lot and try to think of a way to help,but the next day he'll forget about it and pretend he never even saw anything like this.And that's what has been happening.We make films like these to open everyone's eyes and once they've had their eyes wide open they close them and move about their business.So,what's the point of making these kinds of films.The main strength of this film is that it is a message movie packed into a commercial film.So that it could reach a wider audience.And for that it's recommended.Another reason is the characters and the events they go through,which are executed skillfully by a veteran like Ed Zwick.Di Caprio has been making some really great films the past few years.Post-Beach,he's been making some really memorable and striking pictures and working with the best in Hollywood.And each time his performances get better and better.As Danny Archer,Di Caprio infests unpredictability in an otherwise predictable anti-hero.He makes us hard to predict Danny's moves.You are not sure whether you should trust him or not,even till the final few moments of his time in the film.But he makes Danny more human and sympathetic.And he nails it once again with his biting performance.It's unlike any character he's ever played and he's a totally different kind of Di Caprio here.But,I still loved his portrayal of Howard Hughes more than this.And every time he is beaten by a greater performance at the year end awards.Ironically,they were African-Americans,who beat him twice.And they both deserved it.Maybe,next time Di Caprio might finally win.And Djimon Honsou's fierce performance as a father in search of his son is so believable that you know he will do anything to get back his family.Jennifer Connelly doesn't have much to do.Well,her character won't allow her to ,except making the usual speeches and bashing.But Connelly looks stunning.The film is packed with brilliant editing,exceptionally well staged,exciting action set pieces and good cinematography,with able score.It's a well made film only hampered by its weak screenplay.It's filled with a stunning production values and entertains fully.But it certainly could've been a great film and it had the potentials to be.It's only strong performances and able direction that propels and prevents this film from becoming your usual Hollywood action-adventure.It is worth checking out and will seriously hit you with its message about the cost of those bloody diamonds.",7,6,9,15 March 2007
Inside Man," One of the most entertaining films I've seen in a while.....one that doesn't fool around and cheat us.
","Upon its release I was skeptical about it.The film had the same old story about a smart guy robbing a bank with dumb people.But it was something really fresh and new after watching it on DVD and I regret not watching it in the cinema.And tell you the truth ,it was really the most fun I've had watching a film which doesn't play around,dragging you all the way and finally gives you an ending that makes a fool out of you and cheats you.This one has it all.Smart,clever plot.Well written dialogues,superb direction,juicy acting, and a rather thoughtful view on the society that doesn't appreciate diversity.A Bank robber,who is very specific in his actions,plans the perfect bank robbery.He isn't in it for money or anything,he's in it for something else.So,he executes his plan flawlessly ,deceiving everyone.An African-American detective is put on the case and both of them begin this very ingenious cat-and-mouse game.Along the way,there are many people who want the Detective off the case and approach the robbers in a rather conventional way.But as it gets longer and longer,it becomes difficult to tell what exactly is it that the Robbers want.And then you finally get to know with an excellent climax.There are surprises here,and they are not the ones you can easily point out.Although,I did guessed some of the surprises right.But still these twists are not the ones that defies logic and make you look stupid.These surprises keeps you involved and you really have fun solving the puzzles,rather than just sitting there and waiting for the writers prove that they're smarter than the audience,which they are not.The film deals with some really important issues.Race,politics,and moral status etc.And it deals with them well,without being offensive.It's also quite funny.In between the robbery,we flash forward to see the detective interrogating the hostages,to extract some information about the robbers.Since everyone were forced to dress the same,and the precautions taken by the robbers.It becomes quite difficult for the Detectives to solve this big mess.And it's really fun to see them come up ways to solve the case.The writing is impressive.It's smartly designed and brilliantly plotted.It has a lot of fun moments and exciting plot turns.Lee is back.He hasn't been this good since,I don't know when.His direction is one that defines a man who knows what he's doing.He handles everything with awe.He makes this more entertaining than smart,and apt.He is thinking out of the conventional box.Performanes?Well,with a cast like this ,I don't even have to tell you how superficial they were.Washington and Owen are just amazing to watch.And Foster gives enough juiciness to keep you off the heist,for a while, and focus on the characters.A very good film,a fine film in its own standards.But for me,it was really the most fun film I've seen in quite a while.But I can't call it the best heist film,it sure is up there with the best.",8,1,2,3 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Not bad,could've been a great film.However, you can't help but feel really disappointed.
","Da Vinci Code is one of those novels that I kept reading over and over again and yet be bewildered by its twists,turns and surprises.It was a book that had my jaw dropped wide open until I had finished the whole book and solved all the mysteries and yet kept me hooked into it.It was an addictive book with facts that may or may not be true.But it had everyone under its spell.It's one of the smartest and most brilliantly written books,where the fun never stops.A book where you will not be able to stop turning the pages.The twists,the surprises to the end of the book will hold your breath.That was the magic of the book and it was the finest I've read in a long time.No doubt a movie was to be made.But could that film live up to its source?That is rarely a possibility,especially when the film is booked as Hollywood Blockbuster.The film is neither good or bad.It isn't a terrible film,it's just too bland and straightforward that you are able to predict everything that goes on.Even the minor alterations become obvious.I had massive expectations ,like everyone.With a skilled director,with a great cast and a producer who has produced good movies.It was bound to be great.Except,the writer was Akiva Goldsman.That's where I went all skeptical about the film.If you check his resume,it will shock you that why did the producers hired him.But then again,he did Beautiful Mind.A great pedigree on its shoulders,it should've been great.But no,the film's execution is so uneven and so messy that you are unable to find any good points about the film.We all the know the story too well.But at least the makers could've changed it a bit rather than making a way too faithful book to screen presentation.Everything,sadly,becomes too predictable,leaving no surprises.The book had an excellent setting,and an exciting pace that kept your hands turning the pages.The film has none of the excitement and an uneven pace that will either bore you with its dull conversations or will want you to yell out loud.I mean ,even the book's conversations felt so entertaining,whereas the film's felt so banal.There scene that were really lame and poorly executed.Something I didn't expect from Howard.And of course,lifting almost 80% of its source.When it comes to chases and action,it's fine.But when it comes to the revelations and explanations,it becomes cheesy and lame and you laugh at its execution.In the book,the the factoids explanations was what hooked you in and made the book such a classic,but in the film the facts and explanations seem really boring and lame,poorly done except for its flashback sequences,which were impressive.The only saving grace here are some standout performances and accurate casting.Sir Ian Mckellen couldn't have been better cast in a role that I pictured him playing when I read the book.His perfect portrayal of Leigh Teabing is what makes this film worthwhile, for a while.Although,after the big reveal he is just another actor disposed.Another actor who took me by surprise was Paul Bettany as Silas.I never thought of him playing a role like this,but he just proved his talent.He manages to evoke the emotions of his character and his chilling performance really makes Silas come alive.Hanks is a terrible miscast.Perhaps his worst role yet. His portrayal of Langdon is dull and expressionless.His wooden acting really disappoints me,as I had expected more.When it was announced that he would be Langdon,I was excited.But I guess it didn't matter now.While reading the book,the only actress that struck my mind who would be perfect for Sophie Neveau was lovely Audrey Tautou.The character's description matches with her and she was well cast.Except,she couldn't pull it off.She looks totally silly with her weak accent.The makers made a joke out of the character.Most of the times,when she delivers a classic line from the book,I'd be having chuckles.She was a let down to a great character.Alfred Molino is fine.But he's underused.And Jean Reno plays his routine cop character,which I've seen many times before.I had no one else in mind who would play him but he just lets down.And as the smartest character of the book is turned into the stupidest character in the book,Jacque Sauniere.There was more depth in the character in the novel than it is in the film.Director Ron Howard pulls a few surprising elements and handles a number of scenes with his skills but overall he lets down big time as he couldn't hold the film well.His visual taste is fine but doesn't apply to the film.Forget about the writer,he's just made a terrible adaptation.The film has a stunning look to it.It's visually entertaining.Even if under uses its masterful setting it still manages to capture the essence of the book.The score is fine while the editing could've been better.The flashbacks or the re-tellings of the past events were the key highlights of this film.That's what succeeds in the film.Once again,the book-better-than-the-film claim could be easily applied here.What could have been a great translation,is turned into a bloated and disappointing film.It succeeds in only few parts.But regardless of all that,there is a lot to enjoy in this brainless adaptation.It is ridiculously entertaining.It has a gripping atmosphere that will keep you interested as long as it can.It's certainly loads of fun. But don't expect a classic.Another could've been better film.",6,1,2,6 November 2006
The Fountain," I am left with no words to describe this film ; an out of this world experience.
","I'm left speechless,wordless and comment-less.I cannot think of a unique word to give or label this film with.It's one of those experiences that will leave your mind bewildered.It's not the kind of feeling or effect that you get when you're watching a Terrence Malick film,where his images and speechless moments leave you with no words to describe the films.This is different from that,this is like transporting you into a world where images will speak to you and have heavy affect on you.I don't know what happened to me once I left the theatre,but I know this much that I was propelled into a world where nothing is impossible and Love always defies all and you shall embrace death and life.You are reborn or reincarnated and you begin your journey again.It's a process that will continue as long as it has to and that's how it all works.Its 2001:A Space Odyssey philosophy made me seriously want to compare this with my all-time favorite film.The philosophy is incendiary and matches inter wines with my philosophies of life,death,existence,nature,reincarnation and love.Spanning over three centuries,one man's quest,destiny,love lies in one tree.A tree that makes one immortal.His quest begins in the 16th century all the way to the 26th century.And in the present time,a young man's wife is dying and he is struggling to extract a medicine out of a tree.His wife meanwhile begins a novel,called The Fountain.This is a love saga and a love that defies all impossibilities.It's a film with monolithic beauty with most of the credit going to its paradoxical visuals.It's his piece de resistance.From his prominent first big film to this fascinating,spellbinding fantasy,Aronofsky has really proved himself to be the best in just three films.One of the best directors on the planet today.His script and plot may be flawed and feels incomplete and rushed,but it is not without awe and mind bending genius.Its visuals transported me into a world where love conquers all and is above everything.No,it's not emotionally powerful,but its two leads make you feel everything that their characters feel and the power of love,life,death and existence of humanity and its feelings.Its picturesque atmosphere and unbelievable visuals,makes this his quintessential masterwork with limited budget.Unbelievable,jaw-dropping Cinematography,otherworldly visuals and slick editing along with gorgeous music really holds you well.And another flaw in this epic is that,it's not epic enough.It's too short to tackle or discuss the meaning and give you the answers to death and life.It only deals with the thoughts and notions of nature,our existence,and reincarnation.But it's simply a scintillating experience all the way.I want to say so much more about the film,but I see no word that is worthy to describe it.It will only insult its grace.Only images can make you feel what I felt through this film.Truly the best and most confusing sci-fi film since 2001,an ending that will have you scratching your head.But to hell with all that,watch this visual bedazzlement.Giving this film an award or something would be insignificant.It's the experience that you need to feel.It's a one of a kind Love saga.Just go watch it ,and don't ask me anything about this film.I can't describe you the feeling I felt,only you can understand what I felt after watching it.A reverberating cerebral experience",10,2,4,28 October 2006
The Departed," Dark and brutal.Scorsese's most accomplished and entertaining film to date.
","One could look at The Departed and can get the idea that this is less a remake than it is a re-imagining of the riveting crime Drama INTERNAL AFFAIRS.It's more of an inspiration than it is a direct lift off.The story may be the same,but there's a vast difference between Scorsese's epic and the Hong Kong Classic.And for that,this film is truly a fascinating look at the ugly worlds of the two sides of the law.Rookie Cop Billy Costigan goes undercover and is assigned to work for Crime Boss Frank Costello and get really close to him to deliver some information about his crimes.Costigan gains Costello's trust and gets involved a lot deeper in his crimes.On the other hand ,a rising police office is actually a mole in the department, informs everything about the Police Department's movements to Costello.But things get deadly when both men are about to have their secrets exposed and the Mobs and the cops discover that there is a mole/informer,and a traitor who's getting things messed up on both sides.And then they both try to save themselves from each other and the Mobs.They slowly get confused with their dual identities and things get deadlier for the both of them as their delicate balance with the Mobs and the Cops gets them too involved with the world they're into.While both men are in love with the same women,one of them has to suffer the consequences.Leading to a shocking conclusion to this epic.There are intense scenes of violence and action and twists that you never see coming.A Martin Scorsese film is always dark,graphically violent,raw,hard edged,and filled with memorable powerhouse performances.And this film is no exception.The Departed is something new and different .Its complex plot unfolds to an even more powerful story ,with characters colliding with one another and facing terrifying situations.Scorsese shows that what it is like to be a cop.Your life is in danger 24/7 ,and that every minute is a risk when you're undercover.Your only fear is having your true identity be exposed.And then,it's all up to the person who's holding a gun to your face.It's a tough film he carved out,and to be honest it's a perfect example of how a remake should be made.It's actually as good as the original,even better at times.And shows that when it is helled by a legendary director who knows what he is doing the results are always great for a remake.To compare the original and this one,I would say this one is slightly better than the original.Otherwise,it's just as brilliant as the Hong Kong version.But the thing about this film is that even if you've seen the Hong Kong version,you'll still be blown away by the Hollywood version.However,comparisons are inevitable.What else can you ask for when you have a cast this big?I could only recall one such film that had such a huge cast at the moment,and that was Ocean's 11.Where that film didn't do full justice with its cast,this film makes use of its actors and gives you a rare piece of entertainment that is thought-provoking and ingenious.Scorsese really have given a great piece of work.I wouldn't say this is his best work ever,his best directed film was GANGS OF NEW YORK ,which he should've won an Osacar for,but it certainly is one his best work since Goodfellas in the crime genre.It's got the usual trademarks of the director.The script is fantastic.The writer has done a terrific job in this remake.It makes the film a standout from the original.Rich CinematographyThe cinematography is rich,and the editing is sharp. The Score is superb,Scorsese's choice of music is great.And the look of the film and its sets are brilliant,getting us old and new Boston.And lots of cell phone use.Well,you're wondering who's the show stealer out of a giant cast like this.Everyone got to do something with full satisfaction.But the real standout here is Di Caprio and Damon.The actors have only gotten better and better recently and here they pull it off again.They are complex and tough characters to play and they play their part brilliantly.Di Caprio's emotional stature is strong.He manages to bring the character's fear and confusion with full conviction.You do feel sad in the end for what happens to him.You will be shocked and it was unfair for the character.Damon on the other hand is superb as the mole who informs the crime bosses.Their face off and rivalries are intense and suspenseful.And of course,Jack Nicholson couldn't have had more fun doing a film like this than doing another sad comedy.His and Scorsese's collaboration is another reason,altogether a different reason, to watch this film.At this age,he could still pull off juicy performances,and do all that he's done on screen really makes you wonder if he's ever gonna do another film with Scorsese again.And his over the top performance is really fun to watch.Wahlberg is great in his role as the tough cop who talks tough to his co-officers.Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are both terrific.Vera Farimiga was a real surprise as a women who falls in love with both leading men.She plays her part really well and you kind of feel sad that why didn't she chose the character that deserved her. Of course, this film is not without its flaws,and I expected it to end with a bang,whereas the writer seemed to have abandoned the script's energy and just concluded it somewhat like the original film.It was an uneven conclusion.And I just wasn't sure why was it necessary to do what the writer did to the main characters in the end.But regardless of that the rest of the film is a tour de force raw drama.A modern classic and a definite must-see of the year.This film can count on its chances of being at the Oscars next year.A sure fire success.The Departed is the most exciting,fun and thrilling dark crime Drama of the year.And it's fully satisfying and very entertaining.Highly Recommended.",8,14,29,2 October 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Wow,that performance!!!!
","That performance makes Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles look average compared to this harrowing portrayal of Idi Amin.It proves that an actor alone can carry a film on his shoulders.The film has numerous problems.Had it not been Whitaker's towering performance,this film would've ended like any other Biopic.The film is about a Scottish doctor,who heads to Uganda to help the civilians,but stumbles upon the Mendacious Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.With him,he witnesses Amin's Barbaric,disturbing methods and tortures and he decides to do something about it. The film is Whitaker's as you'll hear from many critics or reviewers.It is a performance that should land him his first Oscar,or at least a nomination.This ,along with Hellen Mirren's portrayal of another real life figure,surely gonna raise brows,and garner them their awards in the next year's Oscars.Without doubt,the first great performance of this year is already to be witnessed.This film is as strong as Capote.Where that film was lifted by the power of Hoffman,here it's lifted by Whitaker alone.His dark,seriously disturbing portrayal of Amin is just one thing that will stay with you as long as you go to cinema.You will always think of this performance,regardless if it's victorious at the Oscars or not.It will stay with you with the rest of your lives.It haunts you,and miraculously Whitaker brings it out.It's one heck of an eerie performance that Whitaker gives.His portrayal of a real life figure is amongst the best of all time.He is really Charming,Magnetic,Murdorous as the film suggests his character.I did a little research on Idi Amin,because,honestly I didn't know who he was.And after I did.I had to hand to Whitaker who've just achieved the impossible.It seems that actors portraying real life figures tend to show more talent than playing a fictional character.And as for the film.It's a good film overall.A really well directed and written film,and may have a chance at the Oscars.Actually,with Whitaker on mind,you really don't get your mind off from Whitaker's performance to judge the film.It's Whitaker that makes the film great.When he's on screen,it's like a horror show.To see his character do what Amin did.Then the film shifts focus on other character's,giving you a relief.Which is effective.It sometimes look like it's following the same path as Training Day.Apart from Whitaker, Scottish actor,James McAvoy does an adequate job to meet his superior.So does Washington,who keeps impressing film after film.And Andersen is just fine.The film is shot at some breathtaking locales of Uganda,and it really shows the beauty of the land against the evil-doings of Amin.The film has a myriad of problems.With its twists and turns mainly.The sub-plots become irrelevant,and the use of violence and sex becomes excessive at times.Yes,the film is as gripping as a thriller.But since,it's told from a Scottish Doctor's point of view,it makes it rather unconvincing.This should've been a great film on its own,but it's made great only because of Whitaker. Just go and watch this film.It's a good film and a greater film with Whitaker.I think we have our first official contender in the Male Category of Best performance of the year.",8,4,8,27 September 2006
The Good Shepherd," The most intriguing and absorbing of all Espionage/CIA thrillers.
","A highly intriguing,very absorbing and ambitious epic that is carefully executed with dead pan seriousness.It's one of those fascinating failures that should be put aside and analyzed separately,in the likes of Life Aquatic,I heart Huckabees etc.It's one of those unique films that aren't entirely successful but leave a heavy impact.And De Niro's epic is one such film.It's so interesting that it keeps you hooked in the situations,in its characters but ultimately,you lose interest and will find it hard to digest as it comes close to three hours of running time and feels too long.But it nevertheless deserves a lot of praise.A film that took a long time to come to the screen and when it comes,you realize how much work is put into this anatomy of the birth of CIA.And Eric Roth's complex script aided by De Niro's impressive direction makes this one of the most intriguing of all Spy/Espionage/CIA films.Edward Wilson believes in his job more than anything in the world.He would put his life to risk to serve his nation.But the more deeper he goes into what he does,the more wreaked he becomes.His job requires him to isolate virtually from everyone,including his family.Spending a lot of time away from home just to get the job done.His life becomes a puzzle and a living hell as he's surrounded by people he doesn't know whether to trust or not.He is committed and all but he is left as an inhumane being.A being who is devoid of emotions and has forgotten who he was and what he has become.As the cold war and the rise of CIA plagues him,he is filled with paranoia and fear as he begins to lose touch with reality and is afraid to make contact with anyone.He becomes a ghost.Matt Damon's performance is mesmerizing.It's a very sophisticated character to play and he gets into the character and expresses everything the character goes through.Never once he makes you feel like he's himself. He becomes the character, he becomes a man who seems to be a reflection of a ghost.Increasingly isolating himself from his family just to get the job done, makes him all the more gripping.He does a terrific job,which is evident.It is his best performance to date, believe it or not. He has your attention throughout the long running time and never once letting you get fed up of his character. His expressions and his movement all makes you feel sad for this character.De Niro,who also has an important role in the film,comes off with an impressive work. He presents a fascinating character study and anatomy of CIA workings, for-adults only picture that should go down as the most intriguing films about Espionage to come to screen.And as a director he gets full points for setting up mesmerizing shots with his DOP and showing us a very ambitious epic that might be flawed, but is something really to look out for. For me, it was the best Spy film since the Bourne movies.But the film lacks a strong emotional value.Whether it's deliberate or not,it's up to the viewer.But I felt it did show the human side of Edward Wilson. And the relationship between him and his wife was brilliantly presented.Their quarrels and troubled relationship and all are was well executed. But Jolie wasn't all that impressive.Apart from them,the rest of the big cast was brilliant.The production boosts high quality and is filled with intricate and stunning moments.The cinematography is flawless but the editing was weak.The film needed to be trimmed for at least 20-25 minutes.It often feels like he's presented us his Director's cut.But I think it was very necessary. De Niro took his time to show the details and rise of the CIA, and I fully praise him for that.The length might feel long but it was required.At your own risk,watch the film if you want.But don't expect lots of action like those Bourne films delivered or explosions Spy Game delivered.It's a thoughtful,deeply psychological drama.It's a thriller.It's one of the best films of the year,and it certainly is worth checking out for its ambitious presentation.And it's way better than the somewhat disappointing GOOD German.If you could bear its running time,you might find yourselves absorbed into it.B+ 4/5",8,3,6,23 December 2006
Munich," Terrifying, chilling but stunningly powerful Thriller.
","After delivering two disappointing flicks(Terminal/War of the worlds),Spielberg is finally back in his usual form.He is best at dramatic and intensely realistic films.And Munich is just the film that shows why he is the best in the industry.A morality tale about vengeance and its consequences.How one's beliefs destroy another's faith.A powerful shocking drama that leaves a chilling effect on you.It begins off with an intense situation of hostage takeover,and really gives a feeling what it is like to be taken as a hostage.I was on the edge of my seat ,it shocked me and left me disturbed of how these athletes were put into a horrifying situation and the blood bath that follows.It's the story of how a group of men struggle to seek their revenge against a group of terrorists who murdered 11 athletes in the early 70's during the period of Olympic games in Germany.They are assigned a mission to hunt down those who were responsible and take them out one by one.But as they begin this perilous mission of vengeance,they no longer become different from their enemies and they themselves are transformed into something close to a terrorist;as all of them lose their soul and the very thing that makes them humane.Their beliefs are challenged.They question themselves for what they're doing.Why are they doing and for what?Are they even doing it for the right reason.As they approach each target ,their worlds are shattered and haunted by the bloody killings that they make.And slowly leading them into horrific consequences.The characters are all intense.They are men put into situations they rather not be.Every target they approach leaves a shiver to them,and a chilling effect on the audiences.Every target of theirs end up in a blood splattered scene.They slowly realize that what they're doing simply causes more chaos and destruction.But it becomes too late for these men to give up as they are being haunted by all the killings.They fear the world and somehow they're being targeted.And they no longer have their souls.This is a powerful suspense thriller that takes us a trip throughout Europe,with beautiful locations as a setting.The film is filled with stark realism to every scene.The cinematography really gives the film a docudrama look.A very violently intense thriller that will leave you with fear ,shock,dilemma and perhaps leave you feeling some sympathy for those men who are committed to something they don't really understand.The film poses very provocative questions with controversial remarks.Can there ever be peace?Spielberg has always been a master when it comes to dark ,unsettling subjects.His approach to serious films is different from those commercial ones.When he arrives at a certain concept he really brings the best out of it.I never admired Spielberg as an artistic filmmaker.To me ,he was more of a moneymaker.But here ,he diminishes his trademarks and gets involved with a very striking subject that surely leads to controversy.I've never seen a Spielberg film this dark or graphically violent.Not even Schindler's List or Minority report were this dark.I would simply regard this film as his most accomplished and meaningful film since Schindler's List.His most haunting and powerful film yet.Although there is a certain lack of emotion.There is not enough emotional drama than there is dramatic or violent moments.Spielberg seemed to focused more on the act of violence than how these men felt.I mean we don't see them speaking about anything but violence.How each target would be executed.But you could see that they were terrified at all times.Fear was all around them.The very first target they assassinated ,they weren't sure and were nervous about it,they almost bailed.And by the end one after another was being hunted.Avner started to get paranoid,started having nightmares,dilemma's.He was haunted by those deaths he saw and he felt guilty.He doesn't know the right meaning to his actions.Spielberg somehow takes us deep into the minds of terrorists.For once we see how they plan their attacks and bombings,and that gives a cold feeling.Shivers run down your body.The actors work well together,and only Eric Bana gives a soulful performance.Only his character was broaden.While the rest were perfect in their roles.Superb camera work ,giving an utterly realistic looks, Stunning in every way.The script was tightly written but the films length could've been shortened.It was simply too long.There was an excellent score to heighten the tension and emotion.After watching this film,I would never in my wildest imaginations ,dream of becoming a spy or an assassin working for a government or whatever.I always thought it was cool and really fun.But watching this film,I realized that every second of your life is inflicted with fear.You have no control of your mind and you live in fear 24/7.Terror is what all you feel.This film is an unforgettable,shocking ,unsettling and haunting film.A very flawed masterwork from a man who is widely respected.A very risky move made by Spielberg which has done anything but disappointed.A powerful achievement and he deserves to be

Happy Feet," A delightful,happy-go-lucky Animated feature that is wonderful to watch with a message attached with it.Amongst the best Animated films ever.
","Happy Feet is a delightful,happy-go-lucky film that leaves you feeling happy and wanting to tap dance.It's a well conceived animated film with an ecological,environmental message for kids.Yes,it has themes that may not be suitable for kids,but it's also there for the mature audience to enjoy and think about it.It's a thinking person's animated film.As you know,it's about Penguins,and their empire.Mumble,a young penguin who can't sing has developed a very odd skill among his beings,who have a heart for singing.He tap dances,and he's a genius at that.But the Penguin community survive on their singing.As everyone else like him can do it and master it,Mumble feels isolated.He decides to leave and explore the world.He stumbles upon some new penguins who find him really cool.They get along well and all.Then Mumble meets Lovelace ,who has encountered the so called 'Aliens'(that is ,the humans),and Mumble wants to find out who has been stealing their fishes,which has made it hard to survive for the Penguins.He embarks on a journey to face the Aliens and request for fishes.But as he enters the world of humans,it becomes clear that destruction has already gone underway.Humans are taking away all the fishes and destroying the Antartic by polluting the seas and all that.Mumble's world is plagued by these events and he tries to confront them in the end and prove himself worth to his kind.The story takes many turns and sets it different from other animated features.It's unique in its animation and execution.George Miller tries to present a realistic film than the usually cartoonish animated flicks.He sets serious topics in the plot and allows both the young and mature audience think and start a debate about our actions and all.It's a smart move.But on the way,he kind of looses his message and mixes things up,it also becomes a mess.But Miller keeps thing afloat with the cute little penguins and the gleeful environment he creates.Adding musical numbers and dances to keep the kids entertained and love the film,while the grown up enjoy it along with thinking about what the film is trying to say.It sets new grounds,and for that,this film and its creators deserve all the praise and the award it got.But beware,some elements of the film may prompt your kid to question in the wrong way.The sexual references and some frightening scenes involving very cute,loving penguins may disturb the parents.But,I guess it was necessary.The CGI was breathtaking.The visuals and look of the film was flawless.It just keeps you bewildered for its technical genius.It's a pitch perfect animated feature.It ranks amongst the best Animated features ever made,topping Toy Story,Shrek and what not,except Incredibles.For me Incredibles and this film remain the favorite.But,you should watch this film for its different approach and clever execution.It's adorable and also somewhat thought provoking.And it leaves you with a smile.So,I would say it's classic animation.A technical and animated breakthrough,in a groundbreaking sense.",8,2,3,21 March 2007
V for Vendetta," Riveting and Exciting.
","This marks the fantastic return of the Wachowski brothers.Those who were disappointed with their last two efforts will not be disappointed here,there is no doubt that the Brothers are talented.Here they make their comeback.But not as filmmakers,but as producers and writers.And to be honest ,this film thrills you from beginning to end.You'll be blown away with this adrenaline excitement and dramatically intense thriller.A finely complex storyline about V, a reluctant freedom fighter , a rebellion who fights for freedom against the government in London in another time line.Set against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain,a mild-mannered young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by'V.' Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of combat and deception, V urges his fellow citizens to rise up against tyranny and oppression. As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.This film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insane,but it's just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives. Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.V is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you.",8,456,656,9 March 2006
