The Expendables 2," A craftsmen's disaster (awful score, rigging, camera, editing, story)
","Expendables 2 tries to step into the big shoes of Expendables 1 but fails disappointingly.Throughout the movie the viewer gets the impression of watching a Greek tragedy, but not an action movie.~~ Musical Score ~~The musical score confines to strings playing slow arrangements. At a few, random(!) occasions, playing staccato lines, but still it's not 'Action' music.This musical score lacks brass, snare drum, timpani. It's lacking hard, military, score parts.I remember better musical scores, like Predator, Rambo: First Blood Part II, The Wild Geese, Mission Impossible TV show.Where's Alan Silvestry? Lalo Schifrin? Composers like (unfortunately deceased) Jerry Goldsmith or Maurice Jarre? Don't they belong to a movie like the Expandables like any of the actors?~~ Sound Effects ~~The only sound effects to appreciate have been the heroes' guns. No other extraordinary efforts in creating sound effects have been taken.This comes along with camera/editing, lacking a view for details.You never hear (or see) gloves grate when tightened. You never hear (or see) snap fasteners click when closing a knife's holster.You never 'hear' silence. - Back in the 80's, limiters were used to increase the impact of sound of a movie. Their use had been exaggerated so the the viewer was able to hear crackles when no-one talked. These were the most exciting moments because the viewer actually had the impression of adrenaline kicking through his own veins, which would have resulted in the same effect. The viewer could virtually hear a needle fall on the floor. Expendables 2 is missing both: Silence (and thereby suspense) and a limiter device.~~ Rigging and Color Timing ~~The whole movie is tainted blue. It's lacking pristine colours. The viewer feels more like watching Sleepy Hollow or Blade than watching an action Movie.But for the worst: While the lighting people put lights on the stage, they missed to put light on the actors' faces! The actors mostly are just black blurry shadows acting in front of the camera!Moreover, the movie is missing highlights. The only highlight I could actually see was the sun shining through the airplane's windows. But that's all. Lighting technicians must have been on strike while making this movie.~~ Camera and editing ~~Camera end final cut are awful.The camera did not focus on details at all. You never see macro close-ups, e.g. showing a hand either tightening a glove or clasping a knife in the holster. You never see someone's eyes focusing on anything.This becomes particular annoying during action scenes: Every actor is almost immediately shooting around. There's not a single arming/preparing sequence in the move.The camera never follows a flying knife, or any other of the rare non-shotgun weapons, on its way.The whole cut is always either hasty or boring. Anyway. it's rendering many potentially relevant scenes irrelevant.~~ Story telling ~~This flick is a patchwork of about a dozen common-or-garden stories, each told within 5 minutes, and none of them adds value to the movie.There is not a moment of suspense in the movie. What happens on the screen is either boredom (like the actors waiting for night to come) or immediate action. The viewer never is ahead (or behind) of the actors' knowledge.The jokes don't bring relief to a suspenseful moment. They are mostly referring to the age of the actors.I don't like being reminded of being too old when watching an action flick with my old heroes. I want them to surprise me. I want them to show me what they can still do! Either join the action as a hero or stay out of it.I'm missing the funny chats, the ambiguity between brave heart killers and sentient men, like the Lee/Stallone dialog in part 1. Or the Mickey Rourke scenes from part 1. The coffee/spaghetti cooking scene is funny though.The whole story is missing detail and suspense. The villain never becomes a personal menace. His/their killing is performed without any reason. But a villain does not become a menace from just killing people at random.Most character dialogs or monologues are bullshit. Few jokes are funny. Most of them aren't, particularly when they are making fun of the heroes' previous characters.~~ All in all ~~The flick is technically bad done.I have had the impression of taking part in a video game, but not of watching a Rambo style quality action movie.I've been missing soundness in the characters' portrayal.I've been missing suspense, in story, sound and musical score.There have been too many heroes in the movie. None of them got enough time to fill his role. Less would have been more.I loved how Thomas Danneberg managed to German-dub both, Silvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.My conclusion: The second part of a series always is bad. Seems to be a mathematical law, waiting to be cracked yet.However, I'm very much looking forward to a third (better) part!",3,81,142,2 September 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Too many special effects - boring
","I've just seen the movie in the cinema. The story was quite alright. I felt, though, that the actors spent too much time trying to crack slapstick jokes. Can't hear any more actors' 'oh oh's or 'oops'...The storyboard also spent way too much time and distracted the story on CGI sequences. These are so boring to watch... Where have all the stunt men gone? Ignoring laws of physics so trite and obviously in CGI 'stunt' scenes really drops me off the movie. I was rather impressed that there was a 'real' watermill scene indeed in the movie showing *real* actors in action for... was it half a second?After all, almost every character from the first movie had a reprise. And you could literally see the story authors' minds working hard on how they could possibly fit any character back in. With more or less success...I personally found that Kevin McNally lost character in this second episode. Too clean, too positive...",5,1,5,8 August 2006
La La Land," An indecisive picture, pointlessly drifting between genres
","Throughout the picture, Damien Chazelle doesn't take a decision on what kind of picture to show. The film appears to be a random collage from a number of chapters from some cyclopedia about film making.Being rapidly dragged through diverse genres, heartlessly knitted together, it's hard to get emotionally bound with the story or with the characters in the picture.I felt like a 1st grade student watching a training movie presenting a sketch of different genre styles.The base story, a Becoming of Age story, is obtrusively filled with all kinds of styles. I was permanently asking myself: Why is he doing this now? What's his motivation? What's the story's motivation? For example: --- I guess the musical elements where supposed to convey love emotion. But why have the actors been so unemotionally, even dismissively, playing it? --- What's been the reason for taking so much time for conveying that the Mia character is an actress? That fact doesn't add to the story at all.--- There is an (utterly awesome) long lasting uncut scene. It's a performance highlight. But why on earth is it applied to a negligible chat between lovers? --- Why are all the musical artists depicted in the film so emotionless? I understand the jazz club scene as a reminiscence to the jazz club scene in The Glenn Miller Story. But how dull is the La-La-Land version compared to that? --- Speaking of dull: The score was extremely boring. Cheap jazz licks, carelessly arranged.--- In the musical scenes I was very much in doubt whether the musical text was meant to be serious or ironic. I was asking myself: Is this a Fourth Wall movie or was this a movie with a story to cling to? All in all, to me the movie appeared to be some kind of a bachelor's academic thesis. And I don't understand what makes the movie worth a nomination for even one single Academy Award.",1,7,12,12 February 2017
Titanic," Marvellous Movie - Excellent 3D Conversion
","I just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie, Titanic by James Cameron, in all its brilliance.It's just like those 15 years have never happened. It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life: size.After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice: NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will. But when it'll come back to the theatre's in a couple of years, I'll be right back to watch it there.",10,9,14,2 May 2012
Thor," Great Bible Stories Adapted To Germanic Mythology
","Thor is an extraordinarily well directed movie with fine acting.Its story line contained many interesting stories worth discussing the plot: Father-Son conflict (Odin-Thor), Life and death of Jesus (Thor sent to earth, fight against the Destroyer), the Antichrist (Loki), Cold War (Ice People against Odin's Heaven), generation conflict (old, wise fighters against hot-headed youth). So this movie is worth watching it with your girl friend as well.I very much like Kenneth Branagh's kind of staging. It's so outstandingly personal even when scenes become crowded. You immediately identify with all the characters.Great acting performed by all actors in the movie. I particularly liked Idris Elba who played Heimdall in the movie.Not to mention the good work of other arts like camera, light, cut.The story was very exciting. However, it sometimes wasn't conclusive: It's very hard to believe that an unarmed man can easily walk into a place guarded and monitored by a number or armed forces men. And it's also hard to believe that just an agent has this much power of decision.Moreover, there were a few other things I didn't like:* The musical score was low of emotion and ambition. In my view it wasn't able to properly augment many scenes appropriately, fighting scenes in particular. From the assignment of instruments used and from composing complexity it becomes apparent that the composer very much lacks classic composing education. The result is far below the result a composer like John Williams would have achieved.* CGI characters were rather clumsy. Mass scenes at Asgard looked like they had been shot with loads of mannequins. Ice people, too, were rather lifeless. Not to mention the Destroyer, whose movements were not too 'metally'.* In the German version the term 'destroyer' had not been translated. That very much pulled me out of it. Correctly translating it to 'Zerstörer' would have been much more frowning. It's a very well known term from World War II. To me, 'destroyer' is much more of a term known from movies like Toy Story.",8,0,1,13 June 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The good, the bad and the ugly (incl. German edition's review)
","I went to the cinema last night and here's my personal review:In general: None of the characters is getting developed during the plot. All of them are fully explained and equipped with all their attitude and feature sets within the first five minutes of appearance.Kylo Ren, the villain: isn't threatening at all. I feel sad for a youngster who's apparently been hanging around with the wrong guys and is gotten weird in his puberty. But I'm not impressed. He's just a nervous kid who has never learned to control his temper, angrily destroying things in his room when he gets upset. To me he's more like Biff Tannen in the 'Back to the Future' franchise.Rey, the girl: is just as stubborn, insolent and ludicrously high gifted as all movie heroins are. She's so scrawny she can hardly hold a gun, yet she's winning every fight easily. Oh my god.... Well, at least she PILOTS like a woman ;)Flinn, the guy: is stupid and clumsy. I wonder how he survived his time as a soldier. And I wonder why I should be continuously watching him failing over and over again. I feel sad for him.The girl and the guy: I guess Disney wanted to turn the role model wheel 180°, making the skinny young girl a fighter and the fighter a foolish young girl. For me such absurdity is utterly hard to watch without holding and shaking my disenchanted head.Lor San Tekka, Max von Sydow: Why is he, the perfect Obi-Wan Kenobi character successor, in the movie only for about five minutes?--Why is every film aimed at 12 year old children nowadays? Why didn't the creatures in the carrier hurt someone?Most of the excitement, suspense and sobriety in a movie comes from characters not talking. But all of the characters in the movie - just - didn't - stop - talking!No ambiance or mute suspense scenes are depicted whatsoever. No fade or wipe as been applied, too. So there's no chance whatsoever to get John William's excellent score to interact with the audience.Everyone was acting so fast and nervously. Gee, I felt like being in a nursery from all the unnecessary stupidity and cheer that's been said.What's so great with Chewbacca's crossbow which Han Solo didn't see earlier in all these years?Everyone in the movie is talking and behaving too nervously and fast. The only ones with a great timing were Han Solo - and Snoke in particular.The Chewbacca character is giving a plain stupid idiot. Just like the Finn character does.BB-8 is behaving like a little dog. No cleverness whatsoever. He's unnecessary from the beginning. It would have been more reasonable to put the USB stick into a box and hide it in the sands than to introduce the BB-8 character for this.I would have preferred if a Muppet would have been used for playing Maz Kanata. These CGI characters just don't have soul. I bet no child would like to have a Maz Kanata puppet in their bed.Why is the chess board (Dejarik) on board the Millennium Falcon playing all of a sudden - WITHOUT players?--And here's my review to the horrible German translation of the flick:'I'm a Stormtrooper' has been translated into 'ich bin ein Sturmtruppler' - Huh? 'Sturmtruppler'??? Really? So the German translators didn't know how to translate a German word into German?? In English this would be like calling him a 'Stormtroopling'! Gee!! ... Who came up with that idea?? Why didn't they let him say something reasonable like: 'ich gehöre zu den Sturmtruppen' which may be translated as 'I'm belonging to the shock troops'?!?Same for 'The First Order': They translated it into 'Die erste Ordnung' which sounds just like 'The First Orderliness' in German. Gee!! What did they think this is? Isn't the house cleaning company nearby called like this? I hardly believe the director of the German version really knew what he/she was doing... A more appropriate translation into German would have been something like 'Das neue Regime'.It must have been nitwits who did the translation. Didn't they know that the Empire is a allegory to the Third Reich? Come one, guys, this isn't Lord of the Rings!Moreover, I don't know about Kylo Ren's English voice, but the German voice has been badly set. Too much intonation, he is talking too quickly. His voice is just too vivid and nervous to be evil. Given that voice, wouldn't he be better off singing when he tortures others? (After all, it's a Disney flick, isn't it?)Same for the silvery 'Stormtroopling'. He's a 'she' - and she's talking with a high pitched girl's voice! Urgh!! I couldn't hold myself laughing when she'd be giving orders.Not to mention the voice of Maz Kanata. She's got the voice of a young woman! But does she look like one?? To me she rather seemed and felt like a female Yoda. And that's what I would have expected from her voice: The voice from someone having a voice like one of the Golden Girls actresses. Or Roseanne's as it is now.--One positive thing: There *really* is a great deal of true hardware and makeup done in the movie. And it was great to see the Millennium Falcon interior with all the traditional switches and levers - and WITHOUT a touch screen!However, the amount of CGI in the movie is still 99 % compared to real hardware/makeup.--I'm very much looking forward to get a hand on the DVD. As soon as I get it I will cut all the hooey and girlish stuff out, add length by slowing down some scenes and create my own grown-up version of the flick.",7,8,19,14 January 2016
