First Man," soooooo slooooow
",I was looking forward to this film but apart from the opening 5 mins it is a boring disappointment. I like ryan godling but he seemed to play his role looking half asleep and as though he didnt want to be there. Consequently Neil Armstrong comes across as a self involved and unlikeable individualnost of the characters wer one dimensional and uninteresting. Where was the excitement and optimism?,2,5,8,19 February 2019
War of the Worlds," would've been better without......
","T his is a half decent film that waS made almost unwatchable because of Dakota Fanning screaming every five minutes and behaving like a spoilt brat. it ruined every scene she was in. Yes there are some gaping plot holes and the ending waS unforgiveably schalmtzy. but it isnt a terrible film.one highlight was james Spader's performance as the unhinged ggun toting redneck type. All in all this isnt a bad film, i just wish Dakota Fanning would shut the hell up.",5,6,8,22 April 2019
