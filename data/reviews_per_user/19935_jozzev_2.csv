United 93," Awefully boring movie with a ridiculous story line
","United 93 pretends to tell the story of the disastrous flight that was high-jacked by terrorist on 9-11. Basically, the first hour is as boring as listening to the radio when you're deaf... Bad actors, bad dialogues, nothing to keep you interested whatsoever because simply NOTHING is happening! However, the worse part is the end: when the passengers attack the terrorists and thereby prevent the terrorist to use it in their attack on the US as a nation. Although this was the initial version of the reports and investigations on this case, the final outcome and conclusion has been that the passengers had NOTHING to do with the crash of the unplanned plane... The final scene where passengers force themselves into the cockpit (that's right, that place that is impossible to enter without a key!!!) is pure fiction and totally unbelievable... In one word, this movie SUCKS! Don't waste any money on it. Unless you feel short of pure American nationalist sentiments and want to see your fellow Americans as h e r o e s ....",1,13,41,27 August 2006
Hugo," The most boring, lame, slow and predictable movie ever made
","I had great expectations of Hugo, especially in 3D. The critics were very positive, particularly about the 3D effects. Yes, the opening scene when the camera flies over Paris and through the train station is great. But there the greatness of the film ends. Why was this movie made in 3D? It doesn't add anything to it, there is hardly any difference would you see it in normal 2D, but above all: the movie is made for kids between 6 and 10 years old! For adults it is a torturing 2 hour sit, with absolutely no interesting twists to the story. It is so incredibly predictable, of the kind that is only seen in small children's movies. On top of that, it is painfully slow and boring. Also, the acting in general isn't bad, but the girl (Isabelle) is just terrible. Not believable at all, and over-dramatizing everything. Furthermore, I cannot stand the fact that in Paris everybody speaks traditions UK English... and the train hall inspector is a typical English character, again, in Paris??! All in all it was the worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I have seen more slow and boring movies of course, but this one topped them all because 1) the great critics it got and 2) it was so annoying that you could see exactly how this movie would roll out from minute 1 to last. 1 out of 10 stars, and only because I cannot give it zero stars.",1,8,18,21 February 2012
