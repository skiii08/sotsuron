It," Really good horror film and adaptation although not great.
","IT could've have been great if it had had a darker tone.Using the character's psychological aspect and making the antagonist use those vulnerabilities against them while putting a touch of horror with a dark sadistic humor for him to work with kind of reminds you of child's play, nightmare on elm street (original) or the new series from Netflix's stranger things which is great. It has creepy scenes nevertheless but it's not going to scare you to death.The movie makes you care about the characters whether it is in the horror dark humor kind like IT was or the awesome friendship between the losers club where each had their own time to show bravery in addition to their great acting.Some use of jumpscares were bothersome and unnecessary because there were scenes that didn't need it since they already had horror shots there with an eerie atmosphere without the use of those types of sounds. Some creature designs (two at the most if memory doesn't fail me) were not scary and although the ending was really good, there might've been a way for them to have made it more creepy and horrific given the place they had at their disposal.This movie is really a 7.5 but here you can leave only closed ratings which is why I'm giving it a 7. It's a really competent horror film overall and a must have in blu Ray collection.",7,4,8,17 September 2017
