The Blair Witch Project," Might be the best horror flick ever made!
","This is a real winner of a horror film.  Starting off slowly the suspense builds in an ever-increasing crescendo of terror until the final sequence, which is definitely not for the faint-of-heart.  The film held the audience on the edge of their seats throughout, and it even translates well to video and DVD.  Considering the budget, and the experience level of the filmmakers, this might very well be the best horror film ever made.",10,1,2,11 July 2000
