United 93," This was a major tragedy
","When i first saw this movie on commercials I was like 'Oh thats cool seems like a good movie'. When we rented it the women cashier told me it was going to be a commentary which lowered my excitement and expectations. When the movie began i immediately knew the plot line. Personally I never knew much about 9/11 so I was thinking that the fourth plane survived...I was wrong! The struggle you see everyone go through in the movie was so emotional. I put my self so involved to where the movie soaked me up into the screen and i was on the plane. I was terrified. But i loved how the movie is so humane it didn't make the terrorists look completely evil just mislead by what they were taught. The part that got me shocked was when the passengers got through to the pilot area and the camera goes to the window and you see the grass get closer and closer till the screen goes blank... my heart stopped, my mouth was open for the whole time. I read the captions after wards for my mom and tears ran down my face then i got to the last one to the dedication i could even finish reading the date i started crying so hard. It never hit me until i saw that movie how horrible things were and are. I will never forget 9/11 because of it... This movie is beyond belief. I give much appreciation to the director and the screen writer (s)",10,0,2,16 September 2006
