Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas simply wanted to make money...
","...so he wrote and directed a movie for children, complete with an annoying comic character (Jar Jar Binxs) doing exceedingly stupid things during the whole movie, a lot of visual effects and a very simple story. The young Anakin Skywalker, instead of being a shy boy with a little dark sparkle is haughty and unbearable as the majority of children in the average '80s American comedy. But the worst thing Lucas did, the one that I (and millions of fan) can't forgive, it's the pseudo-scientific explanation of the Force as the result of a symbiotic organism living in the blood cells of the Jedi... No explanation was needed! The Force is simply a mystical power that pervades the universe and that's enough. Shame on you, George!",4,2,4,4 December 2007
Driven," Worst race movie ever... or simply worst movie ever?
","It's hard to write a review about something so horrible in every single aspect: acting, scripting and, above all, the representation of Indycar races... I guess if at least one in the entire troupe has ever watched a real race in his life! Stupid and unrealistic things keep happening all the time, without logic or respect for the intelligence of the unlucky spectator. I'm not spending any more time reviewing this movie, I only hope that no one wants to see it after these lines. I'm a huge race fan and this movies is insulting and a true shame... Arghh! I've been DRIVEN mad! Not yet ten lines! This movie sucks... really sucks! I got it!",1,8,19,3 June 2011
