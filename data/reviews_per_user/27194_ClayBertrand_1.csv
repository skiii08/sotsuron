Lucky Number Slevin," What can be said...?
","Watching Lucky Number Slevin is a lot like being forced to hang out with that kid from high school who thought he was 'cool' but his attempts at it only made him look ridiculous. The writing would have been original if it were made back in 1994, but now the overly witty lines mixed with pop culture references is just old and tired. My guess is they knew the story wasn't very strong so they decided to load it up with big name stars, who have all done much better work. And the big 20 minute 'let's clear it all up' montage at the end is just the worst. If you want a crime thriller, see 'Running Scared' and leave this one alone.",2,8,18,10 September 2006
