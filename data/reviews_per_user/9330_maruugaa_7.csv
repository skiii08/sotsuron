Hereditary," started off good; ending was awful
","So for the first hour and a half, this would have been the best movie I'd seen all year. It was actually creepy/scary, and I watch a lot of horror movies so I generally don't get scared/anxious in horror movies anymore.
But the movie keeps building up suspense and foreshadowing until you get to the end, and *poof*, none of that foreshadowing comes together. Nothing is explains. It just has a random ending and you don't find out why all the other events were connected.
Also, the parents were white and their son clearly was not, and he wasn't adopted because the mother mentioned being preggers with him. I understand he may have been the best actor for the role, but you could've added something to the plot---like he was a sperm donor baby, or a different father, or even have made him adopted---to have it make sense.
Gave it 7/10 because I was entertained for the first hour.",7,0,2,24 June 2018
Wind River," This is the best movie I've seen this decade
","My eyes were glued to the screen for the whole 1.75 hours of this movie. The majority of movies this decade are remakes, or continous superhero movies, political dramas that try too hard and just end up being boring, or action movies that is zero story with a lot of CGI and stuff blowing up.This movie had an in-depth, complex, twisting plot. You become emotionally connected with all the characters in the movie, feel their rage and their sadness. And it also looks at a very real issue going on in USA and Canada right now that seems to be overlooked.I was actually enraged that the Oscar for best picture went to The Shape of Water and not this one. I was also enraged that this movie didn't get nominated at all for anything.",10,0,1,18 April 2018
Ready Player One," too long
","This was a two and a half hour movie for a half hour of content.
I didn't read the book, aside from chapter 1, but given from how every once and a a while the movie would hint at a plot or theme or morale, I assume the book did actually have a story line.
This was 50% 80s references(which I'm aware is from the book), 45% horrible CGI fight/action/violence scenes, and 5% story line. The character development in the movie is zero. I'm pretty sure the whole movie was filmed in front of a green screen. It felt like I was watching a video game demo, which I guess was somewhat the point as it happened in a video game, but it was just visually unappealing to the eyes.
The avatars were hideous. OASIS was hideous.
And a complaint toward both the movie and the book, I am so tired of 1980s music and references. I was born in the 1980s and never even got to experience the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s fully because society is stuck in the 1980s for some reason.
Maybe the music was good in the 1980s, but having to hear the same songs continuously for my entire life means hearing 80s music just gives me a raging headache.",1,8,12,6 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Long and Boring: Worst movie of 2018 so far
","I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured:
1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney
2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.",1,150,355,18 May 2018
A Quiet Place," I was pretty bored.
","Far from the worst movie ever, but not great like everyone here is making out to be. It's one of those movies that you'll see and forget about later because nothing in it was significant enough.The didn't talk. They used sign language sometimes, but not nearly enough for there to be any significant dialogue. Some of the reviews here have more words than this movie.You don't get a backstory, the story doesn't progress throughout the movie. It starts off with them having to be quiet, but no new developments arise throughout the movie. There isn't really a plot, it's just nothing, with random 'shock value' events, like the little boy and the dad getting killed by the alien thingies, but nothing more than that.I think an hour into it, I was hoping the family would just hurry up and be eaten already, because I couldn't see how else this movie would end.But then, suddenly, the girl discovers their weakness, and then *poof*, the movie was over.I did enjoy how short this movie was though.",4,1,2,20 April 2018
Black Panther," I fell asleep
","The movie had a very weak plot and compensated for the lack of plot with violence. It's just a typical 'Disney has no creativity and resorts to turning stuff that was popular in the 1960s into movies'.I missed a good 30 minutes of the movie because I fell asleep from boredom. 
 The stuff I woke up to felt like a fanfiction of the Iliad. Move the Iliad from Africa to Greece and get rid of the Trojan Horse, give it some super high tech equipment and that was pretty much this movie.I would've given it a worse rating, but there was a hot man shirtless throughout most of it, so that made it more enjoyable. Plus I also saw Red Sparrow, and it would have been an insult to humanity to give your typical Disney, superhero, plotless, violence a rating as low as a movie that's just brutal violence towards women.Also, how is something violent only rated PG-13? I've seen less violent movies that were rated R.",4,2,5,9 April 2018
Annihilation," This movie is good, so long as you didn't read the book first
","So i had low expectations for this movie considering it was 2 hours long and the book was under 200 pages, and a good chunk of those less than 200 pages were describing the setting, which doesn't take time in movies, because you just see the setting in the background.
Then when I saw the movie, it wasn't even the same plot as the book.
Only 4 characters in the movie are in the book: The Biologist, her husband, the psychologist, and the Boar thingy.
The characters in the book are: The Biologist, The Psychologist, The Anthropologist, The Surveyor, a mentioned linguist who never made it across with them, the Biologist's husband and parents are mentioned throughout the book. In the movie, it is The Biologist(Lena), Her husband, the guy she's sleeping with, The Psychologist, A Morphologist, A Medic, A Physicist, the people quarantining her.
The characters in the book have no names, and this was to keep them from getting too close to each other. The characters in the movie all have names, and they say their names a lot.
In the book, they're investigating a tunnel/tower, and inside is a never-ending script of words that on closer inspections seems to be alive. The Biologist inhales a spore from inspecting the words, making her immune to The Psychologist's hypnosis. The next day the Anthropologist is dead. Biologist is sure Psychologist caused it. She and Surveyor get sent back into the Tower, then psychologist disappears. The Biologist names the creature writing the text The Crawler. There is a lighthouse, and a picture of the lighthouse keeper she sees in the Crawler. Aside from the existence of a lighthouse, none of this is in the movie. She finds her husband's journal and decides to continue searching Area X instead of returning home. (This is the end of book 1) The movie is just them examining a lighthouse. And Lena enters a hole which I'm guessing is the Tower, and meets a creature that mirrors her. Then she's back on regular Earth in quarantine.
In the book, everyone from the previous expedition came home mysteriously, and then died of cancer a few months later. In the movie, the husband is the only one to have come back, and is now dying of organ failure and in isolation.I didn't think any movie could top Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters for a worse book-to-movie adaptation. But Annihilation movie has proven me wrong.",7,1,3,15 March 2018
