The Blair Witch Project," A 'Witch' to watch....
","Do I have to tell you what this one is about?Anyone worth their salt knows about 'The Blair Witch Project' and the descent of three documentarians into the woods, their own fears, madness and the fallacy of not listening to old wives tales.But is it scary, you ask?  Yes, I say!This is one of the few horror films out in the world today that actually knows what works.  It taps into our primordial fears (getting lost, the dark, distant noises, inexplicable symbolism) and exploits them out the ying-yang.  It is to the film's advantage that it was shot on camcorders; the constantly moving lens gives the film an urgent, breathless feel that makes it seem as if, yes, this is all actually taking place as we see it.  Like we're there with these three crazy kids who go poking around where they shouldn't.I have only one quibble about this film.SPOILER - Even anyone with a minute cache of survival skills knows to follow a stream as it flows and it will lead to a river, pond, lake or whatever.  And there would be the most likely place you would find people, towns, cities, etc. So, why don't these green kids do that?  Yeah, I know: because then the movie would be over and they'd never find that house in the middle of the woods.  Just a small gripe in an otherwise fine horror flick.<ul><li>END OF SPOILER</li></ul>Okay, where was I?  Oh yeah; great film.  Earns every one of its scares and if any one film can trigger so much debate about whether it is real or not, you know these guys must have done something right.  Ten stars and some motion sickness pills for 'The Blair Witch Project', the movie that proves once and for all that when you go out into the woods...pack an extra map.",10,0,1,9 November 1999
Alien 3," Third time's NOT the charm....
","There is a limit to how many times a story can be told....For the 'Alien' saga, that number is 3.This third installment of the venerable saga basically plays out like a Greek tragedy where everything is desolate and everyone is in despair, either over personal loss or their own discontent.  Ripley ends up on a prison planet and, of course, one of the aliens from the original has followed her, ensuring an onslaught of epic proportions. 
UNFORTUNATELY, too much time is given to think about certain plot points. Such as:Why are so many interesting characters introduced (namely Dance), then dropped so arbitrarily?Why does Fincher's direction seem so shaky and unsure (in great contrast to his work in 'Se7en')?How could the same writers (mainly Hill and Giler) write a story that has little or no emotional impact and next to no development as far as plot, motivation or even (in the alien's instance) shock value?And you'll notice, once you've seen this film, that it hasn't got the same sensibilities the first film had.  There is too much time spent on the downbeat, the morose and the evil that men do that there is little to no time left for the sporadic alien attacks.  Sometimes, it's easy to forget this is science fiction we're watching; it might as well be a prison drama for all this movie cares.I won't give away how this movie ends, but to ask one question: if this was, indeed how the series was supposed to end, what are we to make of Ripley's act?  Was she indeed being ascended to the Christ-like for her actions (as is made all too obvious by the final symbolism) or was she a martyr for the cause of good vs. evil?  Or was it, as is my opinion, misplaced symbolism just for symbolism's sake?Even in the theater I saw this in, many of those around me reacted to this film like they would one of 'Alien''s many rip-offs.  Lots of exasperated sighs at different points, some non-amused laughter and at least one person commented aloud 'Aw, jeez!'.My feelings, exactly.Three stars for the effort but as far as sequels go, this probably wasn't as 'Alien' a product as they wanted to get to the audience.",3,503,557,18 May 2000
Se7en," A number worth thinking about....
","A movie as dark, disturbing and heavily wrought with despair as 'Se7en' can hardly be called entertainment.  This is a motion-picture statement.  And not an encouraging one.  But a statement all the same.Not to say that it's a bad movie.  Quite the opposite.In a tale where a retiring police detective (Freeman) takes one last case along with his replacement (Pitt), only to find that their investigation leads them down through a very First Testament eye-for-an-eye lesson in the seven deadly sins, you cannot expect a merry romp down the yellow brick road.As the victims have all been felled by such vices as gluttony, vanity, sloth, sex and such, Freeman and Pitt slowly realize that they are dealing not only with a sicko but one who means to follow his lesson on to the bitter end.And that's it.  I won't tell another bit of the plot; this is the kind of movie that has to be witnessed first-hand.  I'll be the first to admit that it's definitely not a movie for anybody.  Certainly most people will be turned off almost immediately by the gore and downbeat intensity of the whole situation.  As Freeman so lucidly observes, 'This isn't going to have a happy ending.' - well, how could it?Freeman is, of course, a sound center to the film and without him as a grounding wire, the whole film would have suffered through its grunge and blood and rainy days and nights.  Much has been said of Pitt's ineffectual stance in his role, but I think that's the whole point: he's the common man who just sees this killer as another wacko to lock up.  His eventual transformation is almost un-noticeable as he turns from a deadened, I've-seen-it-all type into someone who can't quite believe that such debased evil actually exists until.. well, that would be telling; suffice it to say that it's gradual and sudden all at once - and makes perfect sense, in context.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife about as well as can be expected under the circumstances.  R. Lee Ermey plays a more sedate version of the drill sergeant he made so vivid in 'Full Metal Jacket'.  And as for John Doe... it's a credit to his performance that he makes himself so eerily believable as someone who believes this is the only way to make people listen to what he has to say.  And, in some sick way, he may be right.But the people aren't the stars here, and neither is Fincher's dark, foreboding direction - it's the story and where it leads to, it's the talks you'll have afterwards about what happens at the end, it's about sin and death and what really has to be done to make some people aware of what sin is around them and how dead we've all become towards it.  Maybe 'Se7en' is more about how we react to the eventual lesson taught and how it's presented than the actors, the gore and the literary quotes.If you can stomach the gore and your heart can take some pretty wrenching scenes, this may be a movie for you to watch, think about and, possibly, learn from.  I watched it and, myself, learned a pretty important lesson. Of course, every movie teaches its own different lesson to different people. See 'Se7en' yourself and draw your own conclusion.Eight stars for 'Se7en'.  Powerful: yes.  Disturbing: definitely. Unforgettable: absolutely.",8,0,0,8 May 2000
Batman Returns," Of bats, men and sequels....
","I can see what Tim Burton was trying to do with 'Batman Returns'.In the original, there was darkness enough but also a bit too much of the flip attitude of the TV series for his taste.  After all, we're talking about artistic integrity here.  Once and for all, he wanted to make his OWN interpretation of the 'Batman' mystique, which he did here.Point of order - this movie is indeed successful in showing how good a craftsman Burton is for dark, gloomy images of despair, misgivings and doom. But, is that the right attitude for a movie about a super hero to strike?In a gloomy, seemingly refrigerated Gotham City, Batman must battle the evil of not only The Penguin (DeVito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) but also of businessman Max Schreck (Walken) who plans to drain all of Gotham's energy for his own power plant, along with a few other twisted deeds he has hidden up his tailor-made sleeves.BUT, and this is the important part, the first movie had a successful villain in Nicholson's Joker (as if there were any doubt).  Here, the villains are seen more as objects of pity (the deformed, pathetic Penguin; the put-upon, mentally abused Catwoman; the power-hungry, grasping and son (Bryniarski)-obsessed Schreck) than of anything inherently evil. 
And then there's Batman - as portrayed by Keaton, he feels more like a cypher - an empty suit, if you will - than he was in the first film.  He doesn't even give a flicker of the torment he felt in the original.  Here, he just broods.  As before, the scenery is beautiful, if more dark.  Burton is, first and foremost, an artist and shows his talents in composition and design.  But even though the first 'Batman' was far more successful, it had less to do with Burton and more to do with the calibre of other talent involved (Nicholson, Basinger, Wuhl).Devito plays a one-note villain without any nuance or subtlety; Pfeiffer makes a suitably flaky Catwoman and, even though she tries, her character is far too pitiable to be threatening' Walken basically plays his umpteenth baddie but still pales in comparison to similar parts he's played in 'True Romance',   and 'A View to a Kill' (sure, it wasn't very good, but it was still better than THIS!).This series would have to wait to improve ('Batman Forever'), but as far as sequels go, it at least kept with Burton's vision, even if it didn't keep with the entertainment value.Three stars for 'Batman Returns'.  TIDBIT - Reubens and Salinger, who played the parents to DeVito's character, were featured in an earlier Burton effort - 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'.  Talk about a token gesture....",3,2,7,24 June 2000
Alien," Horrific Good Time....
","When this first came out in '79, the TV ads themselves scared the living beans out of me.  Never mind that I was only 14 at the time; they would have done the trick if I were 54!  Little did I know just how frightening the actual movie would be!'Alien''s story-line has more to do with the old sci-fi film 'It!  The Terror from Beyond Space', about an alien who sneaks aboard a spaceship and terrorizes its passengers.  Of course, there's light-years difference between Ray 'Crash' Corrigan and this beast.  The plot remains the same, save for more modern tweaks and advances in technique.  And the actors herein are all in peak form.  Starting with the ever-radiant Weaver and continuing with Skeritt, Kotto, Stanton, Hurt, Holm and Cartwright, everyone does a fantastic job under the carefully-wrought direction of Scott, modulating terror and amazement at once as the alien gets aboard ship, terrorizing, attacking and destroying all in its path. 
It would be unfair to divulge more than that, as this is less a film than an experience; one best left to be witnessed in a pitch-black room with a pillow clutched tightly in your arms.  If you are a serious fan of sci-fi and/or horror, this is the film for your collection.  There are so many great scenes, classic moments and downright wonderment with outer space along with the terror of the situation that 'Alien' is rightly considered a landmark in the realms of sci-fi and, as other reviewers have noted, stands the test of time.  As for myself, I'll take this film over any of its latter-day rip-offs any day.Ten stars and a bronzed Face-Hugger for 'Alien', a classic example of just what a bad alien can do, especially in the last twenty minutes of this film.Talk about a bonus situation.",10,0,1,18 May 2000
Top Secret!," Spread the word!
","Why are movies like this left forgotten?  'Top Secret!' should be anything but.Created in that dark period of time between 'Airplane!' and the 'Naked Gun' movies, 'Top Secret!' is a gem of a flick given to us by the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker).  These guys have obviously watched a lot of spy films, Elvis films and at least one or two Swedish films.  Every convention, cliche' and possible double entendre is mercilessly dissected and delved into head first.  If you love any of the aforementioned genres, this is definitely one to seek out: you'll bust a gut!Kilmer is dead-on as Nick Rivers (his dad thought of the name while he was shaving), a crooning teen sensation the Germans think would be great to invite to their country to entertain while they plan the downfall of the rest of the world.  Of course, they don't count on Nick Rivers falling in love with Hillary Flammond (Gutteridge), daughter of a famous scientist (Gough) being held by the Germans.  They also don't figure on him becoming a member of the French Underground, singing such classics as 'Share this Night with Me', 'Straighten the Rug' and 'Skeet Surfin'' or trying to pass himself off as Mel Torme'.How can anyone not like this movie?  The sight gags are inexhaustable, and so is the script, dispensing one-liners and quips at a blinding rate.  My favorite scenes: the cartoon map of Germany, the park statue, the introduction of the resistance fighters, the entrances of Latrine, the scene where....Well, you get the idea.Ten stars.  Tell the world: watch 'Top Secret!'And find out what they really put in a prop room.",10,0,1,6 October 1999
Duck Soup," In the 'Soup'....
","What can I say?'Duck Soup', featuring all four Marx Brothers in their last quartet appearance, wreaking havoc as never before on not only the Sylvania's vile ruler Trentino (Calhern) and Freedonia's sole matron Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont - who else?) and everybody and thing that happens into their view. 
To say this is funny is just not enough.  The brothers four let loose with a barrage of jokes both outrageous, ingenious, hilarious and most definitely worthy of quote, honor and reverence at very special moments (i.e. - parties, holidays, christenings, auctions, long walks, bedtime, breakfast, lunch, dinner, brunch...get the idea?).To describe the plot is futility.  Unlike modern plot-driven 'comedies', the Marx Brothers understood that all that is needed of a movie is the barest semblance of an idea (Freedonia president Groucho declares war on Sylvania) to make with gags big and small, all with the same payoff - BIG!Who has the best scene?  Hard to tell, since everyone gets at least one or two great scenes each, sometimes more.  I've already discussed the dialogue, but the sight gags - oh, the sight gags!  The mirror scene, Groucho's confrontations with Trentino, the courtroom scene, Chico and Harpo all pretending to be Groucho (don't ask), the musical numbers, the...well, I could go on, but you know what I mean - this is THE MARX BROTHERS, for cryin' out loud!See 'Duck Soup' right now!  Rent it, catch it on TV, borrow it from your neighbor, swipe it from your little brother.  I don't want your  excuses - watch it NOW!Ten stars.  Hail Freedonia!By the way, does anyone know what the title has to do with the film?  Me neither.  Must be a Marx Brothers thing.",10,0,1,12 August 2002
Aliens," A rarity in the world of sequels....
","Can it be possible; a sequel that is as good, if not better, than the original?  Yes, it not only can be possible, it is, and 'Aliens' not only proves a fantastic sci-fi movie in its own right but again proves the power that Sigourney Weaver has in the right film, as well as the over-powering direction of James Cameron.Picking up 200 years after the fact, Weaver is once again thrown into a battle along with the Space Marines that are called to the planet where Weaver's team originally found the alien of the first film.  The colonies that have been built there have been obliterated of all life and they are being sent there to wipe out every last alien on the planet.Of course, in a movie like this, nothing is as it seems, and that's a positive quality.  Weaver misses nary a beat as Ripley, a woman as un-trusting of aliens, most humans and just about anything else in general as she was before.  It's only when they discover a small girl (Carrie Hehn) left alive that she finally finds something that perhaps shows she has some feeling left.Of course, there are other great performances by Biehn, Henriksen, Goldstein, Paxton and Reiser, playing well fleshed-out characters against a backdrop of desperation, fear and outright gut-wrenching horror as they find out their mission wasn't as easy as they all thought. 
But then comes James Cameron.  Having proven his mettle with 'The Terminator', he works with a bigger budget and shows just as much ingenuity and flair for big, flashy action as any ten action directors.  But even if the story seems routine, Cameron's approach is not; he makes every single moment seem as fresh now as if it were being seen for the first time in motion picture history.  Always a good thing in science fiction, where there aren't exactly new ideas coming out every day.As with the original 'Alien' (and Cameron's 'Terminator'), the last half-hour or so is so much edge-of-your-seat and nail-biting tension that you'll feel like a wrung-out wash rag by the time all is said and done, and rightly so.  And, more than ever, you'll empathize with Weaver as her character fights not only for her own survival, but for that of others as well.  So, 'Aliens' is great science fiction and great film-making, but is it a worthy addition to the saga?  Most definitely, especially when you consider that most sci-fi films can't muster HALF the story this one does, much less a sequel to one.Ten stars (eleven if I only could) to 'Aliens', one of the best science fiction sequels ('Star Wars' movies excluded) ever.",10,4,5,18 May 2000
Die Hard 2," Yippie-ki-yay again....
","The element of surprise isn't there, but the excitement sure is!'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' is a perfect example of what can be right (and sometimes wrong) with the sequel to a blockbuster.Sending McClane (Willis) head-first into a plot to virtually destroy every flight coming into Dulles Airport and avert the crash of his wife Holly's (Bedelia's) flight, he overcomes as many, if not more, obstacles in trying to save the day, in spite of everyone else exercizing bad judgement and blocking him off at the absolute wrong moments.Again, Willis finds the right note as an everyday man thrown into the fiery jaws of death and fighting for his life around every corner.  And some of the scenes will make you hold your breath (the conveyor belt walkway, the grenades in the military plane, the airplane wing fight) and drop your jaw right into your popcorn.But the villains here just aren't as diabolical as in the first; they have more military goals as compared to the greed-driven kidnappers they are aping.  William Sadler may have a mean karate kick, but that's about it.
Still, Willis and the stunts save it.  Maybe not as good as the original (few sequels are), but 'Die Hard 2' at least tries 'Harder'.Eight stars.  And always keep your lighter handy.",Null,2,4,24 August 1999
Independence Day," Salute the flag and blast the ETs...
","Maybe it's just me but the one thing that kept running through my mind as I watched 'Independence Day' was - man, Irwin Allen would have LOVED this one!In fact, ID4 plays at times just like an Allen epic - awesome special effects, one-dimensional characters, action and danger at every turn, melodrama that any soap opera would kill for and top-name stars rounding out a powerhouse cast.  The only thing missing was the little boxes with the cast's pictures in them along the bottoms of the movie posters.And stereotypes?  SHEESH!  There are one-sided portrayals of drunk hicks (Quaid), old Jewish men (Hirsch), hysterical gays (Fierstein), detatched intellectuals (Goldblum), gung-ho tough guys (Smith), gruff military men (Loggia), and a bunch of women (Colin, McDonnell, Fox) who stand around and look worried as aliens blow up most of the world around them.Although, Fox is about the toughest of the lot; she can kick doors, drive trucks, tend to the wounded and stand up for herself mighty well, which is more than what the rest of the women here are allowed to do.  Quite a shame, too; remember when McDonnell was being lauded for 'Dances with Wolves'?Even so, the FX are top notch as we see New York City, Washington DC and all the other world capitals blasted to smithereens, alien ships hovering overhead like huge gray Frisbees and aliens that look like a combination between crabs, octopi and one of the cantina dwellers in 'Star Wars'.  Very impressive.BUT, and this is only a slight problem here, why did they have to paraphrase 'War of the Worlds' so much?  I mean, with all the technology and talent available, why not do something new and exciting?  Instead, the solution to curing the Earth of its alien problems is no more advanced than the end of WOTW.  If you've seen it, you know what I mean.For what it is, though, it works.  Plenty of action, laughs and excitement. Made for millions now when they use to be made for thousands in the '50s.Eight stars for ID4...welcome to Earth!",8,0,1,6 September 2000
1941," It's gonna be a long war....
","You can't have lofty aspirations all the time.Even the director of such powerful films as 'Jaws', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', 'ET' and 'Schindler's List' has to take a break from all the serious issues in his films and play dumb at least once. 
Just look at '1941'.With a plotline straight out of The Three Stooges and special effects befitting a WWII epic, '1941' abandons all pretense by parodying the opening of 'Jaws' right off the bat and hitting every slapstick point from there on in.  Spielberg knew that even if this turned out be a flop, it would be a good-natured one.Just look at this cast!  Not only are Aykroyd and Belushi at the helm, but there's talent like Matheson, Allen, Oates, Williams, Beatty, Gary (Roy Scheider's wife from the 'Jaws' films), Candy, Flaherty, Stack (in his first comedic turn before 'Airplane!'), Lee, Pickens, Deezen (a comic genius if ever there was one), Sperber and a whole herd of other I probably missed. All of them in the midst of the hugest battlefield of comic carnage ever seen.And no wonder.  '1941' was co-written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, Spielberg protogees who went on to further success with the 'Back to the Future' films, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', 'Used Cars', (all with climaxes as wild as the entire running time of '1941') and the vastly under-appreciated 'Death Becomes Her'.  Even John Milius (director/co-writer of 'Conan the Barbarian') lends his pen hand.  In the end, you'll be dazzled, breathless, stunned and amazed, but by no means bored.  And, with any luck, amused.'1941' - it was a very good year.Nine stars.  And don't worry: it's all for the good of the war effort.",9,97,141,15 September 1999
Dumb and Dumber," Carrey-d away....
","Did you ever get the feeling that sometimes an actor is so full of himself that he forgets the movie and kind of goes off on his own tangent, never to return?That's what I got from 'Dumb and Dumber', which basically features Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, two men who are good actors and have been in some of may favorite movies, acting like complete idiots and somehow never getting institutionalized for their actions.I know, I know....  There are people who love this movie and think that Carrey can do no wrong and since bodily function humor is the soup du jour (so to speak), 'Dumb' is their cup of tea (so to speak again).But in spite of some very inspired moments (an escalating fight in the snow between Daniels and Holly, the fantasy restaurant fight, the unfortunate demise of the hitman, the parakeet), there are more moments of just downright stupidity than anything else.  And the scenes with the cop (you know the one) and the out-of-order toilet just are put there, I think, to make ones jaw drop at how far movies will go nowadays.  There's no real humor in what's going on and, in spite of their big following as 'the biggest laugh scenes of all time', they kind of fall flat.  They happen then they're gone.As far as Carrey and Daniels, they basically just play two guys who act stupid and fail to use common sense.  No character traits, just stupidity. But as they say, give the people what they want....As we speak, there is a sequel in the works by the guys that created 'South Park'.  Well, I guess they won't have to worry about losing the original's sophistication.Two stars.  I almost forgot Carrey's and Holly's kiss.  Now THAT'S funny.",2,24,59,12 September 1999
Caddyshack," 'Animal House' with balls....
","Golf balls, that is.Granted, this one doesn't have Bluto, Flounder or Pinto.Does have a gopher, though.The plot's invariably the same: the haves against the have-nots.  But the war between the classes isn't the issue here.  It's laughs, and plenty of them, all served up on an eight iron on the main fairway.What fan of slob comedy doesn't know and love 'Caddyshack'?  The cast and crew knows what works and they milk it for all they can.  Knight's at his blustering best, Dangerfield in full dominance, Chase in all his SNL-dazed glory, Murray on a comedic tear throughout, a gopher just trying to get by. And then there's Danny Noonan (O'Keefe) who just wants to go to college and make something of himself, caddying in the meantime.I know people who can quote every scene of this film.  I'm not that far gone yet, but there are choice scenes all the way throughout.  Dangerfield's intro, the golf club dinner, the swimming pool scene, Chevy's Zen-assisted golf shots, the Bishop's game, the climactic golf contest.  There's plenty more, but space is limited.And through it all, the best cast you could ever hope for in this genre. Best gopher, too.If you haven't seen 'Caddyshack' and call yourself a connoisseur of this kind of film, you deserve to have Bill Murray practice for the Masters in your begonias.Nine stars.

Titanic," An antic, frantic 'Titanic'...
","No doubt that James Cameron's 'Titanic' is an epic story, told in grand fashion.  But let's get one thing straight right now.This is NOT a human interest piece.  This is a special effects piece.Look at all the Academy Awards it has won.  The majority of them in the technical arena, most logically.  If perhaps not the strongest in character motivation, Cameron is first and foremost a craftsman.  It's what he works best at (just look at the 'terminator' films).  Every detail is lovingly placed and arranged with a perfectionist's eye and hand.  And the final half of the film (which I'll get to) is a masterpiece in itself.But as far as characterization goes, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play their parts like good soldiers but are simply too shallow and unconvincing as the puppy-lovers caught up in the huge sweep of tragedy (a plot device as old as motion pictures themselves) to project much emotion or personality. Instead, they just walk around and say their lines as the rest of the movie goes on its merry way.Which is as it should be, I guess, as the movie does indeed have its own agenda and does its work very well, thank you.The final half of the movie is what everyone is interested in, anyway.  And Cameron and company acquit themselves very well as the Titanic slowly splits and sinks into the icy deep waters below.  Every single moment has its drama as the different passengers confront their mortality while the ship confronts its own.  Older couples comforting each other, parents holding their children tightly as the water rises around them, musicians valiantly playing hymns for the passengers, the doomed ship's designer calmly waiting by the fireplace as his creation collapses around him.  In this respect, 'Titanic' deserves every award and accolade it has received, even more so.  No one modern director has worked so hard and emphatically on a vision as Cameron has here.  But as far as the human effort, he is the modern-day Hitchcock: herding his cast cattle-like from scene to scene, positioning them just so to emphasize the FX.But just consider the FX, and you'll understand.In view of the sight of the Titanic itself, that earns ten easy stars.  But subtract four stars for failing to find one cast member or character as interesting as the ship itself (no, not even Gloria Stuart.  Sorry, Gloria).In all, six stars for 'Titanic'.  Fast forward to when the iceberg makes its appearance and you may enjoy it even more.",6,1,2,30 April 2000
The Waterboy," Washed out....
","I think I understand why so many people like Adam Sandler.In every movie of his that I have seen, he acts so immature, so mentally disabled and so antisocial, that people who think they have it bad just have to look at him and feel superior.I'll bet after they saw 'The Waterboy', they felt like they could have ruled the universe.  Sandler again plays a man/child who biggest asset is that he wasn't twins. As a lowly waterboy for a Southern football team, he is constantly harassed until something snaps and he starts tackling everybody in sight who picks on him.  Great; as if antisocial jerks need ANOTHER role model.I don't know what it is: Sandler has the same effect on me as fingernails on a chalkboard has on others.  Maybe it's that smug assurance he has that even if they just filmed him eating breakfast they could release it to theatres and make a bundle.  I'd prefer watching anyone scarf down their Froot Loops than watch this again.  It's an all-out assault on entertainment, talent, intelligence and proves once and for all that if it weren't for the plot line 'underdog proves himself and finds self-worth while winning the big game', half of all of Hollywood's films would not be.And as for Sandler....  Maybe if he makes enough money he'll retire at an early age and we'll never, ever have to see another one of these worthless self-worth 'movies' the rest of our lives.  So if that be the case, go see 'The Waterboy', give Adam Sandler all your money.  And hurry.No stars.",Null,2,4,9 November 1999
The Cannonball Run," What a pile-up....
","If you're looking for a movie loaded with cars, crashes, 1/8th of the Rat Pack, Adrienne Barbeau's best assets... oh yeah, and Burt Reynolds, look no further than 'The Cannonball Run'.It was a hit back in 1981 and no wonder: Burt was on top of his game and we were all young and naive back then.  Heck, I have a warm spot for all the rampant stupidity, myself.All the better that Roger Moore plays a deft parody of his own James Bond persona, complete with an Aston Martin.  If you've seen this film way back when, no doubt you remember it with some fondness.  Let's face it: it may not have been on par with films like 'The Gumball Rally' or even 'Death Race 2000', but in its own way and on its own terms, it works just fine.A word of sage advice: if you watch this film, skip 'Cannonball Run 2'. It'll only ruin your good memories of the first.  And if you didn't like the original, well....Five stars.  Plus one star extra for adding Jackie Chan for what adds up to mostly as a cameo as a karate-kicking racer.  And a half star more for Adrienne Barbeau's fancy work with a jump suit zipper.  Altogether, six and a half stars.Wish she would have made it a seven.",6,55,68,15 August 1999
Space Jam," We be 'Jam'min'...
","For the first time in his illustrious career, Michael 'Air' Jordan shares the court and the spotlight with some of the most intimidating players in basketball...most of which have fur and feathers.'Space Jam' melds real-life and cartoon-life as well as in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and with about the same result.  No one can say that they skimped on the FX, or the story - which yields some mighty big laughs.Seems that Looney Tune Land is under threat from aliens from an other-worldly amusement park and the only way Bugs, Daffy, Porky and Tweety can save themselves from intergalactic slavery is by challenging them to a basketball game.  But when the aliens in question acquire powers from Earth's best b-ball players (Ewing, Barkley, Bogues, etc.) and become Mon-Stars, Bugs and company acquire the newly-retired Jordan to help them get game.Jordan is comfortable in front of the camera, even when surrounded by cartoon characters and Bill Murray (!), so he proves he has even a future as a movie star, especially in movies like this.  And as if there were ever a doubt, Bugs Bunny shows he still has what it takes after all these years.I love this movie; I've always been a fan of animation and 'Space Jam' doesn't disappoint.  Every figure, shadow and shade of skin is perfect and shares screen time with real people so seamlessly that, sure, it looks real enough that we could be surprised that this kind of thing doesn't happen every day.Anyway, you have to love a movie where Murray's big entrance is heralded by someone shouting 'I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture!'Ten stars and a pair of Nikes for 'Space Jam'.  Now, how about a sequel with Joe Montana?",10,8,11,9 February 2000
Speed," 'Speed'-y delivery...
","Pop quiz, hot-shot - what's the most exciting action movie you've ever seen with a bus in it?Right, the answer is 'Speed' and if you've seen it then you'll have to agree that there is more action in this one movie than any ten generic action flicks that have been released in the last ten years.A trend-setter the likes of 'Die Hard', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Lethal Weapon', 'Speed''s premise is simple - a bus is wired by a madman (Dennis Hopper) to blow up if it drops below 50 MPH.  This is to give the cop (Keanu Reeves) who ruined his last effort a run for his money in trying to save the day.  In the ensuing efforts, a woman (Sandra Bullock) is recruited to drive the bus and keep it over 50 MPH at all times.And for as deceivingly simple as it is, 'Speed' pulls out all the stops by making every scene a nail-biter (the bomb discovery, Keanu getting aboard the bus, Sandra driving over an incomplete gap in a highway, etc. - the list is endless) and all the main characters (and a few of the supporting ones) are about as smart as your average movie-goer and have enough of these kinds of movies to figure out what the other guy's move will be and act on it.  I LOOOOVE movies like that.Keanu is far more heroic in this movie than he has been before (and since); Jeff Daniels is born to play best pal and does so with good-nature; Sandra is a delight to watch as well as hear - she has a voice you literally can wrap yourself up in; Hopper adds to his nutso roles with some droll lines that sound all the spicier delivered Hopper-style.  Everyone is great and gives their all.The movie is all one long action set-piece, which is what the action fan expects when they plunk down their money then sit down with their popcorn. They get their money's worth here and then some.  'Speed' was obviously written by someone who loves action films as much as the action film fans that watch them.  Good match-up.Nine stars for 'Speed', and let's hear it for the magic of surveillance cameras.",9,62,76,30 April 2000
The Matrix," The Computer Wore Ray-Bans....
","What is 'The Matrix'?  Lemme tell ya: 'The Matrix' is a vast computer network designed to kick butt and take names...oh, and to imprison all humanity - almost forgot that.  Did I mention what Keanu Reeves has to do with any of this?  No?  We'll get to him later, then.Well, conspiracy theorists, here's your ultimate sci-fi flick.  Seems we're all living a virtual reality lie and that this is really the future and we're all slaves to the Pentium gods.  In fact, the only thing that stands between us and total oblivion are a pack of rebel freedom fighters and a lone man who will one day destroy the evil....  Hmmm, does that sound familiar to anyone else?DUH!  'The Matrix' cobbles together a story-line from not only 'Star Wars' but also 'Alice in Wonderland', 'The Wizard of Oz', Zen philosophy, Kung-Fu chop-socky flicks, your choice of shoot-em-ups and one of any Oliver Stone movies where we're all living in a daze and there's sinister plots working to undermine our lives and make us all live a live (or in this case, a 'techno-lie').Reeves is Neo, the 'Chosen One' as he is sometimes called and must be brought from the 'real world' to help an underground resistance in a desolate world of the 'future' to train, re-learn and re-think himself in order to defeat the bad guys, save the good guys and (GASP!) find true love in the form of Trinity (Moss).Okay, plot mechanics aside, this is a movie you'll only be interested in for the FX and let me tell you, there are some good ones here.  You know those Gap commercials where people jump, freeze in mid-air then the camera rotates around them 180 degrees until they land?  That's what you'll see here, and those scenes are well-done.  In fact, a lot of the action here is invigorating and, truth be told, exciting.BUT, the Wachowski brothers tell a thin plot line that is just an excuse for their speical FX loop. And in it are some talented actors trying to stand out from the swirling and swooping scenery about them.  Of the group, Fishburne does best as Morpheus, the Obi-Wan to Reeves' Luke Skywalker. Fishburne teaches, philosophizes and drop-kicks with the best of them and is one of the more memorable characters in modern day film-making.
Reeves is pretty much ineffectual and (understandingly) bewildered by the goings-on, so doesn't have much of a chance to do any acting.  Moss plays tough all the way through (even when kissing Reeves!) and Pantoliano seems to be here as a token gesture, since he was in the Wachowski's 'Bound'.
The bad guys, though, are pretty effective, wearing dark glasses, neat business suits and locked jaws.  The main baddie, Agent Smith (Weaving), does most of the talking and threatening and suggests what Darth Vader would have been like in business wear.In the end, though, once all is said and done, you'll remember FX and gunfire and fight scenes and, maybe, think twice about touching a mirror again.  But not much else.  But if all you want is cool FX, look no further.Five stars for 'The Matrix', in terms of FX and story.
There are supposed to be sequels coming out for this movie later on.  I'll bet Oliver Stone will be first in line.",5,1,3,19 June 2000
The Wedding Singer," 'Sing'in' Sandler....
","I'm one of the few people in the world who seems blind to Adam Sandler's charms.In just about every movie he's been in, he comes across as a shallow, lazy, shiftless bum whose main purpose in life is to make everyone else's life miserable.The fact that I enjoyed 'The Wedding Singer' as much as I did has little to do with Sandler, though, and more to do with the milieu.Set long ago and far away in the mythic year 1985, Sandler plays the singer of the title, big hair and all, and finds himself falling for a cute waitress (Barrymore, and who can blame him?), who just happens to be engaged to a skirt-chasing lunkhead and is torn between declaring his love or being a good friend and keeping out of things and....Well, forget the plot.  The big drawing card is the setting of the flashy, materialistic, neon-bright world of the Gimmie Decade, as it is so quaintly called.  There are DeLoreans, Michael Jackson fashions, Miami Vice fashions, Madonna fashions, guys who look like the lead singer in Dead or Alive (an '80s band, you young punk), 'rad' linguistics...and, of course, the music.Ah, the music!  The last good decade for music this century.  Check out the soundtrack if you think I'm lying.  After the Fire, Kajagoogoo, Culture Club, Berlin - the bands may be gone but the music serves as an open reference point to the decade.  And it's good, too!  Even when Sandler sings, it's not as bad (in humor terms, not musical terms) as to be expected (at least it's not 'Opera Man: The Movie').Final verdict: good if you're a Sandler fan, better if you're an '80s fan. 
Seven stars and a sequined white glove for 'The Wedding Singer'.  Bring back the '80s, man!",7,0,1,15 September 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," You call this archaeology? Sure do!
","One thing you gotta say for this series: it isn't boring.And 'Last Crusade' has enough thrills, chills and spills to fill up a few dozen old Saturday afternoon serials.  Right down the line, everything about this film is superb.  Ford and Connery do the father and son routine superbly.  Rhys-Davies returns as Sallah, as does Elliott who plays Brody with as much befuddlement as Connery does his role.  And who can blame him? And the FX: there's so many you lose count.  But don't bother, just sit back, relax and get swept up in the moment.  You can't help yourself but to get into this 'Crusade'.Ten stars.  A classic Ford with a bright Sean.",10,149,187,19 August 1999
Beetlejuice," Save this guy for later....
","For prime Time Burton at his best, check out 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure'.  But for big laughs, 'Beetlejuice' scares 'em up.Yeah, I know; cute ghost joke.Keaton is a wonder: strutting around, cracking wise, possessing here and there, cackling like a maniac.  He's the whole show, by and large.Yet, the others acquit themselves nicely.  Jeffrey Jones, Alec Baldwin, Catherine O'Hara, Winona Ryder, Glenn Shadix, Geena Davis....Geena Davis.  Man, she's one cute little spirit, isn't she? Sighhhhh....Ooh, forgive me.  Where was I?  Oh yes: 'Beetlejuice'.  Great special effects, terrific Keaton, good early Tim Burton.  And if you have a soft spot for Geena, you're golden.Eight stars.  Go ahead, make my millenium.",8,1,2,18 August 1999
