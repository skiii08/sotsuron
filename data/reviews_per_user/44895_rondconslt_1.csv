The Blair Witch Project," Unique and excellent
","I thoroughly enjoyed this engrossing film. The concept of a 'found' video (making it a pseudo-documentary) is unique and sets the pace. This film takes you in and makes you feel like you are there. The film is full of subtle horror, leaving much to your imagination. This is a radical departure from the usual horror flick, in which blood, gore, and other literal imagery are used to provide all of the shock factor. As such, I believe it's more of a 'thinking man's' horror film that may not appeal to everyone. I highly recommend it.",Null,0,1,5 August 2004
