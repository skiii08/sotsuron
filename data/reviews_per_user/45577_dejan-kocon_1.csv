Hereditary," Just a horrendous experience
","Immagine yourself wanting to see a good horror movie, and you see the trailer of this one and decide you are going for it... That's what me and my missis did... Average working class 34 year olds wanting to have fun on a rainy afternoon with a horror flick.This isn't one for those occasions. Psychological nightmare at its worst, nothing makes sense, not even the things hapening at the end. Like nothing.You just expect there to be a massive ending with some great huge something and you end up with a 'Why did I go and watch this' feeling.PLEASE if you like to torture yourself, go ahead, otherwise stay away from it. You'll be thanking me later :)",2,4,9,26 August 2018
