It," Brilliant
","Well shot and well formed script. Bill Skarsgard did a fantastic job as Pennywise. You'll float too scene was just brilliant, as was the opening scene with Georgie. The reality of IT being dependant on the children's belief and fear of IT taps into what we know as reality. I thought this film was fantastic. I did think the film could have been creepier and even darker, but maybe Chapter Two will dive beyond the abyss.Overall I would say definitely see this film if you are a fan of the Tim Curry version or a general horror film fan.",8,3,5,19 September 2017
