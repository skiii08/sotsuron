Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An excellent display of special effects.
","I had to wait in line 2 days to see the movie on the 19th, the 12:01 a.m. show, and it was all worth it, the effects are amazing and the sound is terrific, the plot is not that great, but it's interesting enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Kudos to the race scene of Anakin and extra-kudos to the fighting scene of Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi",8,0,0,19 May 1999
