The Rock," Action speaks louder than.......well, everything.
","Need a guide on how to make the perfect action film? Here it is. The Rock has everything.A big round of applause for Michael Bay on his direction that redefines the term 'kinetic'; Jonathan Hensleigh for an action-packed story with a few neat twists; Hans Zimmer and crew for a truly thumping music score; Sean and Nicholas for being two cool good guys and Ed for being a believably human bad guy; and finally, Jerry Bruckheimer for bringing the whole thing together.Truly, the best action film.  Ever.",10,1,1,23 November 1998
Pearl Harbor," Titanigeddon
","Before seeing this film it is important to note the following:1. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer 2. Directed by Michael BayConclusion: Expect a high concept storyline, a script laden with testosterone, stunning visuals edited within an inch of their life, a rousing soundtrack (preferably by Hans Zimmer), a bit of humour, a bit of sadness, and a HUGE amount of 'God bless America'.With this in mind, and with all expectations of a thought-provoking, 'sensible' film thrown away, Pearl Harbor is the ultimate summer popcorn movie.  Clearly, not everyone likes this type of film, and if your enjoyment of a film depends on the script and the quality of acting then this film could quite possibly make you ill.  I think it's reasonable to say that if you didn't like Armageddon, you'll hate this.  That's not to say that fans of Armageddon will necessarily like this as much.In Armageddon, Bay had 2 1/2 hours to try and fit in as much action as possible and the tone was decidedly tongue in cheek.  With Pearl Harbor, Bay and Bruckheimer have tried to go more serious by following the Titanic-approach of a doomed love-story.  While this does produce a more emotional ending, it comes at the price of action and pacing.  The first hour deals mostly with romance and really could have been cut down a bit. We get some relief with the English/German dogfight sequences which are the first suggestion that we are going to witness something truly breathtaking later.  In fact, though this first hour and a half feel slow and tedious at times, this makes the Pearl Harbor attack all the more exciting by contrast.The 35 minute attack is incredible with Bay's kinetic action style finally given a chance to shine.  There are similarities in technique to Saving Private Ryan but so what.  There are more than enough highly-original shots to compensate for the seen-it-before stuff.After the attack, the film never slows down again, since it tones down the romantic plot and concentrates on the more traditional Bruckheimer 'let's kick the bad guys' asses' plot.  Consequently, the film becomes decidedly more Armageddon-y with numerous rousing speeches, heroic slow-motions, tough training for a dangerous mission, and an upbeat ending tinged with tragedy before the credits role accompanied by a cheesy, charts-friendly, love anthem.Ideally, the love story could have been shortened at the start because Bay is an action director and romance has never been a strong point in Bruckheimer films.  In fact, like the Rock and Armageddon, it is the male bonding that produces the more powerful emotional connection.Pearl Harbor is at the top of its genre - big, loud and, assuming you can switch your brain off, very emotionally powerful.  It is not a Titanic, it is not a Saving Private Ryan and to compare it to such films is unfair to the intentions of the film-makers.  It is an action film and Michael Bay has yet again proved that in this field of visual entertainment, he is the best of the best.",10,15,33,1 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," If you can adjust to the style, it's awesome.
","Clearly many viewers disliked this movie.  Passionately.  Chances are the same people hated Armageddon.  Passionately.  Michael Bay has a distinctive style which produces powerful reactions - either you go with it and enjoy the rollercoaster ride, or it doesn't work for you and his style comes across as shallow and painfully cheesy.  IF you let yourself dumb down and take in the visuals instead of expecting a war movie in a similar vein to all the other recent attempts, you should find huge enjoyment in the film. Indeed, it was the second highest grossing film of 2001 behind Shrek which suggests it can't have been hated by everyone.Personally, I think expectations were too high with people looking for another Titanic/Saving Private Ryan.  The first hour is admittedly a little slow, but this is the price for the BEST 45 mins of action ever put to screen.  This is the only film I've ever seen where the CGI is almost always indistinguishable from the real stuff.  Somehow Lord of the Rings won the Visual Effects oscar instead, despite having some fairly poor effects at times.  The hour of light-weight romantic build up gives the battle scene greater power by having such a strong contrast between the frivolous love story and such a momentous historical tragedy - especially in the recent Director's Cut which restores all the battle violence that was originally trimmed for the necessary PG-13 Theatrical rating.The last part of the film was heavily criticised for it's apparent ridiculousness and what looks like a heavily contrived upbeat conclusion. However, the Doolittle raid is portrayed fairly accurately (most of Alec Baldwin's dialogue is a word-for-word copy of Doolittle's actual speeches). As far as the nastier details of the campaign are concerned (e.g. Japanese treatment of captured pilots), financial pressure from the Japanese market forced some omissions.  As far as the somewhat contrived love story is concerned - blame Disney.  They only agreed to put up the huge budget on the condition that a love story was included.Basically, if you go with the cheese, the film is immensely powerful and entertaining.  If you are just too cynical, or unable to enjoy 'dumber' films, then there is little chance of making it through the entire film without vomiting.Bay's style, like Tony Scott or John Woo, is highly distinctive and quite probably an indication of the style that will become more popular over the next few years as audience intelligence and attention spans continue to decrease.  Perhaps then, Pearl Harbor will be more appreciated.  Currently it is simply too uncomfortable a mix of Bruckheimer dumb action/romance and serious war film for most people. Those of you who haven't seen it, try the Director's Cut - you might like it.",10,1,4,22 July 2002
Where Eagles Dare," marvellous.
",It's unbelievable to think this was made back in 1969. Purely in terms of action this is still superior to many modern films of the genre.  The story is spot-on for a wartime adventure and is 'unlikely' in places but in the same way that Bond films are.  The fantastic music is perfectly suited to the material and gives the film a superb action/tension atmosphere.Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood - cool is not the word.This is not one of those war films that is still enjoyable for nostalgic reasons - it really is top-notch.Broadsword calling Danny-Boy...,9,1,1,6 May 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Incredible, as long as you've read the book...
","After many years spent directing mediocre/awful films, Chris Columbus has finally found his fated place in cinema.  'Harry Potter...' (thankfully) bears little resemblance to Home Alone but is far more reminiscent of the wonderful mid-80s years when Columbus was writing the likes of 'The Goonies', 'Gremlins' and 'Young Sherlock Holmes' while Spielberg produced them.  Like these older films, 'Harry Potter...' isn't condescending to the younger audience both in its material (scary moments and violence) and its length.Columbus and Kloves clearly made the (correct) assumption that most children who see the film will have read the book.  With that in mind, they manage to cover a huge amount in the 2 1/2 hours that could well leave new-comers in the dark.  Even at this length, however, there is still a good deal missing from the film, most noticeably Peeves the Poltergeist who was cut out at the last minute.  Personally, I feel that the film could have spent a further 10 or 15 minutes showing more of the everyday life of Hogwarts covering more lesson time thus allowing for more animosity to develop between Malfoy and Harry, and between Ron and Hermione before the troll incident.  With any luck, the DVD might provide us with some of the missing material.Overall, the film has shown the potential for an incredible series which, at least for the younger viewers of today, could certainly rival the Star Wars series.  Indeed 2002 is set to stage an epic battle of sequels - Star Wars II Vs Harry Potter 2 (as well as Lord of the Rings 2).  Judging by the Phantom Menace, 'Chamber of Secrets' is looking far more promising than 'Attack of the Clones'...",10,0,0,9 December 2001
Army of Darkness," 'Hail to the King, Baby' or 'I slept too long!' ?
","Army of Darkness brings the Evil Dead Trilogy to a close (for now at least) with the funniest instalment.  Evil Dead was horror with comedy, Evil Dead 2 was comedy with horror, but Army of Darkness is comedy with fantasy.  As Sam Raimi admits, it's less a homage to horror films but more to the old Ray Harryhausen classics like Sinbad or 'Jason and the Argonauts' (most obviously the army of skeletons).There are numerous different versions of the film, each with their own good points, although the recent Director's Cut release is the one Sam Raimi considers to be the most complete.  This has 15 minutes extra footage beyond the American Universal release, including the original ending.  Here in England, the original release was far closer to this new Director's Cut, though there are welcome additions.  Most noticably, the battle with the 'army of darkness' is much longer and features some amusing fight scenes which were previously cut for running time.  The longer version also fills in a number of plot holes and, as Raimi points out, sorts out many of the continuity errors.Opinion is generally divided on the subject of the ending.  The original American release featured a re-shot ending where Ash, back in the present, fights an evil-dead-hag in a shopping mall before finishing with the famous 'Hail to the king, baby'.  This is much funnier than the official ending and it's a shame it's not included as an extra on the Director's Cut.  However, it's easy to see why Raimi and Campbell prefer the original, 'downbeat' ending.  It fits the tone of the film better, and bears closer relation to Evil Dead 2 by ending on a cliffhanger.  It also has more interesting implications about what could happen in a sequel, should one ever be made. The one complaint I have about the Director's Cut is the replacement of the legendary line, 'Good, Bad.  I'm the guy with the gun', with the international version's 'I ain't that good'.Personally, I think newcomers to the series might be better off seeing the 80 minute version (or perhaps the international version) first, but those who've seen the first two films should stick with the more complete and more satisfying 96 minute Director's Cut.",10,1,1,26 October 2000
Evil Dead II," Groovy!
","This film is the PERFECT mixture of horror and comedy. Evil Dead was scary, Army of Darkness was funny, this is the best of the trilogy. Raimi re-tells a more simplified version of the Evil Dead in the first five minutes which allows him to blast straight into the action with Ash getting possessed. It's uphill from here.The effects are higher budget this time but not TOO high budget as was the case in Army of Darkness. Many of the scenes are remakes from the first but likewise many new scenes are copied in Army of Darkness (eg.Chainsaw arm/metal hand). You really don't need to have seen Evil Dead (though it helps) but you MUST see this before Army of Darkness, otherwise many gags in the latter will be missed.Get your friends round, crack open some beers, crank up the volume and watch this and Army of Darkness for the most entertaining night of your life.",Null,0,0,28 October 1998
