Black Swan," Black Swan
","Black swan is the most beautiful and interesting film of the year from a genius as Derren Aronofsky.Nina Sayers is a young professional dancer in the New York city ballet company that dreams to become the prime ballerina in the new production of the Swan lake by the artistic director Leroy(Vincent Cassel).She has an obsessive mother,Erica(Barbara Hershey), that makes her life somewhat complicated as she is driven by jealousy towards her daughter. After the former prime dancer Beth Macintyre(Winona Ryder) is forced to retire by Leroy,Nina successfully is cast as Odette,the swan queen.But a mysterious new dancer Lily(Mila Kunis)becomes her most dangerous rival.Darren Aronovsky is a master. One of the greatest director out there.His direction is visionary and everything but ordinary.The pace of the film is really engaging and the script has truly original aspects.The movie has really absorbing moments as the transformation of Nina in the Black swan and her desperation that it is difficult to not be drawn.The depiction of her obsession for the perfection and increasing mental disorder is quite fascinating.The soundtrack is outstanding although it's not original but it's taken from the musical.But it adds to the general beauty of the film and express the characters feeling and the roles they have in the story. Natalie Portman,in her first adult role,excels as the leading character.This is her most complex role and she is exceptional and her first great turn after Closer.Her Oscar Award was completely deserved. Mila Kunis is adequate to the role,but honestly I didn't catch all the praises she gained for her performance.Her role is the easiest and she is an average actress. Vincent Cassel plays 'extremely' well the same character(that is inspired by his own personality)in every movie.That's all.And not too much I have to say. Barbara Hershey is truly a gem and she deserved more recognition for her complex role ,she is never over the top although her role could have been played with exaggeration.She is a really great actress.She should have been nominated for an Oscar. Winona Ryder,in her brief role as the fallen prime dancer,was a scene stealer.In only three scenes she is haunting,damned, desperate,intoxicated and angry and was truly mesmerizing.My vote is 10/10",8,0,1,12 August 2011
Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette
","There is such a misconception about the so called flop of Marie Antoinette. Although the movie divided critics ,the major critic reviews were favorable if not very good or even enthusiastic.I am among the enthusiastic ones. First because I know very well the story of M.A. and how it is difficult to interpret her story without being wrong. What Coppola did was to portray a sympathetic portrait of a woman forced to be queen without any help by her mother, husband or courtesans.Coppola brilliantly succeeds to evoke the real situation of that 14 years old girl,who was all alone. Poltics is left out but we are in the world of M.A. I appreciate very much that Coppola didn't want to film the revolution period because if you want to understand the point of view of M.A. you have to forget that she was executed. Coppola is more interested to examine the woman rather than the Queen and her personal feelings towards the entire situation. Besides, we have to remember that this is a movie,not an historical account. The movie is loosely inspired by the book of Antonia Fraser. I believe that Coppola is a very outstanding director. Kirsten Dunst was simply perfect and,in my opinion,deserved more recognition than what she had. She gave a very honest and moving performance.She was fantastic as the naive,spoiled,sensitive,frivolous and unaware Queen. But this is only one of the many sides of that woman. Coppola didn't show us the other aspects of the Queen because she has other purpose that is humanizing the despised and misunderstood Queen of France. There is not her political side , her faults and her disadvantages .It's the private side that only few people knew and not her public side. The supporting cast is appropriate as well. To me the movie was very snubbed by the Academy since I believe that it should have been nominated for best director and best actress.The movie was never meant to be an in depth biography.It could not be a substitute of a book .Coppola portrayed the elements of her story that fit to her trilogy of films(Lost in translation and The virgin suicides). But I think that the main problem is that someone doesn't like Coppola style.A very underrated great director.",8,1,2,5 December 2010
Revolutionary Road," Revolutionary Road
","'Revolutionary Road' is a brilliant ,engaging and a devastating movie(with a great direction) ,near to perfection, from one of the most original and amazing director(Sam Mendes).It is based on a beautiful and touching book from Richard Yates. What I found interesting is the portrayal of the broken dreams of Frank(Leonardo Dicaprio in an under-appreciated stellar performance)and April(a terrific performance by Kate Winslet)and their struggles. Of course,there are not totally positive or negative characters(although April can be cruel in a way that Frank can't be)but overall I believe that both of them are simply too selfish to admit clearly what's wrong with them.The story is a clever example of people that are not capable to live a seemingly wealthy existence, in particularly April who shows ominous signs of mental illness. Sam Mendes is one of the best director.His movies are honest and occasionally shocking. He's not afraid to bare the souls of the characters he describes.The script is truly great and allows the actors to display their abilities.For his terrific performance Leonardo DiCaprio was not even considered for a Best Actor nomination which I consider a real shame since the role is very demanding and he completely disappears inside it.Kate Winslet shows once again why she is one of the best actress of her generation and she wasn't nominated for an Oscar just because she was up for that award with another great performance in The reader.The supporting cast adds very much to the general beauty of the movie.Michael Shannon and Kathy Bates are just priceless. The picture deserved an Oscar nominations for Best movie and Best director given the polished work Mendes did,one of the most daring and competent director we have.My vote is 8/10.",8,0,0,29 January 2011
The Reader," The Reader
","'The reader' is one of the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Michael is a 15 years old student who meet a mysterious woman,Hanna, older than him.They begin a secret affair. Hanna likes to be read aloud while Michael discovers his sexuality as Hanna teaches him how to approach. But Hanna mysteriously disappears. He encounters his lover many years later on trial for Nazi crime charges. The difference of age between Hanna (can she be considered pedophile?) and Michael is an original metaphor to describe the different generations-the former that witnessed the Nazis committing terrible persecution towards the Jews and did nothing to prevent it and ,in many cases, supported actively their actions;the latter that had to relate with this crucial,yet difficult to accept,period. Plus,it is not a traumatizing turn to discover that a person you loved is not only a former Nazi guard but she played an active role by killing innocent people like did Hanna?Hanna is manipulative but with Michael she becomes more human-a humanity she never had. The secret Hanna holds is not only her active part in a crime but the shame of being illiterate which she considers the worst.So an education can make a person wiser and change the course of his life?But although she is perfectly aware to take part of a brutal massacre she could not be seen as a supporter of the Nazi propaganda because she has not political ideology being herself an illiterate woman. The movie stimulates all those questions and manages to depict all of them with a good sense of balance,in the typical delicate but yet competent way of Stephen Daldry. He avoids exaggerations leaving the single person to develop his own point of view.The direction was really marvelous , a proof of Daldry's abilities. The actors play extremely well.Kate Winslet is mesmerizing as always and shows abilities never seen before and her Oscar award for Best Actress is completely deserved.She gave a devastating performance as a former Nazi guard and her face communicates the illogical and cold mind of the illiterate woman.David Kross is truly fantastic, a revelation.He should have been nominated as well. Ralph Fiennes is good (but for the given screen time not so impressive like Winslet and Kross).The supporting cast(Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz)is excellent. The pace of the movie is quite slow.Simply one of the best of the year.My vote is 8/10 .",8,0,0,30 January 2011
