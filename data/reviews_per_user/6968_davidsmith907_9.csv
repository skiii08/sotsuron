The Expendables 2," Good Fun Happy Costumer
",This is what action films are..and should be always. Fun...loud...insane...simple All the actors were great..did not take it seriously and poked fun at themselves and each other.The banter between them all was hilarious. The gore spot on...not too much just rightStallone please make the 3rd expendables with more bad guys. My only negative about the first 2 films was the bad guys are overshadowed with all the mega star good guys. I'm sure you could get some big names to be the bad boys in the next movie.Anyway great fun action film,8,1,2,24 January 2013
World War Z," World War Zzzzzz
","I was going to write a long detailed review but after reading a few of the other low scoring reviews they pretty much nailed it.The zombies were terrible.The pg13 rating for a horror/action film doesn't work..not ever!The characters were cardboard and really couldn't care less who lived or died and that's including Brad Pitt.The Ending.. last 40mins of complete and utter boredom.I heard they had another alternative ending which was in Moscow and was all action but they chose to switch to wales and give the audience a break from the action scenes. Well whoever decided that needs to be fed to a group of zombies because that pretty much was finished off this already suffering movie. Believe me the only little, small, tiny good thing about this film was the action scenes and giving the audience time to think and realise they're actually watching rubbish before the credits rolled was mega dumb. If your cooking up a crap fest movie fill it with action and then more action right up to the end credits, no pauses no breaks just all action that way people will look back and go 'yeah story, acting all sucked but at least the action was good.' So yeah if this film ever appears on TV I'll watch 3/4's of it then switch over. Another film to add to the list of films that could have been good.",4,5,10,15 October 2013
Interstellar," Extremely low score to bring balance to the over hype.
","This film is dull and boring and well just forgettable. I imagine by the time I finish this review I will have forgotten most of the film. I will never see it twice. Even people that enjoyed it I would wager they don't rush for a second viewing. Probably most likely only sit through it a second time after 20 years forgetting they'd even seen it. Most talked about the visuals and the sounds. like all Nolan's movies it's big bass and looks good on the eye but unlike Inception this is overly indulgent complicated for the sake of it. The main story behind all the space talk is basically would you spend a life time with your family or give that up and save mankind's race? Answer screw mankind. In the film it's save mankind. As always Hollywood think's humans have a moral compass and we'd all give up our kids for the good of the race. We as humans would not. I would not and proud to say it. My kids come first before all of mankind. Anyone that thinks differently either doesn't have kids or is lying to themselves. And when a movie shows this , I straight away think this main character just left his family behind..what an ass. The film would have been a lot better if it just became what was the only interesting part of it. Rescuing astronauts on new planets. Those parts was the only time I thought cool new planet with stranded person on it this should be interesting. And we got 2 planets and 1 person (Matt Damon) What a pity. Damon was the only person that actually brought the film alive and then he was gone.Damn. Could go through all the space mumble jumble but really can't be bothered. It's duller than watching grass grow. I Like Nolan sometimes but sometimes he goes too far and loses his way(The Dark Knight Rises springs too mind). This film gets way too much credit from loyal fans of his, its up there with his worst movies he's made and I hope he knows it. It's the only way he'l return to making great ones if he see's his mistakes. So to sum up. Dull boring story/way overly complicated/characters no one cares about and by the end your left thinking damn I just lost all that time out of my life and there's no way to bend time to get it back.",1,7,12,24 December 2015
Pacific Rim," Delivers what it says on the tin
","Look this film is what it says it is.Monsters vs Robots If your looking for more substance and story and Oscar winning acting then you clearly haven't thought it through.Its Ironman and Transformers and Godzilla and a dash of Topgun to make this cocktail called Pacific Rim.Its also what the new recent Godzilla movie should have been.Shame on them, what a mess that was.This is old school action with good CGI thats worth taking your kids to see or sitting on a Saturday night with the family and a big bag of popcorn watching on DVD. There's no need to talk about story and possible loop holes, I enjoyed it for what it was worth. If you can sit and switch your mind to innocent fun mode you'l enjoy this film.",8,0,2,2 July 2015
Man of Steel," Marmite Movie
","Can't decide if I kind of enjoyed this or really disliked it.I am a massive Christopher Reeve Superman fan. Growing up watching those films, Superman was a man that was funny(Clark Kent always made me laugh) and he defeated the bad guys with his powers but more importantly he out smarted them and oh the big point he didn't kill anyone. At the very least he took the fight away from innocent bystanders (get back to that later).The whole opening to this film is massive and way too long, it's all with superman's parents and the dying planet of Krypton which becomes like Avatar with Russell Crowe jumping on and off flying insects(yes its that mental)..After 10 minutes I was sitting thinking come on get to Superman already. Also I should mention that the opening sequence completely ruins the credibility of General Zod as the bad guy. Hes the guy that's in charge of the Planets Army and Superman's dad(Russell Crowe) is a scientist but in a 1V1 hand to hand fight Russell Crowe kicks his ass!! General Zod hang your head in shame..tut tut..that instantly makes me go 'meh here's the bad guy woo pee do' every time he appeared on screen. Regarding the bad guys, credit is due to Faora- Ul played by Antje Traue, she was interesting and well enjoyable to watch in all her scenes.This Film took a different look at Superman, He's floating between jobs and has no real purpose in life. The plot has him stumble onto his parents spacecraft which is badly written and yes there's spacecraft in this film..a lot of spacecraft(madness really). There's plot holes galore mostly with Lois Lane involved..think it was the only way they could keep her in the film by throwing sense out the window. There's also a shocking scene where Superman watches Jonathan Kent die when he could have saved him..that's beyond mental. The very essence of Superman is that no one die's,NO-ONE..not even the bad guy..he wouldn't allow it. There's a few times things like that happen where your sitting thinking ''what's the body count up to now?'' The fight scene with Superman against 2 super bad guys in the town with planes shooting at them with guns and bombs then crashing into the street...people hiding in wooden shops would surely get hurt. Then the final battle between Zod and Superman has half a city blown up and buildings dropping on people and not once does Superman try to take the fight away or save people mid battle. And the craziest scene I've ever witnessed has Superman snap a guys neck!!! That's so not cool..HE JUST WOULDN'T DO THAT EVER.So yeah I liked the different way this was told about him lost on Earth with no purpose as of yet but there was a lot of bad things too (killing,spaceships,flying bugs,killing,no humour,Way too much CGI(even Michael Bay would be jealous) and oh yeah killing).I would have probably rated this lower if I wasn't such a fan of Superman..clouded my judgement slightly.All in all this was poor though :(If you want a Avatar/Transformers/Matrix mix then yeah you may like this.",5,0,1,19 July 2015
The Revenant," Yet another over hyped let down
","Leo DiCaprio is being suggested for an Oscar for this film.No idea why.This film starts well...the attack on the camp by native American's is brutal and realistic then there's the Leo versus the bear scene which is great. Most interesting factor in the movie is the relationship between Leo and his son but that was cut short when bad guy of the movie Tom Hardy kills his son to force the plot pretty early in the film. Then Leo spends 75% (maybe more) crawling around injured with his throat damaged which means nearly zero dialogue from his character. So we're left with Tom Hardy to carry the film and story verbally. Which is never a good idea since in most movies he's in majority of people can't understand a word he says half the time.There's little action in the second half, mainly just a forced Leo versus hardy finale which is nothing special.This movie is insanely over-hyped and will go on the pile of films that won't be watched twice.Leo DiCaprio if you do get an Oscar be sure to realize it wasn't for this film but something you did earlier in your career.",6,2,4,9 February 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," Gutted!!! Nolan I'm Gutted
","Lets start by saying I'm a massive fan of the first 2 movies, Think The Dark Knight is in my top 5 of all time.OK but this was not good, not good at all :( I can only think that they hit such a height with the second film that without heath ledger to continue on that they were left stranded and somehow came out with this pile of crap.When I say crap I mean crap. No joke this is bad filming making and writing, the fight scenes terrible the bad guys weak and group of goodies boring. Hell at the end I wanted them all to perish and I mean them all..good and bad guys.Heh Nolan if the bad guys kill thousands of civilians the audience doesn't care...if the good guys kill thousands of henchmen the audience doesn't care...bad guy kills a main good guy like for example the joker kills Rachel remember the audience goes WOOOOOOOO, In this film there was 2 main bad guys and they killed No one!!! Bane killed his own men more than anyone else!! like I care if he kills his own guys. If he popped lets say Catwoman now that would have been great because Anne Hathaway sucked at being cat-woman, really shocking casting there , not sexy like cat-woman is suppose to be also a figure of a twig and couldn't punch her way out of a wet paper bag but here she is beating up thugs left/right centre no problem..what a joke, Nolan think Kate Beckinsale in Underworld thats what Catwoman is suppose to be like dumb-ass. Holding the city hostage for 5 months!!! what!!!? Batman spine heals and he has a Rocky workout in a cell consisting of push-ups then climbs to freedom and defeats Bane in a fist fight??? WHAT!!!??? Main bad guy revealed and this clown kills.....no one ..noone anyone cares about so no real evilness or fear or well no real need to actually be in the film to be honest, could be edited completely out and make no difference to anything. And how many star named good guys do we need and why do they all live??? I mean hell kill some of them off, it would have helped make the bad guys more em bad. Did Morgan freeman require to survive?? Did Micheal Caine? Did Gary old-man? Did Joseph Gordon-Levitt? Did Anne Hathaway? no the answer is ..its the final film remember .. you could have made the the bad guys so great by losing star names throughout the film but no you bottled it. So we ended up with limp bad guys and overloaded amount of good guys(hell the city's entire police force was underground and there was still too many goodies running around the streets) I don't know why you wrote this or what happened in the making ..can only guess you ran out of ideas and should have shelved it but were pressured into spewing something out your ass.For me Batman was tough and mainly clever and used his mind and brawn combined with gadgets to out wit his enemies..this did-not happen in this film at all. So sad so sad.... I'll wait a few months then watch the second one again and try to forget this crap. *sigh* why is it when great movies or books are made the guys that create them are shocking at finishing them???????????",5,2,6,23 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Something something Remake something
","OK..I have given this a high score and it should be less but damn I loved it.I'm a big fan of the original star wars films (episodes 4/5/6) and absolutely hated episodes 1/2/3, er ma gawd they were terrible. Shame on you Lucas SHAME!! Now that being said I went into this movie hoping for an improvement to the devastation that we previously got hit with. I was not disappointed.Star Wars The Force Awakens is A New Hope remake. There's no getting away from that. Its Episode 4 redone all over. Which is the main bad point about the film. So story wise you can see whats coming, there isn't any real surprises. The thing is it's a remake that is extremely well done. It's done so well in every area. It is nostalgia overload too which I enjoyed. Goosebumps galore.The cast were great, the new characters are great actors and highly likable. Within minutes you care about them and enjoy they're scenes (special mention to Oscar Isaac,probably the coolest pilot in the galaxy, want more of him in the next 2 please) Also a female heroine is a welcome change to 6 movies with male jedi/sith fighting it out (Loved Daisy Ridley). And John Boyega is the new Han which is something of a title to pick up but he did amazing. The old favourites were excellent, Harrison Ford stole the movie with chewy.Only negative I have about the cast is the bad guys really. Snoke was CGI and that sucked by the way. CGI always sucks. Heh Hollywood listen up CGI SUCKS! like watching a cartoon. Emperor was far superior in every scene even back in those rubbish episodes 1/2/3 (looking at you Lucas! SHAME!!) Kylo Ren was decent..liked his temper tantrums. Was compared to what Anakin Skywalker should have been but sadly we got Hayden Christensen's version which was really poor. Captain Phasma I can only guess will appear in future movies and play a more important part(fingers crossed). Also should mention the comedy in this film happened at the right times and was delivered perfectly..No cheese allowed. Well done J.J.Abrams, you showed Lucas how to do comedy (bloody Jar jar Binks, what were you thinking Lucas?! SHAME!!)Look go see this film for an enjoyable Sci-Fi walk down memory lane. You go in with the right frame of mind and you'l walk out happy that you went.And remember this..It's miles way better than episodes 1/2/3 SHAME ON YOU LUCAS SHAME!!!!!",8,19,56,22 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max Ruined.
","Start by saying I'm a fan of the original trilogy of Mad Max films.So I went in to watch this with eager eyes but sadly by the end my neck was sore from shaking it so much.Just terrible on all aspects, Plot/dialogue/CGI/action/soundtrack so so bad.Put it this way they could have made the entire film and removed Mad Max's character and still ended up with the same film.His part in the film wasn't even the lead. Charlize Theron could have solo'd it with out Max which is not the worst thing I can think of to say about the story writer for this mess. Suppose to be a Mad Max film but Tom Hardy had no chance with this script. How many lines did he even have? No character to connect with. Nothing to make me accept him as replacement for Mel Gibsons version. Charlize Therons character had it all, story and purpose but Hardys was basically a passenger along for the ride. The whole concept of them escaping then actually escape to then u- turn back for a suicide mission so we can have a action packed ending is beyond crap writing. The dialogue was terrible, an example would be poor giant Nathan Jones telling me 3 times that they're trying to use the sand storm to lose them..yeah yeah we get it, big storm coming and they're driving towards it, hmmm wonder whats going on here d'uh, no need to help Sherlock...why does Hollywood writers insist on spelling things out unless they accept that the only people that enjoy this stuff are out they're minds on drugs (like the writers clearly)Action in this mess, well yeah the vehicles were inventive I'll give them that but there's only so much of them blowing up you can take before you become immune and start going ''oh yeah there goes another one *yawn'' It's way too repetitive. Especially in a 2 hour movie which is 3/4's blowing car/trucks/bikes/buggy's up.Soundtrack was well laughable..some of the scenes where they're trying and failing to set some sense of mood and this music playing hahaha..it was bad, I struggle to even describe it, what were they thinking...like they realised there was no story or connection to the actors so they turned the melodramatic sounds up to 11..I have no idea. The mad guitar guy on the truck was fun though, abit over the top but yeah he was good.Bad guy, the main Bad dude was erm no idea..no idea why he was in charge, no idea why he wore a mask, no idea what the hell was going on with him, just no idea. oh and his ending was meh ...forgettable.I generally like post apocalypse type of movies, there's been a load made but this is one of the worst. B movies are made better..straight to TV do better.This has been way too over hyped and people want to like it so they walk out going ''yeah that was proper crazy..loved it'' but really deep down they'l forget it and probably not watch it again.I disliked it so much that if I was offered money to sit through it again I would struggle to accept the cash.Its a case of what could have been sadly..script terrible + story terrible = shite movie.",1,35,71,30 June 2015
