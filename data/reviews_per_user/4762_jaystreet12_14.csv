The Hangover," hang in there
",this movie had me laughing from beginning to end. there were some really funny moments such as: when the naked Chinese man jumped out of the trunk and beat them up. i really liked that mike tyson was involved in the movie. since they stole his tiger. i didn't understand that when they were drunk the tiger came easily but later when they took it back it wasn't. i also loved the ending. it was possibly the best comedy ending i ever saw. when they showed the pictures from the night before. when this movie comes out on DVD i will definitely buy it unrated. i want to watch it over and over. also all the actors did amazing. they were definitely the ones for a hangover. waiting for the hangover 2.,9,1,3,22 June 2009
Underworld," what the werewolf
",this movie was one of those films that needed more gunfire. it had a decent amount of gunfire but i need more. my friend was the one who talked me into seeing the movie. before that i thought that it was kinda a boring film. but after that talk i watched it. i do not regret it. kate beckinsale was a good actress in this film. the plot made sense enough so that i could understand it. i didn't know what a lycan was until i was 25 minutes into the film. personally i vote for lycans against vampires. i wish that kate beckinsale was a lycan and a vampire that way i don't have to choose. truthfully the vampires were really brutal in this film compared to other film.,8,0,0,11 May 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," what a mutant
","this film was one of the best x-men movies i had ever seen. the film really went into detail about wolverine's life. i had no idea that sabretooth was wolverines brother. until this film, i didn't know a lot of things about wolverine. i was angry about the negative reviews but i also agreed that the x-men trilogy along with this movie, were masterpieces. the action in the wolverine movie was amazing. all the stunts, explosions and fighting in the film were outstanding. i hear that they are beginning to use x-men origins on certain characters. the next character i hear is magneto. if you liked hugh jackman in the other x-men films than you will surely love him in x-men origins wolverine. this movie should easily be nominated for an Oscar. can't wait for the next x-men film.",10,5,11,10 May 2009
Watchmen," nice!!!
",this movie was a masterpiece. the plot made a lot of sense. when i saw it the audience was astonished by the action. this movie was so good it should have won 2 Oscars. i didn't know a superhero could punch like that. the ending was a fairly good ending. my favorite character through the movie was rorshack. but i thought that in the movie Jackie Earle Haley was the one who fought the most along side the comedian. i was a little mad that rorshack died but he was still the best character. the movie kept me guessing until the end. i was definitely not disappointed!!! it was the best movie i had ever seen in my 13 years of life. i would definitely recommend it if you like action films with superheroes. it is also not cheesy. you can bet i will be the first in In to buy it on 2 disc unrated DVD. watch it now!,10,0,1,15 March 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," really awesome.
","this movie was probably the best in the terminator trilogy. it made me jump up at certain scenes. arnold should win an Oscar. this film showed me more about how the terminator really is. i didn't think he would protect anyone but himself. but, in t2 he proved me wrong. this movie had the best action scenes. when the terminator attacked the t-1000 with his shotgun i knew who was gonna win. whenever the t-1000 was shot with a powerful weapon in the head it would regenerate. i found it cool but upsetting that the terminator couldn't do that. i also loved the way the movie ended because it showed that the terminator also had a caring side to him. i screamed yeah! when the t-1000 was thrown into the lava. when arnold went into the lava i was upset but i knew there would be a sequel. overall everyone in this movie was terrific. catch me at my next review.",10,6,8,14 May 2009
Twilight," what in the world
","i find movies like this to be really stupid for a couple of reasons. reason one, it was about one girl who was lonely and needed a friend. reason two, the vampire didn't even have the traits of a real vampire. the vampires in this movie don't have wings or super strength or feeding frenzies on humans. reason three, robert pattison is a terrible actor for this part. throughout the movie he talks in a low voice close to a whisper.reason four, the storyline didn't make sense. i don't think that wolves would make deals with vampires to not expose their secret. i also think that the ending was really gay. one vampire remaining? what in the world were they thinking. the vampire that is left is a woman for Christ sake. also, the fight scene was really stupid two. there was only about 5 minutes of action throughout the whole movie. the rest was just gay romance. if they make a sequel you can be sure that i will blow my head off.",5,1,4,17 May 2009
The Number 23," what a great film
",i am just at a loss for words at how good this film was. jim carrey normally sticks to comedy films but in this movie he was better than i had ever seen in a suspense film. the film started out kind of weird but than as it progressed i began to understand it more and more. the book in the film was the key to the mystery. i would have never thought that jim carrey was the killer. this movie was really good. jim carrey and Virginia madsen should get an Oscar for this film. it's just one of those films that makes you wonder if what they talk about is real. obviously the number 23 appears a lot in life but i never thought that jim carrey of all people would help to solve the Numbers mystery. some might say this film was boring and stupid and that jim carrey wasn't meant for the part but i say that you are wrong. if you like jim carrey and suspense thriller films than you will love the number 23.,9,2,4,10 May 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," what a curious film
",this movie made me cry like a baby. i began to wonder how that would feel. to be born aging backwards. i thought that this movie was going to be another one of those crappy movies but i was wrong. when i sat down to watch a three hour film i ended up watching it twice.it is so sad that brad pitt aged backwards and that the love of his life couldn't be with him because as she got older he got younger. brad pitt definitely makes this movie a good choice for those of you who like romance and drama movies.the special effects where really good. the way they made banjamin look old. this movie was so good and sad.i bought this movie and i enjoy it for those rainy days when there is nothing to do.,10,0,2,22 June 2009
The Dark Knight," the dark joker
","this movie was excellent. since i loved batman begins and the other batman movies. i couldn't wait to see this one. the old joker was jack nicholson so i wanted to see if heath ledger could top him. ledger beat him by a longshot. i love his role. the way he laughed and acted as the joker made the real joker in him come out so that the role would be excellent. i also liked batman's new suit. it had all these cool gadgets that made him look invincible. i was upset that the batmobile if it's still called that was destroyed. but they made a comeback with his new motorcycle.i also liked that the movie could have ended a couple of different ways. but anyway the ending that stated that batman was a vigilante and that he could never leave the fighting to the cops. the cast was great Christian bale, maggie gylenhall,heath ledger and others. this film is a definite pick for an action movie night. i watched it about 10 times no joke. i bought it 2 disc special edition and it came with a card signed by heath ledger. can't wait for part three but sad to say the joker might not be in it because of heath ledgers death.",10,1,4,22 June 2009
Taken," an older james bond
",this film definitely had me interested when i saw the trailer. i thought that an old man kicking butt was awesome i never thought that this movie was better than james bond.i also thought that the plot was good. a father searching for his daughter in an international country was good but then when i learned that he knew like kung fu. i was excited. this film kept me interested because he went through people like cigarettes to find his daughter. i saw the main actor as an old drama actor but he proved me wrong in this film. when he just started beating people to a pulp asking for information i started to jump up and down. this movie definitely should be a pick when you wanna watch an action film. i bought this on DVD and i do not regret it. i want to watch it over and over again.,8,1,2,22 June 2009
Hancock," what a film
","this film was a good film that will smith did. i knew that will smith liked playing parts of a superhero because he always does super-well as one. will if your reading this give yourself a Pat on the back. this film was a great superhero film. the action scenes were believable and the action was phenomenal. also when hancock cut off that guys hand it was so gross but at the same time so cool. i also thought that the ending was fairly decent but it left me with questions. how did hancock survive after being shot? where did he go after? who was the bird sitting next to him in new york? i would also like to add that the fight between will and the other lady was awesome. i didn't think a girl could Punch that hard. overall, good job will smith. catch me at my next review.",8,1,2,14 May 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," great movie
","this movie is one of those films that keeps you guessing until the end. it was a very good movie. even though it was 2 hours it didn't feel that way because i was so into it. i love movies that have drama and suspense. it got me wondering about real poor kids living in slums. dev patel was a really good choice for this film. the plot made a lot of sense and so did the film itself. it is just so entertaining to see a teenager do anything for love. the things done for love in this film, i don't think i could do. the ending was fairly decent and almost made me shed a tear. i know that if girls watched it and liked it they must have cried at some point. anyway, this film was one of the best film of 2008. even though it won awards it should have won 3 Oscars. one for the romance, one for the drama, and one for the suspense. if you like romance, drama, and suspense and gameshows with money than you will love slumdog millionaire.",10,2,10,10 May 2009
Valkyrie," history rocks
","this movie gave me a detailed description of the other people that had things happen to them while Hitler was in power. it was really cool how tom cruise just stopped taking orders from others and started leading. tom cruise should win an Oscar for doing this film for three reasons. one because tom did an amazing job acting as this person in history. second, this film explained to me what project valkyrie was and it also told me what happened during hitlers reign. and third this film showed a lot of drama and action. i didn't know that there were people trying to kill Hitler, that worked for him. when tom cruise was shot at the end of the movie along with the other people, i kind of felt emotional. i felt that way because throughout the film tom cruise proved to be the hero, not the enemy. if anything Hitler and the Nazis were the enemies. if your into history films that explain a person's role in history, than you will definitely like valkyrie.",9,2,5,14 May 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," award winning citizen
","this movie was awesome!!!! the movie had some jump scenes to it and i like gerard butler in his part!! jamie foxx was okay too. if u didin't know gerard butler is just an innocent person in the beginning. once the movie trails along it got more and more intense. i went in with high expectations and i think that law abiding citizen should win 40,000 Oscars better than titanic,zombieland and the stepfather. i think that the i want and the scene that made me and my friend jump the most was the part when the judge sat by the window and said i can do whatever i want and then boom!!! her head is blown off like the fourth of july. well this movie was amazing and i will buy it on DVD go see it!!!",10,2,6,17 October 2009
