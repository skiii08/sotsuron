The Ring," I normally Do Not Get Creeped Out But........
","This one scared me. The Ring evoked a fear deep inside of me unlike any other movie since the Sixth Sense. The Halloween type of sudden scares works and even when things shouldn't be scary, it is!!! I whole heartedly recommend this to everyone who can handle being on end for nearly two hours. 10/10",10,1,1,9 March 2003
