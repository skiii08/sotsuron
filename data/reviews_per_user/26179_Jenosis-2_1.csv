The Blair Witch Project," The best movie I have seen in a while...
","I thought that the Blair Witch Project was simply 'awesome'.  When I saw it, it sent chills down my spine and made my hair stand on end.  I think the greatest thing about this movie is that, you (as the viewer) don't really know what happen to them.  That's why this film is creepy, because we are naturally scared of the unknown.  Those people that think this movie was a disappointment, must not have a creative imagination.  Cause after the end, all of these thought came into my head of might what had happen or who was responsible for it.",9,0,0,4 August 1999
