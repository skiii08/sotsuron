Sucker Punch," Looks amazing and still deserves 1/10
","For me, this was the worst high budget movie of the last 15years. Lets start by saying that the CGI looks really great, also costumes, makeup, scenery etc. The basic story even makes some sense, working on both 'levels' of the movie.Despite that, i just couldn't imagine making it any worse. Acting is awful, especially from lead actress. She moves like a plastic figure, her dance or martial arts both are awful and make the experience of watching her really dreadful. Overall it looks like someone directed all CGI before any story, then mixed it up with serious topic making very light of it, then added some pretty faces and hoped for the best.It would be better if they only used the CGI scenes and deleted the rest. It would even be smarter.",1,7,15,18 June 2011
