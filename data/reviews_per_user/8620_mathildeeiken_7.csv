Hereditary," Probably the weirdest movie I've watched in a while...
","I wouldn't say I love it, but I didn't hate it either. I guess I need more time to process this...",5,1,2,18 January 2020
Aquaman," It's an OK movie
","The movie got some really beautiful scenery, but I really don't like the script! The humour is off, and some of the lines are unnecessary! It's a superhero-movie, but it's definitely not the best... I won't advise you to see it, and I won't advise you not to. (There are many better films out there)",4,0,0,27 October 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," A masterpiece!

Spirited Away," Visual masterpiece!
","I am amazed with the visuals! The story is great as well, but as we know it's made mostly for children. This however won't lead me to give the movie a lower rating! YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS!",10,0,0,15 February 2020

Princess Mononoke," I never want it to end!
","I loved the contrast between love and how power leads us to destroy our own homes. The small forest spirits were really cute, and gave the movie an extra aspect of mystery. The feeling of hopelessness in the end really hit me, and kept my attention! And the scenery.... was AMAZING! The weird forestspirit's face, the boars and the wolves were great! The background, however was breathtaking! Like how much time must that have taken?!?!
YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS!",10,0,0,15 February 2020
