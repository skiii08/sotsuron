","Watching the film brought me back to the exact state of mind, and emotional state, that I felt on September 11. Some may not want to do that, and I would understand why. But for me, I believe that it is very important to do so, and the best way to honor the victims of 9/11. The film was stunning in it's realism. There were so many things that could have been done, in the making of this film, that would have made me very angry. I was actually pretty skeptical when I went to see it. But, the film is an absolute testament to the heroism that took place that day, as a small group of strangers chose to band together, and become the first line of defense in the war on terror. The film DOES NOT play politics. No matter what your political persuasion, you can appreciate this film. I think this movie is a great way to ensure we do not forget. I, like most people, did not think that I had forgotten. But, when this movie starts churning something inside your stomach, as you see how shocking that day's events were, and two feelings start rising to levels never you had never felt before- anger and sadness- you realize that you have, in a way, begun to forget 9/11. The movie is on your mind long after you leave the theater.",10,3,7,30 April 2006
