The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Don't waste your money
","I was extremely disappointed with the movie after all the publicity that has been going on, saying that's the best movie of the series so far. I disagree! It was the worst! I read the book and the wedding is supposed to be a huge event, where Bella looked gorgeous. Well, she was beyond plain, her nails were not even done!!! Her facial expression was of extreme fear and uncertainty, instead of joy and love, like you would expect from someone who is getting married to the love of her life. The wolves were much smaller compared to the other movies - that's what happens when you have one director for each movie. I was in love with the book and this movie ruined it for me. I almost fell asleep while watching the movie!!! I guess the best part of the movie was the beautiful scenes shot in Brazil - that's about it.",2,7,12,29 November 2011
