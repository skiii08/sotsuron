Sucker Punch," Snyder's 'cult' film
","After watching this flick, maybe sometime into it, you may get the feeling that Snyder made this film simply to fill in his time between projects. I remember reading about him making this film as saying; '...I wondered about why couldn't a film be made that encompassed all these cool effects and martial arts without any regard to propriety.' To me, that sounds like what Michael Bay's philosophy towards his films is all about. Sucker Punch I think is Snyder's attempt of making a 'cult film/art film' ou of his own material and that is reminiscent of those '70's films like 'Two-Lane Blacktop' and 'Vanishing Point' where there was no real rhyme or reason to the whole movie. I think it's Snyder's 'Existential' film. What never made sense to me about Babydoll, was that when she embarked on her 'Matrix Moment', her other ditzy friends followed and strangely, in her head whatever they suffered in the 'Matrix Moment', translated to their reality. This made no sense whatsover. But then I remembered Snyder's rationale behind the reason for the film. That it didn't need to make sense! Disappointing of all, was the way the characters stood out from the greenscreen and it simply looked like doing a karate exhibition in front of the audience at a theatre. Using the screen as a crude 'forced perspective'. Above all, was that Snyder was eager to move from one action sequence to the next but doing that would just make the film 45 minutes long. So we get unnecessary dialogue scenes that are supposed to give us Exposition and emotion which comes off as forced and redundant.",5,0,1,28 June 2012
Iron Man 2," A HEAVY foot in the wrong direction.
","I saw this in the theatre and I should have known better to set any expectations, but since Downey, Favreau, and the previous installment doing Shellhead some justice, I relented and set those expectations. Not high, but they were set optimistically. OK, so I know Cheadle replaced Howard and that was a decision that wasn't for the best. Cheadle is usually dependable in his own way. But Howard was actually plausible and sold you that they were friends. Cheadle didn't bring that to his role. Rourke, In my opinion took the dramatic, emotional stake that should have been Stark's with an ever increasing personal stake or investment with each sequel that doesn't have to always be Pepper Potts. I mean, is that all he actually cares about ? I know she's the unattainable love interest and the one person whom Stark can't get into the sack. But she was bait for Stane in the first, and now for Anton Vanko's droid attack. Come on Justin Theroux. This is why you make the big bucks. This isn't a plot driven movie since it just unfolds as it comes to Stark's realization. But it doesn't offer much for character driven either. When Stark starts gets drunk at his party, you feel they're gonna do an homage to the 'Demon in a Bottle' storyline. But nope. Perfect chance to dive into a moment in Stark's fallibility and character development outside the seemingly 'Uh, gotta fight the Mandarin again.' I felt the action scenes were treated with less reverence than the first and added to satiate action fans. But the fight scene at Monaco was over before it really began, the battle with Cheadle during the party was trying to be funny while also adding humor, and the face-off with Vanko was too un-fulfilling. I felt it was all over waaay too quick. You know it isn't that good of a 'movie' when even Downey is quoted as saying how much of a letdown it is. Furthermore, there wasn't much if any, semblance of an arc for Stark like his realization in the first that he was irresponsible and went about to rectify that character defect. In short, too little of everything in this 'movie'.",5,1,4,4 July 2012
Constantine," If Hell has cars...
","If Hell has cars, then I'd hate to be there to see what's occupying the hot country. Probably '77-'78 Mustang II's, Pontiac Azteks, and newer Fords. Let's clear this once and for all: Reeves is NOT an actor. He's a celebrity. Besides Bill and Ted, I thought he was offensively appalling. If you've seen Point Break, you can observe that Reeves was still nursing that Valley boy drawl. If he's such an actor, why can't he play anyone besides an apathetic savior in The Matrix or pompous Jonathan Harker in Dracula ? I hear Reeves is a perfectionist and pretty unforgiving of his 'performances'. Well did Lawrence bother to screen the dailies of Constantine in front of him to rectify that ? Or is Lawrence fond of printing EVERY take ? Reeves doesn't convey the range of emotions like his peers. The same stoic, introverted character who guzzles whiskey and chain-smokes. It seems Reeves had struggled to eek out a comic character who's pretty self-destructive. The movie doesn't fail completely, it's just the weight of it, is on Reeves who's grossly miscast. The frivolous responses just seem to evade any semblance of capability. There's no over-acting here. That would impugn Reeves knows how to act. Otherwise, he just seems to go through the motions and gave Lawrence a plethora of apathetic takes where he just doesn't cut it. Did the requisites for the role say: 'No enthusiasm needed' ? I deduce...Yes. I mean Reeves can probably relate on some level and click with Constantine's moral constituition if not his over-indulgent tendencies. It's not like asking him to portray Vo Nguyen Giap. Reeves has no range. I don't mean he has unlimited range. I mean no diversity. Stormare and Swinton had fun and it shows. Cam't say that for Reeves. Unless he wasn't in character the whole shoot.",7,0,2,9 March 2013
Blade II," The best of the trilogy
","Let me start by saying this is by far the best in the franchise. Goyer makes a better writer and producer than a director calling the shots. Pun intended. What lacked in the first one, was a worthy foe to match Blade's force of nature and efficient dispatcher. Dorff just seemed like a trashy-chic vampire who spouts cliché'd one-liners in between over-acted fits of spontaneous, narcissistic rage.This one has Nomak who isn't a villain for story sake. He's a tormented, estranged hybrid of a crack-head and vampire. He's an experiment of his father, Damaskinos's.A baddie by circumstance.While the story is good enough here, I feel that a lot of little things add up to detract from the Blade series. First is the set design. Clearly this is where del Toro either skimped, or overlooked. The sets look so bland while the characters obviously were where the money was spent. Next, the Reapers look a little 'barebones' and 'neatly un-imaginative'. del Toro spent too much into their anatomy and not enough anywhere else.Third is the color palette. del Toro is such a renowned film maker and for good reason. His films look so rich and evoke emotion. The 'blue days and amber nights' just don't pull it off. Look at 'Hellboy' 1 & 2! Nobody and I mean nobody, does the amber filter like del Toro. It's so over used and now it's old hat. Nobody uses the color palette/filter as a tool for storytelling. Instead they 'utilize' it strictly for aesthetics.As I've said, 'Blade II' is still entertaining, just that all of these flaws detract from the perfection it could have easily attained.",7,0,16,22 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Vastly superior to the previous 3
","Raimi tried and failed, to depict Spider-Man as a neo-Hamlet with the love triangles, deceit, betrayals, and revenge. He likened Shakespeare to...Spider-Man ? I don't like Raimi's theme of 'Love story with some comic book action' It should be the other way around.Then there was Maguire who didn't resemble anything like Peter Parker. He was just a caricature of nerds abroad. Andrew Garfield looked and sold the part as a more grounded, sarcastic, and presumptuous Spidey. Webb did a superb job of what Raimi failed to do 3 times. Show what Peter Parker did between being sappy and overly dramatic to being Spidey. In this one, we see a more vulnerable, more accessible Spidey repair his suit, training, and asserting his opinions. Abrasively, if he needs to. He also tries to adjust to his newly gained attributes such as regulating his efforts to closing doors carefully. He does this through trial and error. While the film get's off to a slow, albeit phenomenal pace, once it picks up speed, it goes full bore. Raimi punctuated dialogue heavy scenes with action. Webb seemed to make the dialogue more bearable, and less theatrical, and worked it around the action.Also, Webb realized what Raimi and Burton failed to do; 'You don't have to kill the antagonist!' While the only gripe I have, is that the agenda of Curt Connors's alter ego, The Lizard is pretty cheesy. Like it's out of a Bond film or an episode of The Tick. Webb did a different take on the style of how Spidey traverses the city. Where Raimi used a greenscreen to superimpose the acrobatics, it looked flat like Spidey was swinging in front of a cityscape painted wall. Instead, Webb opted for a more visceral and dynamic style befitting this Spidey's bolder, more confrontational style. Even utilizing first person camera angles here. Webb actually wanted the viewer to enjoy the ride as it were, without cutting it too short.Also,Spidey is shown as human. He is shot and limps about while gazing in the distance at how much farther he has to go and sighs.Little,trivial things like these ground Spidey and to me, make him seem less perfect and more human as Spidey still retains his fallibility. Sadly, for Raimi fans, the more humble beginnings do not warrant the appearances of either Norman or Harry Osborn and no J.Jonah Jameson chewing up scenery since Webb is going for a re-telling origin story. This is how Spider-Man was supposed to have been told. Not Raimi's over-inflated and over-ambitious take.",8,1,4,6 July 2012
Ghost Rider," Mark Steven Johnson's 1 of 2 scheduled reboots
","Johnson must be a fan of Uwe Boll or the last thing he watched before taking on this project, was of Boll's. This crap resulted in a 'reboot' which wasn't much better, and Daredevil which is also up for an overhaul. Not a good batting average. The 'plot' for this movie was lackluster at best. The acting by Wes Bentley was horrid and I believe it's 50/50 director and actor's fault.Bentley obvious wasn't concerned about his performance or watched his dailies to adjust his 'method' or 'approach'. Even worse is the awful grating of Ghost Rider's 'voice'. Sounds like Ghost Rider has a carton a day habit. Then there's Eva Mendes trying to make the best out of a bad project along with Cage. But this movie is just inexcusable for looking like a 20 million dollar flick with a supposed 80+ million budget. I think Johnson spent it all on Cage's hairpiece.",1,2,3,27 June 2012
From Dusk Till Dawn," Horrible blandpire flick
","With names on this 'movie' that have then newcomers Tarantino and Rodriguez on them, you'd probably expect something half-way decent. If you have an discerning taste in quality films, you'll quickly realize that this 'movie' is probably one that when mentioned to Clooney, Tarantino, or Rodriguez, will probably get you those contemptuous stares of 'you're just being an a$$hole'. But in my opinion, it isn't trash talking if it's true. This venture starts out with Tarantino and Clooney as brothers who're hiding out from the law. In particular a bigoted sheriff played by veteran actor, Michael Parks, who's in a liquor store shooting the breeze with a backwood, desert rat named Benny about what nosey, small hicktown, busybodys talk about. Then the sheriff does his job of exposition on two a-hole brothers who're in the middle of a robbing/murder spree which started in Kansas after Tarantino's character busted Clooney's character out of a corrections facility. Now if the 'movie' had taken a more serious tone from the beginning, in true Tarantino and Rodriguez fashion, it might have actually been good. Where I think it all goes bad is when the two plus Harvey Keitel's character and his adopted Chinese son and daughter take temporary refuge in Mexico at a dive against their will. Since the family are captives hijacked for their 'self-contained' R.V. by the brothers.What follows is mess of cliché'd special effects and fairly cheap make-up effects and gratuitous violence preceded by oodles of topless women who are *gasp* blandpires.This 'movie' is just gory for gore's sake. To compensate for a lack of story, imagination, and for Tarantino a lack of clever dialogue. The only redeeming virtue in the entire movie is Salma Hayek's exotic/erotic dancing with a yellow boa constrictor for good exotic measure. This is the only semblance of class or sophistication in the entire 'movie' since she remains clothed in a luscious, velvet bikini.Then the festivities end when the blandpires show their true colors by slaughtering en masse a whole barroom of patrons. It is as dumb as it sounds. This 'movie' makes no contribution to the blandpire sub-genre. Interview with the Vampire and Bram Stoker's Dracula brought back the romanticized and urbane blandpire established by Stoker and Lugosi, Blade Agave gave blandpires a more realistic and scientific weight to their folklorish nomenclature of sunlight, garlic, silver and so on. Then 30 Days of Night stripped all that away and made blandpires nothing more than savage parasites truly to be feared.All From Dusk til Dawn manages is...uh...well you got gratuitous profanity by a master dialogue scribe and equally copious amounts of gore. What is kind of funny about it, is that all of the 'actors' behave as though this isn't the first, second, or even tenth time they went to a dive and encountered this sort of a debacle! And to think this is what Clooney gave up E.R. for. But it get's worse, he followed this up with that dreadful Batman and Robin and all it's ingloriousness and homo-eroticism. But hey, not every movie can have the same pedigree of Heat, Braveheart, or Citizen Kane. It's because of crap like this that you truly appreciate when a good movie graces our televisions.",2,1,3,6 July 2012
Man on Fire," Tony Scott's best flick since True Romance
","This film works so well, partly due to the fact it's based on a true story, is a revenge flick but has a soul to it without being a vehicle to justify copious and profusely bleeding baddies for Denzel.The story takes a while to get going, but once it does, it doesn't really let up. Denzel is Creasey, a mysterious and stoic former soldier now turned soldier of fortune/ bodyguard with a strong predilection for booze. Walken is now trying to shake the creepy villain role with him as Creasey's war buddy who does private security 'ferrying workers' across the Rio Grande from El Paso to Mexico to work. He takes on a job merely to ingratiate himself to Rayburn, Walken's character.Then the daughter, Pita takes a fondness to Creasey much to his chagrin as he's not particularly social or fond of anything besides Jack Daniels. What works is the reticent chemistry between Pita and Creasey who later comes to reciprocate his fondness of Pita's charm. Much like Mathilda and Leon in The Professional. Sans the sexual innuendo and alcohol.The narrative actually has a poignancy as it begins with Creasey's self-destruction, and becomes a love story and eventually descends into the dark recesses of a revenge flick. Scott actually let the story breathe and didn't try to cut corners for the sake of action. Actually, he did the story justice by exploring the relationship of Pita and Creasey, thereby giving the viewer a place as the 3rd person among Pita and Creasey.All of this culminates in a dark juxtaposition to the jovial friendship as Creasey goes to seeking trouble in the form of revenge, and finds Pita's abductors.This is evidence that Scott is capable like his brother Ridley to tell a story that does not necessitate blowing things up when he works with Bruckheimer.Maybe Scott had something to say or prove to his critics . Because he followed this up with...Domino? A movie made just to justify his 'exorcising his rock and roll demons' in the same aesthetic he uses in Man on Fire. More kinectic and saturated shots combined with rapid fire editing and under/overexposed frames.",8,0,0,11 July 2012
Platoon," The 'logic' behind Taylor and Elias
","My beef, with this movie is that though it's set in the Vietnam War in '67-68; it doesn't quite jive as an drama with action picture. It seems as though Stone felt obligated to have firefights since NOT having any would be detrimental for audiences and undermine the chaos of war by portraying it as 'uneventful'. Or, he didn't want to 'glorify' any war. The battles seem too meandering. No real outcome is implied or alluded to. Furthermore, Sheen's acting while not underacting, certainly is overdone. Specifically when he snaps in the ville at suspected VC. Alligator tears and wrought brows were probably not character requisites, but Stone's 'method directing'. If you watch the special features, you'll learn of Stone's madness to 'inspire' great acting. The final thing that bothered me, was how Elias and Taylor rationalize. 'We're gonna lose this war. We've been kicking other peoples' asses for so long, it's time we got ours kicked.' So that's what America failed to see in that quagmire ? 'The truth's in the eyes! When you know, you know!' So a gut instinct is substantial enough to warrant a summary execution ? This is ethically flawed judgment at it's worst and apparently, Stone's best. Or, a reflection of Stone's own rationale ?",7,0,0,7 March 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The franchise comes full circle
","For those seeking more mayhem of Batman, be patient with TDKR, since Wayne has been in exile from authorities for obvious reasons. We find he's been out of 'uniform' for some years and is now dependent on a cane to hobble about. But this film has more in common with Begins since it is coming back to 359 degrees. While Wayne has gotten older, he hasn't lost his abilities or his deductive prowess. I'm gonna skip the synopsis since it's been explained profusely. While the plot line has NOT really changed from the previous ones, it's just as they say: 'same book, different chapter'.But since Ledger gave us the iconic Joker, it really left big shoes to fill. I don't quite think Bane is fair to compare to Joker since they are quite different, the grandiose story does the narrative justice. It does come close to being too contrived, but if it weren't, it'd be a simple linear, no frills, run-of-the-mill plot.What I noticed was the themes from the graphic novels like 'The Dark Knight Returns', 'No Man's Land', and the 'Knightfall' books. Also, don't expect the gadgets to be so prominent here. This one goes for raw, visceral action. Even a Batman in daylight! If you pay close attention, you can pick up the subtle and not so subtle shout-outs to the Dark Knight universe.A robust, and satiating finale to a venerable character and trilogy.",9,1,10,20 July 2012
Fast Five," The stars are NOT the cars in this one.
","So when this entry skips the cars for the sake of an ensemble cast/heist movie, it does detract from the experience. There was only the opening and climax with any noteworthy driving sequences! No street races for titles or anything like that. Okay, then there's that whole eclectic ensemble of F&F stars who come together as a motley crew of thieving bastards. But now, the gang fancy themselves as neo-Robin Hoods. Whereas before, they were out for theirs. They still are, but now they need a contrast to frame themselves in a better light. Finally, the 'climax' ? I don't think two Chargers, even with two 6.1 Hemis and even a 7.17:1 axle ratio, could heft a vault with the ease they expect us to believe. All in all ? The worst F&F entry in the series. Especially considering the cast and what Lin had to work with.Something else, why did Diesel skip starring in the second and third ? Did his 'career' not blossom as expected ? Is he trying to reignite that fire that did wonders for him 12 years ago with the original ? I'm inclined to believe so. Watch this film at your dismay. If you're expecting a lot of action around cars ?, be ready for sorrow. I'll 2nd the motion for a do-over.",2,0,3,8 June 2013
