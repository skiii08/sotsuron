Source Code," Time travel at its Best !
","One of those few movies where there is time line travel that is on the edge of being believable. Consider Everett's 'Many Worlds' theory: ' {an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction and denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse. Many-worlds implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual 'world' (or 'universe')' - that is a valid theory in modern physics - then watch and enjoy. Relentless excitement from beginning to end. This is a time travel film that might even impress those who don't believe time travel is possible - And if it is possible this is one way it might happen in the future - Maybe it is already happening? If you like this film another one almost believable is 'I'll Follow You Down' - Also on the edge of believable but not quite as exciting.",10,1,4,12 January 2015
No Country for Old Men," Maybe the worst movie I ever saw !?!
","Why would they waste talented acting in a film whose plot, leads were only few movies have gone before to meaningless, absolute and possibly you could say Existential NONSENSE. But to be fair and as I think about it this movie could have some appeal to psychos, sociopaths and serial killers and people who like to watch bad movies, and I mean bad!Grabs your interest to begin with and holds you. And of course your interested and have expectations for the movie and think you are watching a good well produced movie but by the time it is over you will realize you have been taken - taken to nowhere for no reason - Except as an exercise in movie acting there is so little real meaning or purpose in this film you wonder why it was made? I saw it for free on TV otherwise I guess the Hollywood sociopathic mind won - They made money on it, what else matters?",1,2,7,17 July 2010
The Island," Great Sci-Fi Action Movie!
","WOW! - First thought that came to mind when it ended. One of the best clone/android based tech movies I've seen. Builds up slowly but does not leave you bored and then it takes off. Non stop action keeping you on the edge of your seat - similar to the type of none stop action you get in the James Bond movies. Lead characters become immediately likable and has you cheering for them throughout. I've been watching a lot of science fiction lately and one I just finished was a struggle to stay awake watching - Not this one - Bored and/or tired and want a movie to wake you up? Then try this one action sci-fi at its best. The acting, directing, background sound and special effects are excellent - it was nominated for three awards and did when one.",10,1,2,18 January 2015
