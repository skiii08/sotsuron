The Blair Witch Project," As good as Night of the Living Dead
","Some folks who I saw this film with left disappointed. It is not your typical horror film. There are no cheap scares or really jump out of your seats moments. Gore is almost totally nonexistent. Instead the movie is almost two stories. First, the story during the day about three college students who are lost in the woods and the dynamics as they slowly disintegrate as a group and as individuals. Second, the story at night where something is sitting just beyond the range of their cameras and lights hunting them. Blair Witch, like Night of the Living Dead, focuses more on the group dynamics than on the horror that lurks outside. It isn't clear which is more frightening- the unseen witch or the slow descent to madness of the individuals. The first person point of view created by viewing the 'documentary' footage really puts you into the setting and leaves you straining to see what lies in the dark just like the characters do in the film.  It is a startling vision and one very much worth watching if you are looking for horror along the lines of Night of the Living Dead, Psycho, or The Thing- horror that is more psychological than visual.",9,1,2,18 July 1999
Alien 3," A more honest sequel than Aliens
",Alien3 felt a whole lot more like Alien to me than did Aliens. Aliens is Ripley as Rambo. What made the first movie so good was that the humans outnumbered the enemy but were helpless to stop it. Alien3 returns to that feel. Aliens was an action film while Alien and Alien3 are both really more SciFi/Horror films. Set on a convict world with no weapons and little external contact Alien3 has a good mix of feeling 'in the future' but somehow very primitive. David Fincher does dark very well. The Alien has changed a bit physically but it still has the same bad attitude and need for food. The loss of Newt and Hicks didn't bother me at all the way others seem disturbed by it. Dead folks are just part and parcel of this series. The best part of the entire movie is the final 'chase' scene through a maze or corridors beneath the iron works. The chase rapidly becomes disorienting and even more so when you shift to alien-cam and the aliens runs up onto the ceiling with you. The effect is outstanding all the more so because it throws you into the sense of the poor convicts trying to figure out which corridor they are in and where the alien is in relation to them. It is a wonderful effect and one that Fincher carries elements of with him into the chase scene in Se7en.,Null,0,3,21 October 1999
Memento," Good not Great
","The praise of this film is overblown...without a doubt. Easy way to judge the film: play it in the proper order and see how highly rated it is. Answer: not very. Played forward the film is afairly predictable and easy to see coming. So the story itself isn't compelling. None of the characters are particulary anything other than Guy Pearce- mianly becuase Pearce's character 'sees' all the other characters and doesn't know anything real about them so neither do you.All that said, the arrangment of this film is what sets it apart and makes it not something dull and boring. Other films have used this technique but the technique does work in this case and it adds a level of interest to the film that the story itself does not wholly deserve.BTW, most of the 'talking' about the film afterwards has to do with the open questions left by the film's plot. The question isn't what happens in the film and what you missed (6th Sense or Usuaul suspects) but what happens before the story that you are never told all that muhc about. There are 'supporting' materials at the offical web site that add depth to the tale and make some of the questions- well frankly not very questionable.",6,1,2,5 July 2003
The Mummy," An above average popcorn special effects flick.
","The plot is hokey, the acting isn't always first rate, and we've all seen this film before. All that said, the movie is fun. The film doesn't try and take itself too seriously. Beni (the Renfield character) provides most of the light moments but Fraser has some good lines as does does John Hannah. The effects are seamless and the action is pretty much non-stop. It isn't Oscar material but it is fun.",6,0,0,18 May 1999
Hotel Rwanda," An incredibly dignified movie
","This was a really powerful film. The word that leaps to mind is dignified. A film about the genocide in Rwanda could have taken a lot of roads to hit you in the gut. What impressed me is that you don't get a lot of graphic shots - actually no graphic shots. There is less blood in this film than most episodes of CSI. The film assumes you are capable of understand the horror of the event without showing it to you. Don Cheadle has worked in crap like Mission to Mars, Ocean's 11, and Swordfish so the way he pulls out his role Paul Rusesabagina might shock. He really brings out the character who isn't some crusading hero but a normal man who brings the same talents to saving Rwandans that he used to serve guests at his hotel. He plays the role with such grace and ease that the character is wholly credible. The film's biggest emotion for me was less one of sadness than anger. Listening to an actual US State Department broadcast talk about 'Acts of Genocide' get interrupted by a reporter asking, 'How many acts of genocide does it take before something is genocide.' was maddening. You realize how little effort- manpower and money- it would have taken to avert the killing of almost a million Rwandans but the world sat by and did nothing but make noises at the UN.

Pitch Black," Not much to recommend it
","Is it scary? No, not really. Everyone who dies is pretty much set up to die so when they do buy it you aren't surprised too much. Most are doing something stupid when they do: not staying down, looking in tunnels (when will folks learn?) or running away from the light, for example. You always needs a few of these type deaths but a good grab from the pitch black might have helped too. Are the effects good? Well, kinda. The aliens are pretty free form. There appear to be three varieties: bats, pterodactyls and ground based critters that move too much like the Alien. The right one always seems to be about to make the kill required by the cast member stupidity. When you see them they look o.k. but don't really challenge the genre too much since they do look rather Alien-eque. Characters? Well let's not pretend this matters in a good ole aliens eating people film but these aren't very good at all. Vin Diesel has been praised but this is an easy role to nail and the other characters are mostly flat with stupid attempts at depth: he's an Islamic cleric not a priest (yawn), he's a bounty-hunter with a drug habit (yawn). None of these wrinkles make a lick of plot difference. Plot? Does it make any sense. No. First, struggle to imagine the evolutionary path that creates rabid, photo-sensitive, multitudinous predators on a planet that is pure light for 22 years in a row and has no visble prey items. Ignore that and then try and figure how as little light as the crew has keeps these things at bay. A Jack Daniels bottle used as a torch? This fear of the light seems to kind of come and go being more or less at needed plot moments. Throw in a few twists that don't matter (spoiler): one of the boys is actually a girl...oooh and its pretty silly. Pay a dollar and yuck it up some but don't waste full price on this.",Null,0,0,24 February 2000
28 Days Later...," God awful and dull
","I'm a sucker for a good zombie-type film but I was cheated on this flick. Minor spoilers.First off, this is not a zombie flick anymore than the Blair Witch Project was about the witch or Signs was about aliens. In all three cases the 'monster' is used as a device to explore human problems (and in fairness Night of the Living Dead does the same thing). I like the latter three films becuase while they aren't just monster movies the monsters are sort of omnipiresent and you feel their influence constantly in the film. 28 Days Later doesn't do that. The 'rage' infected (the zombies are vicitms of, shocker, a bioexperiment gone wrong and unleashed) are intermittently in the film and there are times you totally forget about them.Second, the main conflict in the film arises sort of out of nowhere- I won't divulge what it is. It makes no sense what so ever and the 'good' guy's solution to it is to kill all sorts of non-zombies by working with the 'zombies'. You might be able to rationalize some of the actions of the real bad guys but when you realize that society has been gone for all of 28 days at most it gets hard to accept that all societal norms could vanish so quickly- escpeially among folks not in the heat of the moment, spare me about riots and such things.Third, Danny Boyle has the camera sense of the guy who filmed Battlefield Earth. Too many shots on tilts. His handling of action is outright abominable. He's not good with action so he resorts to the classic close shots, bad lighting and frequent cuts to obscure his failures. I don't know why folks still do this since the end result is that you can't see anything happening in the climax. That would assume you care since the zombies are killing bad guys anyway. In BWP, Signs and NotLD you are emotionally invested in the trapped would-be victims but in this flick you don't care a lick about the zombie show and might even be rooting for thier demise. Scarey it ain't.Oh, BTW, one last little gripe at a key moment a British solider has his gun jam- and of course can not clear the jam. This is a really tired movie cliche and deux et machina effect but worse is that all soliders act like they've never been trained to clear a jam.",1,10,19,28 June 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Dreck, Plain and Simple
","Ok, MI2 isn't going to be high art, no problem. Sure it will have improbable moments, no problem. I can accept all of those features. Bond films fall into similar categories and I generally like those. MI2 is simply unlikeable. The plot barely exists as a meaningful feature. The characters are hideous- one wonders how much Anthony Hopkins needed a pay day to show up in this one. OK, fine so the plot is swiss cheese and the characters stink is a good action film? No. The movie opens with the use of the all concealing rubber masks/voice changers and continues to overuse them as a plot device. These masks, BTW, have the incredible ability to make folks taller/shorter, thinner/fatter and come pre-scorched so they are just right for any scene. The device is not only hackneyed but obvious in every use. The martial arts sequences are again boring. Woo loves the spectacular but the fight scenes seem more designed to show off Tom Cruise's whipping hair than any martial arts skills (which I doubt Cruise of the villian-actor had much of). The motorcycle chase scenes are dull but include: an obvious computer animation gaff where the cycle hovers during a jump, a silly wire trick for a front wheelie and Tom's cycle becoming bulletproof while he hides behind it?!?! There are, by my guess, 2 action sequences (one which includes the trademark Woo two gun action)and the finale plus one short and pointless car chase in a movie that runs around 2 hours. The rest is a lot of talking by characters you'll struggle to care a whit about. Skip it.",2,0,0,30 May 2000
