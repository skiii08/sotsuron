Requiem for a Dream," let's not get carried away
","Some of the people commenting on this film have stated that much of their respect for it derives from the fact that it reflects reality, whereas mainstream films do not.  While I would never disagree with a person arguing that 'Requiem' is a powerful testimony against drug use, I strongly object to any equating of the film with reality.  We cannot get ahead of ourselves -- this and other movies reflect stories that in no way can be regarded as more than fiction.  I argue that if you're going to spend the money to see a film at the theater, it may as well be something uplifting; don't we see enough tragedy and loss in life as it is?  With that off my chest, I want to say that while effective in delivering its ultimate anti-drug message, 'Requiem' is a rather unsurprising cinematic effort.  As soon as a couple fundamental plot elements have been set in place, it becomes pretty apparent that the characters' lives will be going in a particular direction.  It's that expected direction which prevents the film's impact from being as powerful as it could have been.  'Requiem' is good, but not outstanding -- and it should be regarded as effective anti-drug propaganda rather than reality.",5,1,3,5 January 2001
