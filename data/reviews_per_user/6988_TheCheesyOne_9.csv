The Ring," Disturbing...
","I saw this movie when I was 12 and it scared the hell out of me! I thought that it was quite well made, with more symbolism than you can normally find in a recent horror movie... One of the most prominant reasons for me liking this movie a lot is the fact the Gore Verbinsky had the ability to make us scared of something not normally scary, like a TV or a tree. All in all, very freaky and disturbing movie. I give it 8/10... See it alone.",Null,0,1,15 October 2003
The Others," I loved this movie!
","I watched this twice in two days. I thought that this would be really scary, but what I got was a very suspenseful movie with great acting by Nicole Kidman (Grace) and Alakina Mann (Ann). The 3 servants were perfect in their role and even if some people say that the ending was known all along, I didn't catch it until the end... call me stupid if you want :)Nicole Kidman was great, and conveyed the message of being exhausted, frustrated and lonely very well... I even felt sympathy for her, as I do most of the 'evil' people in horror/suspense movies. Don't know why exactly, but this movie is very high on my list!",10,1,2,15 October 2003
Romeo + Juliet," Wow! Not half as bad as I thought!
","For some reason, my English teacher is on a R+J movie kick, so we watched this in class as well as the 68 version. This is really a bit of an odd idea for Romeo and Juliet, with the modern setting, but it really worked well! This was actually better than the 68 one, in my opinion. The acting is quite good, the nurse was again, hilarious (teehee), the 'friar' was slightly odd... but all in all, this really isn't a bad movie! ***/*****",Null,0,1,18 December 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Kutcher can act?! Hmm...
","I'll admit right now that the only reason I decided to see this movie was because I wanted to make fun of Ashton Kutcher in a serious role. His acting wasn't actually that bad. As for the rest of the movie, it was good. There were a couple of plot holes, like in almost any time-travel movie, but Melora Walters really stole the show as Evan Treborn's mother. Wow, that woman can act! All in all, not a bad movie. The plot is slightly lacking though, so 7/10.",Null,0,1,16 February 2004
Mystic River," Not your average mystery movie, but still great!
","***minor spoilers ahread*** I just saw this movie yesterday, and was pleasantly surprised with Clint Eastwood's direction. The movie was amazingly well made, with what I found to be great camera work, and wonderful actors. Sean Penn and Marcia Gay Harding stood out as the great actors that they are. The movie really made me want to read the book, something that few novel-adapted movies can do for me, and I was absolutely amazed at how they pulled off the strange twist ending. The movie was also free of plotholes, something I was grateful for, given that mystery movies are normally a little confusing. Mystic River kept me on the edge of my seat, and I give it 9/10.",Null,0,0,14 February 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Overrated
","Rosemary's Baby, as much as it was an interesting film, was still highly overrated. It seemed like it was going to be amazing, but the only part that was even slightly disturbing was the end. The score was mediocre and although the acting wasn't bad, I didn't find myself at all drawn into the universe of Rosemary's Baby. It was probably scarier in the seventies, but my generation, having been desensitized by violence and gratuitous special effects, doesn't all in all seem to like films like this. It wasn't terrible. It just wasn't very good. I would have thought Ruth Gordon would have saved this movie, however, but despite her great acting, this just didn't do it for me That's my two cents...6/10",Null,1,6,5 June 2004
Love Actually," For what it was, not bad.
","Whomever called this movie a cute date movie is pretty much right on the money. The acting is stellar, but how can it not be? The story lines, yes plural, in fact, very much so, are underdevelopped for the most part, and just hard to follow. This didn't stop Love Actually from being a pretty cute movie, and this coming from a die hard horror fan. It seemed cliché though, almost contrived to have all these different, interconnected love stories end up so well. Oddly enough, the only part that really struck a chord with me for no apparent reason was the storyline with Jamie the writer striking up a romance with Aurelia the cleaning lady. When they learned English/Portuguese for each other, it was really...well, cute, but just a tad cringeworthy. The weird gratuitous sex scenes weren't really offensive per se, just slightly unnecessary. The film would have definitely worked without that story line, from which I can't even remember the characters' names. The ten year old with girl problems going to his grieving stepfather for advice was *very* cliché, to the point of groaning whenever they came on screen, since I'm such a nice critic. Hugh Grant was good as the newly elected Prime Minister. Well, Hugh Grant is always good, but he was really good in this one, and the small part he had alongside Thornton was well done indeed. His romance with Nathalie, and especially that kiss at the end was perfect. All in all, there were some story lines and some actors that this film would have done fine without: The sex scene stand ins and I guess the burnt out pop singer/manager thing we could have done without. Alan Rickman was great though, and whoever played Billy Mack was very Keith Richards-ish. This has been another useless review of another weird romantic comedy. Cheers.",Null,0,2,7 November 2004
Carrie," Great movie, I loved Piper Laurie!!
","*** Spoiler Alert ***I thought that Carrie was a great movie, and I think that this is how King would have wanted his book to be portrayed in a movie. The acting was remarkable, the music gripping, the direction good, and the plot amazing, even touching at times, something that isn't usually expected of horror movies. Piper Laurie was brilliant in this, and was exactly how I had pictured Margaret White in the book. All in all, this is a really good movie, but doesn't really stick to the ending of the book too much, even though the rest is pretty similar. The ending is nonetheless great and really freaky with Carrie's bloodied hand... very freaky.",9,0,0,17 October 2003
Carrie," A classic
","This is one of my favourite movies, though I'm not sure why. I read the book and the movie isn't really the same, yet I think that Piper Laurie conveys the character of Margaret White very convincingly! Even though Stephen King regards this as not one of his best works, it will still remain a classic horror movie. Rating 9/10",9,0,1,15 October 2003
