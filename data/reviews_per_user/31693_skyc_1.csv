Ali," An athletic work of art.
","As a World Class athlete, I can relate closely to the extremely well done segments of preparation and competetion, victory and defeat.Mann and Smith certainly did put their hearts into this, because they were able to capture what it feels like to be the best in the world.Im not sure how people can 'fall asleep 3 times' during a film like this. Seems like people say they want to be 'entertained' when they want to be passively involved, (or maybe just need to get more sleep at night0This was visually and aurally beautiful, as much as it lacked any new information about Ali. But hey!! Thats exactly what film is about..images and sounds. If you want new information, read a book!Highly Recommended!",Null,0,0,17 July 2002
