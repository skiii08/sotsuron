The Avengers," Marvel at it's finest
","Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! I have been a fan of Marvel characters since I was a kid and NOTHING even comes close to being as AWESOME as this! I was however, a little disappointed in the 3d at my theater. The projector music have been set on 'darker' or something. I only saw about 1/2 of a 3d effect. I can't wait for more Marvel films to come out. The marvel characters were in full form. I did however miss Black Panther. His character is such a strong one. Of course the ladies in this film were hot as ever in their black spandex. If you are thinking about skipping this one, you are really going to miss out!",10,3,8,14 May 2012
