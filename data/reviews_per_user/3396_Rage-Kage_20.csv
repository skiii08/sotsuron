Iron Man 3," best of the trilogy
",Let me start out by saying that I am not a comic book fan and do not usually like it when a movie goes to far off of source material. That being said I loved this movie in every way. I'm going to list a few of the big complaints I have heard about this movie and then give my point of view on these arguments.1.The Mandarin: I understand why people hated this and I understand why people loved this and i personally loved it.The Mandarin twist was so unexpected if you went into the movie not knowing anything and was really well done. The way that the people involved in this movie had Aldrich Killian create the fake terrorist to scare the entire country to not only draw attention away from himself but also to benifit his plans was amazing.2.to much comedy: People have said that not only was there to much comedy in this movie but that none of it was even funny. I personally think that the comedy never took away from any serious situation in the movie and i think Robert Downey Jr. is the person to thank for that. It is true that there was a lot more comedy in this Iron Man then in any of the others but RDJ is able to be funny in a way that just seems really natural as if it was simply how he actually talks on any normal day whether he is playing a part or not. When somebody is naturaly funny like that it literally cant be forced comedy it just flows.3. Lack of Iron Man: iron Man 3 was really more of a Tony Stark movie then an Iron Man movie and i think given everything that happened to him during The Avengers that making a movie more about the man in the suit is perfect. After helping to save the world and seeing what he has seen of course he has problems and i think that this movie will prove to be an important part in his character development going into The Avengers 2.One last thing i think is worth noting is that the tone of this movie is very different then the other 2 Iron Man movies and for me it worked out really well.These things are of course all my opinions and obviously people will disagree but i gladly give Iron Man 3 a 10/10,10,4,9,27 May 2013
Gravity," An intense movie going experience
",When I first saw the trailers for Gravity start to pop up I thought that it could either be really good or really boring. When some early reviews started coming in with mostly positive things to say I started to get pretty excited to go and see it and my excitement was not wasted. Gravity was an intense interesting and overall really fun time at the movies.I've read some criticism about the scene where Cloony and Bullocks characters talk about their lives back on Earth while floating in space. People have said that the scene was completely forced into the movie and just did not need to be there. I completely disagree with that. That scene was needed and worked so well because Cloonys character (Matt) brought life on Earth up in the first place to try and calm Sandra Bullocks Character down on what was her first space mission. Considering how bad her first mission went I think what happened in that scene was just plain realistic.I would not normally recommend 3D but in this movies case I would highly recommend it.So overall Gravity was just a really cool movie I give Gravity a 9/10,9,3,5,8 October 2013
This Is the End," best comedy of the year so far
",I saw this movie opening weekend but did not review it right away because I was not sure of what I thought of it. It was not really what I was expecting. I was expecting a raunchy but light hearted comedy that took light of a bad situation but instead the apocalypse in this movie is taken very seriously. I was not so sure I liked that. But I've had over a week to think on it and I have decided that Overall I really enjoyed watching This is the End.I love the cast I think everyone in this movie is talented and really funny. They all have such great chemistry together but also all have something of their own to offer. The funniest part of the movie for me and my friends I think was a several minute long back and forth between Danny Mcbride and James Franco but I would watch the movie again for that scene alone So overall This is the End is a really fun over the top movie. I give This is the End an 8/10,8,54,85,24 June 2013
World War Z," About as good as I'd hoped
",I went into this movie not knowing if I would like it or not but also wanting to like it. I got want I had wanted from. World War Z was a fun entertaining new spin on the zombie Apocalypse story that we have all seen a million times before.The action was great and pretty intense. The CGI was not bad but not great. The actors all did a very job and overall I'd say World War Z did what it was trying to do. It never really tried to be anything other then what it was a fun summer movie about zombies. The only thing I did not really like was the number of jump scares. There were not a lot but enough and I just think jump scares are really cheap.I have not read the book I should have said that first thing but didn't.I give World War Z a 7/10,7,2,7,25 June 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A great entry in the series
",I gotta say and this is probably gonna sound pretty pathetic but I think That I can do at least a decent job justifying this. These Marvel movies have gotten to the point where they take up a decent chuck of my life. Now let me try to make that sound less pathetic real quick. I LOVE movies I love becoming immersed in different worlds to the point of where the real world does not exist for the 2 and a half hours that I'm watching a good movie and Marvel has done an amazing job building this world and Captain America the Winter Soldier is yet another amazing piece of the worlds story. I have loved all of the MCU movie so far (yes even Iron Man 2) but The Winter Soldier has probably had the biggest impact on the MCU next to The Avengers. So between actually seeing these movies and reading new details about upcoming movies I spend a fair amount of time on this movie world.As soon as this movie starts you know that you are in for a different kind of superhero movie. This movie plays out more like a spy movie than a superhero movie. It's like if James Bond was a superhero. This movie is full of rather unconventional superhero action a lot like the first one was but I think it was done much better in this one. Instead of massive and over the top fights the big battles in this movie (Involving Captain America anyway) are more like watching super powered UFC fighters going at it. Aside from the fight scenes the rest of the action is also really well done. A great example is a very intense car chase/shoot out involving Nick Fury.When there is not crazy intense action going on this movie has a very eerie tone to it. With all the mystery surrounding shield and the supposed death of Nick Fury Cap has no idea who he can trust and that gives this movie an eerily calm sense of urgency to stop whatever bad things may be coming. One of my personal favorite scenes in the entire movie is when Cap and Black Wdow find out the Shield has had HYDRA growing within the organization from the very start. When Arnim Zola is explaining how HYDRA infiltrated Shield you really get a feeling like wow this is really bad ( if your immersed in the world anyway). The overall plot of this movie just shakes the foundation of the entire Marvel world and it's really awesome to see that. When the movie ends you kinda get this feeling like the hero's lost which does not really happen that often in superhero movies.Now I definitely need to talk about my favorite villain sense Loki. The Winter Soldier is just an amazing villain who you can really sympathize with. He's brainwashed and forced to be a Russian assassin for around 70 years before Captain America is finally able to at least begin to save him in the end of this movie. The actor who played him as well as all the actors did an amazing job in their rolls and seeing as how Sebastian Stan has signed on for 9 more movie that is a very good thing. I can't wait to see him in future movies grow as a character even more than he did in this movie. There are rumors that he will replace Chris Evans as Captain America in the future and with a 9 film deal I think that that rumor is probably true. I really look forward to seeing him transition over from a villain to one of the most important heroes in the franchise.So overall Captain America the Winter Soldier was a really fun time at the movies and a great installment in the MCU. Given everything that happened in this movie I really can't wait to see what kind of state the world is in at the start of The Avengers Age of Ultron.I'm giving Captain America the Winter Soldier a 10/10,10,0,2,2 June 2014
Pacific Rim," Every bit as good as I'd hoped
",I've been really worried for months now that Pacific Rim was just not going to be able to live up to the level I had hyped myself up to but it did. From beginning to end it was just nearly non stop awesome. The visuals were amazing the fights the characters and the story were all so well done. Walking out I could not think of anything about this movie I did not like.Just to try and list off some of my favorite things there was...The characters. Though the characters did not have a ton of back story that we are shown anyway we see what we need to know. They all have there own parts to play during the apocalypse and the story though fairly simple really makes you care about those characters. I especially liked Charlie Days character I never thought I would be able to actually take him seriously because I like him so much as a comedy actor.The story. Like I said the story is simple monsters from another dimension have brought the human race to the edge of extinction. This movie does a great job at pulling you into that world so that you can experience that alongside the characters.The action. The fights in this movie were some of the most entertaining fights I've ever seen. The cgi was amazing and the whole movie was just a lot of fun to watch.I was driving home and I was trying to decide what to rate this movie and I was thinking maybe 8 or 9 but the more I thought about it the more I realized that I could not think of even one small problem that I had with the whole movie.So I give Pacific Rim a well deserved 10/10,10,2,8,13 July 2013
21 Jump Street," A great action comedy
","Okay so I'm definitely late to the party with this review but with 22 Jump Street coming out soon I decided to go ahead and review this one. I first saw this movie a while back around the time it was first released but I had not seen it since so I re watched it last night. I was pretty glad that I did it was just as good the second time around. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have surprisingly good on screen chemistry you really believe that these guys are best friends. I really don't get all the hate that Channing Tatum gets. I mean Okay I get it he's Hollywoods pretty boy but that does not automatically mean that he is not talented.One big thing that I always look for in a good comedy is at least a little substance aside from just being funny. My favorite comedy movies have more to them then just a lot of funny lines. They have a decent story and cool relatable and likable characters and this movie excels at that. As funny as this movie is there is still a lot more to it than just that. The story of these two idiots trying become better cops by uncovering a drug ring is so entertaining. I also really like how this movie knows exactly what it it is. They even go as far as to make fun of the fact that this movie is a sort of remake of an 80's TV show though the two are almost nothing alike. It's really funny to see how originally in high school Cahnning Tatum was the popular one but the second time around Jonah Hill is because things just are not the same as they were in high school just a few years ago. Though The way school was that second time is nothing like my high school experience was which ended right around the time this movie was released.Another big highlight in this movie is the great action. I don't typically come out of a comedy movie thinking wow those action scenes were cool but this movie did a great job. The car chases are intense the shoot outs are intense and it's all really funny all the way through. So overall this movie had it all a lot of comedy, cool action, good acting, and good likable characters.I give 21 Jump Street an 8/10",8,1,2,7 June 2014
Man of Steel," Superman just gained a new fan
",Im not a comic fan but I do know my way around the comic world in general and I've never liked Superman. I've never liked anything about him his powers always seemed a bit to convenient for me. He's invincible except for one fatal weakness. I also never liked his attitude he always made me feel like he was up on some pedestal looking down on everyone for all of their faults. But in this movie he was very human and he was not invincible. I was so happy to hear there was no kryptonite in this movie.Now as for the movie itself. It was really good I had a great time watching it. This was the Superman that I have always wanted to see. I've read a lot of complaints about there being to much action but with all the talk I was actually expecting more then what there really was. Yes there was a lot but it never took away from the movie in fact it added to it. It was not all just mindless explosions.As for the plot and actors anyone who knows Superman has seen it before. Zod comes to earth in search of Kal-El but this was a very refreshing take to that story. The actors all did a great job. None of their roles in the movie seemed forced in and they all had very good chemistry.So overall the tone was great the characters were great and the plot was great.I give Man of Steel a well deserved 10/10,10,0,1,14 June 2013
Now You See Me," Better then I had hoped
",I went into this movie not to sure of what to expect. I knew the basics of the plot and I knew I really liked the cast. Going in I really wanted to like this movie and I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed it.I love Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg in everything I've seen them in and this movie was no exception Between them the other 2 leads a great supporting cast and a surprisingly smart and funny story this movie was a really fun ride. I really loved Mark Ruffalo in this movie especially his twist at the end. Having loved him in The Avengers I was really happy to see that he was not just the cop who could not keep up and do his job as you are made to think throughout the movie.There is plenty more detail I could go into but I'm gonna keep this review short. So in short go see this movie if you think it looks cool it won't disappoint. I personally would really like to see a sequel seeing as how the ending was left open for one but given the box office numbers so far i'm not sure i see that happening but oh well I give Now You See Me an 8/10,8,3,8,1 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A way to reboot the series without actually rebooting it
",I've always been a big fan of the X-Men movies but I have never read the comics. So that being said I didn't hate X3 or Origins like most everybody else though I do have to admit they were definitely the weakest in the series. I was pretty excited for this new installment in the franchise especially after I started hearing some of the early reviews. I loved X-Men First Class and was really excited to see the cast of that movie and the original cast come together in one movie and this movie did not disappoint.The acting in this movie was all around great. I love the actors that were chosen to play the younger versions of the characters from the original series. Michael Fassbender in particular is just perfect for young magneto. Every time he is on screen even in first class when he was more of an hero or anti- hero there was an ominous feeling surrounding him. James McAvoy is also great as young Charles Xavier. I love how after First Class they have managed to further humanize the character. I personally like Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique a lot more then Rebecca Romijn Like with James McAvoy I just feel like she does a good job humanizing the character. Thats not to say that I think that Patrick Stewart and Rebecca Romijn did a bad job because they both did really good as well. I like Nicholas Hoult as Beast for the same general reasons I like the other younger characters and sense I already mentioned the humanizing thing a few times I'll just leave it at that and of course Wolverine was awesome as always.Some of the best action in this movie takes place in the future with the original cast. The future sentinels were great villains and really the first time in the X-Men movie series where there was a real sense of hopelessness when facing down an unbeatable enemy. Part of me wants to say that the future characters were a little underused but overall I think that for what the movie was they were in it for a good amount of time. The past had some great action to though. For example Magneto floating in the air carrying an entire stadium is definitely a highlight in the movie. Anytime Wolverine starts killing people with those claw bone or metal it really doesn't matter it's always cool. I also really like watching Beast fight I think its cool to watch the ways he fights much more like an animal then any humanI think that its really cool the way they have kind of rebooted the series without actually rebooting it by changing the time line. The writers did a great job with the time travel aspect of the story which has proved to be something that is really hard to do in other movies. I'm not saying that there were no holes in the plot what so ever but I think they will probably keep fixing some of the continuity errors as more movie in the series are released in the future so I'm not to worried about any plot holes.Overall I really liked this movie and don't have any complaintsSo I'm giving X-Men Days of Future Past a 10/10,10,2,4,31 May 2014
22 Jump Street," Not as good as the 1st but close
",I was a big fan of 21 Jump street so going into 22 Jump Street I was pretty excited and though I was not disappointed I was not blown away either. 22 Jump Street has a lot of similarities to 21 Jump Street and they even joke about that fact throughout the movie which is pretty funny. Even though it's so similar in so many ways it still seems fresh it does not just feel like a rehash of the first one. The plot revolves around Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum going to collage to catch underground drug dealers and like the first time around stupidity follows and it's pretty entertaining.The acting was all around good in this movie. I really don't understand why Channing Tatum in particular gets so much hate about his acting because just like in 21 Jump Street the fact that he is pretty much Hollywoods favorite pretty boy right now does not mean that he can't act. Jonah Hill is of course funny as always and it was also cool to see Jillian from Workaholics in something else. For me the big surprise in this movie as far as acting goes was Ice Cube. Every scene he was in was hilarious. All of the villains were good though maybe a bit generic but still for a movie that is a comedy above all else that is okay with me. For a comedy though both this movie as well as 21 Jump Street both did a great job with the action though I think it was just a tiny bit better this time around.Overall I personally liked the first movie a Little more than this one but they are still both great comedy movies and 22 Jump Street is definitely the funniest movie I have seen so far this year.I give 22 Jump Street a 8/10,8,0,4,19 June 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," About as good as the 1st
","I had pretty high expectations for The Amazing Spiderman 2 going in and for the most part it really didn't disappoint me. I love Andrew Garfield as Pete Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey as well as some of the varies side character like aunt May. I really loved the first Amazing Spiderman when it was released. I loved seeing a new much more believable take on really every character that was in the original Raimi trilogy (peter, Gwen, aunt May and Uncle Ben just for example). I found all these characters to be very likable and actually useful and intelligent unlike in the Raimi trilogy.The amazing Spiderman 2 definitely had a lot of the things I liked about the first one for example the creative way Peter uses his web shooters. I love watching him do things like putting his finger over one to make it shoot web in 2 different directions or like in the first movie when he used his web to find the lizard. I also like how Gwen Stacey is actually useful unlike Mary Jane. It's cool to see her try to find ways to help peter when he battles against the bad guys. I suppose its not official or anything but I think that aunt May knows Peter is Spiderman which is really cool because I'm pretty sure people close to him would be pretty suspicious.One thing that I really missed in this movie though was the lack of some of the side characters from the first one in particular Flash. I really liked how he started out as a jerk but turned out to be an okay guy.It was a smaller detail but I really liked the dynamics between him and Peter and I was hoping to see more of that. i have heard rumors though that Flash will become Venom in a future film so I hope that that is the case.Now I just want to give my opinion on some of the major complaints that I have heard.1. To many villains with sloppy under developed story arcs2. To much romanceI completely understand where both of these complaints come from but I have to disagree with them both. The Amazing Spiderman 2 was really more of a set up for future installments in the franchise which I know irritates people. For me though being a BIG fan of following long running TV shows and waiting all season for the big pay off of each season for whatever show I'm watching this did not bother me about the movie. I don't mind at all that this movie had a lot of set up because IMO it was an entertaining movie by itself as well. As for the romance all I really have to say is I didn't mind it because Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone work Pretty well together.So overall I really enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman 2 but I liked the first one just a little bit more. I also realize that I did a fair amount of trash talking about the Raimi trilogy which means that this review will automatically be rated down by a lot of people who see it... but oh well it's just my opinion on the 2 separate franchises.I give The Amazing Spiderman 2 an 8/10",8,31,54,1 June 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise surprises me
","I've Never really been much of a fan of Tom Cruise. I don't really know why exactly I've just never been a fan and when I first saw the trailers for Edge of Tomorrow I assumed it would be just another generic action movie. Now that I have seen this movie I am definitely ready to give Tom Cruise another chance because Edge of Tomorrow was actually really cool. Tom Cruise dies in a war against aliens and then wakes up the morning of the battle he dies in and starts all over. Emily Blunt is one of the only people that believes him and helps him understand whats happening. This movie is based off of a manga apparently but I'd never heard of it before this movie's release so I don't know if it follows its source material at all or not.Tom Cruise has definitely made some bad movies in the past but he is still a good actor. His and Emily blunts characters worked pretty well together both as a tag team in war and even as sort of a couple at some points. Watching Tom Hanks dying over and over again is pretty entertaining. It's kind of like that episode of Supernatural where Dean dies over and over again but not as funny and with a lot more sci-fi explosions. I'm definitely not a professional film critic by any stretch of the imagination. I don't know all the ins and outs of movies like someone who is more professional would but I think I can pretty safely say that the writing, directing, and editing are all pretty well done in this movie without sounding like an idiot. I'm also having kind of a hard time remembering all of the details of exactly what happened in the end because it is kind of up for interpretation which has been something that happens in some great movies. That sort of thing I personally think is a sign of good writing when done well. Obviously the ending is no where near as mind bending as movie's like The Shining but it was still pretty good.So overall even though the basic plot of Edge of Tomorrow has been done before this it is a pretty good example of it being done well. Edge of Tomorrow is a cool and entertaining science fiction movie.I'm giving Edge of Tomorrow an 8/10",8,7,9,26 June 2014
The Wolverine," Yet another great superhero movie in 2013
",I had high expectations going into this movie I love the character Wolverine and Hugh Jackman plays him perfectly. So going in I knew that there was a chance that I would be disappointed but that was not the case. I really loved the Wolverine.At first I was disappointed that we never saw how Wolverine got his memory back but I don't mind assuming that over time they came back maybe through his constant nightmares every night. Aside from that the only thing about this movie that bummed me out was that when Wolverine threw that guy off the balcony and he landed in a pool. Even though he did not know there was a pool there I could not help but think that would have been so much cooler and fitting for the character and tone of the movie if the pool had not been there.I didn't mind the lack of mutants like some people have in fact I liked that because that allowed the movie to focus completely on Wolverine. All of the characters in the Wolverine were really good they all did what they needed to do in the movie as well as help to tell the story of The Wolverine.So thats about all I have to say. The Wolverine was a great and really fun summer movie. Don't listen to the negative reviews at least not until you have seen the movie for yourself.Even with those 2 little disappointments the more I think about it the more a realize that I still think overall...The wolverine deserves a 10/10,10,8,17,27 July 2013
Iron Man," Great start for the MCU
",I have been a big fan of superhero movies every since I was 8 and the first Spiderman movie came out however I was not much of a movie fan overall until The Avengers was released in 2012. So that being said when Iron Man was first released I didn't really care. I did however see the Hulk because unlike Iron Man I had heard of him before because of the 2003 Hulk movie. I finally saw this movie in 2010 right before the release of Iron Man 2 nd have been a fan ever since. I actually did not know that all of these Marvel movies were part of the same universe until about 6 months before The Avengers was released and ever since finding that out I have been immersed into this amazing movie world that Marvel has set up.Everybody knows the plot to this movie so I don't need to go into detail. Tony Stark is taken prisoner by terrorists he creates Iron Man and escapes and beats the bad guys. It's really awesome to see Iron Man just flying around. In 2008 especially because there had not really been anything like it in a superhero movie before. The way it looks when it flys or in combat it's like watching an actually piece of advanced weaponry entering a war zone. One thing in particular that is really cool to see in this movie is Tony Stark using every possible available resource including his own mind to his advantage. Everything from first building the Iron Man suit to actually using it does a great job showing that Tony Stark is a genius. He proves even this early on in the MCU that he is Iron Man with or without the suit.The acting like everything else is of course great especially form Robert Downey Jr. Which was of course a big surprise considering he had been on the down slope for at least 10 years prior to the release of this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow did a good job as Pepper Potts though I don't particularly like her as an actor. I don't have anything against her I'm just not a big fan but with that in mind she did a good job throughout the entire trilogy as well as in her short appearance in The Avengers. Her and Robert Downey Jr. work really well together and have a good believable relationship in these movies. Terrence Howard did an OK job as Rhodey but I personally like Don Cheadle a lot more. Of course you can't go wrong with Jeff Bridges in anything so I don't even need to talk about him but I will say he makes a great villain.So overall Iron Man is a great and really entertaining movie as well as the start of an amazing universe of movies. If you've somehow managed not to see Iron Man yet... why? Between all the easter eggs from comics and other movies the tie ins and the superhero awesomness there is no reason for any comic book or movie fan to be left out of this truly amazing world that Marvel has created.I give Iron Man a 10/10,10,3,4,15 June 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The fan base is as divided as ever
","Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice has left the internet in ruin with endless arguing over whether or not the movie is actually good in a fashion that is eerily similar to what we saw with Man of Steel in 2013. The question is whether or not it is all worth it.Batman v Superman is in no way a perfect movie in fact it is a mess overall. Between obligatory cameos from other Justice League members, Lex Luthor plotting and Doomsday showing up to destroy everything in sight the whole concept of Batman fighting Superman almost feels like a subplot in its own movie. That said though all of the various different things that are thrown at the screen in this movie are all pretty cool in my opinion. Ben Affleck is an AMAZING Batman as well as Bruce Wayne. Henry Cavil though a bit under utilized as a character does a great job following up on Man of Steel. Jesse Eisenburg did a great job of portraying an insane madman and Gal Gadot did what her character needed her to do.Whether or not all of the love and the hate for this movie is warranted or not is really not up for anyone to decide. Batman is not afraid to Kill his enemies. The tone is dark and gritty in a movie that stars Superman. Lex Luthor isn't a calm and collected genius. These are all things that are very different from what DC comic fans are used to. If you don't like these things then you won't like this movie. If your like me and you love seeing all of these characters in a real world setting dealing with the realistic struggles that these characters would have then you will like this movie. In the end Batman v Superman is a movie that almost seems like it was made specifically to divide the fan base in half.For me personally Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice despite it's flaws is another win for the DCCU.8/10",8,4,8,7 April 2016
Monsters University," Fun time at the movies
",I just recently watched Monsters inc. for the first time and really enjoyed it so I decided to go see Monsters U. I was pretty happy that I did. Monsters University was an entertaining well done prequel to Monsters inc. Its like American Pie Beta House for kids. Im gonna keep this short and not go into to great of detail.I really liked seeing the characters from the first movie again especially getting to see how Mike and Sully met. I liked how at first they were not friends and had to grow as characters and work together in order to eventually get along. I also really liked seeing what kind of person Randy really is. I was expecting him to just be some jerk but really he just wants to fit in with the cool people at any cost( and yes I know that pretty much means he's a jerk but he at least has reasons for it).So the story was fun the characters were cool and it was just an overall fun movie.I give Monsters University an 8/10,8,0,0,10 August 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Another great movie in 2013
",In my personal opinion 2013 has been full of great movies such as Iron Man Star Trek and Man of Steel just to name a few. Im really happy to be able to say I can now add yet another movie to the list. Thor the Dark World was every bit as awesome as I'd hoped it would be. The story of the MCU was furthered along as well as the story of the stand alone character Thor.I loved seeing Loki once again doing what he does I loved seeing Thor evolve more as a character and I also loved seeing Thor taken from a more sci fi approach.Its great seeing these big characters being worked into a story grounded in reality but since most of this movie didn't take place on Earth they were able to take a more futuristic like approach to realistic then they have before.Overall I don't really have a whole lot to say other then that Thor the Dark World is a great entry in the MCU I give Thor the Dark World a 10/10,10,3,7,19 November 2013
Godzilla," Just about everything I wanted
",I've been unbelievably excited for this movie ever sense I first heard about the first teaser trailer shown at comic con 2012 and I was not disappointed. I've been a HUGE fan of Godzilla for as long as I can remember. I admit that the trailers especially early on were a bit misleading but that didn't stop me from loving the final product at all because what I got was a combination of everything that's great about the various Japanese movies.There was a good feeling of terror throughout the movie with the conspiracy theories and the POV shots of the monsters. Even though this movie was not as dark as I'd expected it still got the point that what was happening was bad across and for me that's good enough. It was also campy like the later movies in the Japanese series without being cheesy.Bryan Cranston was definitely a big highlight in this movie I just wish he had been in it more. When Cranston was on screen though he completely stole every scene and at this point I'd expect nothing less from him. I also completely disagree with the complaints about ATJ I think he did a great job playing his role. I think he had great chemistry with his family and I think he did a good job doing exactly what he needed to do for this role.I don't have much to say about the plot except for that it was fairly simple but did a great job paying tribute to the original while still putting a cool new twist on the origin of Godzilla. So overall Godzilla (2014) was every bit as good as I'd hoped mixing everything I love about the Japanese moviesI thought about giving Godzilla a 9/10 but the more I think about the more I realize that I cant really think of one good complaintSo I gotta give Godzilla (2014) a 10/10,10,10,21,31 May 2014
The Hangover Part III," Much better then part 2
",I'm a fan of both of the 1st 2 hangover movies though part 2 is definintly the weakest of the 3. I had some hopes for this movie that were not all that high because of things i had heard about it but I was still pretty excited to see it and for me it did not disappoint.The hangover 3 was not just a copy of the 1st one like part 2 was it actually had some originality to it and a lot of laughs. As I had expected a lot of those laughs came from Zach Galifianakis. His characters are always so stupid and random and i just love that kind of thing. That being said his co stars Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms were also very good in this movie. They are a very good counter to Zack Galifianakis's naive childish character.The plot of this movie once again revolved around getting their friend Doug back who was kidnapped rather then lost. Instead of having to retrace their steps in order to find Doug the wolfpack had to find Chow so they could trade him to John Goodmans well played character in exchange for Doug.So overall its much more original and more entertaining then the 2nd movie and well worth checking out. It was a satisfying end to the trilogy and a fun enjoyable ride. The post credit scene was one of the funniest in the movie and hinted at a possible 4th installment but as for if that would be a good idea or not I really don't know.8/10,8,4,7,27 May 2013
