The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Just simply amazing
","Everyone already knows or has heard of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, but to the people who have been labeled an outcast at least once in their life, this movie means a crap load. The movie is based on the book, in which Charlie, an anti-social, depressed and friendless teenager has come to his all time low. Right when he thought he could not handle life itself anymore, he meets two amazing people (Emma Watson and Ezra Miller). If you were ever out casted, you would know how much meeting two people means. As Charlie's bond with his friends got stronger, he finally felt as if he fit in. This particular main idea had an impact on me because it made me realize how little things, like two friends, can seriously change someones entire life forever. It made me realize how special your friends are, and how without them, you would not be the way you are. The Perks of Being a Wallflower not only brought joy to me, but also a sense of hope. If Charlie can make two friends in the emotional state he was in, anyone can do it. I would recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower to anyone who is currently/has struggled with friendships, has been or is labeled as an outcast, or who loves movies based on best selling books. This movie, and I guarantee you, will change your life some way or another; It is just simply breathtaking.",10,2,4,25 May 2013
Donnie Darko," Simply immaculate
","***MANY SPOILERS*** IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO NOT CONTINUE READING PAST THIS POINTDonnie Darko is just immaculate. Jake Gyllenhaal's role as Donnie was immaculate; everything was just simply immaculate. Donnie Darko is about a troubled teenager who gets guided through 'life' by a man in a bunny suit, named Frank. Donnie soon realizes that what Frank is making him do is outrageous, but Donnie, being the kind of person he is, accepts Franks plan, even though Donnie really kind of had to in the beginning. Donnie Darko taught me to fight for what I love, and to never, ever give up. It also taught me how people are not as they seem to be, and that everyone has a different side to them. The movie itself if extremely confusing, but with careful examination of the movie, you will understand what it is about. I recommend Donnie Darko to anyone who is into twist endings, and can read and understand movies exceptionally well. If you watch this movie, be prepared to spend around 2-3 months finding answers; it took me about two years, but it was SO worth it in the end...",10,0,2,25 May 2013
