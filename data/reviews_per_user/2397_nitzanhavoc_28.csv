Insidious: Chapter 2," Superb exquisite acting! The rest - great, but not as great as the first film...
","I must say that at the time I've heard about this somewhat illogical sequel to the Horror masterpiece that was Insidious - I was very skeptical. The first question that popped into my head was 'why?'. Why would you take the most creative, most original and innovative and absolutely best Supernatural Horror story of this decade and ruin it by adding unnecessary details and an inferior plot? True, Insidious ended with a lot of loose ends and had a very open ending, but what was so wrong with that? Many Horror films end this way, with the audience not receiving complete closure and therefore being forced to assume the worst. It's part of the Horror effect and experience, we've grown to love it!Having said all that, being a devout Horror fan and perhaps the biggest Insidious fan in my country - I couldn't ignore this sequel, and so I watched it, once to get acquainted, then a second time some months later for this review. The story and plot, as I've expected from the work of the geniuses who created the first chapter, were quite good, which is a big drop compared to the excellent and profound ones of the first chapter. The time overlaps games and how the events of this film helped to explain those of the first one were an excellent addition, definitely one of the features that made this film great! However, the attempt to 'widen' the story and encompass more characters and events (as many sequels from many different genres try to do) simply felt forced and unnecessary.The music is the same eerie, creepy and scary track from the first film (or some variation of it), the cinematography occasionally switching to a home camera view is just the way it should have been, and the unnatural beings of the 'Further' are still absolutely horrifying. Credit for these is all due to the first chapter.Which brings me to the greatest most impressive feature of this sequel, one in which it has outdone the first chapter: the acting. Acting of these profound levels, which we meet from the very start of the film, is a rare delight in modern Horror. Lindsay Seim played the supporting role of young Elise perfectly! Her body language, her facial expressions, her voice and intonations... It was like she studied Lin Shaye for years! And now, the creme de la creme: Patrick Wilson. At certain times, due to the script and plot, Wilson had to play someone else, and not his character Josh Lambert. He changed his acting, his body language and facial expressions, his voice and intonation, his personality and his character. Not since the film 'Face Off' have I seen an actor so professionally and profoundly changing his 'game' and creating a new character from scratch. Wilson has proved yet again that he is one of the best and most underrated actors nowadays. Watching him work is a privilege.All in all, comparing Insidious: Chapter 2 to the original Insidious, shows an inferior film, lacking in comparison in all fields except for the acting. However, objectively speaking - Horror mastermind James Wan (the Wan and only) has done it yet again! I'm not sure I can recommend this film in clear conscience, as the first film on its own is a masterpiece that needs no further additions. Still, if you're a true fan of the original, or of the excellent Director Wan and Leading Actor Wilson - you have got to watch this.",7,0,0,27 April 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," 6 for a good film, 10 for John Goodman's exquisite acting!
","In my opinion, a truly great film that is also part of an anthology and cinematic universe is one that can also function independently, so viewers who have never watched previous titles of the anthology (or are indeed ignorant to its existence) can still enjoy a rewarding experience. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a shining example of such a film, as its connection to the 'Cloververse' is only made apparent in the final 10-12 minutes.The story is good, though not great in my opinion. Michelle, a young women, goes through a car accident and wakes up to find herself fully medically treated for her injury, but handcuffed to her bed. Enter John Goodman (Howard), the absolute best part of the entire film, playing a role so completely removed from his regular typecast that it feels like rediscovering him for the profound actor that he is. Seen him in Roseanne or The Flintstones movie? Forget it. Or bettet yet - don't! It would only make you marvel all the more at his terrifying character and the absolute amazing acting on his part. Goodman's character turns out to be Michelle's captor, but insists that he had saved her life from 'an attack' that has made earth's environment uninhabitable. Goodman perfectly and exquisitely acts the part of a neurotic, disturbing and troubled navy veteran 'with a black belt in conspiracy theories'. Accordingly, he has slaved for years constructing a doomsday bunker with all the comforts of home.Has Michelle been kidnapped or saved? Is Howard a kindhearted savior or a deranged delusional homicidal lunatic? What indeed happened outside the bunker? All of these questioned are gradually answered as the viewer is tormented along with Michelle by not being able to know for a fact what is true and what is assumed. The ultimate conclusion could be guessed in advance by followers of the Cloverfield franchise, but others might find the ending quite surprising.All in all, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a chilling and thrilling experience of confusion, misinformation and terror. The absolutely wonderful acting by Goodman (and sufficiently good by rest of cast), the discomforting atmosphere and the suspenseful process of connecting the dots has left me personally on edge, terrified at times and applauding Goodman's acting. Honestly, I believe that even if some of you would find the film to be mediocre at best - Goodman's portray of a neurotic disturbed pseudo-antagonist would be enough to make the experience rewarding.",8,0,0,4 July 2018
Hostel," Gore and torture, as promised.
","I consider myself a devout Horror fan, and try to watch as many films of the genre as possible and of as many sub-genres as I can. However, I'm not at all a gore fan, and I don't appreciate what people describe as 'torture porn'. It's simply not what I like to watch.Therefore, it took me a long while to bring myself to watching Hostel, because of all that's been said about it. There's been a lot of buzz around Hostel and Saw here in Israel, and I absolutely adore the Saw series, so I thought it was about time to give Hostel a try. And it actually wasn't all that bad.I'd divide Hostel into three parts. First - the build-up. Three friends go backpacking in Europe, enjoying the drugs and ladies, very Eurotrip style without the comedy (except for Oli, who's the comic relief). The second - gore and torture. Some pretty disgusting gore shoots and very disturbing physical torture. Nothing more. The third - the conclusion of the story along with the 'I Spit on Your Grave' style vengeance. It might have been an attempt at a happy ending, though it merely showed that the victim became as bad as the antagonists...All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys gore and torture films, as these are the most powerful aspects of it. Personally, as someone who doesn't like gore and torture (have I said gore and torture yet? Well, gore and torture, plenty of it), I could have easily managed without.",7,0,0,15 December 2012
Hostel," Torture, gore, but so much more.
","It's important to start off by saying that I am not, in any way, a fan of gore or torture porn. I fins these Horror sub-genres to be in very poor taste at best. I recognize zero cinematic or otherwise artistic value in blowing your arts and visual effects budget on blood, puss and other bodily fluids, or severed organs (particularly when I 'get to' watch them actually being severed). I don't enjoy it and I try to avoid films flaunting the use of these features the way Hostel did. Still, after all the buzz, I simply had to check it out.I'm writing this review after watching it for the second, and it seems I have forgotten pretty much everything but the main plot revolving around torture. Indeed, there are plenty of scenes I would have rather not watch, but let's give credit when it's due - Hostel is far from tasteless. The gory scenes are not just out there for no reason, but in order to present a realistic and believable human phenomenon as both the main fear factor and a pinch of social criticism. What keeps you afraid is not the use of cheap jump scares (blissfully absent in this film) nor the disgusting gore, it's how you relate to the characters and experience the fear of what's about to happen to them through their eyes and experiences. The build up towards the torture, as people are tied up and realize that every single type of pain is about to be inflicted and there's nothing they can do about it, received more screen time than the torture itself. The helplessness and terror are delivered professionally and amazingly.On this note, the film is absolutely taken to the next level by Eli Roth's direction of the characters and the cast's ability to play the role in the most professional and impressive way possible. Jay Hernandez (Paxton) and Derek Richardson (Josh) played the terror of anticipating their impending torture in a manner that was terrifying and authentic, stressing what a raw deal they received in their casting in Suicide Squad and Dumb and Dumber respectively. Barbara Nedeljakova (Natalya) and Jana Kaderabkova (Svetlana) are so much more than eye candy (though admittedly not painful to look at to say the least) as the hostel's occupants, delivering their role in the most realistic manner imaginable. And to top it all - Rick Hoffman (American Client) and Petr Janis (German Surgeon) are as discomforting, terrifying and revolting as you'd expect, meeting every possible standard.Originally, I rated Hostel a 5, due to being younger, less experienced and honestly less fair. It's improper to criticize a gore torture flick for showing gore and torture, I know that now. My new more appropriate rate is 7, meant to reflect the overall level of the film while accounting for what I found to be a wanting plot and an unfortunate lack of a final twist. Also, some of the scenes were simply too much and frankly unnecessary. If you're a fan of gore and torture porn - you're in for a real treat. If you're not - think hard before you decide to watch this, as it will take you places you might not have wanted to visit or experience.",7,2,5,12 January 2019
The Babadook," Drama-Horror hybrid at its finest, for what it's worth. Or: How acting and mood make a good film great.
","The first word that came to mind when I tried to think how I would eventually review and rate this film was 'different'. The Babadook is absolutely different. I wouldn't say unique, or one of a kind, but it definitely has its own uniqueness which makes it unlike other films, and a lot better than most. Now, let me try and verbally describe the sensations brought upon by watching this.First of all, the the plot is successful in being intriguing and fascinating regardless to having a pretty ordinary story. A mother and her small neurotic child face a supernatural being. We've seen it in the Hollywood adaptation of The Ring, ans in many other films whose names I am simply unable to recall at the moment. And, the inter-character dynamics and the slow downward spiral into insanity and despair make the suspense strong enough to overcome the overall mood and ambiance.Second, as I've just mentioned, the mood and ambiance. The characters, the acting, the cinematography and the story create an almost unbearable sensation of discomfort, awkwardness and uneasiness. One could almost taste the stress, strain and frustration gone through by the mother, as well the fear and despair of the child. In a way, watching The Babadook is like going through a mental breakdown. More Drama than Horror, yet excellently executed and serves the overall sensation very well.The acting is in all ways superb. The lead roles by Essie Davis (Amelia) and Noah Wiseman (her son Samuel) are absolutely marvelous, and the supporting cast isn't any less amazing. One could understand the main plot and the relationships and dynamics between the characters simply by watching the actors and actresses do their job. As a viewer who is always impressed by young characters, Wiseman's acting was in my opinion the best, but altogether the acting is way more realistic, authentic and disbelief suspending than the usual Hollywood acting in Horror films.As for the supernatural part, we don't really see the Babadook, but we definitely feel its presence and its relentless grip on the main characters. The effects are just right, not too flamboyant yet not lacking, And of course, the book... Dear Lord, that book is probably responsible to 50% of the Horror motive of this film, if not more. The film also uses some jump scares emphasized by the eerie aggressive soundtrack, but these only serve to support the overall sensation of haunting and fear, not to solely create them.There were some parts of the film I didn't like, of course. As a six year old boy, Wiseman's character is way too capable if you ask me, not to mention way to courageous... That is not how I would expect a 6 year old to deal with a supernatural evil terrorizing him and his mother, and how he'd been able to create his 'toy' weapons is beyond me... Also, the ending wasn't only anticlimactic but a flat disappointment. I'm not only referring to the lack of plot twists, but to the complete lack of logic and accordance with the plot. That film deserved a better ending.All in all, I can't say this film was 'fun' to watch. The uneasy awkward feeling it gives throughout most of it is not enjoyable. Then again, it isn't meant to be. While most Horror films dealing with supernatural evils and the haunting of characters aim mainly for fear, the Babadook uses the plot tools usually utilized by different sub-genres like the ones dealing with torture, hunts, murderers and such others. It is still, in my opinion, a great film achieving precisely the goals set out by it. I don't think I'll be watching it again, but I would definitely recommend it to Horror fans looking for something new, innovative and refreshing in a genre that usually fails in breaking the boundaries of old.",7,1,5,18 January 2015
Resident Evil: Extinction," Nothing more than Chapter 3.
","As a Horror fan who has learnt of Resident Evil not through the original Capcom game, but through the Hollywood films, I've very much enjoyed the first film, and very much more the second. Extinction, the third title in the Resident Evil anthology, on the other hand, has very little (if at all) cinematic value besides being another chapter in the story.The screenplay is nice and fits right in with the rest of them, but in this case lacks the good plot twists we've learnt to expect after the first two films. The story connects beautifully with the ending of the second film, is a great start for the coming fourth, but not that goo on its own. Not much good or bad can be said about the script.The acting by the cast is good as always, Milla Jovovich and Oded Fehr are a great as they've been before, and Ali Larter (as this film's female addition to Jovovich) isn't another Femme Fatale like in the first two films, but more of a leader. Not much good or bad can be said about the direction and cinematography.All in all, as I've said, besides being a nice conclusion to chapter 2 and a preparation for chapter 4 - chapter 3 isn't much. Definitely my least favorite of the series so far. I very much hope that Afterlife will return to the glory of the first two films.",5,2,4,21 May 2013
Cloverfield," I am NOT a fan of Found Footage, but wow... Simply wow!!!
","I've only recently grown accustomed to Found Footage films, giving them a chance as a Horror enthusiast who ran out on other Netflix options. I'm not yet a fan, but having recently had some positive experiences and remembering the finer qualities of 10 Cloverfield Lane, I've decided to check out the film that gave birth to J. J. Abrams 'Cloververse'. Wow, was I ever in for a surprise.Cloverfield tells the story of a group of friends in their mid-twenties, celebrating protagonist Rob (Michael Stahl-David)'s move to Japan after receiving a big promotion. As the exposition progresses, it's made apparent that Rob is in love with Beth (Odette Annable), and the film jumps between the currently documented events and previous events filmed prior on the same tape (showing Rob and Beth). Suddenly, something huge and unnatural attacks Manhattan, and the group attempts to run for their lives while doing their best to save each other.So far everything sounds corny, banal and mediocre, but trust me, it's everything but. Everything I dislike about Found Footage is beautifully improved upon in Cloverfield: the acting and characters feel authentic without presumptuous tendencies of being 'overly real', the plot actually makes sense (minus, of course, the huge 1950's monster), and mty favorite - there is actually a legitimate explanation as to why on earth they keep the camera rolling while running for their lives (which is a lot more that the human crave for attention despite all logic).Cloverfield got me really immersed, at the edge of my seat hoping for the characters' success and love's victory over disaster. Again, sounds corny, but I couldn't help myself. I was on edge the entire film (since the attack) and haven't for one moment felt anything ruining my suspense of disbelief (and I'm a cynical douche at times, especially when it comes to Horror, I have no idea how this film managed to disarm me so, but it did). It's been a while since I've watched a Horror film that felt like it ended too soon for me (not because it did, but because I enjoyed it so much). I'm in absolute awe of how fun great watching this was. Also, without giving any spoilers, the final touch is given towards the end of the credits, so stay tuned!It is of course a matter of opinion. Some of you might hate this film, others might find it to be mediocre at best (a phrase I have used often to describe numerous Horror films), but I simply won't be able to forgive myself if I don't wholeheartedly recommend that you quit reading my fanboy rambling and go watch this. I envy you for being about to experience this film for the first time.",9,1,1,2 August 2018
Final Destination 2," Average film, good sequel, doesn't live up to the first.
","After finally getting to watching the first film, I've just watched this one last night, hoping it's as good as the first. Let's start off by saying it's not. I did have plenty of criticism for certain aspects of the first film (especially to do with the work of director James Wong), but unlike the first film - this one was never going to be as groundbreaking, original and inspiring.Not unlike the first film, the story kicks off with a group of youngsters on their way to to party somehow somewhere. During the drive, Kimberly (the driver) has a vision which makes her pull over, ultimately saving the lives of the people stuck behind her on the highway. When the survivors begin dying, Kimberly seeks out Clear Rivers, one of the survivors of the famous plane explosion from the first film, in hopes that she could help her and her new friends 'break the pattern' and 'beat death's design'. The only original addition is new information shared by the creepy mortician (always great to see Candyman Tony Todd, eerie and unnerving as ever).Besides the obvious lack of originality or even the slightest attempt to offer something new plot and story-wise, Final Destination 2 suffers from two obvious shortcomings (in my opinion of course): First, any attempt to compensate for a lacking story with over-intensified gore scenes is low class in my book; and second, the deaths seem too supernatural, much more than in the first film. Where in the first film some water leak, causing the victim to slip - this time the amount of 'coincidents' leading to each 'freak accident' feel too much like divine (or unholy) intervention, too deliberate and too far fetched. Not as convincing, not as reasonable, not as good.The small attempt at a plot twist towards the ending isn't successful, and the ending itself is far too comical (again, not unlike the first film). All in all, as a standalone film the film is average at best, and as a sequel - not more than good. It's still a lot of fun to watch after the first, and it definitely isn't a bad film or a reason to quit on the anthology, it just very obviously could have been better.",6,0,2,18 June 2016
Split," Definitely recommended, just bare in mind this could have been a solid 10 film. Unfortunate.
","I'd like to start off by saying that most of what this review is about to be is a statement of the obvious. Therefore, it starts with me stating the obvious and recommending that while you do take what myself and others have to say to your attention (as it's obviously of some interest to you or wouldn't have been reading this now) you shouldn't let any review, be it negative or positive, deter you from giving Split a fair chance. I'm about to dish out some criticism which might even exceed the compliments, and I still urge you to watch it. It's worth that if not more.So first of all, like previous titles (namely 6 Souls / Shelter, which is pretty decent by its own right and also worth watching) Split not only fails in offering an even remotely accurate account of Dissociative Identity Disorder (NOT the same as Split Personality, by the way) - but obviously doesn't even try. Not to mention it's another one of these films in which the actual fear factor staying with the viewers weeks after is their ignorance of mental illnesses and their fear of the unfamiliar sadly translated to stigma. I am far from being a 'woke' activist, but come on, at least try to get with the times, or at least not to make things worse for those battling psychological disorders.Second, directly related to the aforementioned is the blunt use of pseudo-science (and I use the term loosely as there is hardly anything scientific about the portrayal of DID in the film). Using ignorance in order to present disinformation that ends up being perceived as disturbing and even terrifying only on account of said ignorance is not 'cheating', it's simply a little cheap. And speaking of cheap - how could I ignore the plot twist and ending? Imagine somebody is asked to prepare a meat dinner. The guests arrive, the aroma surrounding the dining area is exquisite, and the host presents their creation - hamburgers. The ending of Split is equivalent to that scenario, in which the agreed upon rules have not been broken per se - only taken too literally and used to exploit an obvious loophole of which the decent thing would have been to ignore or at least overlook. The shift in definitions in order to fake a twist and the 10 seconds guest appearance in order to justify it are just like a hamburger diner - undoubtedly satisfying, even good, but cheap.Which brings me to the acting. If anyone wasn't yet aware that antagonist James McAvoy is a superb actor, for instance if they missed on out on all the newer X-Men films, Split is absolutely a good way to become informed. He's professional, authentic and by all means a delight and the best feature of the film. Which is exactly the problem. Acting the role of different personalities (and operatively different people) residing inside the mind (and to all relevant extents body) of the same individual is really having to act the role of different characters, at times one after the other or even having a conversation with each other. McAvoy does that exquisitely, but simply not enough so. His impressive acting abilities only serve to emphasize this shortcoming, as it feels he's doing everything right yet still getting it wrong. I personally felt very aware that I was watching an act and completely lost all hopes of immersion (perhaps the most important component of a worthy viewing experience when it comes to Psychological Thrillers accidentally tagged by some as Horror). It didn't feel like different personalities in certain times, it felt like an actor failing to adopt the proper minute variations of body language, facial expressions and speech intonation. Very frustrating considering that after watching McAvoy's profound skills I simply feel this mission cannot be accomplished (I would be overjoyed to be proven wrong).The rest of the cast, while not nearly as impressive as McAvoy, have also performed in a level worthy of commending, and still wanting. The incredible Anna Taylor-Joy who had been excellent in The VVitch was great in Split, delivering a very relatable portray of a teenager dealing with severe childhood trauma. And yet, while most 'teenage girls' stereotypic characters tend to be stereotypically and quite annoyingly overdramatic - Casey is under-dramatic to a fault. I do believe direction to blame, but still, you can't show her obviously terrified and yet so preposterously calm. As for Betty Buckley as the conflicted psychiatrist - again, impressive, but not nearly charismatic enough to confidingly deliver the character of an experienced professional. Again, I can only blame direction for these two cases of botched acting, as the cast seemed more than capable to deliver a better performance by far.Having said all that - none of this criticism is experienced over the surface while watching. Split is suspenseful, entertaining and smart and I personally had a great time watching it, as I would have a great time feasting on that hamburger dinner. The reason that I unfortunately had so much criticism was that Split could have, should have and would have been a masterpiece with better direction and just a little more effort by Master M. Night. It makes me personally sad to see such wasted potential and such a mediocre utilization of God given talent. And yet, I've enjoyed watching it and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to just about anyone.This has unintentionally been my longest review as of yet. If you've read this far, thank you!",7,0,1,4 January 2019
The Conjuring 2," First Saw, then Insidious, and now this. Another Horror Masterpiece by the Wan and Only!
","In this day and age, where Horror very seldom receives the attention and praises of which it is so worthy, creators of Horror films have to constantly challenge themselves with aspirations of newer heights. If you didn't successfully reinvent the wheel and improved on it - you project probably won't be as successful as others from different genres. 'If you want a good Horror film', say the critics and reviewers, 'make a great one. If you want a great one - make a masterpiece'. 'Is that so?' says genius director-screenwriter James Wan, 'challenge accepted!'At first, I must say I was slightly disappointed having realized that The Conjuring 2 isn't a straight sequel, and doesn't pick up after the events of the first film (as I was looking forward to getting some long overdue answers and closure). The sequel, in short, as another crazy Ed & Lorraine Warren adventure, beginning with a fine and well deserving tribute to the famous Amityville incident. Her premonitions still haunting her, Lorraine hopes to convince Ed to stop their work as Possession/Haunting 911, but the two find themselves unable to send away a family in need, who is haunted and terrorized by yet another malevolent entity of the underworld. Nothing new so far - but only because I'm refraining from spoilers. Towards the final third of the film, Wan presents one of the best, most off-guard catching twists since Insidious.As in the first film and the less impressive spin-off 'Annabelle', the story is divided into the main plot (Ed & Lorraine to the rescue vs. haunting spirit), and a side-plot portraying an entity haunting the couple itself. Both come to a closure in a suspenseful, creative and innovative manner as only Wan has been able to produce in the past decade. The story is compelling, interesting and well presented, and the conclusion is absolutely marvelous!As in the previous film, Patrick Wilson is extraordinary and Vera Farmiga is only slightly less impressive. Patrick McAuley deserves as many complements for such fine acting skill at such a young age. However, the show is breathtakingly stolen by Madison Wolfe as little Janet, the spirit's main point of interest. In the first film I thought I'd seen the pinnacle of 'possessed'-acting, but just as Wan was able to higher the stakes of writing and direction - Wolfe presented a whole new level of exquisite acting.In addition, The Conjuring presented one of the scariest Horror icons ever seen on screen (being Annabelle, the nightmare-inducing doll). I really hadn't expected Wan to be able to top that. Surprise surprise, he did. The painting and appearance of the 'nun-demon' in this film is one of the most terrifying images I've ever seen, very much resembling the haunting spirit in Insidious, yet not enough to qualify as recycling.As for the other info some might find interesting - the music and soundtrack are as 'Wan' as can be, combining haunting thrilling tunes with nursery rhymes, with the addition of a religious song. Hey, if it worked so greatly in Insidious, why change it? The cinematography is nothing special, but this goes unnoticed during the films. In addition, just like in the first film, cliché jump- scares are almost non-existent, and the very few that do appear are in very good taste.In summary, the creator of Saw and Insidious has done it again, placing The Conjuring franchise right at the top with the best of them. I never have high expectations of sequels, but I tell you, Wan is going to make a believer out of me yet. I had to think a lot about the rating I was going to give this film, but the final plot twist (which is of a whole new level and never seen before) made it an easier decision. If you are in any way a fan of Horror - go watch the first film, and then this one. You'll be happy (and terrified) that you did.",10,2,5,10 October 2016
Resident Evil," Resident Evil - Father of the 'zombie virus' idea? Even if not, excellent zombie film!
","As a devout Horror fan, I suggest that Zombie flicks are sort of a different genre. It could be considered a sub-genre of Horror, much like Ghost Stories and 'Torture Porn', but it's more unique in it's differences, I reckon. I've seen my share of Zombie flicks. Most of them, like world famous Dawn of the Dead, take place in a zombie infected reality, where few survivors try to live through the aftermath of an apocalypse. Resident Evil predates most of the films of the passed decade, and the best thing - it shows the factors that lead to the zombie apocalypse. I must confess that I have no prior experience with the title, not the Comic books nor the animated films. But I very much enjoyed this film!The screenplay and story feel unoriginal, but if anyone knows of the first film that has come up with the idea of a major corporation developing a virus that turns people into zombies, then gets released somehow and infects the world - let me know, because I don't. White Zombie was released in 1932, but involved Voodoo rather than a virus. Resident Evil probably ins't the first, but it was there before many others. The story is great, with good plot twists and delightfully surprising turn of events.This film might not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a great and fun to watch zombies film. The acting is good (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez of course, but I also liked James Purefoy as Spencer). Direction and cinematography are also good, done just right for such a film. I've watched this intending to continue and watch all the anthology, all the way to the latest 2012 film, including the animated films. It seems I'm in for quite a ride!",7,1,2,16 May 2013
It Follows," A modern 80's classic. Not a masterpiece, some distinct shortcomings, but great nonetheless.
","As most of us Horror fans are well aware of, shooting a Horror film is usually a very unrewarding experience when fame and fortune are considered. It is not a very popular genre, regardless to a loyal and growing fan-base worldwide. In It Follows, writer-director David Robert Mitchell took on an additional challenge - creating an artistic classic inspired by the prominent differentiated style of the 80's. The sales compared to the budget may have deemed the project a failure, but any and every Horror fan out there who would give it a chance would have an extraordinary experience!Everything about It Follows feels like a blast from the past, being an obvious tribute to decades past. The story is quite generic - some supernatural creature following and tormenting its victims. The costumes, acting, lighting and cinematography all resemble the distinct style of the 80's. Even the television sets are old, heavy and round-screened, showing old black and white films. The best feature in this regard is the soundtrack - original, retro and authentic, giving the sensation of watching a film from 30 years ago.Even the socio-political subliminal messages are from a time past. The creature's victims are chosen after having sexual relations, protesting promiscuity and extent sexual freedom. The conversations between the characters (for instance, the '8 mile speech' mentioned in the quotes) criticize racism and geographic profiling. These messages, banal as they are in this day and age, were extremely popular back in the 80's.The acting is right on the spot. Body language, intonations, sensations of fear, even the sex scenes - all seem 'older' and much less intense and 'in your face' than modern Hollywood. Considering the cast is mostly in its early to mid 20's, they obviously had to expand their abilities and learn how to make their acting style older and more traditional. I personally enjoy modern Horror and prefer it, yet can't ignore the skills displayed by the cast. Very impressive!The downside of the film is the use of certain unnecessary cheats. While the female cast doesn't look like porn actresses with completely flat bellies and huge silicon breasts (and even the bathing suites aren't bikinis, not to mention that bathing suites were actually used instead of showing skinny dip scenes which have become quite popular in modern Slashers) - many scenes (especially of the creature) portray nudity. In addition, one of the first scenes shows very violent graphics. I can't help but feel frustrated with this. Both the violence and the nudity are completely redundant and unnecessary, and feel like a silly attempt at forcing an R rating. The eerie and creepy mood would have wanted for nothing without these cheats, and I honestly can't comprehend why Mitchell decided to use them.However - It Follows gains lots of points for avoiding the use of cheap jump-scares. The situations described in the story and the sympathy with the characters are what make it scary, not stereotypical 'Boo!' moments. I would have liked to see certain plot twists and a better story development (not to mention a better more climactic ending), but even without the film seems to achieve all that it aims for.In summary, I would definitely recommend It Follows to any Horror fan looking for something different and more intelligent, as well as to cinema fans who enjoy the artistic nuances. Not the best, but far from the worst!",7,0,2,4 March 2016
Insidious," The best non-Asian Ghost Story I've seen, and one of the best Horror films in history!!!
","This has actually been the second time I've watched this film. I remembered it was excellent and terrifying, I just didn't remember how much! Now I've seen it again so I could review and rate it, and even though I remembered the twists and the ending, it still scared the living daylight out of me!I usually start off with the build-up and the story, but in this case I'll save the best for last. The acting has been absolutely excellent by the entire cast! I've especially enjoyed the slight and subtle comic relief by Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson as Specs and Tucker. They give a few seconds of comic atmosphere, enough to give us a breather from being absolutely terrified, and not enough to spoil the overall sensation of utter fear. Speaking of utter fear - the cinematography and sound effects have also been excellent, right on the spot for a Ghost Story Horror sub-genre. So far the scariest ghosts I've seen have been in The Ring and The Grudge, so I'm a big fan of the Japanese way of portraying a ghost. In this case - the macabre style spirits have really frightened me, especially the 'frame-cut' shots where moment second they are expressionless and then suddenly they smile a neurotic deranged smile.Now for the best part - the story. The build up is a little slow and slightly empty of event to the point of boredom, but becomes packed with fear and thrill at just the right time, proving that patience pays off. As for the story - in one word, wow! During the past years, at least from my experience as a devout Horror freak in general and a huge fan of Ghost Stories in particular, in such films the main focus is on the haunting's physical manifestations (moving furniture, shattered light- bulbs, doors opening/closing suddenly etc.) and/or on the ghost itself. Very few screenplays have a truly genius, original and horrifying story (with the exception of The Haunting in Connecticut where the story is original as it is brilliant). In Insidious, however, the screen writing has been, in my opinion, flawless. Almost perfect. An original and simply excellent idea, using Astral Projection as the connection to the world of spirits. It's been long since I've been so impressed. I'd like to shake the hands of writer Leigh Whannell and director James Wan for creating one of the best Horror films in history.Now for some criticism, or what this time I call 'why I'm not giving Insidious a perfect 10'. Without giving any spoilers - I just want to say I was very disappointed with 'the demon' that's mentioned towards the middle... the way it's visually portrayed is so banal, so obvious and unoriginal, and that's very obvious in such a film where the main idea is as original and superb as it is. Why use such a cheap and terrible overdone design? Simply a shame... However, that's the one and only thing I didn't like. EDIT: I've just now looked at the overall rating here, and I'm furious. So I'm going to do what I feel is right, be subjective, and rate it 10 for justice's sake. Shame on the IMDb raters for this film!!!All in all - I think Insidious just might be the best non Asian Ghost Story I've ever seen. I can't recommend it enough. I'm a grown man and an experienced Horror fan, and I don't scare easily. And yet, Insidious will give me nightmares. Don't you dare miss out on this one!",10,0,2,1 April 2013
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," The perfect sequel! Hollywood, take note: This is how a sequel is done!
","After watching the first Resident Evil, I've thought it to be the best zombie virus film I've seen. Now, after watching Apocalypse, I know I was right. The definition of a good sequel is that it picks up where the first film has ended, smoothly continues, leaves no loose ends and unanswered questions, doesn't open itself to plot holes, and takes the rules made by the first film to a new and improved level. Resident Evil: Apocalypse does all of these, and in a nearly perfect way. In my opinion, it's easily in the top 5 of the best sequels ever made. Another thing I liked, is that it shows features that we've seen before (or will see later) in other famous films in their respective genres, like Terminator, The Matrix, The Descent and pretty much ever new zombie flick made in the 21st century. Resident Evil is probably the hottest name in the zombie film industry, and by right.The screenplay and story are excellent, although the name is slightly misleading - the only place going through a 'zombie apocalypse' is Raccoon City, not the entire world as the name (and the end scene in the first film) imply. Perhaps Resident Evil: Raccoon City would have been a better name, but never mind that. The plot involves everything we've learnt and today know to want and expect to see. An area infected by zombies, survivors trying to escape/live through the ordeal, and excellent action scenes of battles. As for the new and evolved rules - they're absolutely there and are very exciting, but I wouldn't want to risk spoilers.The acting is excellent. Milla Jovovich is as talented, beautiful and deadly as in the first film, and is this time joined by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, the perfect femme fatal! I also liked Jarred Harris's roll as Dr. Ashford, but altogether a great work by the entire cast!Direction and cinematography are also great, featuring some terminator style shots from the point of view of the beings controlled by the Umbrella Corporation. The soundtrack is also just the way it should be in a zombie flick.It took me to this week to familiarize myself with the Resident Evil anthology, and not a moment too soon. I only wish I'd known it years ago. As a big fan of the Underworld anthology, I salute the better predecessor. I know I'm about to have a great time watching the rest of the Resident Evil films, including the animated ones. This film in particular is, as I've said, better than the first, and leaves plenty of room for more improvements (or a devastating fall from grace) in the third. The perfect sequel!",9,4,6,17 May 2013
Drag Me to Hell," I'm an easy grader who rarely trashes anything. But this is pure trash.
","I may have seen just one too many horror films, or one to few.OK, the old lady started off as being real creepy, a very good feature that could have been played as the ace in the hole. Instead? She spent the entire film vomiting gore out of her mouth into others' mouths. How lovely, thanks for that! Now I'm not a gore fan, not one bit. And even if I were - this was the toilet humor level of gore. Plain filth with no art what so ever.OK, story is nice, in its own predictable non original juvenile way. There have been enough films that dealt with curses and evil spirits, this has to be the worst I've seen. Even the so-called 'moral' of the story is self righteous and condescending... cheap. Very cheap. Not karma, but self indulgence. The only times you might find yourself frightened is when the oldest cheap shot cheat in the book is played - something happens quickly and suddenly and loud audio forces you to twitch. Like a 13 year old bringing a wild card to a Texas Hold'em table.Now, the grand finale - the '''twist'''. So obvious, so predictable, so insultingly blunt... next time try putting a little more work to the story writing, Raimi bros, instead of blowing through 30 million dollars on corny Michael Bay effects. This wasn't supposed to be an action film with explosions and fire, it was supposed to be horror, as in scary, as in good.I apologize, this review didn't come out objective. That's only because I will never get 99 minutes back, and am both frustrated and disappointed. I wouldn't mind a low level twist, I'd even prefer no twist at all than such a lame one. Maybe a 12 year old watching the first Horror film in their lives could have somehow missed that... And the ending doesn't even follow up on the twist! I mean COME ON!I'm going to be as objective as I can and rate this film 3. If anyone asks me - I'll recommend watching 99 minutes of static white noise on a dead channel before going through the non-existing effort of hitting the play button on this one.",2,0,2,14 November 2012
Mama," Original story, fine acting, some frightening scenes... Then the ending spoiled it for me
","As a devout horror fan for over a decade now, there are very few sub-genres I haven't encountered during my ever ongoing search for the thrill of fear. Still, Mama has managed to take me by surprise. This film, in my opinion, is simply too... well, different. So in this review I face the challenging task of being objective even though I did not really enjoy it.I have my issues with the plot, though I find it to be quite original and innovative, a trait modern Horror sadly lacks in most films. A husband and father has a breakdown due to a financial crisis, kills his wife and takes his daughters to a deserted remote cabin, with the intention of killing them too. However, something stops him. Something protects the girls and cares for them, helping them survive in the wild for 5 years. So far - so good, and quite impressive! Cinematography features a little too many jump scares, which I personally enjoy, but recognize for being a cheap stunt. A true Horror prodigy scares the audience using the story and characters, not sudden loud music with a frightening antagonist. Still, I especially enjoyed a certain scene where a flash camera is used instead of a flashlight, very much like the Horror game Outlast.As for the acting, I always find myself impressed with young actors and actresses, and Mama has a few of these. Megan Charpentier as 8 year old Victoria shows some real promising potential, and so does little Morgan McGarry as young 3 year old Victoria, even though she has very little lines and has to mostly relay on facial expressions and body language. Speaking of which - Isabelle Nelisse as little 6 year old Lilly takes the grand prize for acting in this film, playing her role perfectly! In addition, I must also pay my respects to leading actress Jessica Chastain. I had absolutely loved her in Zero Dark Thirty, yet failed to recognize her in this film as Annabelle. Playing such a different role in such a professional and successful manner really shows a lot of hard work combined with some God given talent, always a pleasure!I also must be fair and admit that the character of Mama (played by Javier Botete, yes, a male actor, how impressive/weird/awesome/messed up is that?) was one of the scarier that I've seen so far. This is one of these rare occasions where Hollywood really gives Asian Horror a run for its money. Not since Ju-On (The Grudge) has a voice/sound caused me that much distress. Surprisingly, I've learnt that credit here is due to Jane Moffat, who plays Aunt Jean, and is also responsible for the voice of Mama. Talk about chills...So if I have so many compliments to the plot and crew, where is the problem? That would be the ending. Horror films are not supposed to have a happy ending, true, but this ending didn't feel frightening, simply sad. Heartbreaking, to be more accurate. And given that this is the ending, it's also the feeling with which I finished the film. For me, the ending of a Horror film is extremely important in setting the overall experience, and ending a film with sadness and pain rather than fear is a big setback.So all in all, I must be fair and say that this is film is good, maybe even very good. A good film which I ultimately did not enjoy. I would say, as I do always - watch it yourselves and be your own judges. After a long personal debate, I've decided to go with a 7 rather than my originally planned 6. Mama has earned this much.",7,2,3,15 January 2015
Sinister," Lots of 'boo!' moments, but very well done. Scared me silly!
","EDITED: Feb. 27, after 2nd watch.I've just finished watching Sinister, and I must confess that my heart is still pounding. I hate to say it, but it made me jump in my seat a few times. Why do I hate to say it? Because as a devout and pretty experienced Horror fan, I really find it hard to respect films that use 'cheats' (i.e slow shooting with very dark lighting, suddenly a frightening shot with a blast of loud bass music) that appeal more to a viewer's physiology than their logic and fear. Still, if you're gonna use that 'cheat', then this is definitely the way to do so! Sometimes it's real fun being scared like that.I didn't find the screenplay and story to be all that original, as we've seen many films using very similar backgrounds, but I did like it. Gruesome murders, missing children, found footage as part of the plot (rather than the entire film being a 'mockumentary'), and one Ethan Hawk trying to get to the bottom of all while fighting to save his career and keep his family and marriage from paying the price. Pretty decent, yet pretty generic.Sinister uses elements from different sub-genres and adds them up together to give the viewer a very healthy scare. I especially liked the fact that the audience can't really know what type of Horror film this is (Ghosts? Slasher/Murderer? Occult/Supernatural? All of the above?) until around the middle, and that unlike in other films - in this case the plot synopsis here doesn't spoil it. The acting was also good, though mainly by the rest of the cast (for instance Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley as the two children, or Fred Dalton Thompson and James Ransone as the Sheriff and Deputy), I don't really appreciate Ethan Hawk's obvious overacting in this one (though I guess his acting is like pineapple as a pizza topping, you either like it or you don't).As for the ending, I always enjoy Horror more when a clever plot twist is applied, enhancing the feeling of suspense and the using the element of surprise to increase the overall sensation of fear (very much like psycho-thriller films). In Sinister, the ending doesn't involve such a twist per se, but it definitely binds together many pieces of information and succeeds in being unpredictable and horrifying (even when watching for the 2nd time!)One of the best features of this film is the original soundtrack, which is dark and eerie and definitely takes the overall feeling of discomfort to a new level. This is especially noticed when the protagonist watches the old silent films.Like I've said, if you're going to appeal to the audience's physiology and jump from behind the closet shouting 'boo!', do it right, and Sinister definitely does it right! Very very few Horror films in this day and age don't use any 'cheats' at all, and when done well enough - the 'boo!' thing isn't really that much of a cheat. I've really enjoyed watching this film, and would recommend it to anyone who fancies themselves a tough viewer. Sit at home alone, turn off the lights, and watch this. It was 8:30 a.m when I first watched it, and it still scared me silly.",8,6,7,7 May 2013
Don't Breathe," Cheap and unpolished, still suspenseful and entertaining.
","For honesty and coherence's sake I'll start off by saying I gave Don't Breathe a 6 out of 10. It's compelling, keeps you on edge and at times truly shocking without allowing itself to be pulled into anything too cliché. Pretty much all the makings of a decent modern Horror film not dealing with the supernatural, definitely achieving its initially set goals both story-wise and cinema-wise.Having said that, the film is (in my humble opinion of course, feel more than free to disagree) quite frankly cheap and enjoyable despite it, not due to it. First, the cheap psychological trick of presenting the villains (no, they are NOT anti-heroes, simply a bunch of misfit delinquents forming a street gang of egotistical spoiled brats) as the protagonists from the exposition to the very end. Three jerks who decide to break into a war veteran and bereaved father in order to rob him of his settlement funds (his sole livelihood), and the audience is coerced into sympathizing with them on account of the female coming from a messed up home with an abusing mother and the male being a slightly dorky 'good guy' in love with her. The screen time they are given achieved the effect of making us (or me at least) secretly (or not quite so) root for them despite them being the obvious bad guys from the get go.Second, the fear and shock factors are as cheap as they come. Jump scares as the only truly 'frightening' feature. Dark secrets revealed which flip the script and imply that there are no good guys in this film (so much for the film avoiding clichés). And my favorite - the 'antagonist' (again, a 50+ year old veteran protecting his house and wealth from a bunch of no good would be burglars) being a hybrid of Superman and God, easily able to overpower a youngster half his age and twice his size, survive two hammer swings hitting him straight on the back of the head and escape handcuffs. Perhaps this was a supernatural Horror film after all.Third, the sheer stupidity of certain scenes for the sake of the plot instead of choosing one of a million other more authentic and realistic options. Like the war veteran suddenly losing his accuracy and missing the kid he tries stabbing with garden shears when he's literally on top of him, moments after he was able to track said kid using his hearing alone and hit him with a pistol bullet form the other end of the hall. The bullet of course didn't kill the kid, as that would have made far too much sense. That's not just foolish, it's cheating.Yes, the film is fun to watch even if you aren't able to ignore all those blunt shortcomings. It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing and hoping. Some scenes are truly shocking regardless of being cheap and overall result is definitely worth watching. Just please don't be fooled by the relatively high score Don't Breathe has received here on IMDB (yes, that's pretty high, people here get a kick out of trashing excellent Horror films) and don't expect 2016's Horror masterpiece. Aside from the great acting nothing about this film should have been as it was, and it wouldn't have been all that challenging to make it better or at least less cheap.",6,0,1,2 January 2019
The Witch," The real challange was finding a reason not to rate 10. Stop reading and go watch.
","Often when reviewing Horror films (my favorite genre) I discuss the acute necessity of lowered expectations if one hopes to enjoy, as sadly this undervalued genre lacks the investment (professional, financial and creative) it so rightfully deserves. More often than not a film of the genre graced with a great trailer, an intriguing poster or any form of positive publicity (mostly informal) is devoid of any remotely sufficient quality of story, acting or cinematics. However, in regards to The Witch - worry not. Bring on your highest expectations and be mentally prepared to trash this film as soon as it's finished, it would do you no good. In my opinion, The Witch is one of the best Horror films you'll watch.Everything about The Witch feels classical and fancy, as something about the combination between Little House in the Prairie and Poltergeist hits the atmospheric spot perfectly. The setting, while simple almost to the point of being unimpressive (but just almost), is original and very seldom implemented in such a terrifying plot. The story revolves around William and his Family, a stereotypically devout (even fanatic) Christian family from 19th century New England. After leaving their community on account of its inhabitants not being sufficiently Christian by William's judgement, the family establishes their own little homeland in a nearby rural plain. A wooden shack, a farm, a stock of barnyard animals and the satisfaction of a hard day's work and doing well by one's cherrished deity. That is, until a mysterious and nefarious force begins to torment the family, weakening their faith as well as their family ties and letting their paranoia drive them apart to the point of hatered.The acting is superb by all members of the cast, particularly the breathtaking Anya Taylor-Joy (daughter Thomasin). You know all these slasher films casting eye candies with mediocre and unconvincing acting? Forget them. Taylor-Joy is genuinely authentic and professional aside from being captivating like a renaissance model. Harvey Scrimshaw (her brother, Caleb) also with a superb performance, damaged somewhat solely by what is obviously a direction error. Ralph Ineson (William) is also a pleasure to watch and experience. Aside from the acting skills, the casting has been as accurate and clever as can be (probably along with some excellent writing, directing and art-dress-makeup). Each and every character feels real, authentic and compelling, making me personally feel like each and every cast member was made for their role. Enough to warrant a 6.5 even if this has been the film's sole quality. It isn't. Not remotely.The story is an emotional roller-coaster, sharply and almost violently dragging the viewer from sadness to anticipation, from suspense to fear, from pity to anger. Indeed, the dark force tormenting the family seems to affect the viewers similarly, drawing them into the story and making the entire experience all the more horrific. It isn't a literary masterpiece, but a good screenplay needs not be to achieve its goal. It only needs to tell a compelling and clever story with the right dosage of fear. Add to that the 19th century setting, the old English texts and the farmhand costumes - and you feel like you're told an old terrifying folktale. An absolute pleasure!The only aspect in which I felt the film didn't fulfill its potential was the ending. A worthy attempt to create a plot twist was indeed made, but unsuccessfully. The ending feels like the worst part of the film, the least exciting and not at all frightening. From certain perspectives one might even consider it a happy ending, which is completely out of touch with the mood the film worked so hard to create. In a word: anticlimactic, the all too familiar bane and curse of the genre. While The Witch is simply that good as to not suffer in quality on this fault's account - I can't help but feel disappointed, as it really was one good ending (not even great, just good and better than the actual one) from being a Horror masterpiece.In summary? I can't remain objective, I loved this film too much. I simply feel obligated to encourage each and every cinema fan to turn off the lights and watch The Witch, preferably at night and home alone. Of course, many of you might disagree with me, it's a matter of subjective preferences after all, but I personally am grateful for the experience The Witch has put me through.",9,8,15,25 June 2018
30 Days of Night," Best vampires I've ever seen!
","I've really had low expectations, if any, when I set out to watch this film. I've had no information about the original comic strip, or the cast, or anything save for the short synopsis. Surprisingly, 30 Days of Night turned out to be the best film of the Monsters/Vampires sub-genre I've seen in a while, if not ever.The story and build up are great, and really suitable for a vampires flick. An Alaskan town going through a full month with no sunlight, what grounds could be more fertile for a vampires attack? The perfect combination of supernatural with fitting realistic set-up. The exposition is carried out through the uncovering of the preparations for the attack, and continues to show the way the few survivors struggle to survive, giving us some aspects of post-apocalyptic and zombies films. The plot is pretty straight forward, simple and lacking in any challenging complexity or twists, but then again the plot is not the 'main feature' of this film, not by far.The entire cast has done a great job in my opinion, and I for one have been most impressed by Mark Rendall in the role of Jake, the main protagonist's kid brother. Script and cinematography have also been done just right. However, the best part of the film and the one that truly made it shine above all others which resemble it - has definitely been the vampires themselves. I'm not sure who deserves the credit for the amazing and almost perfect way in which the vampires have been designed and portrayed - but I've never seen better. These vampires weren't Victorian nobles like in Interview With the Vampire, not elitist pseudo- Goths like in the Blade trilogy. They were far from human despite having humanoid skeleton, limbs and such exterior organs. Their eyes, jaws, teeth and movement were savage and feral like beasts. Their banshee-like shrieks of communication and their authentic language topped it off, and really made them more alien-beast than human. I salute those in charge of creating these nightmarish creatures.This has been the second time I've seen this film, this time as a preparation for the much anticipated sequel. I really hope it lives up to this film's standards. While lacking any real twists in the not that complicated plot - 30 Days of Nights just might be the best vampires film I've ever seen. Very, very highly recommended!",9,2,4,21 February 2013
The Conjuring," The Wan and only, the Maestro of Horror, has done it yet again!
","As a devout Horror fan, I've seen pretty much every sub-genre there is, from Torture Porn to Comedy Horror. I must say that usually when asked, I say that Ghost Story is my favorite of the sub-genres, especially the Asian ones were the ghosts connect with my inner child and scare the living daylight out of the poor thing. However, films dealing with exorcisms and haunting / possession come as a very close second, especially when it's a good one like The Exorcism of Emily Rose or The Unborn. As of late, a new sub-genre has joined the list as no. 1 and as the best Horror international cinema has to offer: James Wan films. It has taken me a while to figure out that the best Horror I've seen in the passed 10 years has all been made thanks to that amazingly talented Writer-Director: The Saw Series, Insidious and Dead Silence are masterpieces in my book. Now, The Conjuring happily and rightfully joins the list.The acting by Patrick Wilson is excellent. While his character is usually a little timid and not all that impressive, Wilson has truly proved profound acting skills playing the charismatic Ed Warren. Yet the really pleasant surprise is by far Lili Taylor as the mother of the family whose house is haunted. I haven't seen Taylor since Mel Gibson's Ransom, and had to look her up in order to even realize that, but if she never acts again this part shall be remembered as her moment of pure glory. I have seen many actors playing the part, and she still managed to amaze me. I believe 'Bravo!!!' sums it up.The story is great, and with all due respect to 'based on real events' - I credit that to Wan. A perfect combination of Ghost Story and Haunting / Exorcism, interesting and compelling with great suspense. The script is even better, and I've been really impressed with how many classic jump-scare moments simply didn't happen! No cheap tricks, no cheats, nothing! At first the ghosts manage to frighten the audience without even appearing in the shot. We do see them eventually, but in two (maybe three) scenes only. The only criticism I have - without giving away any spoilers, there are two scenes I've noticed where the characters suffer a pretty serious fall, then get up with not so much as a sprained ankle. Suspense of disbelief is critical in such 'supernatural' Horror films, and making the characters miraculously immune to falls slightly damaged it for me. Along with that, I was going to say the ending was slightly anti-climactic, and that I personally felt that the plot set us up for an ending that had never arrived. Then I saw that there is (or about to be) a sequel, which I'm anticipating greatly!As for soundtrack and cinematography, I didn't notice anything too impressive or even worth mentioning (which takes absolutely nothing away from this excellent film).All in all - the slight almost non-existent criticism I've mentioned is the only reason I'm not rating this 10. I've seen a review claiming The Conjuring is better than Insidious, and while I find it difficult to agree - it is an excellent film, a fine piece of Horror, and another great achievement by the Wan and only. I recommend this film to any Horror fan out there. Re-reading all I've just written for editing reasons, I realize that my words don't commune clearly enough how much I've enjoyed watching this film. Take my word for it - this is one of the best Horror films you'll ever see.",9,1,3,15 March 2014
The Woman in Black," Nothing Special
","Ghost Stories have always been my absolute favourite sub-genre of Horror. On that account, I've watched dozens of them, any film I could get my hands on. Judging from my personal experience and subjective preferences - The Woman in Black had never had a chance of being anything more than ordinary, perhaps reaching to good.When it comes to portraying ghosts and apparitions, the Asians, who are the true masters of the field, have set the bar real high with their famous ghost stories such as The Grudge. In this field, I must say The Woman in Black has done an excellent job! The ghost is as horrifying as could be, the apparitions of the children are eerie and terrifying, and the jump-scares (while a cheap cinematic trick) are done just right.Unfortunately, this concludes all possible praises I could give the film, with the exception of Ciaran Hinds playing the role of Sam Daily in a more than satisfactory manner. Harry Potter (aka Daniel Radcliffe) can only be compared to Johnny Depp's character in Sleepy Hollow, and unsurprisingly this comparison doesn't flatter him. He lacks the charisma and screen presence of other actors of the genre, and his acting simply 'doesn't cut it'. The plot and script are mediocre at best, nothing innovative or original, no noticeable creativity, nothing out of the ordinary we haven't seen before in many other films. I don't know if this criticism is to be given to screenwriter Jane Goldman and director James Watkins (this is by far not the best work of either) or to novelist Susan Hill, but the story isn't profound in any way.All in all, I can't say I didn't enjoy this film. It's a fun watch, scary at times, and isn't altogether disappointing for those of use who don't get carried away to unrealistic expectations. You could find many better and many worst.",6,0,0,28 April 2015
Final Destination," Excellent story, could have easily been a masterpiece with better direction.
","While being a devout Horror fan for over a decade, I must sadly confess that I've missed out on many of the classics, by which I mean that even if I did end up eventually watching them, I was far too old to really appreciate them (and have thus lost most of the scare-effect in classics such as Children of the Corn, The Omen, Village of the Damned, and don't even get me started on Chucky). Thankfully, Final Destination is simply an excellent film, and therefore immortal.The story altogether is original and compelling, showing a teenager which an obvious fear of flights getting a premonition of his plain bursting into flames. Thus he discovers his power to comprehend and anticipate death's 'pattern', thereby avoiding it. What he doesn't realize before it's too late is that nobody cheats death. At first the story feels a little mixed up and not too well presented, even considering director James Wong's former known project (The X Files). With no build up whatsoever, the unfolding of the story feels like a long episode of the cult series, for better or for worse. Also, certain parts of the story are simply left out, and the audience is left with the sole option of figuring things out relying on later scenes. While not a dire shortcoming - this still feels amateurish and bluntly unnecessary, especially considering the few seconds it would have taken to set things right.Then there's the acting, or more appropriately the cast. As a huge fan of both SLC Punk and Idle Hands, I simply couldn't take Devon Sawa as a serious (even tragic) character. I kept half expecting the joke or wise crack to magically appear around him, and that's the last thing one would want while watching a Horror film. Luckily I'd never realized he played the role of Stan in Eminem's music video, or it would have been ruined for me too. I assume this is a personal problem, as Sawa is a great actor and performs beautifully, and yet. Then of course there's the slightly weird choice of casting Steven Stifler as Billy (which brings us to the question - why have a Billy in the first place? Such films have absolutely zero need for a comic relief, this is not a slasher parody). After his immortal performance in American Pie (and later Road Trip), even seeing his face in a Horror film severely damages the sensation of fear and suspense. Lastly, Kristen Cloke as Miss Lewton. Having a young high- school teacher is a risky move, and takes some talented maneuvering to pull off (for instance Drew Barrymore in Donnie Darco). Cloke, while obviously a talented actress following bad directing instructions, is far too timid and overdoes the whole damsel in distress routine. Having such a character as a teacher, after presented as strong and secure at first, felt unrealistic (yes, I realize she's been traumatized, yet as I've said - overdoing it).Then, of course, the ending, following a very weak plot twist (if it can even qualify as one) and being as predictable as one could imagine, and far too comical. If Sawa and Scott were too comic for my personal liking, the ending is simply too comical for the average Horror viewer. With such an ending as the wrapping paper, the entire project stinks of 'I want to be mainstream'. This is Horror... why try and be mainstream instead of trying to make a better film?Please understand, the reason I have so much concrete criticism isn't by far that Final Destination is a bad film. On the contrary, the original and innovative story (even today, 16 years later! Hats off to screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick) could and would have been enough to make this film a masterpiece. Sadly, all these bad choices by Wong turned what could have been an excellent film, to just a good film. Such potential gone to waste...All in all, I had a great time watching this. While obviously more Suspense than Horror, it's definitely one of the classics, and if at 30 and 16 years after its debut it still managed to leave such an impressive mark on me - I can't recommend it enough.",7,1,2,17 June 2016
The Purge," Profoundly original, terribly underrated
","Even though I had heard of this film around the time of its debut, I only got around to actually watching it now. My main conclusion is that I should have watched it sooner, and the only slightly secondary conclusion is that (as always when Horror is considered) one must never rely on IMDb raters when choosing a film. At the time of this review, the film is rated 5.6, which is no less than an atrocity of justice in my opinion as a devout Horror fan.Like many other Horror titles, the strongest and best aspect of The Purge is the story. In an alternate reality, the US has been able to make unemployment, crime and violence almost extinct, thanks to a new 'national holiday' known as The Purge, which takes place annually on the night of March 21st. During that night, for 12 hours, any and all crimes (with the main focus given to murder) are decriminalized, in order to allow Americans to 'purge' themselves of hatred, anger and violence by committing heinous acts against their fellow citizens.It's no coincidence that I've chosen to describe March 21st as a 'national holiday', as the film presents it as nothing less: there's a special holiday greeting ('safe night!'), special television broadcasts, and everyday conversations referring to a night of violence and murder as any other mundane annual traditional celebration. Purging is not just a custom, it's a civil right no different than the first and second amendments. The reality presented is original and groundbreaking, offering philosophical moral dilemmas (the individual vs. the collective) for the audience to debate amongst itself throughout the film.The plot revolves around the Sandin family, with whom the first connection to The Purge is established as the father is a successful salesman of home security systems (used mainly to defend families locking themselves indoors to survive The Purge). Ethan Hawke is, I must say, less than impressive and not the best casting choice for the part. The plot thickens when the family's youngest son (a lot of unfulfilled potential shown by young actor Max Burkholder) notices a man crying for help on the screen showing live feed from the security camera, and decides to unlock the doors and let him in. Soon after, a group of experienced revelers arrive at the Sandins' door and demand that they turn in the man, lest they break into the house and exercise their right to purge on the entire family. Rhys Wakefield demonstrates profound and unparalleled acting skills as the leader of the group, with facial expressions, body language and diction that run chills through the viewers.What is the 'right' thing to do? Should a father sacrifice a stranger in order to save his family? Is something morally allowed just because it is legalized? These questions are only some of the thinking process beautifully forced on the audience of The Purge. As a Horror feature, it is mediocre at best, and in my opinion fails to replicate the thrilling tension bar set by other titles such as The Strangers. However, combined with the ethical dilemmas and the original story, The Purge offers an excellent viewing experience which I would highly recommend to anyone (even non-Horror fans). I was going to rate it a well earnt 7, but seeing as how other reviewers have made it so annoyingly underrated - I chose to give it an 8, in a futile attempt to salvage some justice.",8,0,2,7 January 2016
Cube," To paraphrase Saucy Jack - 'Years from now people will look back and say that Cube gave birth to 21st century Psychological Horror'. It sure did.
","I've always been a devout fan of story-centered Horror films with smart and surprising plot twists and endings. To me, these films (for instance many titles by James Wan) embody the perfect combination of Horror and Psychological Thriller (most titles of the Saw anthology come to mind as a shining example). As a fan of such, I must pay proper respects to Cube, which just might be the title that had originally presented this particular sub-genre years before the first Saw reinvented it (even though it sadly fails to deliver an actual plot twist).As the plot summary and trailers have most likely told you already - Cube begins, continues and ends with the struggle of six strangers who awake to a living nightmare in which they're trapped inside a giant maze rigged with traps. The way I see it, Cube relies on three main features. First, the film's main feature is deception, as everything we're made to think we know about each character on one hand and their devastatingly discomforting predicament on the other first comes into question and later, at times, shatters completely. This serves as a metonymic representation of the fact that nothing around is familiar, known of comprehendible, both in the maze and in the characters' lives as part of human society.The second feature is discomfort, which has become a key characteristic of many modern Horror films that have crossed the classical boundaries of a haunting ghost or a hunting killer. From the start, the main antagonist is the setting (i.e. the maze), into which the characters have been forced and out of which they barely have a prayer of escaping. As stress, fatigue and of course hunger and dehydration are gradually added to the equation - the characters become paranoid and distrustful, sometimes for good reasons. The genius single location and lack of any flashbacks and past/future scenes only serve to enhance the sensation of discomfort: there's nowhere and no time to which the characters can escape, the nightmare is real and is the only thing that exists for them.The third and less profound feature is the philosophical dimension added by the characters' different perceptions and attitudes regarding life's rules of conduct and terms of endeavor, so to say. As they discuss and relate their own individual explanation to their situation - questions of life, humanity and personality arise, making the viewer constantly think and ponder while following the characters' attempts at survival and escape. While this might have been considered a relief from the aforementioned sense of discomfort (since focusing on anything but the reality of the nightmarish predicament might give a false sense of hope) - it turns out it actually feeds the fear and despair, as each explanation is both realistic and authentic (to the extent you'd attribute logic and rationale to conspiracy theories and sci-fi scenarios) and more terrible than the other.The acting is professional and excellent, the story is original and innovative and the plot is compelling and suspenseful, always keeping the viewer on edge. Even the minimalistic soundtrack is great, although too much resembling a Slasher theme in my opinion. The only let down for me had been, as I mentioned in the beginning, the blunt lack of an actual plot twist, or an actual ending. While the open ending could be considered another element of discomfort and lack of clarity - I firmly believe a smart plot twist would have made this film perfect.And yet, made over two decades ago - Cube still sets a standard few Horror and Psychological Thriller titles manage to meet today. It isn't frightening of that scary (as it doesn't really rely on fear), but a true psychological Horror combining discomfort, torture, despair and pursuit which manage to exquisitely deliver every stressful and agonizing sensation to the viewing audience. While this is solely my personal opinion - I can't recommend this film enough, even to those who aren't particularly fond of Horror films.",8,3,5,29 March 2019
Cube," Original, compelling, excellent!
","Throughout the years, I've kept running into Cube on TV, but I've never watched it from beginning to end until just now. I'm not usually that big a fan of Sci-Fi films, but in this case I must make an exception, as Cube is simply spectacular. As a devout Horror fan, my favorite anthology is the Saw series, and watching Cube really give me a clue as to where it got its ideas from.The film has a very short exposition, basically showing us people stuck in the cube. Every room either has a death trap, or doesn't. The prisoners must figure out how to get out, or die trying. The screenplay/story is original, compelling, interesting and exquisitely smart, excellent job by the writers. We even get a few twists, though not really shocking ones, mostly about the group dynamics of the prisoners. Some smarter twists could have really made the film even better. The acting is excellent by the entire cast, all characters are portrayed perfectly. Personally I've been most impressed with Andrew Miller as Kazan. Making a single-location film is always a challenge, to which Cube has stood up in the best way possible.Cube leaves many questions asked, and I doubt the two sequels answer them. The audience is left to wonder, question, and fear. While not exactly a Horror film, Cube is definitely a masterpiece. Very very highly recommended!",8,0,3,28 April 2013
Annihilation," Alex Garland presents: How to destroy a film that could have been great
","You know how sometimes you really want to like and enjoy a film, but it simply doesn't let you? Annihilation is a perfect example. As a devout Horror fan who's normally on good terms with Netflix films (despite the usually mediocre level at best), Annihilator's trailer really got me excited. Natalie Portman in a Horror film featuring a natural environment and mutated predators similar to the best features of Avatar? What could possibly go wrong?! Unfortunately, the answer is everything.Annihilation is two different films at least. The first 90 minutes portray an excellent story with a compelling plot. Portman, a former-soldier current-biologist, follows an all-female crew into an unexplained phenomenon codenamed 'The Shimmer' in order to discover what about it has made her husband (a soldier who recently returned from there) suffer from complete organ failure. The acting is excellent, the characters are relatable and the all-female cast is far from being a political statement (this isn't a 'women studies film' nor a 'chick-flick'). The ambiance is suspenseful and eerie, as you find yourself actually concerned for the future and welfare of all characters involved. As the predators become increasingly dangerous, one can't help but cheer Lena (Portman's character) on as her commitment to her husband aids her in overcoming all obstacles.And then? The final 25 minutes or so completely, utterly and unorthodoxly destroy the film. And by destroy I mean shatter, crush and evaporate any and every good thing about the story, plot and overall sense and mood. It feels like the screenwriter and director had absolutely no idea what they were doing and how to conclude the plot, so they decided to drop a little LSD and let it dictate the colors, soundtrack and general occurrences of the final scenes. I honestly have no idea why they would do that. The film was great, it was working, it was achieving all the goals the build-up had set up. Why allow for such a clumsy and extreme shift from suspense and horror to forced sci-fi? Honestly, why?! I haven't seen such a waste of talent and potential since the legendary Michal Jordan became a Baseball player.All in all, I can't find it in me to objectively rate this film. The first 90 minutes are a solid 8 in my opinion, with the final 25 deserving a zero, if not a negative rating. The resulting rating of 4 feels unjust for the first part and way too forgiving for the 2nd. Honestly, the cast didn't deserve to have their project destroyed so. Annoying, disappointing and truly sad. So, if you're a student or scholar of film, cinema, sound, philosophy or the sorts and are looking to study and analyze a piece - this film might be just right for you, your professor would probably appreciate an interpretation drawing from social, behavioral and existential theories. However, if like me you're just a common spectator looking for a fun viewing experience - do NOT watch this. I'm sorry, Natalie, you sure deserved better.",4,0,2,16 June 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," A Clever Satire or What You Thought You Knew About Horror Movies
","You know? I was going to really trash this movie. I don't usually, but when I expect good ol' fashioned horror and get a comedy instead, it's hard for me to not feel disappointed, even a little cheated. Then I read the review that was randomly chosen to appear on this page, and I finally got it: this is a parody. Not a completely silly (not to say dumb) comic parody like the Scary Movie series, but an old fashioned satire like Scream.The movie starts off like your usual teen horror with all the elements present. A bunch of friends going on vacation, get slightly lost, meet a creepy fella in a deserted gas station, fail to recognize the warning, reach the isolated place and start getting butchered. Their roles are even as stereotypical as can be (Jock, slut, nerd, stoner and good-girl) but are portrayed in a very satirical way (the stoner is the smart one, and the jock reads?!). Then, as time goes by, it adds pretty much every element of every sub-genre in the wide spectrum of Horror (cult, sacrifices, zombies, ghosts, monsters, cat and mouse chase, being trapped, pretty much everything you can possibly imagine...) This movie obviously set out to not meet the casual expectations, and did a fine job at it.If you're looking for a good scare - stop. There isn't a scary scene in this movie, not one. However - if you're looking for a good laugh, you've hit the jackpot. Almost every time the stoner (superb acting by Fran Kranz) opened his mouth - I ended up laughing, sometimes hysterically.And of course, the All-Star monster assembly, which appeared as if it were taken directly from a Family Guy flashback scene. I thought it was ridiculously absurd, until I realized that was the point.I don't like writing spoiler reviews, but I can tell you that I don't think there's a way to spoil the ending. This movie isn't about surprising twists, impressive dialogues or a smart script. It's as I mentioned before, a clever satire meant to make fun of the Horror genre.Since I'd been disappointed because I expected something else, I wasn't really sure how to rate this. It's a hilarious comedy and an excellent satire, but it simply isn't a horror movie.",6,0,4,8 October 2012
