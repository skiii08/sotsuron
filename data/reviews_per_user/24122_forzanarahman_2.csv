The Lobster," pretentious
","I didn't realize until half way through the movie. In the end I kept skipping the film it was so boring, because it kept trying to be quirky. And the French dialogue just made it so obvious. Also the dancing with the head phones in, yep we get it you're different. But the dialogue was just so annoying. You could tell they were trying to hard to be abnormal. The blonde French girl- her acting is just- she just looks like she's being smug, just because she's in an 'arr film'. And in the end I don't get why Colin and Rachel (can't remember character names) were running, they didn't need to. And why did he Sta himself- that just makes him useless.",1,2,2,4 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," boring
","Soooooo boring. I wish I could skip all the parts that weren't about David and the other robot. I actually forgot his name. I thought it was going to be strongly influenced by religion like Prometheus, but it wasn't. It was more like a mish mash between b horror movies and ... Something else? Oh it was dark too.",Null,1,2,21 July 2017
