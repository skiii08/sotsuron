Requiem for a Dream," A horrific, yet beautifully poetic film about the desperation of addiction.
","Wow! My wife will never let me pick the movie ever again. She actually said that after walking out at the end of this one.Aranofsky should be proud, however. I don't want to give away too much, but let's just say that the film pulls you in to the world of drug addiction in a gripping, sickening, and unrelenting manner. See it, but be warned--this is not the feel-good hit of the holiday season.Tremendous performances. Much more accessible than PI. And fast-paced editing and stylish camera work.Go watch the film--just don't see the film on a 'first date.'",Null,0,0,11 December 2000
