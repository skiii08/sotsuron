Skyfall," im only like 20 minutes in and felt compelled to leave a rating
","haven't used IMDb in years but had to rate this movie. I've seen a lot of movies and im very reasonable to just accepting holes in plots or looking the other way on things that don't make sense but this movie has been awful. as most people explained the 100 foot drop after being shot with a high powered rifle and then after the drop into a river (not a deep lake) falls off a waterfall while unconscious yet still survives. at this point i thought the movie was the dumbest thing id seen since broken arrow or con air but then i had to pause after bond goes back to London to see M and he says he heard her say 'take the shot' meaning he had to have heard his partner say 'i don't have a clear shot earlier' why didn't he just take a step back then? what gets me is how critics rate movies. I've seen some pretty bad ratings before on movies i actually thought were pretty good, maybe just some bad acting but while this movie may have good acting its got too many holes to ignore.",3,3,8,1 January 2014
