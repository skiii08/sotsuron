Blade Runner 2049," Modern day masterpiece
","This is a beautiful, impactful and touching movie. Everyone, cast and crew are at the top of their profession. This movie will be taught in film schools.",10,1,16,16 December 2018
Us," 3/10 for the good middle 3/10th of a nonsense movie
","The movie begins with 30mins of frankly unnecessary sequence of people going from point As to point Bs either in their homes or outside....after the first act reveal, the movie does grip you with the plot. You start to root for the family. The action is unique and thrilling too. However, the movie goes off the rails in a bad way... It is expected from the audience to appreciate whatever turds it drops in the final resolution. They say some movies are made for critics. This may be one of those. I really have no idea what it was trying to do. Any movie where I have to go to Reddit to understand its far-fetched 'themes' shouldn't be called a good movie. Also you can literally pick the logic of the plot apart in like 10 seconds if you bother yourself to think about this mess....'Tunnels' lolololo",3,0,1,2 June 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," An engaging movie with a misfired conclusion.
",You hope till the last moment of the film that some reveal or a moment will justify everything in the build up. In the end it is such an easy/cheesy way to conclude what was a really interesting premise and journey. The audience deserves better.,6,0,1,26 December 2018
