10 Cloverfield Lane," John Goodman owns the film
","Over the years, John Goodman has matured into an accomplished actor, and here he hauls out every nuance he's honed during his long career. At turns he is either folksy or terrifying, transforming from one to the other within seconds. The only other actor I can think of who has added this kind of depth and range in his later years would be Michael McKean and his outstanding performance in Better Call Saul.Unfortunately if we're talking about believable actors and their contribution to a willing suspension of disbelief, Mary Winstead and John Gallagher are just okay; neither one of them is very convincing in their respective roles. Michelle should be terrified and isn't, not even at the very end when she casually kills a giant monster with a molotov cocktail, something every dressmaker instinctively knows how to do. Emmett is a dimwit who isn't enough of a dimwit. Either go full dimwit or not at all, there is no in-between. I couldn't figure out why Howard even let him into the bunker, what purpose does he serve?The drama is gripping for 75% of the film until it turns into something very different and unexpected, as implied above, the end scene hinting at the now mandatory franchise serialization cliff hanger demanded by the bean-counters at all the major studios so the next film in the series can hook onto it. It's disappointing and pretentious but what are you going to do, it is what it is.",8,1,2,3 September 2017
Catch Me If You Can," The Sara Lee of films
","***This review contains spoilers***The biggest problem I have with this film is the same one I had with Coppolla's `Dracula':  this film is a hodgepodge of vignettes, less a continuous stream than a series of carefully crafted scenes.  Normally the editing process of a film patches the scenes together into a unified whole, so that the resulting film flows, but in this film nearly every scene opens and closes like its own little film, leaving little room for character development.  I have no idea what motivates Frank Abagnale, for example. One might be tempted to look at the failure of the family business or his parents' divorce as a catalyst, but still we are given absolutely no insight into the character.  It would have been nice to see the characters given a little humanity instead of looking and acting like stiff background characters from some crappy 1960s cartoon.In one of the most bald-faced product placements I've ever seen, three FBI agents, including Hanks, are invited in to Franks's mother's house for `Sara Lee'.  One of the agents says:  `nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.'  That might be true if the only food you've ever eaten is tree bark, but the waxy, unsatisfying desserts offered by Sara Lee are the Keanu Reeves of the dessert world:  they look good, but have no substance.
Situations arise and disappear like zephyrs.  Why does Frank apply for the job at the hospital, did he get tired of being a pilot?  He gets the job at the hospital, okay that's simultaneously interesting and funny, but then what happens?  Does he quit, is he fired?  How does the girl get back together with her parents, did they forgive her, does she keep her job? How did Frank perform as an attorney?  When and how did he buy a house in Atlanta?  Who are all those people at his house?  What was the deal with model/prostitute?  The whole scene served absolutely no purpose.  There are dozens and dozens of unanswered questions such as these, from start to finish, leaving a curiously empty, unsatisfying feeling, much like eating a frozen dessert made with artificial chemicals.  That Sara Lee gets such a high-profile product placement in this film is no coincidence, I am sure.Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances as Frank's father. Like Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story, Walken's face tells more about the character than anything he could ever say.  His performance is so rich and deep that he should be nominated for best supporting actor.  LDC, having shown so much promise in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' is merely adequate in the role of Frank Abagnale; he's no Christopher Walken, that's for sure.  Hanks plays himself, doing his best Robin Williams impression of Tom Hanks playing a dramatic role, occasionally raising his voice just like he's been doing since Bosom Buddies.  Hanks is the Sara Lee of actors.All in all, this is an interesting film, albeit a curiously empty one. The day after you watch it, you won't remember any of it.",1,25,58,5 November 2003
The Ring," A complex, layered film that is an unsatisfying imitation of The Sixth Sense
","***There are spoilers in this review***I doubt that any medium has ever captured so many shades of blue as this film has.  The cinematography is gorgeous:  the pacific northwest, in all its rainy, forested glory, is wonderfully depicted in this luscious movie.As much as this film strives to rid itself of its Hollywood-horror movie roots, unfortunately it falls back into them again, as evidenced by the fact that there are not just one but two prescient, sepulchral children (an old Hollywood standby), one of them so evil that her mother kills her.  The premise of this film is intriguing:  a strange videotape surfaces at a remote cabin, four teenagers die, and there's a big mystery.  The object is to solve the mystery before you die.  This film isn't as scary as the beginning would have you believe.  Much of the time is spent solving the mystery of the weird video, which, as the film nears its conclusion, is clear that it was most likely shot and edited somewhere in the afterworld.  Seems like a ghost would use a higher-quality medium like a DVD.  Evil characters usually make sense, but Samara's motivations make none.  Why a videocassette?  Why kill people seven days after they watch it, why not just roam the world killing people indiscriminately?  Why would Richard Morgan steal the videocassette of Samara's psyche-ward interview if he couldn't stand his daughter?  And just what was the connection between the cabins and the Morgan family?  Who built the cabin over the well and for what reason, did they know they were hiding a murder scene?  And how could Samara draw the tree on her `bedroom' wall when she didn't even see it until just before she died?  The plot holes get bigger and bigger as the film progresses.Although the characterizations are quite good, even complex, they are ruined by the unnecessarily confusing ending.  Why would Samara go after Noah and leave Rachel and Aidan alone, when Rachel and Aidan saw the tape before Noah did?  And given the expectation that all people who view the video will die, how could Rachel possibly hope to deter Samara by feeding the videocassette to unsuspecting viewers?  Sooner or later, she's coming back to get Rachel. This film starts out really strong, but the improbabilities pile atop each other until you have a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. 
This film is like the proverbial dumb blonde:  she looks pretty, but when she opens her mouth to talk, it's pretty clear that her porch light is flickering.  If you want scary, see Rosemary's Baby or The Blair Witch Project, two horror films which happen to be pretty and smart, a rare combination indeed.",1,2,7,6 April 2003
Hereditary," The only true horror film?
","This bleak film just keeps coming at you, but then any movie that begins with a funeral probably isn't going to be a comedy. There are a couple of moments of hope, but they are quickly squashed as the characters are all trapped in an inescapable web. It's a very dark story but then the film makes no apologies; it's refreshing to finally see a completely immersive story that ignores almost all horror film cliches. The hero dies, that's it. But it's how we get there that fascinates, so much so that I watched the film twice and plan to watch it again. Like Rosemary's Baby, the clues build as you go, in subtle ways, and you won't catch them on a first viewing. Toni Collette gives one of her best performances; what she does with her face and voice are sometimes astonishing, whether it's struggling with indecision when she meets Joan or full-bore hysterics when her daughter dies, everything about her character is legitimate. Even before the reveal at the end, I suspected that something was amiss with Charlie; nothing against the actress who plays her, but her odd face, premature development, creepy voice, and strange mannerisms imply that she's something other than what she appears. By far the most amazing scene is the end, and I watched it five times because it's so unexpected and inhuman, so completely dismissive of the struggles of the characters who suffered for it to happen, that it earns authenticity simply because the story has been divorced from any human expectation of a positive ending. The eerie music accompanying the end scene underscores the impression that we're getting a glimpse of hell, and for me it's terrifying. It's not easy to do that, many films have tried and failed.As much as I love this film, there is one corny old horror movie cliche that prevents me from giving it ten stars, and that's the old book that explains everything, with illustrations no less. Here it's a book about witchcraft that grandmother conveniently left among her belongings. The rest of the film is so unique and original that it's rather glaring when this cliche pops up.",9,1,3,26 March 2019
John Wick," Video game violence with some Charles Bronson thrown in
","This film is nothing more than a reimagining of those old movies from the 70s where some evil people kill a guy's wife/family/dog/whatever and he goes on a bloody vendetta. The Outlaw Josey Wales comes to mind, or basically any Charles Bronson film, with a touch of Taken and The Usual Suspects thrown in. There is no time to get to know any of the characters, they have zero depth, which is fitting since Keanu Reeves lacks the ability to portray three-dimensional characters. As the body count piles up, Willem Dafoe's character drifts in here and there, but he isn't given much to do except look pensive and drift away again. This is the perfect film to watch if you just want to zone out and not think very much, there are no challenging ideas for you to struggle with, just lots and lots of stabbings, shootings, and head-bashings. It must have been incredibly easy to write the script for this film.",5,0,1,23 November 2017
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Not as good as everyone says it is
","Over the years I've tried to enjoy this film as much as Monty Python's other works but the film doesn't work for me. I watched it again tonight, and what strikes me the most is that the reported difficulties in making the film show through here and there, in the actor's faces, their behavior, etc; Graham Chapman is practically wincing in pain, in almost every scene. There's an awful lot of shouting, sometimes all at once from extras, and even with subtitles it's difficult to follow along. I'm sure there's some quality writing buried somewhere under all the noise and chaos, but parsing it from the subtitles to the action seems like work instead of entertainment. I wish I could enjoy this film as much as everyone else does, but in my opinion this isn't Python's best work.",5,5,11,5 January 2020
As Good as It Gets," Not one of Brooks's best
","I don't know why people like this movie, it's the most uncomfortable movie of all time. Not one scene in this movie clicks, all the actors look like they are expecting someone to come out of nowhere and start blasting away with a shotgun at any second. There's this one scene that's so stupid and hammy, it's when Greg Kinnear is sitting in his apartment and these thugs come in and suddenly Kinnear starts saying: 'oh no, oh no' repeatedly. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. How could he know they were going to beat the stuffing out of him? In another scene, plain-faced Helen Hunt is arguing with her mother, and suddenly Hunt says 'what do you want mom? What do you want mom?' There is no basis for her verbal attack on her mother, it comes out of nowhere, the movie just keeps switching around all over the place like some twitchy drug addict. Then when Lisa Simpson sits down with the flash cards to talk to Kinnear, the whole scene between them is so clumsy and ham-handed that I'm convinced Brooks went to McDonalds and told everyone to just keep filming while he was gone, and that it would turn out all right.There were a couple of things in this movie that were just too precious, the fist one being Hunt's date. They go back to her place and start to get romantic, then her son has an asthma attack or something and her date gets all turned off and leaves. HELLO? Didn't she think for a minute and say 'oh, I have a kid' before they agreed to a date? Or maybe she's in the habit of bringing home strange men, I don't know. Another thing that annoys me is when Hunt runs down the sidewalk yelling Melvin's name to get the cab. It doesn't make any sense, there are cabs everywhere in NYC, and as far as I could see it wasn't rush hour. Why did she run all the way down the sidewalk just to get his cab? And how would she even know that he was getting a cab in the first place? So stupid.",Null,0,2,12 July 2005
Monster," Fundamentally flawed with old-fashioned views of women
","Charlize Theron is great in this movie, but her performance is the only good thing about it. It's too bad the rest of the movie is so artificial. First of all, a lot of reviews crow about how truthful the movie is and how it sticks to the facts. How could anyone possibly know what the truth really is unless they were there? Maybe Selby's mother wasn't some straitlaced two-dimensional prude, maybe she was just a protective mother. Think about that for a minute.My biggest problem with this movie is the pretension of assuming that a woman couldn't be inherently evil, that a woman over the edge must have gotten that way because of a never-ending parade of misdeeds visited upon her by cartoonishly violent or egotistical men. For example, why would any lawyer interview a person without first looking at their resume and THEN invite them for an interview? But no, the lawyer scene doesn't happen in any real context, it's designed so that Aileen can nurse yet another grudge against men, who in the movie are shown, again and again, to contribute to her deteriorating mental state and poor decision making. Aileen doesn't act on her own, you see, it's all those damned men who are making her crazy. She couldn't just simply be an evil person, she has to be manipulated into being evil by evil men. I'm surprised that so many people who like this movie can't see how pretentiously old-fashioned and misogynistic this viewpoint really is. What is this, the 1940s? I've got news for you: no one ever figured out Ted Bundy and no one ever will. Thanks to Florida's zealous legal system, no one will ever figure out Aileen Wuornos either. She was an enigma. Why did she kill seven men? The movie shouldn't have tried to explain Aileen's rampage by showing possible catalysts for her behavior, it should have simply told the unembellished story, and not one that was solely from her point of view.",2,5,17,22 June 2005
Memento," Interesting film, but unsatisfying conclusion
","There are spoilers in this review.This is your chance to see Guy Pearce as a bleached-blonde SoCal Calvin Klein model.  Not only that, but he is also half-naked during the entire film as the camera pans up and down his body.  Guy in the shower, Guy on the bed, Guy getting dressed.  Like it or not, you're going to see Guy Pearce's body, dammit.This film is strongly reminiscent of the Seinfeld episode where everything goes backward, the one where Sue Ellen Mischke gets married in India.  I wonder if the screenwriter was inspired by that show.Anyway, Pearce plays a man who has no short-term memory, so he has to write down everything.  This is a thinking person's film, which cleverly challenges your own short-term memory as you try to remember how each vignette ties into the previous one.  It works, but after awhile it becomes formulaic.  Joe Pantoliano's character is utterly unconvincing as a police officer.  He is such a simpering milquetoast, and his friendship with Guy is so weak, that you wonder about his motivation for helping Guy.  It is never clearly demonstrated.Major spoiler alert in this paragraph.  The problem I have with the ending is that it is so unsatisfying.  It does not clearly demonstrate Guy's motivation for `finding new challenges'.  His writing down of Teddy's license plate is so contrived and unlikely, and largely unexplained, that the whole film falls apart.  It is as though Leonard is inventing challenges just to keep himself busy; it is such an empty, unsatisfying conclusion that one wonders if there are a group of screenwriters somewhere whose job it is to create silly movie endings, such as those in `The Ring' and `Donnie Darko'.  A lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.On IMDB's scale, this movie deserves a five.",5,3,4,5 July 2003
The English Patient," Watch it again, it's really good
","When I first saw this movie years ago I thought it was boring, I couldn't understand it, it was confusing. But it was on t.v. last night and I watched the whole thing all the way through, and wondered why I dismissed such a well-crafted movie. The performances are wonderful, and the way the story weaves in and out from past to present, and from character to character, is amazing. In my case, the riches of this film weren't revealed on a single viewing, but I had to see it again years later. It's kind of like classical music, where you don't like it at first but after hearing it for awhile you appreciate the complexities of it and you start to appreciate your favorite pieces. Juliette Binoche is delightful, she seems so natural and relaxed that it's impossible to imagine that she is aware of a camera in the room filming her. And I think Ralph Fiennes's acting style suits this film perfectly; he's cold and distant through much of the movie, until the heart-wrenching ending when he returns to the cave. Anyone who doesn't cry when Hana is reading Katharine's dying words to the count must have a heart of stone.",10,1,5,18 September 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Flat
","Like many other reviewers, I read the series of books years ago when I was a kid. Lewis's writing has a light touch that is easily read and understood by children, and the deeper messages are there for anyone who looks for them. For children, his writing is bold and exciting, and stepping into Narnia for the first time is like a breath of fresh air: the characters are rich and sharp, and the scenes are clearly portrayed. The Chronicles of Narnia are not just a work of escapism for children, but at their heart they represent an idealistic moralism that, unfortunately, many religious people have claimed as their own, when in actuality they stand on their own merit without any reinterpretation by religious nuts. Lewis was keenly aware of how his work was viewed, and never intended his children's books to be interpreted as metaphors for religion.That said, there is something about Lewis's excitement and sense of immediacy that is sorely lacking in this beautiful but flat film. It all seems kind of cheap and slapped together somehow. Where Lewis describes Narnia in terms of its newness and its impression upon the Pevensie children, Adamson the director fails to convey this excitement on screen. The characters are flat, one does not feel their sense of wonder at this new world, and in no other recent movie that I can think of has it been more obvious that the actors were tired of standing in front of green screens conjuring up reactions to things that are added in later during post production.The special effects are ho-hum. The waterfall scene, for example, went on far too long and contributed nothing to the story, on top of looking like a scene out of a made-for-TV movie. Aslan is particularly hokey, with his fur that doesn't move like the fur of any other lion in the world, and it doesn't help that Liam Neeson's forced, creepy voice is meant to impart the deep wisdom that Lewis so carefully portrayed in the book. I hear Liam Neeson and I think of his tongue-in-cheek role in Darkman, and it kind of blows the whole Aslan thing for me.One might expect that the icily beautiful Tilda Swinton was perfectly cast as the white witch, when in actuality most of the time she appears as though she can't remember her lines. The best actor of the bunch is Georgie Henley as Lucy, a natural born actor if there ever was one.All in all, a disappointing effort from what was probably a collaboration by hundreds of people and millions of dollars, desperately trying to inject some humanity or heart into a film composed largely of poorly rendered computer graphics.Lewis would probably have walked out of this film, shaking his head and thinking 'oh well, children can still have a much better time reading the book. Long after this movie is forgotten, they will be reading the book.'",3,4,7,4 May 2008
The Others," Gee, I never saw the end coming from a mile away
","***SPOILERS HEREIN***This fog-bound film is about as entertaining as a wake.  Remember those corny old English creep-shows from the sixties and seventies, and they always took place on an English estate, and they always starred Christopher Lee?  This movie looks like it was made in 1973.  Amenabar's choice to place the characters in the coldest setting imaginable, in spartan rooms, dressed in black, and with light so muted that we can't appreciate Kidman's natural beauty, all to emphasize the ultimate point about who the characters really are at the end of the film, is a dismal failure.  Instead of enhancing the characters, this emphasized de-styling separates the viewer from the characters, keeping him from sympathizing with the story.  I feel none of Grace's panic when the children are screaming, nor do I care the slightest about Grace's search for 'intruders' in the house.  For that matter, when hubby returns from abroad, the meeting is icy and distant, all for the ending's ultimate purpose of course, but to sacrifice what could have been a great film for the cheap gimmick that pops up at the end is a real shame.  The mystery doesn't go deep enough, this film is all about appearances and surface details.  Oh, and you won't see the ending coming from a mile away.",Null,2,5,14 June 2004
Orphan," Worth watching for Isabelle Fuhrman alone
","Even though I knew the twist before I saw this film, I was shocked at Isabelle Furhrman's brilliant performance. Vacillating between sweet and psychotic from one scene to the next, you can read what's going on in her head just by looking at her face; there are actors five times her age who still haven't mastered this skill. I nominate Esther as one of the greatest movie villains of all time, and here's to hoping that Isabelle Furhrman has a very long and rewarding acting career.Despite Furhman's jaw-dropping performance, the rest of the film is surprisingly odd. The characters don't react the way you expect them to. The film would have been much more powerful and fun if Esther had concentrated on slowly driving Kate crazy, while at the same time being incredibly sweet to her. The film blew it when Esther suddenly became very cold towards Kate and started lecturing her about her other kids or her past drinking problem. Esther could easily have convinced Kate that she was going insane, driving her away from the family and leaving her to seduce John, but she stupidly left some loose ends. If you're going to the trouble of creating a super-intelligent character, why create one that makes so many mistakes along the way? I understand that Esther is insane, the film makes it pretty clear, but she must want something that she is continually unable to get, and the film doesn't answer this question. Instead we're left with a cookie-cutter Hollywood ending where the villain is thought to be dead and comes back for another attack, not once but three times...this is standard in films these days I guess.Despite the above flaws, this film is tremendously entertaining, and there isn't a flat spot in the entire movie as you wonder what Esther is going to do next. I see in the other reviews that people are drawing a comparison to The Bad Seed, which I find quite cloying and melodramatic for long, unbearable stretches of time.",Null,1,2,27 October 2011
The Day After Tomorrow," Brrr!
","***SPOILERS HEREIN***First of all, I nominate this film for having the worst title of any summer movie this year.  I tried and tried to understand why this film is called The Day After Tomorrow, but there seems to be absolutely no reason for it. Does it refer to hope for mankind in the face of insurmountable odds? Perhaps, but I hardly think such an abstract concept would be pushed in a film which purports that a new ice age can happen within a day's time.  This is no-brainer entertainment anyway.Dennis Quaid is pretty good, playing the befuddled scientist character that Jeff Goldblum played in Independence Day.  Perry King plays the obstinate Bill Pullman from ID.  Sela Ward plays the cool and distant wife from ID. There is also a dog, a homeless man, a crusty cop, a person in need of medical attention (two of them), and an icy vice-president, all of whom were lifted straight from Independence Day.  Geez, it wasn't hard to write this movie, all that was left was an unstoppable force, which was played by aliens in Independence Day and in this movie by the weather.  Yes, this is a movie about weather.  To emphasize the fact, the vice president addresses the nation on the weather channel.  There are several fantastic scenes of Los Angeles and New York being destroyed by tornadoes and tidal waves, respectively.  It is an awesome spectacle, too big for words and well worth the price of admission. Curiously, all other cities are ignored.  It must have been prohibitively expensive to swath the Eiffel tower or Big Ben in ice, even CGI-style, though they did set aside money for CGI wolves, which aren't very realistic. Why is it that CGI always looks like it?  Jurassic Park was released in 1993, the infancy of CGI, and yet the dinosaurs are infinitely more convincing than the fake fur and eyes of a pack of newly-released wolves from the New York zoo.  The movie drags and drags during times when there isn't something spectacular happening (read the entire last hour of the film).  There is not just one cliffhanger but two of them, as though the screenwriter wasn't imaginative enough to think up something else.  The whole wolf thing was beyond tiresome, a drama invented after all the bad weather already happened.  Why the wolves didn't go after the thousands of people who walked away on the ice is never explained.  As in all disaster films, none of the characters shows the slightest degree of shock.  New York is first buried under water, then under a blanket of snow, millions of people are killed, and yet the librarian is more concerned about a book than anything else.  What bothers me about this kind of movie is that people still want to see them:  after the horrors of the WTC attack, I'm surprised that anyone would want to see a movie like this.  It's almost as if people want to be afraid of something, to get a little thrill out of it, like roller coasters or paint ball games, as though we have a need to be afraid.  Morality lessons pepper the film from start to finish, as Quaid rails against the evils of resource misuse.  To emphasize the point, he drives a nerdy little lime-green car (the same part played by a bicycle in Independence Day).  The movie fades away into nothing, implying that the U.S. is now one-third of its original size.  At this point, the cautionary fable about planet abuse is supposed to sink in, enraging conservatives and causing them to snort derisively.  Why does this film suck so much?  Because at its heart it's a pretty boring film.  It's about weather, for god's sake.",Null,0,0,1 June 2004
Pan's Labyrinth," Not the movie the ads would have you believe
","All over the newspapers, TV, and the internet you see the ad for this movie: a little girl standing in a room with a weird-looking creature sitting at a table. So you think 'wow, I've got to see that.' Yes, there are weird creatures in this movie, but their screen time is brief. The film is largely a standard wartime drama, and the brutality of the Franco regime is shown repeatedly just in case you don't get it the first dozen times. Ever see a man beaten to death with a liquor bottle? It's just one of the three hundred scenes calculated to foment your anger at fascism and the concomitant loss of individual freedom.There are some startling images in this movie, among them a gigantic frog and a man mending a slice in his face, but you'll spend most of your time wondering what atrocity el capitan will commit next. The suspense is there, certainly, but all the while you'll be wondering: where are the strange creatures I was promised, and how do they fit into the plot? The answer is, they don't.Yes, this is one of those duality films where all the cool stuff that is going on exists only in the head of the main character Ofelia, in other words, that most boring of themes: individualistic escapism. The film seems to be saying that during times of oppression, it's okay to seek solace in fantasy. In the meantime, a very real rebellion is occurring in the mountains of Spain. This is why the film doesn't work: everything going on inside Ofelia's head has nothing whatsoever to do with the Franco resistance. Del Toro makes sure that the audience has no clue that this duality exists until the very end, where it is shown that Ofelia can see the faun and el capitan cannot.There's nothing original to be seen here. Even some of the special effects are Harry Potteresque, such as the mandrake and the book with invisible ink.What is the point to all this? It's a lot of brutal, ugly images that add up to a whole lot of nothing. In a year or so, people will look back and wonder why they voted this movie a '10'.",4,9,19,1 February 2007
The Polar Express," Scary, depressing, and violent, meant for kids?
","Few films are as polarizing as the Polar Express; people either love it or hate it. I'm curious if kids actually like this dismal film, the train conductor is angry and abusive, yelling at the kids, threatening to throw them off the train, yanking them topside in the blinding snow. The town is like some depressing little English industrial burb with lots of strict rules and short-tempered workers; it's like having Christmastime at a brick-making factory. The children characters are annoying, especially the kid with the glasses. Not to worry, the film is overlaid with jolly old muted colors where blue becomes gray, bright red becomes maroon, and Santa himself is seen through the darkest sunglasses you've ever worn. I agree with everyone else who commented about the frightening eyes on the characters, 'Manson lamps' as Tony Soprano would say. A cold and cheerless film with exactly zero lessons to teach kids about anything. Merry Christmas?",4,1,9,18 November 2014
Elf," Has its moments
","Will Farrell seems to have taken a page from the Jim Carrey look-at-me school of acting. People like Carrey, and Farrell, and Bette Midler were probably the kind of people who, as small children, would jump onto the empty stage in malls and put on a show for their delighted parents, while other patrons walked by scratching their heads. It's not to say that these people aren't occasionally funny, but when your entire celebrity is built on self-referentialism, you'll hit more wrong notes than right ones. I have a hunch that they did many, many takes of each scene in this movie.Anyway, the funniest parts of this movie come from the veteran actors themselves: Steenburgen, Asner, Newhart, and Caan. Each of them has perfect straight-man timing to Farrell's manic funny-man Elf. Steenburgen's spaghetti breakfast, Asner's crabby Santa, Newhart's deadpan delivery and Caan's irritable reactions are all priceless moments. Farrell is basically himself, the same person he plays in every movie, and yet even given his two-dimensional portrayal of a man raised as an elf, his peculiarly funny mannerisms are somehow never tiresome. With a manic laugh or flick of his eyes he can be humorous, but he often seems bereft of an inner critic and tends to overdo it. For instance, the dinner scene is hilarious ('Is there sugar in maple syrup?'...'Yes'...'then YES!'), but Farrell ruins the lighthearted banter by belching for a full minute, a scene that should have been left on the cutting room floor.All in all, not a bad Christmas film, although the entire Central Park scene looks like it was written into the script at the last minute. It's all a bit overdone, but then they had to have some warm fuzzies or it wouldn't be a Christmas movie.",5,2,4,4 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Monument To Lucas's Ego
","There are spoilers in this review.If ever there was a clear indication of George Lucas's commitment to his vision, good or bad, it is the presence of Jar-Jar Binks in this film. Disregarding universal hatred for Jar-Jar, Lucas thumbs his nose at his critics by stubbornly placing Jar-Jar in several key scenes in this film. This commitment to his vision is what made the first three films so good, and what makes this one so bad; left to your own devices and many millions of dollars, what happens to your inner critic?  It dies, and you lose your sense of what works and what doesn't.  And this film doesn't.It doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway:  Christopher Lee is cool, whether in this film or as Saruman in Lord of the Rings.  With his icy voice, deadpan expression, and careful delivery, he alone is worth the price of the DVD.  The acting is generally good all around, although since the actors are thickly couched in layers upon layers of special effects, you don't really notice anyway.If I never hear the phrase `I don't think so' again, I'll die a happy man. This idiotic observation, better suited to any film or television series starring Chuck Norris, is sprinkled throughout the script like candy.  And hearing C3PO say `what a drag' as his head is being, well, dragged made me groan.  Such winking at the audience detracts from the film-watching experience, and turns the movie into its own joke.  It just doesn't work.There are so many little winks at the coming films:  the Death Star plans, the meeting with Beru and Owen, the little Fett boy picking up the head of his father, the verbal jarring between Obi-Wan and Anakin.it just goes on and on, and there's always a dramatic pause at each one.  I can't imagine what this irritating technique must have been like in the theater, with people going `ah!' after each one.Someone please explain something to me:  Anakin Skywalker wins his freedom, galavants across the galaxy for ten years, blithely forgets about his beloved mother, and suddenly remembers:  `oh yeah, my mom' and rushes back to get her.  Now, anyone else would have immediately tried to secure her release the second he joined the Jedis.  A small loan from the Jedi Credit Union, and he could have returned immediately and bought her freedom. Instead he waits for ten years.  Waits.  For ten years. Okay.Just in case your head isn't numb yet from Lucas's sledgehammer, the bickering between young Anakin and wise Obi-wan signals the start of Anakin's rebellion:  oh, that's how it all started, that's the genesis of his darth vaderism.  Gee, a surly teenager not liking what he's told, how original.  I wonder how many other teen jedi knights have fallen into that trap.  Better do what you're told, or you'll wind up on the dark side, young man.  Frankly, the image of Darth Vader as a surly teenager is disturbing. `It's all Obi-wan's fault.  He's jealous and he's holding me back.'  Yes, it's as bad as it sounds.I have to agree with other reviewers about the presence of Samuel Jackson in this film; he adds nothing to the plot, he looks uncomfortable, he's unconvincing, and he looks like he would rather be somewhere else.  With his open-mouthed stare, at any moment he's going to spout off bible verses a la his role as Jules in Pulp Fiction.  Jar-Jar and Jackson largely ruin the film, as if the dialogue alone doesn't already do it.
Much has been made of the clunky dialogue.  During a romantic scene with Amadala, Anakin proclaims `I am haunted by the kiss that you shouldn't have given me.'  Boy, that one made me wince.  In another scene, after he returns from killing the sand people, he says `they are animals.ANIMALS!  And I killed them all!'  What his employees should have explained to Lucas, after drawing straws to determine which one had to tell him, is that Anakin didn't have to say anything.  After seeing his mother tied up, we know they're animals, you don't have to tell us for chrissake.The scene in the robot factory is fantastic, and I must say the battle scene toward the end is quite good, although I wonder why they didn't shoot down the other two spherical federation ships.  `Aim for the closest one!' and down it comes, but what about the other two?  Away they float, unattacked. Okay, whatever.The robotic waitress in the diner, complete with Polly Holliday accent, was just plain stupid.  Why shouldn't it speak in a monotone like all the other robots?  And just how would some fat old diner owner know the origin of a poison dart?  Why would `keepers of the peace' commission an army of clones? Would the Viceroy and Dooku really antagonize the Senate by executing Amadala and two Jedi knights?  Why would Amadala leave Jar-Jar in charge when she knows he's an idiot?  Don't think about this film too hard or you'll get a headache.Overall, this is an okay movie.  The beautiful special effects are the highlight of the film, but if you can't stand the silly dialogue you can always hit the mute button and enjoy the scenery.",Null,1,2,27 January 2003
Corpse Bride," The nightmare after Christmas
","There's something so sad and wistful about this gray-colored film, as it plods along wishing that something exciting would happen to it. It's bad enough that all the characters look like they belong in some crappy 1960s stop-animation movie for kids, but they stylistically resemble that time, with exaggerated hair and body types. At least the nightmare before Christmas had more than three colors, which is all you'll see in this film, and your favorite color better be gray.Among the film's many faults is its lack of characterization. If you're going to feature a worm, why not make it cute, instead of the literally ugly little thing that crawls about talking like Peter Lorre. There's nothing even remotely lovable about it. And why not name the main characters Victor/Victoria, just to showcase a lack of imagination. Scariest of all is the pastor, an elongated horror gifted with Christopher Lee's voice. It's all very ugly and disturbing, as cold and heartless as an Ingmar Berman film.There is a particularly stupid scene where everyone runs around the burning pastor without the slightest idea of how to extinguish a fire; this knowledge is beyond even the pastor himself. The hosts calmly look on as the terrified pastor's clothes burn cheerily, the only spot of color in the entire film.The dialogue is inspid and stilted, without an ounce of emotion or surprise, as whomever wrote the script was apparently raised in front of the television. The stiff, Victorian drawing-room conversations hold no surprises whatsoever and you see every word coming. This is the most unchallenging, nonthreatening film of all time. The 'living' people are so sedate that they are indistinguishable from the dead people. Victor's blue face and Johnny Depp eyes at first glance appear to be soulful, but there is no identifiable character behind the figure.For some reason the dead rejoin the living at the end of the movie, and old friends and family are reunited, even couples. Don't think about this last part too hard, if you know what I mean. Yuck.All in all, if you watch this movie, then like old folks in a nursing home you'll just be waiting for something to happen, and it never does. It has a boring ending that totally doesn't make any sense, like Burton's 'Planet of the Aches'.",3,2,8,6 November 2006
Bird Box," The Happening II
","I read somewhere that 45 million people viewed this film. You hear statistics like that and think it must be pretty good, right? Well, it's basically Night of the Living Dead...a bunch of desperate characters trapped in a house while the world collapses outside. You have the stern older white man that no one listens to (to their detriment), the heroic black male, the no-nonsense older woman, and the nerd who's totally unprepared for the apocalypse. Oh, and to update the formula for the new millennium, the asian guy and his 'husband', so it's basically the united nations in a sprawling mansion while unseen creatures, that you never see, ravage the planet. I'm wondering why the voices didn't follow them all the way on the trip, why wait until the last second when they're at the sanctuary. Why were some humans immune to the creatures. It's a frustrating and pointless trip with a lame payoff, much like The Happening.",4,2,5,30 December 2018
American Psycho," As empty as the era it ridicules
","This review contains spoilers.This movie doesn't know what it wants to be.  It's too serious to be a black comedy, too gruesome to be a comedy, too funny to be a drama, too narrow-mined to be satirical, and too broad to be a character study.  In short, American Psycho takes the middle road so often that the end result is a weak, ineffectual film that promises more than it delivers.Just in case you don't know that this film takes place in greed-driven 1980s (oh right, like the 1990s internet explosion had nothing to do with greed), gigantic cordless phones, 1980s music, power suits, whitewashed Malibu walls, and odd menu choices like `sea urchin ceviche' are jammed into your senses.  With all of these blatant era-placement devices, you just know that during the writing of the script someone must have quipped about `instant culture immersion via baseball bat.'  I'm surprised they didn't stick a Neiman poster on the wall.  By the way, why aren't any of the women actors wearing those huge shoulder pads that were so popular in the 1980s? 
Christian Bale, as the yuppie Patrick Bateman, is pretty good in this otherwise vapid film.  The men are broadly-painted cliches of the typical 1980s ivy-league archetype:  snotty and oily-haired, with mannerisms akin to those of car salesmen or insurance agents, engaged in a culture of their own that we as viewers are supposed to ridicule, not just because it is the 1980s but because they were born priveleged, have nicknames like `Biff', and will someday die not in a smelly hospital but in the comfort of their own home on a four-hundred-year-old poster bed attended to by a private nurse.Several things don't make sense:  when the prostitute ran screaming down the hall, pounding on doors, why didn't any of the residents open their doors? Why don't we ever see Bateman doing any work instead of just listening to music or going to lunch?  How could you kill someone with a nail gun?  And just what happened at the end, was Paul Allen alive or dead?  I don't understand this film at all.This film is as pretty and sterile as Patrick Bateman's condo, and, like much of the 1980s, offers little substance.",2,3,10,23 February 2003
Spider-Man," Spiderman  Forever Ruined
","There are spoilers in this review.First of all, the casting of Tobey Maguire for the lead role is the film's biggest mistake.  With his pointy lip, jumbo ears, big nose, and squeaky voice, he resembles Screech from Saved By The Bell (I take it Dustin Diamond wasn't available).  Much like Michael Keaton in Batman, Maguire doesn't even remotely resemble the title character.  Since we're talking about miscast superheroes, thank god they didn't make that Superman movie starring Nicholas Cage.  Maguire isn't the only miscast actor in this dud.  Aunt May is annoying, Kirsten Dunst is a terrible actress and Willem Dafoe as the squeaky-voiced Green Goblinwell, let's just say that boy aint right.  They emasculated the J. Jonah Jameson character; in the comic book he's a huge, scary, angry editor who resembles a wrestling character, but in the film he's a meek, squeaky-voiced, accountant-looking guy with all the screen presence of Droopy the dog.  What is it with the squeaky voices?  About the only actor who resembles one of the characters is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, who doesn't die of a heart attack as he did in the comic book.  Couldn't they keep anything authentic?You know all those really cool special effects showing Spiderman looping through the city between the buildings?  Well, about ninety-seven percent of the film contains scenes that are not that.  Which is to say that three percent of the film doesn't contain scenes that are boring and stretched out endlessly until you want to gouge out your eyeballs with a rusty spike.  The chemistry between Maguire and Dunst is ice-cold.  There are long stretches of boring, pointless scenes that do nothing for the film, such as the wrestling scene.  Parker wants money to buy a car so he can impress MJ.  What was the point of all this?  Spiderman should be out saving people's lives and stopping crime, not worrying about getting money for a car.  This film is laced with continuity and character problems.  The Green Goblin has absolutely no reservations about destroying a balcony full of people, including his own son, and yet when the people on the bridge throw trash at him how does he react?  By letting them throw trash at him.  Why didn't he just blow them away?  And just because Osborne kills the board of directors does not make their decision non-binding.  If Osborne was thrown out for being inept, it's almost assured that the new board of directors would do the same thing.  And the ending is a real problem:  Harry blames Spiderman for his father's death, but how would Harry know that?  Spiderman would have to tell Harry that he killed his father, in which case he would have to tell him thata)  it was an accidentb)  his father was really the Green GoblinThis dry, pointless, barren film has singlehandedly sucked all the fun and joy out of Spiderman forever.",1,7,18,4 May 2003
Man on the Moon," Jim Carrey impersonates Andy Kaufman and the results aren't pretty
","Andy Kaufman was a one-of-a-kind genius, a man whose comic style transcended his persona.  The undeniable brilliance of Kaufman is that you never knew if he was kidding or serious; he danced on such a thin line that you always expected him to fall off on one side or the other.  There were so many layers to his personality that you never quite knew who or what you were watching:  was he acting or was he serious?  Kaufman was so far ahead of his time that many people simply didn't understand him, that's why he was voted off of Saturday Night Live in a stunt that he probably engineered himself.Kaufman liked to push things to the limit. One of his bits was reading a book onstage, such as The Great Gatsby, in a dry, boring voice, then tease the audience by giving them a choice between playing a record or to continue reading.  After several minutes of continuously reading, interspersed by booing from the audience, Kaufman finally played the record, which was a recording of Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby.  Carrey's performance in this film is good, but because Kaufman was such an original, then Carrey is largely relegated to aping Kaufman's television performances.  As everyone knows, impersonating a celebrity is funny for about five minutes, but when the impersonation is stretched into an entire film it becomes tired and pointless.The secret to Kaufman was that he never publicly revealed who he really was. Like movies about space aliens or ghosts, once you personalize the mystery by identifying with them, you destroy their power to fascinate.  Because of his layered personality, no one could ever personalize Andy Kaufman, and that's why this film fails in his portrayal.  I don't recommend this film.",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
Behind The Candelabra," Surprisingly dull
","Watch any clip of Liberace on youtube and, despite your awareness of his personal life, you have to agree that he was a natural showman. I remember seeing him on TV in the 70s and woman loved him, my mom went nuts. It's easy to see why, because he pulled the audience into his performances and made you feel like you were part of it. It's not easy to do this, and he made it look effortless in the way that some outstanding entertainers do, like Michael Jackson or Madonna. That critical element is missing from this film. When you peel back the layers of showmanship, you want to see what makes up the person behind them, and this film doesn't accomplish that goal or explain Liberace's complicated life. I had high hopes for Douglas, but for some reason he just doesn't click, his delivery is off, and you can't buy him as Liberace, you just see Michael Douglas in heavy makeup. Matt Damon gives a suitably understated performance and he is a dead ringer for Scott Thorson.Ironically, given what are supposed to be colorful main characters, the real stars of the show are the supporting characters: an unrecognizable Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Dan Akroyd as Liberace's snappy lawyer, Scott Bakula as Bob Black, and of course Rob Lowe, who steals every scene he's in. Maybe Rob Lowe should have played Liberace.",5,5,9,1 August 2015
I Am Legend," The one man who is immune turns out to be a doctor
","who is trying to find a cure...what are the odds? Let's examine the other head-scratchers: 1) Mother and son, as clean and well-scrubbed as models in a Macy's advertisement, appear out of nowhere, in the dead of night, to rescue the protagonist in the middle of a nighttime post-apocalyptic war zone that basically belongs to the zombies who have ten times the energy of the acrobats in a Cirque du Soleil show.2) re: #1 above, Macy's model mother and her Macy's model son manage to rescue the unconscious protagonist and take him to his house, when they would have no idea where he lives.3) Bacon bacon where's the bacon (I was saving that bacon) 4) Creepy mannequin social networking 5) Hunting deer from your car, we had a word for people like that where I grew up and it's not polite to repeat it here. Seriously, that's not how you hunt deer...who wrote the script? Everyone knows you stalk them silently while they're grazing, you don't chase after them while they're running, that's just lame.6) Dr. Neville has the ability, in his rinky-dink basement lab, to reverse a condition that has probably taken a huge corporation years, millions of dollars, and hundreds of research scientists to unleash upon the world. Oh, and he still has plenty of time left over to hit golf balls, browse for dvds, and putter around NYC, because somehow devoting every minute you have to curing a disease that has rendered you the last man on earth takes a back seat to flirting with a mannequin with a bob haircut.7) Worst CGI lions in film history, even worse than the CGI wolves in The Day After Tomorrow. They look like cartoon lions. I half expected to see Hanna Barbera credited for the lions in the credits.8) What have the zombies lived on for the last three years? Nothing on earth can survive that long without eating.9) Dr. Neville didn't see the cable attached to Fred? 10) I heard that Tom Cruise was considered for the role; in terms of acting ability, is Smith simply not Cruise's tepid contemporary? They could be used interchangeably in any role. Try to convince me that if they had used Smith for the War of the Worlds, complete with Smithlet (Willow), that most audience members could not have told the difference.11) Lest you think I'm being hard on his acting ability, would an accomplished actor desperately resort to shirtless chin-ups and that exaggerated swagger in his walk in order to add depth to his character? As 'the last man on earth', he isn't convincing; he should be ten times stranger than what we're seeing on the screen. Quoting Shrek doesn't make him strange, but if the Macy's model kid put in several dvds one after the other and he could quote them all, that would have made him strange, and we would have had a sense of what he was going through.12) He hasn't seen a single living person in three years, and yet reacts to blithely to the Macy's model people, who pop up out of nowhere. Would he not be in shock from seeing them? Boy am I glad to see you, where did you come from, how did you get here, etc. The woman and her kid are similarly lukewarm. This just isn't how people would act under these circumstances, they look bored with each other.",3,0,1,27 September 2010
The Man Who Would Be King," Connery and Caine should have made more buddy films
","Throughout this film they have a natural chemistry, Caine with his pushy type-A ego, and Connery with his brooding scowl. The scale and scope of the film is enormous, from train stations to mountains to full-scale battles. You know you're in for a rough ride when Michael Caine throws a guy off a train for eating a watermelon. The film has a real heart at its center, and you forget that Connery is supposed to be a con man, when for the first time in his life he's presented with an opportunity to change the world...power, people, and money right at his fingertips, no one could blame him for wanting these things, and the character reversal, with Connery's character in the lead instead of Caine's, must have been an eye-opener for the latter. But as with all things in life, it all ends with a mummified head. I doubt they could make a film this ambitious nowadays, I'm sure someone would be offended at fictionalized territorialism, or subjugation of humans, or the implication that any human being could be as ignorant as the mountain folk shown in the story. It's almost a perfect tale, except for the housefly crawling over the obviously still picture of the mountain 1/3 of the way through, don't know how that escaped the editor.",10,2,5,11 September 2018
Midsommar," Come on, its just a Wicker Man and Hostel remake
","While I loved Hereditary so much that I watched it five times, the yelling, screeching, and xenophobic mocking of obscure European rituals was a bit too much to bear in Midsommar. I have nothing against Florence Pugh, but if I were her I probably would have been angry at the wardrobe department, especially when they show her from the back; you'll know what I mean when you see it. While I appreciate Aster's clever use of visual clues in both films, in this film it wasn't compelling enough to rise above the achingly long, drawn-out dramatic scenes. Was there supposed to be a correlation between the mass murder in the beginning of the story and the smiling horror show that happens later on? If so, it wasn't apparent to this viewer. It could be that I was distracted by all the screeching. Oh well, the creepy music was top-notch, I recognized the style right away from Hereditary, and correctly guessed that this film had the same director. I wouldn't want to watch this film again, but I am looking forward to Aster's next film.",4,4,10,13 January 2020
Life Is Beautiful," The day the clown cried?
","I realize I'm in the minority here, but I strongly feel this film trivializes the holocaust. First of all, Benigni is annoying as hell. The film starts out okay, but halfway through the viewer is treated to a slew of historical inaccuracies: when the trains got to the camps, the children were immediately separated from the adults and exterminated, there was simply no way that a child wouldn't be discovered in the barracks. And the women had their hair shaved off, the film apparently couldn't find extras who wouldn't shave their hair, so they put unrealistic bandanas on their heads. The camp itself doesn't even look realistic, and there is no way that the prisoners had that much freedom to walk around. I actually felt sorry for the extras in the barracks, because Begnini talked so loudly and thought he was the only one who had problems, I expected them to tell him to shut up because they were suffering too.It's puzzling why this film is rated so highly. I actually fast-forwarded through the last thirty minutes because I couldn't stand watching it any more.",5,3,6,29 September 2013
The Witch," Doesn't quite come together
","First of all, there are no special effects, so don't think you'll see anything cool. A man is unwilling to compromise his religious beliefs so he dooms his whole family by leaving town, which is ironic because religious persecution is why these people left England in the first place. As they set up a farm in the boondocks, a witch or a wolf or a goat may or may not be responsible for a string of misfortunes, a missing baby, a bewitched child, and a mother-daughter tiff. The family is torn apart as they accuse each other of being witches, and by this point the film has turned into a literal witch hunt, a miniature version of the salem witch trials. One wonders where the witch came from, if she emigrated from england like everyone else or if she was already living in north America when the settlers arrived; alas this issue is never explored and by the end the naked daughter walks into the woods and floats into the air with a bunch of other naked women. No, it's not even the least bit scary.",3,4,8,4 December 2016
Rosemary's Baby," One of the scariest films ever
","There are spoilers in this review.Rosemary's Baby sits on the cusp of changing Hollywood filmmaking; abandoning the corny westerns and drawing-room banter of 1950s films that basically mimic stage performances, it explodes into the 1960s like some crazy psychedelic dream.  The Miracle Worker, The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke:  the 1960s were a movie renaissance for the American public.  It must have been a very exciting time if you were a moviegoer, and Rosemary's Baby belongs in the same vein of exciting films.Where do I begin?  The fundamental strength of this film is its believability, and it accomplishes it with flow.  This film effortlessly captures the natural flow between man and wife, in a way that no film prior to it ever did.  Cassavettes's smoldering expression and smoky observations as Guy play so easily against Farrow's waifish, wide-eyed Rosemary that it's easy to imagine they might have been married in real life.  It is so easy to see these people as real characters, because we are given their strengths and faults, we see them quarrelling and kissing, just like real life.  It is this strength of reality that pulls along the rest of the film; when things turn unreal, that's when the real terror begins.  Polanski brilliantly takes this sense of unreality to the limit.Polanski's genius lies in taking Hollywood cliches and putting a contemporary spin on them:  witches no longer wear long black clothes and pointy hats, they are an annoying old woman and a pie-faced old man living in a run-down gothic apartment building in New York.  The creepy Dakota apartment building is the iconic haunted house of everyone's collective subconscious, brought into contemporary 1960s city living.  The building is at first serene but becomes more sinister as the film progresses.  Guy and Rosemary renovate their new flat, brightening it with gallons of white paint and pre-Martha Stewart white linens, but like MS herself, there is something odd lingering underneath the surface.Ruth Gordon steals the movie.  She nails the part of Minnie Castevet with such self-assured manic demeanor that it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role.  She gleefully destroys the cliche of the Halloween-style Margaret Hamilton witch, and instead gives us a witch who looks like a train wreck.  Dressed like a clown with too much makeup, forcing her nutrition drinks down Rosemary's throat, barging into Rosemary's apartment, displaying terrible table manners, and doing her best to meddle in every detail of Rosemary's life, she is at once annoying and fascinating; who would ever think a witch could actually be irritating?By the end of the film, Cassavettes's ambitious actor Guy Woodhouse is a pathetic, soulless automaton, clearly the film's villain for selling his wife's body to the witches in order to advance his career.  His deception is laid bare for all the world to see, and made all the more abject with his inability to see anything wrong with the unholy agreement.  I wonder how many other actors would do the same thing.There is more fear in the unknown than in the known; special effects can only do so much to capture the fear that we all share, but Rosemary's Baby, much like the Exorcist and the Blair Witch Project, uses huge doses of suggestion rather than relying solely on special effects.  The truly frightening things are left to the imagination, for instance when Rosemary looks at the baby and shrieks `What have you done to his eyes?', we don't need to see them, we know they're frightening because of her reaction. 
After watching this film, it's easy to see where The Exorcist gained most of its inspiration, although Rosemary's European director gives us an ending that is perfectly chilling and uncompromisingly pessimistic, while the Exorcist continues as though nothing ever happened.  This is a must-see film.",Null,2,3,27 February 2003
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The accent is on bad accents
","***There are spoilers in this review.***Francis Ford Coppola is one of those people who works best as a starving artist.  During the production of the Godfather films, he was constantly kept on the fence, wondering whether he would be fired the next day.  The result?  Two brilliantly executed films, among the best of American cinema. Will Coppola ever meet or exceed his early directorial efforts?  Thirty years and many mediocre films later, it seems doubtful (witness `Peggy Sue Got Married').  Maybe he needs to lose all his money so he can be a starving artist again, and won't produce another `Jack'.  I wonder what kind of fantastic film could be produced then.Anyway, I don't know what I liked least about Dracula:  Keanu Reeve's fright wig halfway through the film, the uneven direction, the disembodied voiceovers, the terrible accents, the disorienting double exposures, or the general bad acting.  How do you mess up Dracula, one of the most popular novels of all time?  Given millions of dollars and an army of talented people, Coppola manages to screw it up.  That aside, the costumes and sets are rich and lavish, immersing you in the place and time, and the special effects and makeup are quite good.  Gary Oldman is a wonderful actor but, like Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Jason Leigh, his talents are best displayed at the hands of a capable director who can harness the histrionics.  Here he lets loose and hams it up.  Do we really need to hear Dracula cry?  Or watch him in orgiastic ecstasy as Mina laps up his blood?  I'm shuddering as I type this.Winona Ryder is too petite, fragile, and snotty to play movie heroines.  She has beautiful features, but her tinny voice does not carry very well, and despite what must have been hours and hours of English accent coaching, her California hippy inflections stubbornly remain.  And who can ever understand the inexplicable popularity of Keanu Reeves, whose acting ability consists largely of open-mouthed stares.  His mouth is open for roughly one-third of the film.  And poor Anthony Hopkins, saddled  with his own terrible accent, looking inordinately lost and befuddled in this messy film after his groundbreaking role as Hannibal Lechter in the Silence of the Lambs. Heh-heh, the only English actor in the bunch, and they give him a lousy accent.  Wait, I'm forgetting the watery-eyed Richard E. Grant, who somehow manages to never, ever look comfortable in any film he's ever done.Because much of the movie features people standing around and talking, the overall impression I got of this film is that it's an updated version of those old Hammer movies.  Did Coppola watch back-to-back Hammer films as inspiration for Dracula?  I half-expected to see Christopher Lee somewhere in this mess, standing somewhere and talking, and drinking a brandy, in a Hammer-like way.To sum up, this film is alternately funny and campy as it strives to reach dramatic depths and continuously comes up short.  The film is stuffed with half-finished scenes that have little to do with each other, leaving a curiously empty feeling not unlike the way you feel after watching a short-film festival.",Null,1,2,19 October 2003
Kong: Skull Island," Maybe they should have added more bad actors
","I'm not sure what to make of Brie Larson. Did she make a deal with the devil? Her monotone voice, flat delivery, expressionless face, and inability to convey emotion should be working against her, but strangely, people keep throwing acting roles at her. Is there anyone in the world who is excited to see a film because Brie Larson's name is attached to it? If so, I would like to meet these people and ask them: What is your deal? As bad as she is, there are even worse actors in this dud, namely John Ortiz, whose acting skills are simply dreadful. Samuel L. Jackson's natural intensity might have saved this film, but he's a machine gun firing off his mouth over every little thing, trying to pump some life into into a plot that makes less sense the more you think about it. The only saving grace is John C. Reilly, who understands his role inside and out; he is the only human being in the film.",3,1,2,10 June 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," The greatest movie of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Wait, no it isn't. I have a hard time understanding why this movie is rated at #2 on IMDb. The acting is good, I'll give you that, but it's inexplicable how a standard prison drama that hauls every clichÃ© out of the book has enchanted so many people. I mean really, does it say anything new? Have any of its images or dialog made their way into pop culture (the sure sign of an influential film)? No and no. When you really look at it, this is actually a pretty boring movie, and the sleep-inducing musical score doesn't help.The most objectionable thing about this movie is how the convicts are made to be funny, humorous, engaging. I assure you that if you ever stepped foot into a prison, they won't be anything like the characters you see in the movie. They are in prison for a reason, usually because they are uncontrollably violent, anti-social, and manipulative. They are killers and rapists, thieves, inhuman monsters; putting a friendly face on them does a disservice to the people who worked so hard to get them in there. The sheeple who love this movie are the same kind of people who were hoodwinked into believing that Robert Stroud (the Birdman of Alcatraz) was a quiet, gentle, kindly man because of the movie they made about him. In actuality, Stroud was just the opposite: he was a bitter, violent, poisonous little man who wrote detailed child porn. It doesn't help that Andy's innocence is never shown, it's only implied. Why should I root for a man who might have killed his wife, if they won't show that he didn't do it? The only thing Andy has going for him is a convict in another prison who confessed to the crime. It's not enough for me to believe in his innocence.I guess Morgan Freeman's soothing, grandfatherly narration, Andy's cavorting on a Mexican beach, and the warden's desperate final denouement might all have something to do with the popularity of this standard prison movie, but like I said it's all been done before, and to better effect, in other movies. As an example, James Cagney's howl of despair when he learns his mother dies in 'White Heat' is an electrifying moment, and is loaded with more humanity than the icy and distant Shawshank Redemption.",Null,1,3,26 June 2005
Final Destination," Yet another 'humans are cogs in a giant wheel' movie
","Can the world stand one more of these movies?  Whatever happened to the idea of free will, or that things happen by accident, or that you can never really plan anything--stuff just happens for no reason?  Are we really living in a time where people are so scared of world events that they want to believe we are all part of some gigantic plan?  Why are movies about predestination being made, the idea is as old and outdated as bloodletting, the miracle cure.  Donnie Darko, Memento, and the Matrix were all the same way, shoving people into categories where their fate was predetermined; it is the ultimate fantasy for people who need explanations for life's travails, because it means that all of the bad things that happen to them are not their fault.  People, there is no grand plan for each one of us.  If there were, then why bother doing anything, your fate is already sealed.That said, this movie is about as enjoyable as a root canal.  Snarky, caustic teens sulk across the screen, looking curiously old.  Movies come from artificiality and therefore strive to distance themselves from it, but this film seems to embrace it:  every scene looks phony and staged, like the 'fight' when they are booted off the plane.  There is no life to any of the characters, they are like little plastic cows in a model train set, placed here and there for aesthetic reasons.  At its core, this movie is thickheaded and hamhanded, lacking anything remotely resembling entertainment.  I guess dull and stupid movies have their place; after all, it makes good movies look that much better.",Null,3,5,26 May 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Beautifully realized, but it has eight separate endings
","***Spoilers herein***That's right, this film could have ended eight separate times, but it chose to keep going.  It's one of those movies where you think it's going to end, but then suddenly there's another scene.  I would rather have had fewer and shorter Hobbit close-ups and Family Ties-style hugging, and more Saruman and Treebeard.  The film skips Saruman's downfall, and he's relegated to a single sentence by Gandalf.  After all the crap that Saruman pulled, I really wanted to see how broken he was after Isengard's destruction by the Ents.  Speaking of Ents, Treebeard is in the film for about a minute.  It would have been nice to see he and Gandalf gloating over Saruman's downfall. I guess there was only so much they could fit into three hours.The three films are a tremendous effort.  There are breathtaking vistas, panoramas, and sweeping pans whisking you up and down Minas Tirith and Mordor, and the battle scenes are nothing short of remarkable.  In one scene, Legolas swings up the side of an oliphant and quickly kills everyone riding it, then fells the huge beast with a single arrow, all while the view is rapidly rotating around and around the maddened oliphant.  It is a stunning special effect.One problem I had with these films is the realism.  In both Minas Tirith and Rohan, there are absolutely no farms, livestock, fields, wagons, crops, markets, trees, or any of the other things that a city requires in order to provide for its people.  Watch the movie carefully.  See a crop of corn anywhere, or even one single sheep?  Where did they get the material for those clothes?There are two scenes with Shelob that are breathtaking in their simple horror:  there is a full view of Shelob, launching herself onto the little Hobbit with the tenacity of a rabid dog.  In the theater, everyone gasped at that scene, because it drove home the size of Shelob against the size of Sam.  The second one is where Frodo is by himself, on the path, and Shelob looms soundlessly over him.  It is creepy to watch.I'm disappointed by the truncated friendly rivalry between Legolas and Gimli.  In the book there was a rich humor in their odd-couple friendship, but it isn't really explored in the films.  Then again, there are so many characters that the film couldn't possibly explore them all.  Eowyn's story seems particularly abrupt; the tender moment with her dying father is pretty much the last we see of her.  I don't remember seeing her at the wedding. The moment she slays the Nazgul reminded me of St. George and the dragon. Also, Faramir's story ends abruptly too.  And what about the white tree and the restorative quality of kingsfoil?  It was those missing details that could have added more humanity to the film.There could not have been a better Gandalf than Ian McKellen.  He has just the right kind of wise, sprightly, smart-ass attitude that the character has in the book.  He's fantastic during battle scenes, whirling around, running back and forth, telling people not to give up, conking mad steward Denethor on the head with his staff.  I understand that Peter Jackson wants to make the Hobbit as well, and if so, it will be nice to see Ian McKellen introducing the dwarves one-by-one to Bilbo Baggins at Bag End.Frodo and Sam's trek through Mordor moves too quickly.  One moment they are in the orc's tower, and the next they are at Mount Doom.  How did they get there so fast?  Gollum's descent into the volcano was perfect.  In a final demonstration of just how precious the ring really was to him, he keeps it out of the flame until the last possible moment as he slowly sinks into the lava, deliriously happy at having the ring again as he ignores the lava that eats him alive.This film isn't perfect, but it's so faithful to the book and so carefully crafted that it's easy to overlook the faults and enjoy the breathtaking scenery.",Null,1,1,8 January 2004
Life," I thought it was okay
","I was sick at home yesterday so this movie filled two hours of my time, so that's something, isn't it? Movies are supposed to make you forget about your troubles, so they succeeded, even if it makes zero sense that they would 'catch' a gigantic probe headed right for the space station, a feat that would likely have resulted in the deaths of everyone on board. I kind of wish they had named the alien Steve, so they could comment on Steve's progress throughout the ship in loud voices. At least make the alien consistent...if it's able to survive outside the ship in sub-zero temperatures, then why can't it survive later on when the temperature goes down? They have specific, dedicated displays for the position of the air vents in the exam room, why? Why would this even be a thing? Also, I'm at the point in my life where I've seen enough of Jake Gyllenhall's open-mouthed stare, which is about as convincing as Kristen Stewart's open-mouthed stare. They should put these two fish in a film together in their own undersea adventure.",5,1,2,24 April 2019
Annihilation," They were zombies all along
","I'm not sure when this style of acting became popular, but someone needs to tell directors that having actors stand perfectly still while speaking in a monotone makes the film LESS exciting. I needed subtitles for the emotionless asian guy, who i suppose is thrown in for chinese audiences. Overall the characters come off like mindless zombies, not real human beings faced with the prospect of the end of humanity. The alien's motivation was unclear...it goes out of its way to distort everything within the shimmer but then has no problem looking exactly like human beings at the Adam & Eve ending. What does the alien want? Natalie Portman doesn't know. If you don't know, why should I care? An ambiguous enemy isn't terribly frightening. Also, the affair served no purpose and didn't advance the story at all.",4,1,2,12 January 2019
Donnie Darko," Ambiguity is popular again!
","***There are spoilers in this review***This dark, layered film almost hits the mark, but unfortunately it falls short, leaving too many unanswered questions and unresolved plot lines. We're living through another film renaissance, almost like the 1960s, with films such as Being John Malkovich, L.A. Confidential, American Beauty, and Chicago.  Everyone laments the largely pathetic output of today's corporate Hollywood production machine, but these films are among those who prove that high-profile culture isn't dead in America just yet.  Donnie Darko might belong among these thoughtful, painstakingly assembled films if only it had more substance.For some reason, this film is set in 1988, apparently only to include 80s music in the soundtrack like Echo and the Bunnymen (was this a coincidence?).  The only 1988 reference in the entire film is the presidential race.  So why 1988?  By the way, it's always amusing to see the number of ways that time travel, an old Hollywood standby, is incorporated into films.  This time it's some nonsense about worm holes.The film isn't all bad:  Frank is one of the most fascinating, layered characters since Dr. Lecter, and watching the unraveling of who he really is is like a mystical journey.  Though the idea of Frank as spiritual guide is intriguing, it is an empty gesture.  What purpose does it serve to teach someone a life lesson if they're, ahem, ultimately unable to use it? 
As beautifully subtle as most of the film is, it is the jarring baseball-bat-to-the-head inferences that bother me the most.  Donnie's teacher could not be any more conveniently repressed; any teacher who doesn't know the difference between Lorne Greene and Grahame Greene should be fired.  Then later on, the same teacher tells Donnie's mother that she believes she `isn't committed to Sparkle Motion' (the high school dance troupe).  I think it's supposed to be a funny vignette, but it's not at home in this movie; John Waters would have more use for it.No purpose is served by exposing Cunningham.  It adds nothing to the story other than that it hints that Frank might be real, and even then it's a stretch; you would think that an omniscient time-traveling one-eyed man would be powerful enough to set the fire himself.  And even then, the pessimistic expectation that the entire house would burn down and leave Cunningham's porn collection untouched for the authorities to discover would be just the motivation not to do it and instead simply alert the police. Whatever.It's easy to see why this film and the Matrix are so popular with young people:  they fulfill the aching question about the supposed unseen, influential force that directs peoples' lives.  Predestination was always a popular notion in uncertain times, because it meant that everything really wasn't your fault.  Since times will be uncertain for years to come, expect to see more of these fanciful films that reduce humanity to cogs in a giant wheel, like Magnolia.  I guess it's easier to believe in that than the fact that you make your own decisions and have to live with them.  In other words, if you're unhappy, most of the time it's your fault. 
There are sites devoted to picking this film apart, endlessly searching for buried symbolism; someone needs to tell these people that if you look hard enough, you'll find what you're looking for.  You need to be over thirty to understand that.On the plus side, the acting is good all around.  Drew Barrymore is wonderful as a liberal english teacher, and it is great to see Katharine Ross again.  This film is worth watching if you want to see something that breaks out of the mold, even if the effort falls far short of the mark. With more editing, this could have been a great film.",Null,0,1,4 May 2003
The Simpsons Movie," From a die-hard Simpsons fan
","I've been with the Simpsons since the very beginning, when I enjoyed the short cartoons on the Tracey Uhlman show. Even before that, I've been a fan of Matt Groening's work since the Life In Hell syndicated comic, and I fondly remember Akbar and Jeff ('lovers, or brothers, or possibly both'). Who knew that the sly satirical comedy of Matt's genius would translate so well to one of the longest-running TV shows of all time. It's amazing that the show has always found writers who can capture this spirit of satire, which walks a fine line between both portraying and ridiculing the typical American family and the characters with which they are surrounded. Granted the show has not always been spectacular, but it has always been among the best shows on television.So with such a storied pedigree, you would expect the film to be just as spectacular. Unfortunately, it suffers from what a lot of TV-to-movie translations suffer from: it's difficult (and apparently impossible) to translate a 30 minute program to a 90-minute feature film. First off, Marge's voice sounds weird. Because the characters have breathing room in the film, there is no incentive for them to speak as fast as they can before the next commercial break, so all the snappy, witty dialogue that I have come to expect from the t.v. show has been slowed down so much that the characters sound like they're sedated.Secondly, I have a huge believability problem with the film. Granted it's a cartoon, but it is physically impossible for Homer to ride the motorcycle at that angle inside the dome, for Bart to be able to reach the little hole at the top. In addition, pig poop is an organic waste, it's not some weird chemical that would cause genetic mutations in a squirrel, this whole thing was just beyond stupid and unwatchable, I had to hit the mute button during that. Also, the part where Maggie moves in and out of the sinkhole was lame, the physics of that are just impossible.Third, the eskimo woman sequence just comes out of nowhere, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I guess I expected a lot more parody from the film, at first I thought they were parodying Misery with that sequence, which would have been really funny, but instead it was just some lame plot device to get Homer to realize how self-centered he was being.Overall, there is a weird 'reality' type feel to the film, all the lightheartedness of the t.v. show has been sucked away to leave a harder, grittier Simpsons that I don't think a lot of people expected. In a nutshell: the film isn't any fun.As flawed as the film is, there are several bright moments that still make it worth watching: Homer and Bart on the roof, Homer daring Bart to ride the skateboard naked, the scene in the gas station when Bart doctors the wanted photo, Flanders constructing the hot chocolate. I'm glad I finally saw this movie, not because it was an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half, but because it proved that not everything is translateable to the big screen.Given the considerable talent and cash behind this film I expected much, much more.",5,2,4,30 March 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Starts off well, but erodes into banality
","***SPOILERS HEREIN***This movie starts out as a wonderfully cartoonish, big, brawling, slowpoke of a film.  With his hillbilly mannerisms, wall-eyed expressions, and perfect delivery, George Clooney gains redemption from the dreadful 'Batman and Robin' and 'Solaris'.  'I'm the paterfamilias,' he proclaims when he sees his daughters.  Priceless.This film's defenders are those who find genius in things that are merely different.  For example, watching John Turturro yodel is startling, but then so is watching a homeless man urinate in a bottle; genius lies in context, not in eclecticism.  After listening to the wonderfully original music that permeates the score, the viewer is then treated to an audience singalong of 'You Are My Sunshine', a song even more loathsome than 'Disco Duck'.The subplot about dueling politicans made no sense and contributed nothing to the storyline, other than as a convenient way to wrap up the ending. Is there any politician in the world who would storm into a crowded music hall and proclaim 'I am a member of a secret society'?  It was a very weak and very lame way of disposing of the subplot villain.  Why would a man who was so careful and crafty with his campaign throw it all away by raising the ire of a roomfull of people?  So stupid, and made no sense.  This is very sloppy writing by the Coens.John Goodman is not a very good actor.  Although he was brilliant as Dan Connor on 'Roseanne', he just doesn't have the range to play different characters.  He delivers his lines as Dan Connor would; little wonder then that the character is named Big Dan.  Fred Flintstone, Babe Ruth, King Ralph:  he plays the same character time after time, just like Morgan Freeman does.  However, he has a good screen presence, so it's understandable that he's a Coen brothers staple.  Holly Hunter, normally a firecracker, is ice-cold, and it's difficult to understand what Everett sees in her.  John Turturro is, as always, on the edge of mania, ready to fall off the deep end at any moment.  His howl of lust when he sees the women at the river is one of the funniest things he's ever done.  'Looks like Pete's got the itch,' Delmar deadpans in his philosophical way.My main problem with this movie is that there is no point to any of it. There is no goal and no storyline.  You can't identify with any of the characters, and it's difficult to accept Everett's longing to be back with his frigid wife.  Villians pop up right and left, but they are just temporary.  This film is like a series of half-finished thoughts, or half-remembered dreams, all leading up to a whole bunch of nothing.  The ending fizzles out like a dying candle, with Everett begging Penny to take him back.  Hmm, we're back where we started.With better writing, this could have been a great film.",1,44,109,11 April 2004
