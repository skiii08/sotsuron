Ali," Obnoxious....unsurprisingly
","I tried to avoid this movie, just like every biographical
movie thats ever been made. But it was on tv and i caught it.Yeah, now I wish I had just turned the channel over.
But it was the lesser of many evils on tv tonight.Awful...worse than I could have imagined.If theres a man who DOESN'T need a movie about him its ALI...just sift through youtube. The time will just FLY by watching old Ali spots. Forget this rubbish",3,0,1,21 September 2019
Creed II," I was rooting for the Drago camp
","You will watch this because your already a lifelong fan but my god this is rubbish.
It is just completely soul less. By far the weakest of all the series. The first Creed was good and had some grit. This one is LONG and FEELS it too.
The story is silly and kind of does tamper with the Rocky 4 legacy a bit.I was genuinely rooting for the Russians in this movie",3,2,4,25 June 2019
