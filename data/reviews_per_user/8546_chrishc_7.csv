Skyfall," 'The best Bond film' - er, yeah, of course it is.
","I bought Skyfall in a supermarket and was looking forward to it. I usually don't like to hear lots of information about a film beforehand, and in a way I had with this. I thought it was great, and really enjoyed it up to and hour and a half in. Something about that seemed slightly odd - I anticipated what did happen - in a good way. Then, the subsequent scenes were just stupid. The entire setup before the London underground thing was slightly daft, and then When you think about someones ability to predict and second guess (or third guess) - and it does not work - you have a problem. I like it when I see films and think 'Wow! I didn't expect that!' - but holy sheet, how could anyone predict it? Its an invention which is carried away. Anyway, it was a huge downhill slide all the way to the end. *spoiler*Is it misogynistic Bond returning? Yeah, we killed the woman, and now its all men again! Hurray! (apart from the secretary - isn't modern society brilliant?)",Null,3,8,26 February 2013
The Hateful Eight," Don't read - just watch. Or don't.
","I never read someones opinions prior to watching a film since it will cloud your judgement and taint the experience.Oddly, with Django and now this, they're two Quentin films my reaction to and feeling are sort of pretty much in a way whatever around the roundabout ho hum. I'd give it a 2.5 out of four. I loved Iain Banks, but I did not enjoy espedair street too much. I love Ben Folds Five, but their third album was so so. I loved Donnie Darko, but everything else he's made is awful. Quite why or how anyone you like is going to be non stop never endingly fantastically amazing says more about you being a crap eating fantasist than it does about they're unstoppable brilliance.Pretty much whatever...",6,0,1,12 July 2016
28 Days Later...," 15 million is NOT a low budget!
","This movie was remarkably awful, I had high hopes for 28 days later - mostly based around the responses from IMDB - since I don't consider Boyle to have made a single good film. Ok, the opening scenes... well after the Shot of the Pall Mall - didn't anyone notice the black figure walking away up the hill from Jim? I burst out laughing at that point - they spend all that time and money getting a deserted London and there's some guy in the shot! How did they miss that??? Anyway I was prepared to give it a go and was quite enjoying until the daughters speech on the balcony - this was so poor, and I mean very BAD - how can a Director allow such badly delivered (and written) dialogue into his finished film? The only answer to that question I can figure is that what they don't know about directing movies you could fit in the Albert Hall - a deserted one at that.Oh and why do people consider this movie Low Budget? 15 Million is a whopping amount for a movie. I could list all the bad things but there's no point. Bad bad bad.",Null,0,0,5 November 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," this movie will floor you
","I can't really add anything that hasn't already been said by the other users here. This film is remarkable. I was intrigued by the comments to the tune of 'best film i've seen and i'll never watch again' or 'amazing film, don't see it!'. But I can see their point, this film is more than just touching or upsetting, and I'm afraid I cannot articulate on what level it affects. But affect it does. Others felt that Schindlers List (who some have compared this to) was somehow more poignant because of the sheer number of lives destroyed in it. I felt that this simple story of survival said everything that could be said about War while avoiding the politics and propaganda so often associated with movies like this. That said, there are no movies like this. It is singularly beautiful and has some absolutely perfect moments. The animation of the little sister Setsuko is incredible. The English dub is also excellent. It's hard to analyse this movie in terms of it's component parts because the overall effect is so overwhelming. I'm prone to letting myself fall into a movie, but this film is something else. This should be a standard text, like the novel,Catcher in the Rye it's something everyone should experience at least once.",Null,0,1,15 March 2001
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," I don't recommend that you see this, but...
","I've never seen a film which made me feel like this: disturbed; disgusted;shocked; appalled etc. I can understand its rationale - to a point. It seems to show you how people can be, and were. Along with the French Irreversible, this is a film I've meant to watch for years, but will probably never watch again. Irreversible is a brilliant film, but not something I'd advise anyone to watch. If you want to, then do. It's odd, I don't tell you to never watch it, but I don't tell you to either. I never thought I'd sit on the fence, but there you go. I found Grave of the Fireflies more upsetting, but that was in a very different way. Its still mans inhumanity to man, whichever way you spin it. I think this is the kind of film you should watch on your own. If you're with others it might affect your viewing. In some sense, I don't know what.",6,0,0,28 October 2013
Rango," Nickleodeon are great aren't they?
","When you see the turtle in his wheelchair on top of a tall wooden podium with only steep steps up to it you think - this is just a film, why would descriptive things be important, the story doesn't matter on the reality of it. Right. Then you see them all go in a tunnel and explore past something with a big eye, what is it? What's that got to do with the story? Nothing. Ha ha. Then they come out of the tunnel and then get on their 'horses', which weren't in the tunnel with them. But what has that got to do with the story? Nothing. It starts of on a freeway, and the chameleon is 'freed' - only to become part of a gang which is being ripped off and supplying water to a human city, even though they are 'animals' - which has got nothing to do with the story so why am I whining on about it? This sort of nonsense happens a lot in this film, the writing is appalling - 'everyone needs to believe in something' - well, I 'believe' this movie is a massive piece of actual crap. Hurray for rubbish! Pixars UP! a fantastic animated film, the story is amazing, this one? Pfffttt!",Null,5,12,5 March 2011
Monsters University," Great - but not as great as Monsters Inc.
","I really enjoyed this film - but - there were a few moments where it seemed like over egging a pudding - or even scraping the barrel - almost. Monsters Inc. is my favourite pixar film - like Miyazaki - there isn't a moment where you're thinking about something else - or whats going to happen. A prequel is a sequel so its never going to be as good as the original, but its still great. Get Monsters Inc in the wide screen version as well, even though all of the UK DVD's are 4:3. You can get it.Always stay till the the end of the credits with Pixar - and mostly with Disney too.",8,0,0,23 July 2013
