Blade Runner 2049," Llacks the passion and desperation of the original.
","Blade Runner is a cult favourite, with its futuristic visions and the way it asked questions about humanity and being human. Equally riveting was the pace and plot. As Deckard fought for his life against physically superior replicants. Then, there was the romantic relationship between Dckard and Rachel, the beautifully cool replicant.This 2049 version is merely an extension of the original film. Stylistically and creatively, it does not break new ground. Though there are clever ideas and a great deal of detail.In terms of human interest, I found it hard to empathize with K because it didn't have enough of an inner life. Granted that K has an interesting relationship with a virtual girlfriend.Other weaknesses include the lack of a terrifying killer replicant like Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer). The mad genius played by Leto just does not match the mania of Joe Turkel's Dr Tyrell. Nor the other interesting characters populating the original film.The bottom line is that the film has a great deal of creative input, but lacks the passion and desperation of the original.",Null,10,18,7 April 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Film did not fully exploit its potential
","I can only rate it as 6/10. It has a scifi plot, with the human interest element of the three-persons-in-a cell drama.First, the cast did an adequate job though Goodman overplayed the lunatic. Mary Winstead photographed well. There was some good dynamics of the three people hunkered down. The aliens appeared briefly at the end and was credible.However, I feel that the dynamics of the three-persons needed to be explored further. Shifting alliances etc. In addition, I would have liked to see a stronger transformation of the heroine from scared young woman to fighter. After all, she survives a harrowing experience and chooses to drives towards danger.The plot had a great deal of dramatic potential, but this film did not fully deliver.",Null,1,4,15 March 2016
It," Very good
","This is the screen version of a Stephen King novel. Usually, the movie versions turn out badly. However, this film is a huge success.The screenplay is different from the novel which tells the story of the children in their first (in 1989) and second confrontation (as adults) with the monster. Instead, the movie ends after the defeat of the monster in 1989. Allowing for a happy ending. The novel's plot complexity is lost. But, the simplification turns the tale into a simple battle between innocence and an ancient evil.The young actors are excellent. Sophia Lillis is enchanting. Credit goes to the director and writers for making the villain creditable and fearsome.Bottom line is that the movie succeeds as a horror film.",Null,3,8,12 September 2017
Green Room," Very good independent flick
","Green RoomThis is edger and more complex than the director's earlier Blue Ruin. Same formula. A look at America's underbelly. Hapless characters caught up in something bigger. A tragedy played out to the end.A group of itinerate hard rock musicians are on a road tour. Living hard, they get a gig in a very rough neighbourhood. Unfortunately, they end up as witnesses to a murder. The hard men decide their fate. And, our merry band try to escape.Events roll on from there.This film has a better screen play, better dialogue, more diverse characters sketched sharply, better editing and prolonged drama during the stand off. There is not one, but two climatic scenes.Patrick Steward does a good job as the decisive leader of the ultra- violent militia. Who knew that there was a red-lace killer squad?Very credible effort by the independent film makers.",Null,0,3,18 February 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Did not meet my expectations
","**** May contain spoilers****In view of the threat to Asgard, I was expecting something like Game of Thrones. Unfortunately, the plot seemed contrived. Thor's long lost sister suddenly shows up. How was it possible to erase knowledge of her existence? The last Valkyrie is also conveniently at the Game Master's arena.Thor's friends and many Asgard heroes are killed by the villain. But, that doesn't seem to faze Thor.Asgard is destroyed, and Thor sails away with a handful of survivors. But, no great speech from Thor to rally his people.Then, there is the levity and low humour at the beginning of the film. Fortunately, the movie picks up momentum with a continuous stream of violence. Ended with a bang.However, IMHO, this was not a great movie. Entertaining enough for action fantasy fans. But, does not add to the mystique of the God of Thunder.",Null,4,15,31 October 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Warning: Movie intended for 12-year boys
","The movie is fun and light entertainment. However, the hero bounces around like an eight year old with the social confusion of a twelve year old.Fortunately, the project is saved by the gravitas of Michael Keaton.I left after an hour and dropped in on the screening of 'It'. Here is a tale of children forced to grow up quickly and defeat a monster. The villain isn't just a vengeful criminal. But, evil incarnate.",Null,34,56,12 September 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Brilliant and prophetic
","The film was made in the early 1960s during the hysteria of the Cold War. The Eisenhower administration had just ended. John Kennedy had permitted the Bay of Pigs fiasco. The Cuban Missile crisis had just ended. President Johnson would use the Gulf of Tonkin incident to escalate American involvement in Vietnam.In such a climate, Kubrick had the audacity to produce an anti-war film. And, it was a brilliant film because it attacked American society's repression and anxiety, which was the basis of aggressive patriotism. And, it attacked the competence and integrity of civil and military leaders.Kubrick did not make a breeding-heart anti-war film. He was not interested in giving love a chance. He was a realist, and he zeroed in on the crucial flaw in American society.Even 40 years later, the film has a timeless prophetic quality. Is the American government not in the hands of reactionary nuts and incompetents? Kubrick deserves our respect. He was a consistently brilliant film-maker and insightful analyst. It's a pity that the young people of today are fed a diet of Matrix films and MTV bites. They just cannot recognise a brilliant film about reality disguised as fiction.",Null,0,1,16 November 2005
Interstellar," Powerful movie
","I predict academy awards for the cast. Excellent job by all involved.For the non-technical, the physics can be confusing. Just take a ride along with the stunning visuals and the strong performances.The story spans many decades and (thanks to Einstein's special theory of relativity) our protagonist meets his daughter who is old enough to be his grandmother.Plenty of drama from mishaps and plot twists. There is the explorer/scientist who betrays his rescuers. There is the senior scientist who hid the truth.Above all, there is the vision of humanity dying as the planet turns hostile. Recommended. Emotionally and intellectually satisfying.",Null,1,3,7 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," One of the best of 2017
","Three Billboards in Ebbing Missouri (2017)Here's an strong indie feature in the mould of Fargo (but without the weirdness). Once again, Frances McDormand gives an excellent dramatic characterization.A grieving mother unsettles a small town by confronting the police for failing to find her daughter's killer. The aging Woody Harrelson plays the hapless dying police chief. Another casualty is the dumb hick deputy (Sam Rockwell) who expresses his morality through violence.Like a whodunit, this movie provides a wealth of revelations about familial relationships. The mother with her family. The police chief and his family. The deputy with his mother.The movie ends in a western-style posse of unlikely comrades. One (McDormand) seeks revenge while the other (Rockwell) seeks justice. Created without special effects. This engrossing movie rolls simply and angrily to its conclusion. Excellent performance by the entire cast.Warning: A significant amount of graphic violence.",Null,1,4,7 January 2018
Dunkirk," Limited in scope
","A big project. It has scale and intensity. Dunkirk is now a mythical moment in history. The film is a welcome reminder of the tragedy of WW2 as ordinary men are crushed by the weapons of modern warfare. There is much horror. Screaming men on fire in a flaming ocean. Soldiers burrowing for cover against aerial attacks. Trapped soldiers going down with the ship. On the other hand, there isn't much gore or body parts.Shown from the shifting POV of infantry men, pilots and sailors. We get a view from the ground/sea, then the same scene viewed from the air.What are the film's weak points? It provides a narrow claustrophobic view of the beach operations. There is no appreciation of the terrible tactical decisions made by the commander of the BEF. He made the unilateral decision to abandon the fight without proper preparations for the evacuation or rearguard protection.There is no insight into the triumphant Germans, or the plight of the French civilians. Insufficient tribute to the terrible losses suffered by the Little Ships of the evacuation.As the events cover less than a week, there isn't time for character development. Does not have the same impact as The Bridge over The River Kwai.Bottom Line: Interesting but not memorable. Recommended for those who like immersion, without getting their feet wet.",Null,3,5,2 August 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Warning - boring
","Walked out after 45 minutes. Sheer boredom. 80% of screen time was devoted to violence. Loud noises (crashes and explosions) and the destruction of cars, doors and buildings.Luke Evans had center stage and he has zero 'magnetism'. Did not make a good case for his side of the debate. Downing looked tired. The Bucky character was okay.Plot was paper thin. It is logical that the human world would want to rein in the superheroes after they conduct epic battles in population centers. But, the humanism is overridden by the violence and the negative motivations.My conclusion is that this movie was made solely for teens. For adult fare, look elsewhere.",Null,26,52,1 June 2016
Jurassic World," Less than entertaining
","Follows the same formula as the original. There are lost kids, love interest, megalomaniacs, strange beasts, thrills and spills.But, the big picture that the show tries to convey is less convincing. The insights about the relationship between humans and animals are weakly explored.In any case, there is a new wrinkle. The hero trains some of the velociraptors and uses them against the mega-monster. Good luck!There are thrills from the first minute too. But, the unceasing parade of thrills makes this film less entertaining. Special effects galore.Worth a look for the spectacle. But, not worth the time for a second look.",Null,3,8,24 June 2015
War of the Worlds," Saw the DVD
","I enjoyed the first half of the film. It was great seeing the Americans being crushed by the aliens. Of course, it was H.G. Wells' intention to show the dark side of the British empire which crushed and humiliated indigenous people. The rest of the movie was a disappointment. Tom Cruise had to be the obligatory hero and single-handed destroy a war machine. The American soldier were too clean and scrubbed for survivors. H G Wells wrote a fine novel. At its end, the beaten humans await their annihilation, but are saved by germs. Cosmic irony.This movie is deeply flawed because it lacks artistic integrity.",Null,0,2,4 November 2005
Arrival," It is satisfying. It is visionary.
","I was surprised to see the difference between the high ratings from the critics, and the modest box office receipts. Having seen the movie, I am satisfied.The film makers have created an uncompromising adult sci-fi classic. This movie does not have the loud music and continuous explosions of today's blockbusters. It is not about gung-ho marines on a bug hunt. It is not about a fantasy adventure in another realm.Overpowering aliens suddenly appear on earth. It is the task of the experts to learn how to communicate with them. You can only understand their intentions by providing the linguistic bridge between species. It is not useful to communicate by numbers. That only tells you that there is a compatibility in the sciences. The movie makes it very clear that there is ambiguity in any attempt to understand intent. A weapon can also be a tool. This should be obvious when you realize that humans often use the same terms (e.g. freedom) with very different interpretations and intentions.There is plenty of drama in the movie. The eerie appearance of the aliens crafts. The alien environment of a radiation suit. The technological marvel of the alien craft. The sinister response of the hard men in the military and CIA. The bomb attempt against the aliens. Above all, the movie highlights the disunity and enmity among human nations.In the end, the linguist (Amy Adams) solves the puzzle. Using her rudimentary grasp of the alien language to receive a message from the future. Thereby, saving the day. A far greater achievement than the mere mastery of anti-gravity.On a personal note, the linguist demonstrates free will when she chooses to get married and bear a child. Knowing that a tragedy will befall the child. To those who don't get it, you're not in Kansas anymore.",Null,3,8,22 November 2016
Wonder Woman," Finally, a superhero movie that I can respect
","I really enjoyed this movie. The saga of a birth-of-a superhero. From the princess on the island of the Amazons, to the war heroine of WW1, and to humanity's protector as Diana Prince. Directed by a woman who has never done a big budget movie. Bravo. I had no problem with the extra length of the movie.Gil Gadot is excellent as the innocent who discovers love and defends humanity despite their flaws. From the trainee warrior to the heroine and god killer.Chris Pine puts in an unexpectedly fine performance as the sincere Steve Taylor. Commendations for a strong supporting cast. In this film. the villains are treated with respect. Dr. Maru rejecting Steve's amateurish attempt at seduction.Good heavens! There is romance and tenderness. It could be mistaken for an adult movie?",Null,4,10,13 June 2017
Munich," Disappointing
","Another disappointing film from Spielberg! In the first place, this doesn't look like a $75 million production. The cast looks authentic, but the actors are not allowed to show what they are capable of.Compare this film with 'Paradise Now' made by an Israeli Palestinian, and showing the journey of two Palestinian suicide bombers. You can be sure that their budget was minuscule.It's okay to take a documentary approach; non-judgmental and neutral. However, the filmmaker has to have an incisive POV. What's the point of this endeavor? Spielberg is trying to say that violence brutalizes the participants, and does not lead to peace. Pretty trite, unless you can deliver the emotional punch of Paradise Now.The documentary footage and reenactment of the Munich fiasco does have an emotional impact for those who lived through those days. But, what value does this film add for them? What's in it for the rest of us? How could Spielberg have provided a documentary perspective? It is rational to deter an enemy by the threat of retaliation. Eleven Palestinian operatives for eleven Israeli victims. The lamentable point of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle is that retaliation does not work for Israel because of their political objectives.That is, the expulsion of non-Jews from Israel and the occupation of occupied territories by Jewish settlers. That is why the actions of this group of Israeli operatives were futile.On a historical note, Israel ceased its operation after the wrong man was killed in Norway. Five Israeli operatives were caught and convicted.The Palestinians ceased their operations in Europe after they realized that the attacks were a political liability.",Null,1,4,3 January 2007
Annihilation," Good acting but flawed movie
","Annihilation (2018)Ir's a scifi horror. The problem is that it's difficult to translate the first person account in a novel to the third person narrative captured on camera. There's a great deal of ambiguity about motive and responses.In general, the movie's premise mirrors that of the book. An alien organism arrives on earth, and begins to transform the area into an alien biosphere. Plants, fungi and animals are transformed as their DNA is altered.The threat is mentioned but not fully articulated in the movie. The alien biosphere is expanding rapidly and all existing life is threatened.In the movie, the plot about the expedition is very different from the book.Several military teams have entered the biosphere, but none have returned. Until the protagonist's husband mysteriously shows up alone on her doorstep.The protagonist (a biologist) joins an all-woman academic team to explore the strange new world. Apparently, radio and GPS is disabled. So, the team has no information from the previous expeditions. And, they don't realize that they have been in the biosphere for weeks.We don't know much about the team members, only snippets from the gossip between the ladies.They are horrified by the discovery of strange animals and flora as they follow in the footsteps of the previous expedition. Eventually, some are killed. Some mutate into plants.Realizing that they are changing, the team leader rushes to the core of the alien entity at the lighthouse, 'while I'm still human'. Why? Presumably because she hopes to merge with the alien core and mutate it. Her motive is not explicitly explained.IMO, the most significant discovery was that of the doppelgangers. The alien entity is creating identical copies of humans. Why? Presumably to understand/communicate/compromise with the existing biosphere.The story ends in an unsatisfactory manner. The protagonist manages to ignite her doppelganger and the entire alien biosphere collapses!With patience, the viewer can follow the growing horror of the humans. But, the screenwriter and director should also include the bigger picture in order to craft a better ending.In conclusion, it's a thought provoking narrative. But, lacks balance between emotive and logic.",Null,0,1,5 November 2018
Sin City," Stunning and unsatisfying
","Stunning and unsatisfying! The first viewing intrigued me. The second viewing came up empty.It's audacious, glossy, sexy, saturated, riveting, violent, and gory. But, it is unsatisfying like all comic books. How do you internalize the repetitious violence, repetitious nastiness and repetitious posturing? This is pornography, albeit artistic pornography. Yes, it is a form of pulp fiction. However, it isn't therapeutic. It does stretch the imagination, but in dangerous ways for an adult.How many times will you have to see this film to be satiated?",Null,2,4,18 March 2006
