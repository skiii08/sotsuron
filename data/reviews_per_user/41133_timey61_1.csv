Source Code," Inception, Groundhog Day and Back to the Future, all mixed into a great movie you have to see!
","This is one of those movies you can watch 10 times and it gets better every time. With its complicated, intelligent, mysterious, amazing plot, it could best be described as a mix of Inception, Groundhog Day, and Back to the Future. And it is at least as good as those movies. (if not even better)The actors were great as well. (even better than I expected) Especially Jake Gyllenhaal of course, who did a wonderful job once again. This combined with the amazing plot made the movie one of the best I have ever seen!I simply loved seeing Source Code. This is a movie you have to see!",10,1,4,25 January 2012
