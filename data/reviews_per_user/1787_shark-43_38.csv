Catch Me If You Can," Cotton Candy
","This movie has many things in it that work - most of the performances, a great Saul Bass-like opening title sequence, John Williams' score and terrific art direction. But it really is just fluff - there isn't much substance to it at all. Hey, look at this young con man who ripped off a major corporation (for those of you who don't know - Pan Am eventually went bankrupt. Certainly not because of this hustler, but losing 2 million dollars in fraud certainly didn't help - and 2 million back then was equal to 10-20 million now). And once again, a huge star doesn't have anyone in their camp brave enough to tell them they are doing something badly - Tom Hanks' awful attempt at a Boston accent was a joke! Did he study with Kevin Costner from '13 Days'??? I mean, what was the point? Why have him speak with that accent? Hanratty isn't eventhe name of the real agent who was after the real con man, so why try an accent if you can't pull it off? DiCaprio gives a fine performance (to add to his brilliant work in Gilbert Grape and his sterling work opposite DeNiro in Boy's Life) and Walken is powerful and sad as his destroyed father. But movie just moves along from scam to scam and Hanks looks like a complete fool as he is tricked over and over. Like cotton candy, you don't mind it while you're eating it, heck - you might even enjoy it, but later you realize there's not much to it and your tooth aches. (5 out of 10)",Null,0,1,10 January 2003
Minority Report," Cruise Hits A Triple, Speilberg Singles
","Tom Cruise gives a very good performance in a mess of a film. Phillip K. Dick, one of the most brilliant sci-fi writers of all time, is very hard to adapt, because when you read his stories, your mind and imagination are always going to come up with a much better visual than what a movie can show you. This movie seemed to want to be a whole bunch of things but it never came together as a one solid film. The main plot is smart and clever (Dick's) and that is what propels the movie, but man, it is no shock who the secret villain is and the last part of the movie is padded with the typical Hollywood twists and turns that are so forced and just basically tap dancing while you look at your watch and wonder when they're gonna wrap the damn thing up. Speilberg, a gifted director, has to get away from these dark, sinister attempts, just like the disasterous A.I., Speilberg tries so damn hard, using all the tricks and gimmicks available to him and even though it LOOKS good, it's slick and glossy and impressive, these dark, moody films of his never seem ORGANIC, they never seem to be coming from a real place within him. I mean, for crissakes, look at his logo for Dreamworks, a Tom Sawyerish boy sits on the moon with his fishin' pole???? I mean - how 1950's and sweet is that? THAT'S Speilberg - that's what he knows, that is what makes his heart beat, that's why he can hit a home run with E.T. and Indiana Jones, etc. They're fun and breezy. But his last two attempts to make these dark, brooding adult sci-fi films just seem like weak singles into shallow left field. In the long run, they're empty and hollow. All flash, no substance. (Oh, and a horrid cartoonish performance by Tim Blake Nelson as the wheelchair bound tech assistant - he seemed to be performing in a Coen Brothers film. Sheesh!!!)",5,1,2,19 July 2002
In Bruges," Violent, Funny & Thoughtful
","Really well written with interesting characters and off beat humor - some flashes of brutality and violence but for those that like quirky films with strong acting - try out IN BRUGES. Written and directed by a terrific playwright - the film takes its time with the two main leads - hit men hiding out in Bruges after a 'job' goes badly. Instead of one dimensional killers - the film shows them to be three dimensional with fears and guilt and hope and decency and love - just like anybody. Gleeson is a wonderful character actor and gives a tremendous performance here - Farrell is also a pleasant surprise - when he is usually put into the leading man roles I find him rather boring but he's powerful here as the naive, jump first =think later criminal. And Ralph Fiennes is a delight as the short tempered crime boss. I can see how this film wouldn't be for everyone - but for a crime comedy, it is very well done.",9,1,3,8 March 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino Meet With Your Editor!
","I enjoyed I.B. - it was fun, exciting - at times moving but it was too long - there were soooo many scenes he could have cut. I have no problem with a film that takes its time, that wants to move slowly but I feel at this point in his career - Tarantino is in love with every single scene that he won't cut it down for anyone - and here Tarantino is a movie freak - he loves these 70's action films, these wild European 'men on a mission' war films - well they most certainly aren't 2 hours and 32 minutes long! This could have easily been a 2 hour flick - having said that - the acting is tremendous - Waltz has a career making performance as the Nazi officer Landa but my god - Diane Kruger was heart breaking as the German movie star/collaborator and Ms. Laurent as Shosahanna was magnificent as was the young man who played the war hero they made into a star in 'Nation's Pride'. The actor who played LaPadite in the opening scene was amazing - in fact, the weakest performances came from the Inglorious Basterds themselves - Pitt was fine - he was having fun and it worked but Eli Roth should stop acting in films - he is stiff and wooden and I never believe him for a minute. One has to go into this film saying - we are gonna watch Where Eagles Dare meets The Dirty Dozen on acid - and then you have it. An enjoyable mess with some sterling performances.",6,1,7,30 August 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Clever Little Zombie Flick
","This movie is very witty and clever and even though it hits it's satirical topics over and over a bit too much - it still is flat out funny and has some wonderful touches. The opening satire of many people going through life like a zombie is well done but then the director keeps going back to the well once too often - but the relationships are well drawn and Shaun is a perfect member of the 'lost' late twenties generation. Nick Frost gives an excellent performance as his slacker best friend and it's great to see Tim Bevan - one of the stars of the hit BBC sitcom, The Office, put his TV money to good use. Bevan is one of the exceutive producers of the film and even makes a brief cameo. Overall, a little bit of gore, some chills but overall, just damn funny.",Null,0,1,29 September 2004
Oldboy," Brilliant, Disturbed & Flawed
","OLDBOY really affected me - I hadn't seen something like this in a long time - something that truly did creep me out. I agree the film has its problems but the acting is sterling (especially the lead guy)there are some amazing sequences of action and emotion and violence and some terrific camera-work. I hate it though when people have to react so violently when they don't like something - okay, so you disagree with some of the strong reviews and awards this film got. Fine. You didn't like it. Okay. But you all are hypocrites when you lash out at others who don't share your opinion. You liked this?? Bull****! This seems to the main thrust of many of the negative reviews and I don't get it. I get that you may not have liked OLDBOY. I have many times not liked films that the mainstream gushes over and throws awards at: I think Forrest Gump is incredibly overrated, but I don't lash out at those who embrace it. The main plot turn of this movie - guy in drunk tank, gets bailed out, stops to make phone call in the rain, boom - you wake up somewhere and you are a prisoner. If you go with that in pulp fiction kinda way - it really is quite disturbing. And the process of someone trying not to go mad, trying to work out in their mind all the people they have wronged - powerful stuff - especially when the lead actor is so strong. Plus the infamous loooong hallway fight with him and his hammer - slowly moving down the hall in all camera shot - it is great. Can totally understand that this film would not be everyone's cup of tea - but I enjoyed it - flaws and all.",7,5,68,29 October 2005
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How To Lose An Audience In 10 Minutes
","Thank god I saw this at a screening and didn't waste money on it. After the horrid reviews, I had low expectations but still -this movie is so predictable, so false, so by the numbers that it just unfolds because it has to. Who thought the names of the leads was a cute idea - see, she's Andi Anderson and he's Benjamin Barry and they say the names all the time in the movie as if it's catchy and clever as opposed to forced and created. I must be in the minority because I find Kate Hudson so irritating and an awful actress. She can't seem to play a three-dimensional character so she resorts to pretty much mugging for the camera - watch me make funny faces as I eat a hamburger, watch me giggle just like my Mom did thirty years ago. I'm sorry - but if Goldie Hawn wasn't her mom - she'd be lucky to get a dinner theatre part. Bebe Neuwirth and Adam Goldberg try their hardest but seem embarrassed to be in the movie. SPOILERS************ (as if there's ONE actual surprise in the movie) But, once again, the reality of a cabbie stopping on a bridge in New York - especially post 9/11 -please. Plus the crowbarred in way they have Matthew give the cabbie money to take her stuff back to her apartment so they can ride back on his motorcycle. Sheesh - a happy ending? Maybe for some, for me I was happy only because this insipid tripe was actually ENDING. Look, that's what makes the world go round - but when smart, clever romantic comedies like MR. JEALOUSY OR NEXT STOP WONDERLAND have trouble finding an audience and this coloring book rakes in the money, well, hell, you get what you deserve.",2,13,27,11 February 2003
Orphan," CUT Above The Rest
","ORPHAN is very well made - well-directed and full of strong acting - especially by Fuhrman who plays the 'little girl' Esther - you don't have a movie without her performance and it IS amazing. I am a big fan of THE BAD SEED and again - that is from a different time and rather dated but still chilling and fun and with a great evil kid. What I appreciated about ORPHAN was that it took time with the characters - especially the parents - so that when things start to snowball badly for them - you actually care. ****SPOILERS******* Now poor Saarsgaard has the thankless role of the non-believer - and this people are always irritating in horror movies - the last somewhat reasonable and logical person to finally open their eyes and 'see' - and of course at the end of the movie he does some incredibly stupid things - yes, I know they have him drink a whole bottle of wine so he's 'drunk' but even if I was smashed I would still go upstairs and grab my young daughter to protect her once I realized the adopted girl was dressed like a twenty dollar whore. But look - these movies are always a house of cards and you always need scares and drama and disbelief and for a 21st Century horror film - ORPHAN pretty much delivers. It's funny that Vera Farminga (sp??) also starred in a creepy bad kid movie a few years back with Sam Rockwell as her husband in JOSHUA - I like that film very much too but it is slower and truly NOT a horror film but a psychological drama about a disturbed kid and sibling envy and postpartum depression.",7,2,5,24 July 2009
Insomnia," Botched remake
","Look, Nolan is an incredibly talented director. He even does a nice job with the visuals in this remake of the vastly superior original, but that's the whole thing - the original is just so much more believable and human and messy and interesting. Hollywood again feels they have to clean up a flawed character - well, damnit, then write your own cop movie and leave the original alone. I also (maybe I'm in the minority here) can't stand Robin Williams when he tries to ACT! he is so one-note, so stilted, he made the killer so bland and boring it really hurt the remake. Seriously, go back and look at his performance - there is NOTHING going on in the eyes, face, nothing. he doesn't know what to do so he keeps himself tight-lipped and tries to give a sinister smile every now and then. Arrggghhhh! Please, seek out the original film by Skjoldbjaerg - it is so much better than this mess.",Null,1,2,4 June 2002
Cloverfield," It's a GIANT MONSTER ATTACKS movie - that's it, people
","I think people are getting waaay too worked up over this (put down the Taurine and step away from the computer) - let's strip everything else away and focus on what CLOVERFIELD truly is - it's a giant monster attacks a city movie - that's it - from Godzilla to Reptillicus to Beast from 20,000 Fathoms - it has been done forever and the fact that these filmmakers tried to create a new way to do it while still remaining faithful to the genre itself - well - they should be commended. Many things in the movie work - first off, I really appreciated the FACT that they did NOT explain the monster - who cares - you want a military scientist rushed in and blab on about toxins in the water or pollution or microwaves or Lindsay Lohan being responsible for it - all the old movies have that and you don't need it - whatever caused it - it's there and it's ticked off and ready to destroy. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)I loved how we saw glimpses of it - in my humble opinion - you did not need the big shots of it over Hud at the end - it was on camera too long and that's when the whole CGI of it looked lame to me. I tried to go with the whole premise of Hud filming as much as he did (otherwise you don't have a movie) but that was too much to swallow at times - like, hey dude - there are tiny scorpion/spider thingys trying to kill us - could you put down the *^&%$% camera and help me shut the door on them, please thank you very much? The way they taped over the previous Coney Island day was clever and I thought that was effective. There are some great scenes - the bridge being attacked - the initial 'earthquake' - the news cameras showing glimpses of the creature moving through the avenues - the subway tunnels scene and the helicopter crash - in fact, if the movie had ended when the copter crashed - that would have been fine with me - I did like how it seemed all the main characters died. Good ending. As for this talk that something is possibly seen falling in the ocean at the end of the Coney Island tape - I thought I saw something too and I liked that touch very much. See, that is one thing I did enjoy - they didn't overexplain, they let you figure stuff or analyze stuff yourself. Use the old brainbox, what. Don't need to be spoonfed everything.",7,1,4,24 January 2008
Final Destination 2," Silly Sequel, Impressive Gore
","Again, another surprise hit at the box office so Hollywood tries to squeeze a sequel out of it. Well, given that that isn't a very good idea and that this movie will pretty much be a retread of the first one (which I enjoyed - especially the beginning but 'Death' became absolutely ridiculous at the end - going through these preposterous ways to try and kill these teenagers)BUT this movie KNOWSthat it is a sequel and that it is silly so yes, the movie and the script are pretty lame BUT what this movie has is some of the most impressive gore and special effects I have seen in a big studio film in a long time. In fact, the opening highway accident is incredibly well shot and set up and the actually violence and trauma of the collisions are breathtaking. Plus once the doddering plot gets going and you are just waiting for the 'survivors' to bite it, well, the actual deaths are, again, very well done. Now does good gore make a good movie - no. But it certainly makes for a hoot to watch with some of your buddies. Nuff said.",6,5,9,20 August 2005
Closer," Talky, Insightful & Mean
","I liked CLOSER a lot more than I expected - I had friends who had seen the popular play in London (it later transfered over to Broadway and did okay in NY - but a much bigger hit in London)- my friends said it was well-written but a little overwrought for their tastes. So I had rather low expectations and I was very impressed with the performances of the four leads - they ALL have their moments - real quiet, REAL moments but Clive Owen and Natalie Portman hit it out of the park. Clive Owen is brilliant in the indie film CROUPIER, did nice work in GOSFORD PARK and continues to grow into a powerful film actor. He is amazing in this film and Portman follows up her solid work in this year's GARDEN STATE with a delicate, emotional performance as a little 'girl lost' in London who falls madly in love with Jude Law. Law and Roberts also do fine work and even though the screenplay is full of 'written' back and forth, snappy dialogue and rather cruel putdowns - the whole thing moves at a brisk pace under the steady hand of master director Nichols. An adult movie about jealousy, insecurity and fear - not everyone's cup of tea but if you feel like watching a mature film about troubled relationships - check it out.",8,4,7,14 December 2004
Elf," Big Elf, Big Laughs
","This movie has some big, big laughs it. It's clever and very well done. Even the artwork in the opening credits showed the makers of the film understood what they were doing- they were embracing all the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials (Rudolph, Frosty,etc.)all the other cheesy Xmas movies and we were going to have FUN. Ferrell is a strong comic force and he is hilarious in the movie - he gives 100% and it pays off. Great to see comic legend Bob Newhart on the big screen and the visuals of Ferrell crushing Newhart's lap is priceless. Now, it is not a perfect movie of course - yes, near the end it kind of runs in place and spins it's wheels and Caan's complete character turnaround is fake - he changes just because it is time to change cuz the mvie needs to wind down. BUT, come on,folks, this isn't Terms Of Enderament or To Kill A Mocking bird, it's a holiday comedy ABOUT AN ELF!!!!! And for that and it's high concept premise, it really  works. Sit back, eat the popcorn and enjoy it.",7,1,1,11 November 2003
Pacific Rim," Giant Monsters/Giant Robots/Giant Fun
","I guess I was just in the mood for a Giant Monsters/Giant Robots movie and didn't even know it. PACIFIC RIM has its faults but overall, it packs a punch! Good fun entertainment. I loved the way the monsters looked and overall, I thought the special effects were excellent. Del Toro is such a talented director - I loved PAN'S LABYRINTH as well his early underrated vampire flick KRONOS. The acting is rather uneven in this film - the lead guy seemed a bit dead eyed and stiff but I loved the Asian actress from BABEL. The wacky scientists seemed to be in a different movie but I loved their story line. I can see how this might not be everyone's cup of tea but I really enjoyed it.",8,2,7,18 July 2013
The Aviator," Bloated Yet Brilliant
","Scorsese tends to love every single shot lately and really should cut down his movies BIG time. There was a good forty minutes that could have been cut and yet I understand - the art direction, the costumes, the cinematography is stunning and he wants to show it ALL. I felt that DiCaprio gives a fine performance and by the end of the movie, I damn well bought that he WAS Howard Hughes.In fact, I felt the movie was very well acted. The plane crash sequence is one of the most exciting and disturbing and brilliantly edited scenes I've seen in years. I actually felt the movie spent way too much time focusing on Hughes' already well known germaphobia. In fact, I really despised the opening of the film and how Scosese felt the need to bring it back up at the end for a bit of a wraparound. The scenes with Hughes as a little boy being told by his mother about all the dangerous cholera and other diseases going around was a bit too on the head and then really jackhammered home at the finale. But the sequences on his obsession with filming Hell's Angels and the battles with Pan Am were extremely involving and fascinating. I've read a lot books about Hughes but the re-creations of the planes and aviation and some of the battle scenes in Hell's Angels was remarkable.",7,0,1,7 January 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," A Mess
","Yes, I am a fan of the original and at the time Craven made the 1977 version, he had little to no budget and yet the film is brutal and scary and disturbing. So now, decades later, with quite a lot of money, French director Aja is given the reins. The film has one flaw that a horror movie shouldn't have - it is rather boring. Now I like films to take their time - I'm a huge fan of Asian horror and they can be so effective at drawing things out so that dread is pushing down on your shoulders. But there were soooo many long scenes between the stranded family where nothing was happening and yes, at the end, when the 'gloves come off' and it's REVENGE time - the movie picks up speed and lots of violence and gore and so what? The mutants in the movie are so outlandish that any reality factor goes out the window, they are basically fighting comic book monsters. While being stalked by REAL humans, by real depraved psychos is much more terrifying than subhuman monsters out of Tales From The Crypt comic book. The actors deliver and I do feel that Aja has talent as a director. But overall the whole thing felt like a big empty excuse to use a 'brand name' in horror and show off the latest gore effects. Ho hum.",5,5,10,15 March 2006
The Fast and the Furious," Four Skid Marks!!
","Wow - where are all the drive-ins this movie should be playing at?? Roger Corman would be very proud of this trashy, enjoyable little film. It somehow works. The standard plot chugs along yet there are little interesting touches scattered throughout that shows some dimension to the characters. Great actions scenes and stunts. Rob Cohen has shot the film beautifully (even though his cameo as the Pizza Hut delivery guy needed direction! Hee hee). Walker as the lead cop is a bit bland, but overall this film works.",Null,0,1,25 June 2001
Ocean's Eleven," What a Great Looking Mess
","(Some SPOILERS)***********Is it better than the original film? Hell yes. But, that's not saying much. The legendary stories behind the 'making' of the Sinatra film are well known, especially how Sinatra would yell 'Move on' after the first take on almost every scene. he and Dino and Joey Bishop and Lawford were soused during most of it and the film is fun to watch in a kitschy Rat Pack kinda way but it is a bad movie. So, this one is better. There are some genuinely funny scenes, some fine performances and Soderbergh shoots all the action well, but, when all is said and done, it seems like Clooney put on a tux and said 'Let's just have some fun'. But the movie so falls apart and you have to just go along for the ride, but the ending OR endings really were strange. Orchestral music swells as it follows Julia Roberts out of the casino for no particular reason and after you pull off a very risky heist, would you just hang around, together, as a group, and watch a casino fountain??? Weird. And then the final tagged on scene where Pitt comes to pick up Clooney from prison - uh....so Garcia's men are just going to follow him for the rest of his life? Or only until he leaves Nevada? Not clear, not needed, not good. And Cheadle, who is so brilliant in Devil In A Blue Dress, Traffic, Out Of Sight and so many others, gives a bad performance. I couldn't believe it. He and the director must have become such good friends that when he said 'Lemme do an English accent' no one had the heart to tell him it sucked. He makes Costner's accents sound good. I am a huge fan of Soderbergh's work (from Sex, Lies & Videotape to what I consider his best film, The period drama, King Of The Hill) and this little trinket won't hurt him. He makes it move as best he can, but overall, why??? There are so many better heist films (Riffifi). Or even Thunderbolt & Lightfoot for that matter. If you catch it on cable, you might have fun, but if you get a babysitter, shell out close to 20 bucks, popcorn, big box of Goobers, I think you might feel as taken as Andy Garcia's character.",Null,0,1,7 December 2001
Spirited Away," Beautifully Done, Wonderful For All Ages
","I watched this with my ten year old daughter and we both enjoyed it immensely. We have seen other animated films by this amazing director/writer/animator (Castle In The Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service, etc.) but we both feel this is the best one we have seen (so far). The symbolism is there for you to make with it what you want - but for me - it is a wonderfully imaginative story about growing up - to go from when you are truly a child who is always taken care of, where every whine or sniffle or cry will eventually be tended to - but here - you slowly make steps to be your own person. T o learn - step by step - what you are capable of and how one can stand up for themselves in the world. It is so beautifully drawn - some of the images are breathtaking. Like the Wizard Of Oz, a little Harry Potter, and yet totally original - fantastic animated film!",9,0,1,3 September 2005
No Country for Old Men," Flip A Coin
","I am a fan of the Coen Brothers(Raising Arizona, Fargo, Barton Fink, Big Lebowski and Blood Simple) and yet I have also sat through films of theirs that just didn't work -- even with entertaining moments -- (Hudsucker Proxy, Miller's Crossing, O' Brother, etc.) - so I went in thinking I was just going to love this new one - especially with all the rave reviews in the press and I was with it - really enjoying it - until the shootout in the El Paso Motel room - from that moment on I felt the movie was off the rails and in the ravine. The acting is excellent - the cinematography is brilliant, but overall - I was disappointed with the final act. I understand the Coens were very faithful to the book (which is to be commended yet there are times one has to realize you are visually telling a story) but maybe they were TOO faithful. I'm not one of these viewers who needs things explained or wants everything tied up in a ribbon - but to invest so much time in Brolin's character and then not even SEE his demise - well that just ticked me off. And I also felt that once Brolin found the money (which is a good plot point for dozens and dozens of crime films) the movie just kind off moved from one bit to another - some of them amazing but some of them bland and one-note. The scene with Bardem messing with the old timer who runs the gas station is one of the best, most tension-filled scenes I have ever watched - brilliantly acted, written and edited. Bardem (who is so damn good in Night Must Fall), Brolin and the rest of the cast are terrific - I loved Tommy Lee Jones' opening narration but I must be in the minority in not liking his little speech about his dreams at the end. I think it's a good film, a flawed film but not a great film.",6,8,13,13 December 2007
The Pianist," Harrowing
","This film is very powerful, very harrowing and hard to watch at times - the evil that humans can afflict on one another is chilling. A true story - it is effective and dramatic and even uplifting. I thought the lead actor, Brody did afine job (I've been a fan of his since his sterling work in Steven Soderburgh's underrated gem, King Of The Hill). But the film is flawed - Polanski has never been very subtle as a director lately and there are times when he could have pulled back (the little girl with the empty bird cage, the freakish looking jews being forced to dance with each other, etc.) - and the script in the long run (maybe because of the scope of the whole thing) is a bit thin in places - I never felt like I knew that much about Brody's character so while I was certainly invested in his survival - I didnt really feel much dimension to him. Afterawhile the film takes on a one, two, three feeling: this happened, then this happened, then this happened, etc. But the music is amazing, some strong performances and the art direction is Oscar caliber. A sad, tough, gritty look at one man's attempt to survive at all costs.",8,0,0,28 December 2002
City of God," Relentless and Powerful
","This film is incredibly well made and very powerful. The violence, the poverty, the ignorance, the complete lack of respect for human life becomes relentless and after all, numbing but that is the point. There is no hope anywhere in the slums and the gangs become the only thing there is. The performances are amazing - incredibly strong. Quite violent. A Brazil Scarface, Good Fellas and The Killing all rolled into one. Check this film out. One of the best of the year.",Null,0,2,3 January 2004
Moulin Rouge!," YIKES!!!
","I did enjoy this filmmaker's 'Strictly Ballroom' and I will give him credit for TRYING such a daring piece as 'Moulin Rouge'. But just because someone TRIES doesn't mean they SUCCEED and this film is a colorful, beautiful to look at MESS!!! John Leguizamo gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen captured on film. He plays it as a one-note cartoon character with a speech impediment. All of his 'cronies' were like cartoon sidekicks that quickly grew tiring. Ewan and Nicole do give fine performances but how many times did we have to listen to the same line from 'Your Song' sung over and over and over??? I am a huge fan of British actor Jim Broadbent (See 'Life is Sweet' or 'Bullets Over broadway') but this is the first time I've actually seen him be bad. I couldn't wait for his 'Like A Virgin' number to be over. This film obviously divides into two camps, those who loved it and those who hated it. I just found it's story line simple and predictable and when you take away all the art direction and lighting, it's just a lame doomed love story. And the 'Roxanne' number??? Could they have found someone with a worse singing voice? They might as well had the Cookie Monster yelling out the lyrics!",Null,0,1,8 June 2001
Garden State," Impressive Debut
","Garden State is a good little movie. *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS*****Braff is a very talented actor, he does a terrific job as a director and I'm sure he'll grow as a writer. The script is the main flaw - much of the writing is 'young' - in fact I believe EVERY writer in the world has a short story, a play, something in a drawer about a dead Mom. It is such a tired little area but Braff does bring some new and dark, interesting insight into it. The film is full of great performances and Portman does a wonderful job playing a quirky, flawed girl who meets Braff's character at a doctor's office. The film is a bit slow in the beginning but I liked how it took it's time and there are scenes in the second half that just soar - really work with their humor and power.",10,0,2,2 August 2004
Mulholland Drive," A Wonderful Mess By Lynch
","I enjoy Lynch's work very much (Blue Velvet and the brilliant Elephant Man are my favorites)and in Mullholland Drive, I was blown away when some magical scenes just went on and on and they worked and then BLAM - the pacing would be killed by pretentious camerawork (this is a complaint I have with Mr. Lynch sometimes). But he lays out a hypnotic puzzle and as I said, when it works, it really works. I had never seen Naomi Watts before and I was incredibly impressed with her multi-layered performance; from playing the innocent girl arriving in Hollywood to the strung-out jealous walking time bomb, she was incredible. I was able to see this at a screening, so maybe if I had shelled out nine bucks or so, I might have been a bit more frustrated with the film at times, but here I just sat back and let Lynch take me for a ride and aside from some questionable left turns, I loved it!!!",Null,0,0,27 October 2001
Paranormal Activity," Sorry, Folks, Overrated.
","I like indie films - I love hearing 'the little engine that could' stories in show business - so good for the filmmakers and actors. But this movie did not work for me at all. The VERY end was effective but so what? Everything else that led up to it did not scare or terrify. In fact who knew hauntings could be so boring? This slightly annoying couple argue - the camera is providing the only real evidence to her case and yet the girl says over and over 'turn off that stupid camera!'. If only he had. And look, I liked Blair Witch Project a lot - I felt that once that movie got going, the scares built and built to the climax. Here - we see a sheet move, we hear a bang, etc. And I have no problem with movies taking their time and being subtle but for the sheer use of sound to scare someone - rent the original The Haunting - a Robert Wise film - excellent ghost story that uses sound very effectively. People keep saying 'can you believe they made this film for only 11 grand?' And I'm like 'Yes! Yes I can! It looks cheap and it is full of cheap thrills. No thrills really.'

","INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so I certainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I was blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes the film a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook is amazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (but probably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there are pacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well and the film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remember noticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of Altar Boys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be for every one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain images and moments stayed with me. Penn is getting better as a filmmaker with each movie he makes.",10,197,278,24 October 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Wow!
","I remember seeing this quite young in the theatres and even though I did not understand it - I was blown away by so many of the sequences. The art direction and the special effects in space were stunning for their time. I now own a copy of the film and every now and then I just put it in the VCR and it doesn't matter where it is, I just watch and am blown away by the consummate film-making. Kubrick was a film genius who made great films (Paths Of Glory, 2001) admirable ones (Barry Lyndon) and messes (Eyes Wide Shut, Shining, Lolita). I just showed Paths of Glory to my wife for the first time and man, what an amazing film about war and madness and cowardice amongst officers.",8,3,6,24 November 2000
Saw," SAW is (S)AWFUL
","SAW is a mess of a movie - and I'm not talking about the bloody, filthy conditions the two lead actors find themselves in when the movie starts. Now, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of clever things in this movie. It really TRIES to pull it all together but overall, the movie is just full of plot-holes and some real laughable moments of pure stupidity. Poor Cary Elwes has had a real strange career - he is absolutely charming and funny in Princess Bride and since then he really seems to have lost his way - showing up in second and third leads - playing the stiff boyfriend or the shifty cop. Here is a hardworking doctor who finds himself chained to a pipe in a killer's lair. (Again, this whole notion of someone being able to just turn an old factory into a torture chamber with millions of dollars of equipment and accessories is just ridiculous). Elwes really tries to make the moments work but I swear to you, near the end, his work goes so over-the-top, so hammy and corny - you want to call the Screen Actors Guild and have them stage an intervention. Also, the so-called police work that is done in this movie is so unintentionally moronic that the audience I saw this with was howling at some of the dumb mistakes Danny Glover makes in this movie. This is one of those serial killer movies where at various times either a cop or a tortured wife or victim get a chance to have an actual gun pointed at the killer and instead of shooting him many times or wounding him or disabling him or shooting him in both ankles, etc. they just point the gun at him and scream obscenties until they can be overpowered. The film really isn't scary or gory - just rather unpleasant in a Seven kind of way. Horrible things happening to humans and even children. I like this genre and there are some powerful moments in Saw, but overall, this movie should be chained to a pipe and left for dead.",4,1,2,6 November 2004
The Last Samurai," Cruise & Ego Get To Play Swords
","I am a fan of Cruise. He has done strong work throughout his career (including the powerful psycho in TAPS right up to the nuanced pain of JERRY MAGUIRE)but event though there IS a strong story at the core - a damaged, haunted soldier from the Indian Wars looking for something instead of a whiskey bottle or suicide or both - is quickly brushed aside for the typically hollow, beautifully photographed Hollywood 'epic' - lots of shots of Cruise practicing with a stick or a sword in front of gorgeous sunsets and snow-capped Japanese mountains. It becomes so predictable and ridiculously close to Costner's immersion with the Indians in WOLVES that it becomes stale and one-note. Sweeping, yes. Some great fight scenes, yes. And the Japanese lead is wonderful. But this Zwick film becomes as tortured and ridiculous as his other bloated 'historical epic', LEGENDS OF THE FALL. Not worth your hard-earned cash.",4,3,7,3 January 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Bi-Polar
","I really liked the first MATRIX and was looking forward to this one - but it really is a mess. The first one had it's flaws but it also was full of this unbridled energy and this second one seems to be going by the numbers 'Oh well, we just had a long philosophy 101 scene, time for a fight. Cue the thumping music and let's kick some BUTT!!!' Yawn. Don't get me wrong - there are stunning fight and action scenes in this movie - the freeway chase, the fight with the hundreds of look-alikes - they really are amazing. But oh lord, such stilted dialogue and such heavy-handedness in so many of the performances. To have the character called The Architect with his sinister white hair and villian cliche voice, I mean it was laughable. I still say the filmmakers best film is BOUND. See this Matrix, you'll have fun, you'll eat popcorn, you'll jaw will drop at some of the action, but most of the dialogue will have you smirking and cursing your old college philosophy professor.",Null,0,0,21 May 2003
Love Actually," FEEL GOOD KINDA BAD
","This movie is enjoyable but also tries way too hard to make sure the audience feels good. The music swells with timely lyrics at certain points to make sure you 'GET IT' - it's like an annoying friend sitting next to you, jabbing you in the ribs to make sure you 'get it'. Feeling good, feeling teary, feeling bittersweet??? Huh?? Are you?? The film doesnt trust it's material so it throws in the whole kitchen sink - while their are wonderful scenes and performances, there are also parts of the film that feel so cloying, so manipulative, so sappy, you want to scream. Richard Curtis is a very funny writer - both on TV (Blackadder) and in film (Bridget Jones, 4 Weddings...)but as a first time director his work was rather flat and stale. Maybe that is why he felt the need for almost wall to wall music. Plus it does seem like he had all these scraps of paper in a drawer with dozens of ideas written down for scripts and he decided to throw ALL of them into ONE movie. SPOILERS########SPOILERS: I could have cared less about the best friend secretly in love with his buddy's wife and the storyline of the stand-ins (nude)was predictable and one-note and the goofy Brit going to America to get hot chicks was stupid and seemed to belong in another teen movie but there was passion and fire in Emma Thompson's story, Hugh Grant was quite funny and the little boy with the crush on the girl singer was fantastic. And even though I liked the work of Colin Firth and the cleaning woman - I mean, please, he is going to just MARRY her???? Not maybe go out on a few dates first - gauge the HUGE cultural differences they might have- let alone the language barrier. But, yes, you would have to be a corpse not to FEEL something as certain stories wrapped up but Curtis needs to not be so heavy-handed and pushy with the message. Yes, yes, we get it. Love - Good. Sheesh.",Null,0,1,13 November 2003
Man on Fire," Death Wish Meets The Nanny
","This is a simple little revenge film - not bad, not good.SPOILERS*******SPOILERS**** Scott the director once again says, Wheeeeee, lok at me, Im directing!! which is a bit annoying. There were times when some of his techniques were interesting and I enjoyed the way some of the subtitles were used. Washington gives an effective performance as does Dakota Fanning and R. Mitchell as the mother. But the film spends waaaay too much time showing us how sad and troubled and damaged Denzel's chracter is - we get it - he was a hired killer - he's haunted. Lets watch him drink some more as the focus goes in and out. Sheesh. Lots of violence. Some of it effective and I did like how the main chracter dies at the end. But man, Washington was sure playing it up to the hilt. The movie hero giving it all for the little girl. People will probably enjoy it on cable but shelling out ten bucks is a whole nother story.",Null,0,0,19 May 2004
Vanilla Sky," Not Bad Remake
","SPOILERS ALERT I was a big fan of the original film 'Open Your Eyes' and not because it itself is a perfect thriller. It actually was a bit of a mess, but also a daring, thrilling and interesting mess. Anytime a filmmaker decides to work in the area of dreams/reality/dream state - they can become lazy because of the freedom this genre allows. Something not quite making sense - something not quite pulled off??? Oh well - it's a dream. I can totally understand how Cruise would see the original and think., 'Man, I could play the hell out of this guy' and he does. Cruise gives a good performance and this remake is actually better then I thought it would be but...(SPOILERS AHEAD+++++++++++++++++++++++++YE BE WARNED+++++): ...THE WAY EITHER CRUISE AS A PRODUCER OR CROWE OR THE STUDIO insisted on how things MUST be explained (and overexplained) for that matter, is insulting to adult audiences. The Spanish film laid it out there for YOU to decide what really happened and this film should have done the same. But obviously someone said NO - we must explain - we must paint a sign for the audience so that ends up being quite a letdown. The film is very well cast and Cruz (who is never as good in English as she is in her native tongue) probably gives her best performance in a Hollywood film (of course she's already played this girl in the original and she is as sparkling in this one as in Amenabar's version). The real surprise is Cameron Diaz's work. The role is a bit underwritten (or maybe trimmed down in the final cut) but she really gives dimension to what could be the one-note psycho stalker. When you think of her work in Being John Malkovich, Charlie's Angels and now this - she really shows she can bring good work to almost any kind of film : art house, action blockbuster, etc. By reading some of the other comments, i can see that many people don't want to be challenged by a film, they don't want to have to do any work as they watch a film, and that's fine. I understand that. But carp about it when a film DOES try and make you think. There are plenty of other mindless films out there, God Knows, so when movies like Lantana, Vanilla Sky, Innocence or even Mulholland Drive try and work outside the normal constraints of Hollywood movie making, give them a tip of the cap. My one other complaint with Crowe (who I admire very much) is he really has to stop with the wall to wall rock song soundtrack. We all know his Rolling Stone Magazine background, we know his wife is Nancy Wilson Heart, but there were many moments in Vanilla Sky where you DID NOT need a song to remind you what feeling might be needed. It was a bit much - trust a scene to work without the pop song hook. 6 out of 10 stars but worth a viewing.",6,0,0,27 December 2001
Signs," Scary, Restrained, Falls Apart
","SPOILERS*****SPOILERS (somewhat):Shyamalan's newest film has much in it that works and he is to be commended for what he DOESN'T show - the tiny glimpses of the aliens were much more effective than the usual 'Hey, look what we made on a computer! Doesn't it almost look three-dimensional and alive??' In fact at one point when a video shot at a birthday party reveals a quick sighting of one of the aliens - well, that was incredibly eerie. This young director might have the misfortune of making a classic so early on in his career (Sixth Sense) and thus will forever be compared to that - much like Orson Welles with Citizen Kane (Even though I like Magnificent Ambersons and Touch Of Evil even better than his first opus.)And I really must take to task the one poster who totally dismisses Sixth Sense as crap because, he, the great genius of the world, figured out that Willis was already dead. Well, good for you, but just because you figured that out does not take away the fact that Shymalan still wrote a tightly crafted, smart and clever ghost thriller. How's your screenplay going? Why don't you try it. In the times of Scream 3's and gazillionth Halloween movie, the fact that someone is even trying to scare you with sound and character as opposed to what a sharp implement can do to the human body is most welcomed. Now, back to Signs - I thought the first hour was incredibly well made and unfortunately, once he set up this incredible story - you have aliens coming to earth - well, what are you going to do about it? And to just have the news come back that'hey, guess what - the aliens are leaving!! Woo hoo!!!' Well, that's just lazy storytelling. And it also was just so pat and easy that Gibson gets his faith back. But, setting up the Gibson character and his struggle with his faith and his battle with his oldest son was powerful and interesting and well done. Overall, the acting is the real strong suit to this film. Gibson (who can just put it on cruise-control) gives a great performance as does Phoenix. And the always dependable Cherry Jones does some fine work - especially when she has to tell Gibson the horrible new about the accident. So on a scale of 1-10 I give this a 6.",Null,0,1,12 August 2002
Amélie," Well-Made Heartfelt Gem
","This movie is extremely well-made and well cast. The beginning takes off like a jet and the clever and insightful story unfolds in front of you like a perfect meal. Some may fight the sweetness and goodness of the piece, but I feel the filmmaker strikes a wonderful balance between whimsy and reality. Some wonderful pay-offs at the end with supporting characters and their stories plus some wonderful huge laughs. Touching and funny. I'll take that anyday. (Plus it shows how clever a romantic comedy can be as opposed to a by-the-numbers mess like Serendipity).",9,1,3,3 November 2001
Warm Bodies," Clever Twist On Genre
","WARM BODIES marketing campaign probably hurt it cuz you couldn't tell if it was a romantic comedy WITh zombies or a zombie movie WITH comedy. But we finally watched it and I thought it was very clever and funny. Hoult & Palmer were terrific. The opening monologue was hilarious and immediately showed how funny sharing the inner thoughts of a zombie would be. LOVED that John Malkovich was the militaristic leader. Haven't liked most of the other films Jonathan Levine has made but this was very well done. Romeo & Juliet with a BITE! They satirized everything from makeover montages, sidekicks, zombie folklore, etc. And the music used throughout was GREAT! Bravo! Hoult has really grown up since being the little kid in ABOUT A BOY!",8,1,1,16 November 2013
Dodgeball," Dumb Fun!
","I had low expectations for this movie and was surprised how much I laughed. It is just silly, stupid fun. Dont go expecting a strong story - it is the predictable underdog sports movie but they also have great fun lampooning all that. The great Rip Torn (Larry Sanders Show) chews up the scenery and everyone does strong work. I do feel, however, that the only reason Christine Taylor is in the movie is because she IS Stiller's wife. She did dead-on funny work as Marcia Brady in the Brady Bunch Movies, but since then I always find her kinda drab and one-note. Stiller and Vaughn play off of each other quite well and the cameos by B-Level actors are hilarious! Some really funny bits and I hate to admit it - but it IS really funny to see people absolutely whammed with a ball.",7,0,0,1 July 2004
