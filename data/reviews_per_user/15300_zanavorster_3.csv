The Avengers," BEST MOVIE EVER! Think about all of you favorite Marvel heroes and put them together and BAM! you got The Avengers!
","This movie would probably be a dream come true for Marvel-Freaks! I for one ABSOLUTELY LOVE this movie!! It's action pact and full of drama, with all of our favorite actors starring as all of our favorite superheroes... Not only are the good guys FANTASTIC, but also our favorite villain: Yes, Loki! I was soooo exited for this film, and was in no way disappointed! The movie does not just offer you action, but also a lot of HUMOR!! Robert Downey Jr's quick and remarkable jokes almost made me pee in my pants!! And Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was once again incredibly entertaining! Best Sci-Fi in like,,, a century!! This movie is guaranteed to impress! WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!",10,2,5,9 May 2014
Megamind," A unsuccessful villain defeats his enemy, but then realizes he gets bored without him...
","This has to be one of the best animated movies EVER!!! A complete surprise this was, since I thought it would be Amazing, but it turned out to be even more incredible than I imagined! This movie is SUPER! In every way possible... It's funnier than ANY adult movie, FULL of action(not violent of course) and has some kind of lesson to it! Well, OK, I'm a HUGE animation fan, but Mega mind really didn't seize to AMAZE me...It has Super(using the word AGAIN, sorry!) funny characters with so much sass to them! Especially the main character! Will Ferrell out did himself! I recommend this movie to ALL audiences. Any one with a bit of a sense for humor would die over this movie!! Such a unique storyline AND COMPLETELY unpredictable... DO SEE THIS MOVIE!",10,0,3,17 May 2014
10 Things I Hate About You," A new student falls in love with a popular girl, but her father won't let her date unless her older sister does. He tries to find a guy brave enough to go out with her.
","I absolutely fell in L O V E with this movie!!! And not just with the movie, but also with Patrick (Heath Ledger's SUPER sexy and brilliantly seductive,charming character). With a brilliantly written script and AMAZING young actors, this movie is filled with unexpected humor and sweet teenage romance. Both the main characters were stunningly portrayed and very amusing to watch and I found the unusual personalities very interesting. I completely recommend this movie, this film is SUPER CHEEKY and 100% FUN! Best way to spend your Friday evening. And don't worry, this review was under no circumstances influenced by my LOVE for Heath Ledger! Oh, and by the way the soundtrack is actually pretty good... P.S: I've watched this movie like 3 times in one week!",10,0,0,9 May 2014
