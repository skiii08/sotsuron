Moneyball," 9.5/10
","This movie is cinema at it's finest. Many were skeptical of Bennet Miller's ability to take Moneyball, a bland story about an idea put together by baseball executives. Let me say this: they were wrong. I'm not one to hand out high ratings lightly, but this film goes above and beyond my expectations. The script, penned by Aaron Sorkin, Oscar winner for The Social Network, is brilliant. He works in comedic elements well still keeping the film as dramatic as it should be. The editing is clean and well thought out, greatly adding to the effect. Pitt delivers a heartfelt and honest performance as Billy Beane, A's GM and former major league dud. He fakes his cool well when discussing ball with his fellow higher-ups, but shows that he is really soft and emotional. Jonah Hill shines, showing Oscar potential as nerd Peter Brand. He shows he can be more than some high-school idiot from Superbad. Now, where the film shines is the direction. Miller captivates a sense of excitement out of a bland story without resorting to sex or violence. His suspense is shown through tension between characters and slow development. The excitement when Scott Hatterberg (the delightful Chris Pratt) hits his walk-off home run to break the winning streak record (Completely true to real life) was so great there were cheers in my theater. The film wraps up perfectly, showing the flaws with the idea of moneyball and wrapping up Billy's personal dilemmas. Miller expertly changes what was the story of an idea into a character study of a man with as many problems as his team. Moneyball is pure bliss.",9,2,5,2 October 2011
