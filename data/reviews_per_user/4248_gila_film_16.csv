The Blair Witch Project," A great independent effort
","Three filmmaker students are trying to capture the myth about a local witch in their cameras. The thing goes terribly wrong when they find the truth can be more lethal than the fiction.  As truth to be told, Blair Witch Project (BWP) is confusing me when I firstly view it. I felt certain inconvenient of it, because it is not a normal movie (if you know what I mean). Then I decide to watch it once again and I surprised by the way it amuse me. Refreshing, thrilling and innovating as well.  The actors really natural on their roles, the plot is thicken, and the dark atmosphere is awakening. I almost believe that this is a documentary feature. BWP is fit all my expectations about a decent horror movies, things that really rare in the post-Scream horror movies.  The documentary style is adding the plus point of the movie. In general, BWP is an alternative horror movie that guarantees to entertain you. 8/10",8,4,7,18 February 2003
Minority Report," One Of The Greatest Movie
","It's kinda confusing to make sure exactly the main genre for the Minority Report. Is it action, sci-fi, suspense thriller or drama ? Well, actually it's a perfect combination of them all. Definitely one of the greatest movie ever.After the A.I., it's seem that SS change much on his directional line. Even though he doesn't off his 'popcorn' style completely, but it has more dark atmosphere there.-----CONTAIN SPOILER-------- I must warn you, the action sequences that appears on the trailer can be so deceiving. The action's portion is so small, but you wouldn't disappointing with the plot it self at all. It's so great. Totally Guarantee.8/10",8,0,1,11 December 2002
The Others," A Scary Drama
","It's so Hollywood type. After  'The Sixth Sense' became the big hit, they have successfully throwing us with another supernatural thriller-drama. 'What Lies Beneath', 'Stir Of Echoes', 'The Gift',etc, you name it....But, as the part of the trend, I guarantee this one will be different.Of course, as many ghost story film, it have it own absurdness, but it won't be our focus here.I promise, 'The Others' is both chilling and touching drama, that will keep you on the edge of your seat, especially the very surprising ending, that in my opinion is even better than The Sixth Sense.The Story is about a woman, Grace (Nicole Kidman), who moves with her sick children into a mansion on an isolated island while her husband is off at war. Unable to withstand sunlight, Grace's children must live in total darkness. In their isolation, they discover that they are not alone. There's a ghostly presence in their house......I know you will think it's just another haunted house flick, but trust me, do not trust the plot ! Just come to the theater near you, seat thight and enjoy  this frightening drama....Even it's not so original, but it's one step ahead from another supernatural flick, so I give 9/10.",9,1,2,3 September 2001
Silent Hill," Disturbing yet Beautiful
","In his 'Silent Hil's review, Rober Ebert said 'Perhaps those who have played the game will understand the movie, and enjoy it'. Well, I never played the game and I understand the movie and I totally enjoy it. Frankly, Silent Hill is one of the finest horror movie that I ever watched recently! Silent Hill is based on a video game and thankfully Uwie Boll doesn't put his hand on this.Sharon Da Silva (Jodelle Ferland) is suffering from night-walker and kept saying 'Silent Hill' in her dream. Despite the hesitation of her husband, Chris (Sean Bean), Sharon's mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell) take her to the site. Now deserted, Silent Hill is a ghastly looking town and full with secrets that Rose must reveal if she want to save her life and her daughter life.Silent Hill is about mystery and maintain it with full of disturbing yet terrific visuals and scares. The mystery is so captivating and never let our attention wander around. Silent Hill also barely rely on just scare tactics. In my humble opinion, the horrors are not so scary, but Mr. Gans succeed to keep us as the audience to seat still. Yes, the story somewhat surreal and have some holes, but is hard for any horror movies without holes. And the holes this movie contains is not in the annoying rate, but still tolerable.This is the third movie of Christophe Gans, after The Crying Freeman and Brotherhood of the Wolf. Once again he shows his ability in images and scenery, which is beautiful as visuals. He also could keep the atmospheric elements from the games and that I might say is also borrowing from the J-Horror style. I do not complaining about it since the result is good.The acting is always could dependable form the cast, since Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean and Deborah Kara Unger is amongst of the finest actors that I ever know. They bring a solid performance that delivers the tension that the movie need.As conclusion, Silent Hill is a first rate horror movie and must watch for the genre's fans or the video-gamers that love the game.",8,0,1,22 August 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The ultimate story telling
","LOTR:Fellowship Of The Ring is definitely a master in film history. I never saw a film that's so perfect. There's nothing wrong with this film. Drama, horror, action, epic and adventure in just one film, can you imagine that? The best film ever made! I don't know what else to say. I just want to worship this film, and I hope all the two LOTR films can be great like this.

Moulin Rouge!," Wickedly Classic!
","I'm always enjoying a musical movies, because they always provides both story telling and entertaining music. Moulin Rouge is absolutely one of the wicked musical classic. Baz Luhrmann does something extraordinary here. The visualization is so magnificent, even though the story is so plain and common and has been rehash for many times. Nicole Kidman is adorable. Such an actress. Ewan McGregor is charming as always, but he does to learn more about singing. In general, Moulin Rouge is great. But, if you don't like a musical flick, I think you should avoid this, because you won't enjoying this flick much (I even have to watch it twice to enjoy it more completely).8/10",8,1,2,12 December 2002
Titanic," My heart will go on and on...
","I remember when I watched `Titanic' back 1n 1997/1998, I had watch it for about 6 or 5 times in the theater. And it's not just me because everybody does! Being the holder of the world record for the most successful film ever made and winning 11 Oscar, crafted it became a true classic. No one will ever forget easily to Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater three days romance that ended with tragedy.  Even tough many critics said that `Titanic' was nothing except a piece of shallowly and clich√© crab, but James Cameron proves that he could manage a wonderful tale of love and one of the most disastrous event that ever happen became one in a magnificent visualization story telling.
The chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is so strong like they are really meant to be lover. The romance is thrilling, the action is heart-pounding and the F/X is first class. I barely can find any flaws on it. 10/10",10,0,3,2 January 2003
Scream," The best in the genre
","Fear Can't Kill You, But A Question Can Do It.......Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore), A girl from Woodsboro, a quite small town, is terrorized by a phone.

I know that for some folks, this is nothing but a piece of garbage that need to throw as soon as possible to the disposal, but this movie actually is smart and scary, and you must watch it.This is a perfect combination between thriller and horror, and that make this movie is the best in the genre.

Halloween," The classic that start it all
","On an eerie night, a child slashes to death his own sister. That boy, Michael Myers, than became the living legend of terror, return to the 20 year later, to kill his other sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee-Curtis). Laurie survived that night. But Michael is unstoppable then.
Halloween is the first that came out in the slasher genre, and on that time, Halloween was surprisingly good, an independent movie that carried a new dimension of terror (and many of copycat, of course). Jamie Lee-Curtis is the original Scream Queen. All my salute to her. In general this movie is fairly entertaining, but don't expect too much for the viewers of posh Scream era, because it's a bit lame. Anyway, thanks to Halloween, and John Carpenter, now we have another variant in the horror genre. 6/10",6,0,0,23 December 2002
Shrek," The greatest fairy tale ever retold
","I never really want to watch animated feature, because I think it's only for kids. I ever noticed the fuzz about 'Shrek', and from what I heard 'Shrek' is a fabulous film. But it's still doesn't impressed me, because it's only an animated feature, right?And then, yesterday, incidentally I watched it on video, and (as you can guess) I was wrong, because 'Shrek' is more mature than I thought. It has everything, comedy, action, adventure and romance. I know a fairy tale is usually a simple romance for kids, but in 'Shrek', you will find a kind of mature love story cloaking in a sweet romantic comedy. I was really moving by Shrek and Fiona romance tale.The plot line is quite simple and rehash the fairy tale that we ever heard, but made by the fresh many fairy tale used to do, but in such a very extreme different ways! I just love it.Mike Meyers and Eddy Murphy contributed their voice with an powerful force. Cameron Diaz is really show her spirit and make 'Shrek' more delicious to digests.10/10",10,1,2,17 January 2003
Vanilla Sky," Thanks God I watched it closely
","I heard the fuss about `Vanilla Sky' before. Some say well, most say bad. The polemic made me so curious about this movie. So, I decide to give it a chance. Prior the comments that I ever read on IMDB.com make me want to watch closely and I glad I did. Actually, the main idea of `Vanilla Sky' is quite simple, but Cameron Crowe try to reach our attention with a more complicated way, if you know what I mean (see it to your self!).  I understand why many viewers feel deceived by this movie, because their expectation is about to watch an entertaining light movie. Well, they should do the opponent way, just like I did and then they will feel the amusing elements.  I like the way the movie entertains me. Somewhat, similar to what `The Truman Show' did. Watch it with heart and passion and in the end, your expectation is achieved. One thing bother me is the lack of the chemistry between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. I don't know with Penelope, maybe she should just stand for those Spanish language movies instead.  I worship Cameron Diaz though, because she looks so stunning and got such a fabulous acts. She definitely one of my acting divas. In general, avoid `Vanilla Sky' if you want to watch a light movie (as a regular movie consumer), but a-must-see if you a truly moviegoers.

Signs," Enchanting
","with a title like 'Signs' and provocative trailer, we easily can dub this new film feature of M. Night Shyamalan, as an edge-of-your-seat-thriller. Well, it's a gripping thriller certainly, but just was not as we used to think of.Set in a rural area of Buck County, Pennsylvania, U.S., 'Signs' tells us about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) that find a mysterious appearance of a five-hundred-foot design of circles and lines carved into his family's crops. His children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) thinks it was an alien works. Evidently, Graham doesn't consider it. He easily thinks it's a prank from the locales. The only person that aware about what happening is his younger sibling, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). However, when the crops around the globe showing the same phenomena, his faith is being tested once again and when the fate of his family as the stake, he must reveal what lies beneath the Signs.Sometimes, we have a certain difficulty whether we have watched a good or bad movie. The same wonder struck me when the first time I watched 'Signs'. I felt deceived by the trailer and promos (I even have an interactive CD-ROM). I thought I would encounter that another Hollywood summer blockbuster, but I was wrong, because it seems I have watched a lame and boring little thriller whatsoever. Moreover, because I was not satisfying enough, than I decide to give it a second chance. From my second encounter, than I realized what 'Signs' is really about. 'Signs' is about a man's journey of faith, presented in an enchanting suspense-drama. Mr. Shayamalan succeeds to build the tension that it needs. It is raising our emotion from the low to the high by step by step, until on the climax our emotion erupts to the expectation. The drama penned by Mr. Shyamalan given beautiful and moving touch. The suspense is very griping. The performance of Mel Gibson, Rory Culkin and even Abigail Breslin are superb and giving a huge contribution to the film's structure. Only Joaquin Phoenix hardly serve his role decently, because it seems he play it with an over acting way. Overall, 'Signs' is a beautiful drama portraying an ordinary people in an extraordinary situation. 'Signs' is a what-if, so don't bother to push your logical sense on it and you will get an enjoyable cinematic adventure.8/10",8,0,2,18 February 2003
Am√©lie," Almost Flawless
","I'd like to watch a drama film with deep humanity theme on it. That's why I fall in love with Am√©lie. I even fall in love with Am√©lie her self. I never found such character and such film like Am√©lie. With an incredible pace and amazing story telling, Am√©lie share us about human relationship and how important it is to be a human it self. God, I wish I can meet with someone like Am√©lie.But, there's nothing perfect on this earth and so with Am√©lie. I just felt that the characters on Am√©lie (except her off course!) undeveloped well. They just hang there without any further story as a final conclusion.
Finally, in general Am√©lie is superb, and it's a must see for everybody.9/10",9,0,2,12 December 2002
Final Destination," The new style in slasher flick
","Many people said that this movie is really a scary supernatural thriller. I agree with they said, but I don't see it as that, but it's to me just another typical slasher flick, because it has the standard rules for that (I Know What You Did Last Summer's rules), like the gory killing of the victim and (off course !)the bogeyman. But, it made smartly by James Wong and make this movie as an innovative slasher ever. Imagine, you are been stalking by the unseen Grim Reaper (!). How can you cheat it ? Just watch this movie and find the trick, and you will never regret it....8/10",8,0,2,22 November 2001
A Walk to Remember," Surprisingly good
","When I first realized the premise that this film offers, I felt that this film is none others than parts of that big fat and overdone teen flick. I know it sounds clich√© as well, but I must admit that I was wrong. This film surprisingly good. Good plot, good characterization, good directing and many other good things as a film can be (esp. for a teen flick).The film it self is such an inspirational thing. We'll get back from the theater with relieving something that life is so precious to waste and we must run it more useful. Believe me, you wouldn't disappoint about this.P.S.: Mandy Moore is such a bag of talents and by this film, she's one of my favorite babes ^_^.8/10",8,0,0,15 December 2002
High Fidelity," Defy that melodrama!
","If you want to experience an alternative romantic comedy, you definitely must watch `High Fidelity'.Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is the owner of a semi-failing record store in Chicago. He employs Dick (Todd Louiso), an introvert and shy guy, and Barry (Jack Black) the antithesis of Dick. Even Rob and his buddies consumed by the music and popular culture, but that not so help much his relationship with either his long time girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) or all his previous. In an attempt to find out why he is so clueless in a relationship, he starts to dig on all his past romantic life and learn how to commit in a serious liaison.`High Fidelity' is a strictly enjoyable film. All the characters perform so natural, came along with the non-novel plot. It is a sure thing so refreshing in the genre.John Cusack plays his role respectfully and so do the rest of the casts.  It is surprising me that Catherine Zeta-Jones as one of the cameo, and she looks so gorgeous and talented as usual.In closing, you will fill a little (or much) distracting by the time you watch `High Fidelity', if you usually could enjoy a plain and typical romantic comedy. Nevertheless, as truth to be told, I really hope there is will be more like this come from Hollywood. 8/10",8,0,1,18 February 2003
