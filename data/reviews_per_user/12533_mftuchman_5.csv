United 93," Powerful
","This is an emotionally difficult movie. It brings home the cold, chilling nature of evil and the bravery of those willing to face it. Watching this movie is like reliving a trauma,and viewers are recommended to discuss it afterwards to enable a smoother emotional recovery. The lead villain played their role with absolute sang-froid, which made the actual takeover all the more terrifying. This movie will go down in history as one of the greats in the chronicle of evil, second perhaps only to Schindler's List. Even though this is an historical movie, and the outcome should be known to most Americans, its contribution to the event is a look at both the highs and lows of human potential.",7,1,4,13 May 2006
The Fault in Our Stars," For a deep movie, a lot of saccharine moments
","I spent a lot of time checking my watch, wondering when this movie was really going to get rolling. When it did, it was good, but the whole movie could have used some more editing. Also, I found it had for me an annoying 'life is beautiful' postcard-y sense about it for such a difficult topic of kids dying of cancer. There was little difficulty or real conflict in the first three quarters of the movie. Laura Dern's talent was completely wasted. Willem Dafoe put in a fine performance as a crotchety, hateful writer, but it wasn't enough to add any real depth to the movie.I wish I could say I liked it more. Hazel, Augustus, and Josh came off as likable, real people, although A's perfect attitude began to bug me as the movie wore on.",6,1,3,15 June 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Tedious
","The entire LotR series was done in three movies, and they couldn't finish the Hobbit in one? This slow paced clunker failed to amaze most of the people in my family, and focused too much on visuals rather than action, dialogue, plot, or character development. CGI alone does not a movie make.Yet for all the tediousness of the initial dwarf visits, they failed to capture the charm of either Bilbo or the guests. It seemed that in the book they captured him with the power of adventure and the fun of being a burglar. The movie's version of the scene had all the excitement of a deposition for an estate in probate. The Hobbit's plot isn't deeply complicated. A tighter, better screenplay can still be true to the spirit of the book. This one misses the mark. It just wasn't fun.",4,6,14,30 December 2012
The Godfather: Part III," Unwatchable
","This movie is way too facile in the way it attempts to resurrect Michael . The whole thing felt like a giant backpedal, and it was just a self serving tour guide with some pretty scenes. In my view, the glossing over of difficult or destroyed relationships actually undoes (not in plot but in spirit) the entire second movie. The acting is second rate, and by the time the plot got rolling, I didn't care. The love scenes were awkward. Andy Garcia seemed plastic and unbelievable, and Sophia should have stayed behind the camera.There was some suffering all right, but no Godfather could ever undo the movie goers agony at having to sit through this mess, not even at a daughter''s wedding.",1,16,24,13 April 2015
The Sixth Sense," Powerful and Sweet, but a little Schmaltzy in places
","This movie has been out for six years. Although this appears to be a story about the supernatural, it is really about our hopes that we never are completely separated from those who love, or loved us.After a traumatic evening with a man breaking into their house, our Hero's life goes into a tailspin. He cannot seem to connect with his new patient, a young boy with similar symptoms to one he could not treat. His wife is distant and uncommunicative. He often has difficulty keeping track of time. And on top of all this, the patient claims to be able to see dead people. Sure, here's an easy case to solve in a stress filled life.This often has parallels to our own lives, as those who love us come closer and farther in a gentle, undulating wave. But we are not prepared for the separation that no amount of work can undo. It is this poignancy that the movie captures so expertly. Granted, it is couched in supernatural terms, but the lessons for us mere mortals should be clear.The soundtrack is superb. James Newton Howard has made several mediocre movies quite bearable, and here he makes a good film into an excellent one. The track is truly one of the important characters in the film, and does its job by staying in the background without interference.There are some moments of startling horror. I have seen this movie many times and I still jump at places.The pacing is well done, and the characters are all developed sufficiently for you to care about them. After six years, I still recommend the Sixth Sense.",7,1,1,29 September 2005
