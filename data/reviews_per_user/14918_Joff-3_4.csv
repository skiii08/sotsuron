The Blair Witch Project," Don't bother.
","*****Possible spoiler here*****The Blair Witch Project trod upon new ground in filmmaking in that it let the viewer's imagination fill in (some but not enough of) the voids left out of the actual film footage.  Objectively speaking, this movie accurately portrayed increasing feelings of despair, fear, and hopelessness as experienced first hand.  I experienced a true sense of fear and even dread a few times during some of the night sequences.  I never knew what was going to materialize out of the darkness, and when the lights came on it was almost worse.  The daytime sequences were too 'real'.  Imagine shooting video while running through a wooded area looking through the viewfinder. My wife literally got nauseous.  My advice?  Borrow two expensive camcorders, give one to a friend and tape each other running aimlessly through a wooded area shouting the 'F' word about once every 10 seconds or so.  Be sure to include some too-close close ups and some night shots of nothing in particular.  Continue until both cameras are broken.  Now sit down together and figure out how you're going to explain the broken equipment.  That's watching 'The Blair Witch Project' in a nutshell, feelings and all.",Null,1,1,18 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The most moving film I have ever seen.
","This was the most incredibly moving film I have ever experienced.  I say 'experienced' because this is not a film that you 'see'.  You 'see' 2010. You 'see' Star Wars.  You 'experience' Private Ryan.  From the beginning to the very end of the show, you are hopelessly attached to your newly acquired best buddies in the world who are real people with fears and aspirations and attitudes and personalities and everything.  This is not the G.I.Joe hero story where the good guys always just manage to not get shot.  This is war, as real as I can imagine it: up close and very, very personal.  If you have served our country, thank you for whatever it is that you did FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.  If you know somebody that was in a war, especially WW II, please go and experience this movie.  I guarantee you will see them in a light that you may have never seen before.My rating?  Definitely on the drama / action must see list",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
The Legend of 1900," Beyond mere words!
","When I saw the teaser for this movie, I thought to myself, 'Movie or sleep?' I'm very VERY glad that I decided to watch the movie.  It has become one of my favorite drama movies.  I cannot begin to say enough good about it. When this movie comes out on video, I'll own a copy of it.",10,0,2,30 September 2000
