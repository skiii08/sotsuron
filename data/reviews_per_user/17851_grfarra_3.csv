Walk the Line," Predictable and boring
","At best, average storyline, Phoenix was impressive but every other bit was amazingly mediocre",5,0,0,1 May 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," So lame and uninspiring
","Foster's acting is so uninteresting and bland. Hopkins' escape is ridiculous, the killer looked very unsophisticated and stupid, the whole movie was full of weaknesses.Had potential but the serial killer was just too stupid, we never understood what motivated his killings, we never got a deep understanding of his character. All in all a dumb movie, extremely hyped",5,1,1,15 March 2020
Black Panther," Trash movie
","It's a clear example of 'hype'. I can't believe how how hard the media pushed for this movie, after watching it for 30 min I couldn't take it anymore and switched it off.Awful acting, poor plot build up and very dumb dialogues. It's almost embarrassing",1,2,4,29 May 2020
