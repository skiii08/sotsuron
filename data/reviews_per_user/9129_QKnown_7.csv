Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'm Defending this movie and here's why.....
","Since this movie was way overhyped, It's no huge surprise why it has recieved so much negativity. But Let's be real now..On a George Lucas stand-point, he did his job to satisfy the STAR WARS fans with the saga's FIRST,  (I'll say that again)    THE FIRST!!!  Episode of the whole Star Wars Legacy.On SWEp:1-TPM,  here we are invited to a different looking galaxy (NOT THE ONE THAT SO MANY OF US WERE USED TO IN THE OLD TRILOGY, you know:star wars, empire strikes back, etc,)  This is a galaxy that seems to have gotten along fairly well, untill a greedy trade federation intervenes (*SPOILERS--->Headed by a mysterious leader-Darth Sidious AKA Palpatine, who happens to be the main evil character out of the whole series) It is here when we are first introduced to the Jedi characters. Not much is known about them, but we will soon get into greater depth with them..in future episodes.. And that's what my main point of this review is!You cannot blame this film just because the previous films were so much better! Well, You do have an argument there because George Lucas CHOSE to introduce us to the STAR WARS galaxy by showing where the saga had reached at that point! Here he is showing where,how, and why those things began! (Whether it was budget problems or not)Examples for hatred of this film:1)'The acting is wooden and terrible' - Jedis are'nt supposed to be wise-cracking Han Solo types.2) -It's possible that Jake Loyd (Anakin) could have been played by a different, more tolerant kid, But Lucas wanted to show that the future DARTH VADER was'nt an always evil person.3)- 'Jar Jar'- a species created for comic relief, If you did'nt find him funny keep it to yourself, (personally i find Jim Carrey & Roberto Benigni more irritating)4)-' Script?' I guess that the critics and viewers in this day & age, plus the hype, expected something more challenging & universal going for this picture.  All you have to do is look at this picture UN-AWARE of what will become of the future of this imaginative saga!!!!5)- 'Too much CGI' Does Disney get a lot of flack for too many animated characters in their movies? When will we viewers realize that a motion picture is just a motion picture, despite its effects. Plain and simple.6)- 'Darth Maul'  Everybody expected a successor to Darth Vader, but with Maul we get an introduction to the Dark Side of the Force, nothing more nothing less, this is where the mystery begins (That is, If you are tolerant enough!)7)- 'It did'nt seem STAR WARS enough'  AGAIN, this film is supposed to take place at a different time when things were'nt as darker as they would soon be. *SPOILERS*--> Once Anakin has accepted the dark side of the force and helps lead the Emperor, AKA Palpatine to conquer all of the galaxy, then thats when we are brought into the familiar territory of the old trilogy--- YET 'The Phantom Menace' is a film alone that still sparks interest into wonderous filmaking, whether you like it or not.My whole point is that these series of films should be looked at and admired of how they will proceed in TIMELINE order. Not when they were made, but when they take place.Because believe me, In time, when new generations view this saga, they will be appreciated with what they will see in THE PHANTOM MENACE.

The Jungle Book," Still my favorite Disney flick
","After seeing what Walt Disney's studios have given us throughout the millenium, The Jungle Book remains as my most favorite. There's no over-the-top animation that we are used to seeing nowdays, just a plain simple story of a little orphan boy who wants to stay in the jungle.All the characters are memorable and the songs and music is catchy. Timeless!",Null,1,3,10 November 1999
X-Men," Worth the wait!
","Seeing the X-MEN come alive on the screen sure was something special! Enough praise should go to director Bryan Singer who seemed to have a lot of pressure making this project since a lot of die-hard fans did'nt think it would be made right, thinking that it would be another weak comic flick.Well this die-hard fan was pleased Big time! At first I was skeptical about Hugh Jackman (who?) playing the one and only , Wolverine. After seeing a few early publicity stills of him, I was'nt really impressed. But all that changes once you see this picture, this is a strong candidate for breakthrough performance of the year. Yet I do agree little with some of the other comments here regarding the other characters. While Professor X and Magneto shine on the screen, the other X-men and Brotherhood of the Mutants rarely have much to do. Yes, Sabretooth is much more than just a roaring henchman, But lets face it , not everything can be perfect in films so I'll let this one slide.That's just about it! There are no other flaws that turn the film into a mushy,predictable flop. It all runs so smoothly. The action, the special fx, the sound(Be sure to catch this flick at a new theatre with special surround sound or you'll miss Professor X lurking around in your brain!)and the story. Of course there will be more story to tell when the sequel(s) come around, and I wont mind catching all of them, as well as THIS one for a second time  :-) **** XMEN4EVER",Null,0,0,16 July 2000
The Doors," The psychadelic RAGING BULL
","Much like pro-boxer Jake La Motta, Jim Morrison had a talent but those darn inner demons kept calling. Also, Jake's arena to show the world his capabilites was the boxing ring while Morrison's was the music stage. I thought Oliver Stone did a fair job in capturing the 60's as well as his filming fury. Pretty top notch stuff here. Of course, there are a few inaccuracies in this film, but we're used to having different stories told to us. It works in a tough movie like this one.  ***",Null,1,2,3 November 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Still among the greatest...
","Since I've yet to own a DVD player, I just recently bought the '99 VHS version with '15 minutes of additional footage'. Well, that mysterious footage did'nt appear on my tape for some reason, but I am still satisfied with what I saw. It was as though I was put back into the blasting theatre when I first saw this gem on the big screen, T2  still reigns as one of the greatest sci-fi/action masterpieces ever seen.Honorable mention should go to Brad Fiedel who composed a  solid musical score ever put to a motion picture.",Null,1,1,4 September 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Well, what more could be said?
","Years ago, I remember reading some sci-fi books about the greatest films ever. I came across 2001 a few times, and all the  articles seemed to talk about was the character HAL in it. Since 2001 came out way before my time, I did'nt know what these articles were talking about. So, in '93, I finally decided to see what all this 'HAL'   stuff was about.Well, HAL just turned out to be a minor character in the story. For it was the strange monolith in the film that kept me in amazement & its purpose is the stuff that keeps me fascinated with films!Of course, theres a few slow moments in this film that drag on for quite a while,but It still has enough kick to keep you glued to the screen to see what will happen next. For those of you who still get confused with the ending. 2010 (the sequel) explains a few things.RIP Stanley Kubrick",Null,1,4,26 October 1999
The Thin Red Line," a motion picture that gets better with more than 1 viewing
","I'll agree with the haters, who thought this was a boring, nonsense drag, when i first saw it.But if you would only give it another chance, It would soon sink into you, as it did me. The Thin Red Line turns out to be a masterpiece. Gripping the true viewers who look at movies for a reason. I'll agree with the commentators here at IMDB that say it's at the same wavenlength as 2001:A Space Odyessey. First off, pvt. Train(!) is the main narrator of this movie! Not Witt! If you don't believe me, put your CC (closed caption) on and see for yourself.  The main question of the picture, I believe, is that War is capable of destroying all that God has given us, but why? Thats the reason why you see the beautiful landscapes, exotic animals, etc. Of course it goes further than that, Showing what man can go through. Man has the emotions. As Col. Tall (Nick Nolte in a perfect performance) says 'Nature's cruel, Staros' giving the backbone of what is going on. Yet the soliders in Charlie Company show you what goes on in their minds: 'I killed a man, worse thing you can do...'You are my sons...'Who are you to me?...Nothin''Shut up in a tomb, can't lift the lid....''Be with me now...' Add all this with the excellent cinematography plus Hans Zimmer's gorgeous score and this is a great film. This is one that i won't ever forget. Like I said before, please check this one out. Even a forgettable character like pvt. Train plays a huge part in this. ****",Null,0,0,17 November 1999
