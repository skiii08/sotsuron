The Avengers," They make the 'effects' better and better
","I'll start by saying that when I bought tickets to this show I was a little sceptic. First because I did not imagine how can you build a story involving Hulk and Thor, were is Tony Stark's arrogance and attention going to fit and finally will it all be just a bunch of no sense fights. But as the action went on all my fears were shattered, Tony was still arrogant but funny in the same way, I loved the nagging between Hulk and Thor, Captain America was exactly how it was in his own movie, a true believer, a true American. The story was not that good but I did not see huge plot holes lake I've seen on Battleship for example and the small comedy involved between the fighting scenes made this movie even greater.",7,1,4,19 August 2012
The Notebook," You wanna know what love is? Check this movie!
","My 10 vote it looks like a bug comparing to what this colossal movie is. It is so good, so epic that even if you're in one of the saddest moments in your real life it will make you smile. We have a romanian song called 'Even boys sometimes cry' and this is one of the movies that doesn't take care of gender, manhood and everything that makes us men different from women. It will make any guy cry foreshure or at least will make your fellings and perspective of life change. Another good thing of this movie, besides the beautiful love story, is that it places the scene in times were social differences create huge abysses between human race. It did not matter if you're smart, good looking, creative or hard worker, if you came from a poor family, with little education, you had little change of living a love story with the person you'd consider, at least for that moment, THE ONE. For me this is the best love movie and my words express very little. Truly epic.",10,0,1,13 November 2011
The Flowers of War," Heartbracking experience
","I admit it took me 3 or 4 times to go watch this movie but I tell you it was worth every penny. I kind of misjudge it because I thought that a drama/thriller about the Japanese invasion over China together with a priest from USA would only show how good are the Americans and how can they save everyday. But it was definitely not like this. Although Bale looks to be the main actor I definitely think that Ni Ni ( Yu Mo ) - this Chinese new actress - on top judging her splendid performance. Regarding the story I think it is flawless and this movie can easily be considered an epic one. The colors of war, the drama of the innocent children, the sacrifice of the 'big sisters', the cruelty and the low honor of the Japanese soldiers are so intense that it keeps your heart beating as if you were running for an Olympic medal. There is no honor in war, what the Japanese did to the Chinese, in my opinion, it easily tops Hitler or Stalin's behavior towards Lewis people and Russians. Their goal was not only to conquer and to make the enemy capitulate but also to rape every single women soul regarding age and I think that should be one of the things that separate us from the animals; even some animals are smarter than that. On the other hand Bale is playing a perfect role of an undecided man. I mean he's definitely not the hero figure, he's not the 'Bruce Willis' kind of character or even Oscar Schindler ( remember the one who saved Jews from extermination with his factory ). He has to choose between what's better for him or what's better for some strangers and his decision together with Ni Ni's perfect play as an escort lady adds the perfect dose of romanticism in times of desperation and lack of self confidence. I rate this movie 9 out of then and I tell you that even if you are not a drama fan this will let a good mark in your head.",9,7,9,4 February 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," God but not as the original
","The only thing that made me go see this movie was to simply compare it with the Swedish version. OK, in term of special effects, camera angles, you know setup, this movie is way better but then if you compare the thriller in this one with the original version I think that this version is way under. I'm not saying, like I've seen here, that you should definitely see this one because of Daniel Craig's acting, or just give you the classic stereotype 'oldies but goldies' regarding the Swedish version. I'm just saying that if a movie is born in some culture, Nordic in this case, you should at least let go of the American felling when you rate it. For me even the Swedish accent makes it more mysterious and more thrilling than this one. But both are great and if you've seen it with Daniel Craig you should also try it with Michael Nyqvist.",6,4,7,4 February 2012
Into the Wild," Is this a lesson?
","The question is very simple. Is this movie a lesson for human kind? Do we need to stop thinking and move back to the stone age simply because we can? The answer is very simple. NO! Now the hole point in rating this movie is the way you look at it. As a drama/thriller or as a documentary/adventure. Because if you look at it as a documentary 5 stars is a huge mark. Do we need to teach our children that this is the way they should thing and approach life? Definitely no. On the other hand if you look at it as a drama, as a mere interpretation of a real story you'll find it likable. Not epic. Not the kind of movie that you will remember but still a good one. The plot is good, it has fluidity, the scenes don't jump back and forward like crazy and the leading actor is doing a great job showing his emotions like it ware for real. I personally locked at it as a documentary and that why my rating is low.",3,4,5,26 December 2012
