Casablanca," this is simply the most overrated movie in American history.
","This movie was not 'a masterpiece', it is actually a piece of something else.  It had a weak plot, atrocious acting and a pathetic ending.  Also, it was very annoying.  Only people swayed by the almighty popular opinion would claim they like this film.",1,40,133,23 May 2000
