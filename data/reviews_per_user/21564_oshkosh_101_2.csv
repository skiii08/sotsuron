The King's Speech," Fairly strong writing and acting, but...
","Alright, I'm probably going to receive an onslaught of thumbs downs for this review for simply not agreeing with the masses but oh well this is simply my opinion of the movie. Remember Paranormal Activity when it first came out? Maybe the hype wasn't as strong for this movie as Paranormal Activity but I feel like a similar situation is going to happen with this one. On Paranormal Activity's opening and many weeks after, the film had a ridiculously high IMDb rating in the 9's I believe. Fast forward a few years later and the rating of Paranormal Activity dropped significantly. A mere 6.6. Simply put, people will probably look back at this film and think 'Oh it really wasn't that good, really over-hyped.' I notice on the discussion boards people simply refuse the fact that not every single person had to like this film. These people go as far as labelling the people who didn't like it as much as them as 'trolls' or saying that 'you just don't get this movie'. I could just namedrop a bunch of avant-garde films and said I enjoy those but not this. What's the point in that though? Alright after I got that rant sorted out, I might as well talk about the actual movie.Well for what I did like about this film was pretty much mentioned by everyone else previously. The acting was quite strong with the Rush and Firth putting on convincing performances. You generally looked forward to when these two guys were in the same shot and seeing what they would have to say. However, I don't understand why people think Firth's role couldn't be played by anyone else. Sure he does do a good job but quite a few people make it out to be the role of a lifetime. He mostly has trouble with enunciation and his anger but I'm sure any seasoned actor could portray that quite well. On the other hand, there are many one liners that will surely amuse most people by both their wit and delivery. There are also quite a few good shots in this movie with one of my favourites being after Edward viciously insults Bertie. You then see a shaken a Bertie while his brother forgets about him and goes socialize. So this film sounds good so far? Well that's really all I can say about it. The film has fairly strong acting, writing, and a believable setting. However, there's much more to a perfect film than simply having those few characteristics down. The film's plot is okay and for the most part you're just simply waiting for the two leads to share the same shot. The plot doesn't feel that well thought out and comes across as clichéd at some parts (ie the reluctance of Bertie going to a therapist and him not believing it will work when it does, the typical joyful montage of Bertie doing exercises with the therapist, the part where they 'break up' and eventually come back together in the end, etc.) Not sure if what I said previously counts as spoilers since it is pretty clichéd but I'll check spoilers off anyway. There are also not simply many good themes in this film. After you see this, you just feel uplifted that this guy overcame his stutter for a short period of time. I don't think it'll have the impact like the way say a movie like Taxi Driver does where you feel changed by it. As well as being left sitting where you are and thinking about what you just saw for a long period of time. This is all coming from a person who had a lisp and was insulted much in the same way Bertie was, as well as having difficulties with public speaking. Even though I understand the character's position quite well and the difficulties he went through, I still don't think this was that good of a movie. Oh well, I guess people will be calling me a 'troll' now but we'll see how that holds up in a few years.",7,7,12,2 February 2011
Limitless," Unfocused and 2D Characters with Some Decent Parts
","Limitless seems to be limited on conveying its purpose to the audience. The film wanders around unsure of where to go, but ends up being nothing special. It certainly had potential with its concept but ends up being a typical rise and fall movie of a drug addict where he sort of rises again at the end. The film is mostly a watered down version of the film Pi with some drug thrown in so it wouldn't cross the line of plagiarism. I really don't know why De Niro was cast in this film as his role could have been played by virtually any other decent actor. Yeah I said it. De Niro barely adds anything to this movie. Obviously, the only reason De Niro was in this was to increase the film's revenue.There really isn't much to say about the plot except that it's basically what you would except and nothing extremely surprising happens. I admit I was consistently paying attention throughout the movie and wasn't ever truly bored. However, this film is just so... bland. The only point of it seems to make a few bucks. Not to mention, the characters also seem rather indistinct and 2D with no notable performances. Very little development. The film's pacing is also quite slow. Despite having a rather typical running length it seems to go 1.5x as much as it actually is. They also throw in some random balding guy who just tries to kill Eddie and his girlfriend just so you wouldn't fall off from the edge of your seat from falling asleep. There's really nothing memorable about this movie with the exception of the somewhat intense confrontation scene towards the end, with those stereotypical Russian guys. However, there's one flaw with that scene. You WOULD THINK with such an extremely expensive security system there would be an alarm of any sort but nope. Even with NZT, he forgot to check if it came with an alarm. Writers of this movie: take some NZT or at least proofread your scripts.There are some questionable visual effects that seem to be there just for the sake of having them. Initially, I thought the drug's effect was seeing in a sepia tone and a wide angle lens. But seriously, was it really necessary to add random words that appear around the room as he is typing? Also, there's this godawful zoom in that appears a few times in the movie gave me a headache. I guess they're trying to be creative but it doesn't really work. Maybe I'm being too nitpicky on the effects, but theses ones are borderline artsy-fartsy or wankery without any taste. The soundtrack is also nothing noteworthy. From what I've heard, it just seems like your typical electronic music that will fit the mood but is just there for the sake of it.If you have nothing to do on a Friday night and you feel like you must see a movie just for the sake of seeing a movie, then by all means go see this one. Otherwise, I think my time is better spent watching De Niro in his prime instead of him just jumping into any film he can. Click 'not helpful' on my review all you want, in a year or two the IMDb rating for this movie will plummet. The people who genuinely think this movie has a purpose besides mindless entertainment to it should pop some NZT in their mouth to be able to see why it isn't that good.",5,3,8,18 March 2011
