The Blair Witch Project," Good idea but didn't go anywhere
","I saw this movie long after it was released. I rented the video from the local library. I knew the bare outline of the movie, which is what you learn in the first 5 minutes. I thought this is a great idea, using a supposed documentary made by the actors as the basis for a movie. It occurred to me that there were all kinds of possibilities of using the camera to reflect the relationships between the actors - what was filmed, what was left out, who was doing the filming, etc. None of this was done. The 3 college students in the film had a collective vocabulary of about 100 words, every other one of which was an expletive. They had no historical or philosophic interest in their project. They apparently did no prior research and seemed to take the whole thing as some sort of a joke. It was apparent from the start of the movie that they were all going to die and I found myself not particularly caring. If I had been camping with this trio I would have been tempted to strangle them right from the beginning. God they were shallow and boring. Needless to say I did not find the film frightening, which was the whole point.",Null,0,1,24 October 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How to lose an audience in 5 minutes
","Here is the setup.  A shallow self-centered guy working for an ad agency makes a bet that he can get a woman fall in love with him in 10 days so that he win the contract for a diamond seller.An overeducated journalism major working for a woman's magazine will get the opportunity to do 'serious' articles if she succeeds in writing about her experience of doing the wrong things in dating causing her to lose a guy in 10 days.The big question of course is, who cares?  Maybe my Marxist tendencies got in the way but it would be difficult to find two people who I could care less about.It was raining out and I wanted to watch a video so I took a chance on it. Big mistake. Well I was curious to see how his wager would turn out. I suppose I should have known but I thought it might have gone the other way. Once that was determined I was suprised that the movie was still going on. You mean I am supposed to actually care about the relationship?  Sorry but no.",Null,0,2,2 April 2004
