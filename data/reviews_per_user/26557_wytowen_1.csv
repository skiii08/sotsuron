E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," excellent
","A super tear bomb...... What's more ,when those bicycles are flying,in front of the falling sun,no one else can not be touched!!!!!!!Actually,it's the 1st time for me to see the well-known E.T.. Many people told me about that E.T. was so exciting, so impressive,etc.Few days before, an idea suddenly occurred to me, why not try to see this classical film?At the beginning of the film,the image of the UFO was not so satisfied, which can not be compared with these newly made film. However,when the story is developing,I was deeply touched by such a strong feeling between our little boy and the E.T.....Also,the back music is another spark of this great film.Everybody loves this film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,1,4 January 2008
