Ford v Ferrari," The Perfect Lap
","FORD v FERRARI
RATING: 4.9/5Yeah, Ford v Ferrari is definitely my favorite movie of the year. It's been years since i felt like i was watching actual movie stars on the big screen. It was great to have that feeling in the theater again, thanks to Christian Bale and Matt Damon. Same goes for the supporting actors. There were no phoned in performances, everyone showed up to play, even the kid. Not to mention, the 2 1/2 hour run time just flies by, as the film jumps from situation to situation. The story is tight. No subplots, no fat to really trim. This movie knows exactly where it's going and the road it needs to take to get there. No detours, probably because it's based off the true story of when Ford beat the dominant Ferrari at the prestigious 24 hour Le Mans race back in 1966. The movie is actually called 'Le Mans '66' in some countries. It's considered the Super Bowl of racing, for many race enthusiasts.Anyways, the film takes place in the 60s but it feels very modern because they spend all their time either racing or working on cars, giving it almost a timeless quality. I was iffy on the musical score but after watching the movie twice, i noticed the score would get me anxious during the race scenes (4DX is the preferred way to watch this movie). My leg would start shaking and I'd get this feeling that i had to go fast. As someone that likes driving fast, that's pretty impressive, so the score definitely does a great job of immersing you in these races, and not overpowering the scenes. Cinematography is spot on. There's a moment where they're racing at night, in the rain, and it just made me super anxious. If you've ever driven in hard rain before, going 60 mph or more, you should be able to grasp the concept of how dangerous it is going over 150 mph, with other cars trying to pass you. This is a great looking movie.I'm really struggling to find negative things to say about this movie, so I'm going to address some of the negative things I've heard in reviews I've seen.
<ul><li>TOO MANY WHITE PEOPLE:</li></ul>Yes, the movie is filled with white men, and one white woman, so there's not a lot of diversity here, if that's what you're looking for. Remember, it's based off a true story that takes place in the 60s, 'Mad Men' era. Knocking a movie for trying to be accurate to reality is just not smart at all.
<ul><li>NO CHARACTER GROWTH:</li></ul>Someone said there was no real character growth in the movie. In the final race, a big thing happens for one of the characters, that practically took a lifetime of growth as a person for them to accomplish. It's even acknowledged by other characters in the movie. It's just nonsense to say there was no character development.
-????:
One reviewer was hoping to see the engine built from the ground up and was disappointed that's not what they got in the film. I mean, the story being told wasn't about the car being built from scratch. The Ford Racing program already existed before Ford ever decided to take on Ferrari. This was about Ken Miles and Carol Shelby being brought on board to do the impossible with what was already there at Ford. This reviewer wanted a different movie.
<ul><li>CLIMATE CHANGE:</li></ul>Yeah, that reviewer was full of it. LOLUltimately, even if someone is not into racing, i think the concepts in the movie are extremely accessible. There are so many themes going through this movie, you're bound to find one that you can get behind. The story of man and machine, creators v. big business, innovation against time, being the best versus being a team player, etc... there's a lot of commentary going on just beneath the surface. The movie is a great snapshot of the American Spirit. It takes place around the time America landed on the moon. Around the time when American exceptionalism was arguably at its height. The Ford GT40 is practically a representation of the American Spirit, America potential. The impossible made real. It's magic, and so is this movie.SIDE NOTE:
Ford decided to go back to Le Mans in 2016, for the 50th anniversary of the Ford GT40 win in 1966, and they won! Like i said, that car, that racing program, is simply magic.",10,1,2,25 November 2019
Hereditary," Uneasy
","HEREDITARY
RATING: 3.7/5They really need a sub category for these kind of so called 'horror' movies because this is the same thing that happened to 'mother!' Apparently, HEREDITARY was marketed as the 'scariest movie ever,' which it is not, by far. There is horror imagery and an uneasy feeling throughout a lot of the film, but there's never anything really scary, and I'm not just talking about the lack of a single jump scare. Guess you could just call this kind of movie 'Horror Lite,' where they're not really hitting you with jump scares but you're probably not gonna leave the theater feeling happy go lucky either... i guess if ghosts make you uncomfortable, you might find it scary, but that's on you, cause the film definitely ain't trying to make you jump out of your seat.The film is pretty long too, for the amount of story you're getting, it's over 2 hours. They could have tightened up some things and maybe picked up the pace a little. Apparently, the director left 30 scenes on the cutting room floor and the original cut was 3 hours long. 1 hour cut from the film, and a lot of it still felt like setup, setup, setup, so it could then lose its mind in the 3rd Act the same way 'mother!' did towards the end. The overall message of the film feels lost. If I had to guess, you could argue that the message is, you can't escape your family's history, even after they die, unless you're willing to completely let them go. Or something along those lines perhaps, but it doesn't feel earned, and that's the problem.On the positive side, the acting is pretty solid. The family does a pretty good job of portraying their grief and dysfunction. They do it so well in fact, that for a little while i forgot that i was technically watching a horror lite film. It's like they stepped into some depressing indie film for a bit, until they were forced to come back to the horror genre. That probably wouldn't have happened if the film was paced better. The music also does a good job of accentuating the uneasiness throughout.The more i think about the film the more it just doesn't hold up to scrutiny as a horror film, and i think that's what's hurting it the most. Hereditary falls under the horror genre but it doesn't feel like it's trying to scare you for the majority of the film, it just wants to make you feel uncomfortable, like really uncomfortable. If they were gonna cut an hour off the original cut, then it needed another two or three passes to work out all the kinks. I'm honestly curious how different the 3 hour cut is, but as it stands now, Hereditary is not a very scary movie despite the horror elements in it. Be warned though, despite it not being very scary, some of the imagery may stick with you because it is a well crafted movie. If you do decide to go see it, just know what you're getting into so you're not blindsided and disappointed by the lack of jump scares.",7,3,4,19 August 2019
Aquaman," At least it's pretty
","Aquaman
RATING: 3.2/5This movie has no business being 2 hours and 22 minutes long for being as dumb as it is. I really don't get how Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse can have more characters and tell a more cohesive story in less than 2 hours, and look way better doing it, while Aquaman trips all over itself. People try to excuse the stupidity of this movie by saying it embraces it's comic book goofiness, except that's a lie. The movie is a mess and it never fully commits to itself. Some characters play it super straight, but their dialogue is so bad that it comes off as generic, over the top, and just dumb.The movie gives you two villains, Ocean Master and Black Manta. The problem is that they're two of Aquaman's biggest villains and they could each hold their own movies as the main antagonist. Black Manta's intro is something that could have been very powerful and character building for both Aquaman and Black Manta, but the garbage dialogue deflates the entire scene. As the movie continues, Black Manta just fades into the background as Ocean Master takes center stage. However, it makes no sense because Black Manta gets the origin setup and Ocean Master doesn't. Mera and Aquaman have zero chemistry, so when they get this epic kiss, it's practically meaningless. And there's a lot of moments like that where something will be presented as a big deal, visually, but will have piss poor setup and thus have little to no meaning behind it. For example, they literally show you dinosaurs in the background of somewhere they go to, with no explanation whatsoever, and no reaction from the actors. It's just poorly thought out. This is Aquaman's first real venture into this world of Atlantis and the 7 Kingdoms, but you wouldn't know it by the way he acts. This whole movie is really about distraction. They hit you with something shiny and pretty to distract from the fact that the story doesn't add up, and the dialogue is downright stupid most of the time. Character development be damned. Jason Mamoa does his best, but there's only so much he can do with the charisma he has.As for the positive stuff, the special effects are fantastic. There's one underwater scene that looks really cool, mainly because Wan gets to go all horror movie director with it, and it works to great effect. And then the story starts happening again, and you remember how dumb everything is. Smh.
Atlantis looks gorgeous, better than Wakanda in Black Panther, that's for sure. However, you're not there long enough to get any sense of what Atlantis is, or the people, which Aquaman constantly repeats he has no allegiance to. In fact, they just have Mera beat you over the head with exposition which you can take or leave with her generic acting. The action scenes are solid, nothing super memorable but solid. The big fight between armies at the end is all but forgettable, just a big CGI mess. Not as bad as Wonder Woman's 3rd Act though, Aquaman's still looked gorgeous, but despite the stakes, you just don't really care because you know how everything's gonna turn out. There's no mystery or anything because of how generic and predictable it is.In the end, yeah it's a gorgeous film but it's story is borderline asinine and it's almost 2 and half hours long, which I will admit, you don't really feel because everything moves so fast. If the movie didn't look as good as it did, and move as fast as it does, this would be an average film, maybe even less. As is, the craftsmanship manages to drag it into above average territory, but just barely... note, this is nowhere near close to the Aquaman in the current comics, but you might have fun with this Aquaman movie, if you don't think about it too much.",6,2,5,25 August 2019
Deadpool 2," Still pretty good
","DEADPOOL 2
RATING: 3.8/5I think the thing about these Deadpool movies is that you can tell Ryan Reynolds really cares about the character, so you know that he's not gonna phone it in. Honestly, Deadpool feels like this generations 'The Mask.' Yes, he doesn't have all the crazy magic powers Jim Carrey had, but his inability to die gives him a Looney Tunes quality about him. He literally comes back from every fatal injury imaginable like if he's Wile E. Coyote, which lends itself to some interestingly funny scenes.I guess my main issues are the CG, and the action choreography. A lot of the CG is just bad, really bad. With all the money they made off the first movie, you'd think they would put in the money to have the CG look great, especially if they're gonna use so much of it compared to the first film. It took me out of the movie every time. A lot of the action feels a little on the generic side and not very creative unless it's played for laughs. It feels like a step back from the first Deadpool. Case in point, Dominos super power is luck, but it's portrayed like a Final Destination movie. The director must not have known that there's been 5 Final Destination films because the scenes here are pretty forgettable by comparison.Overall I'm left with this feeling of unfulfilled potential with this sequel. The pieces are there for something greater than the first one, and although it may be funnier, story wise it isn't really that great the way things play out. For all the Domino controversy about her being Black, she's really not that big a character, hardly gets any development, and left me feeling pretty 'meh' about her in the end. Cable is pretty great but he only gets bare bones development too. Every time he was on screen, i wanted to know more about him, and the future he came from, but they just never really deliver. The kid in the film is whatever, despite all the screen time they give him. Almost every character in the first movie gets relegated to the background this time around, and that just did not sit well with me cause i really liked the first one. Rather than building on the first film, it felt like they semi-scrapped it.In the end, it comes down to what you find funny and what you'll accept, on whether this sequel is going to be better for you or not. For me, the laughs weren't as good as the first one but that's just my personal taste, and i would never really ding it for that. It came down to the bad CG, uninspired action scenes, and lack of development for everyone else but Deadpool, that kept lowering it's score from 'great' and put it in 'pretty good' territory. The first Deadpool is a better crafted movie overall, but the sequel is still entertaining, despite all its flaws.",8,2,3,22 August 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," There was a Ragnarok?
","THOR: RAGNAROK
RATING: 3.7/5The first action scene, is something I'd been waiting to see for years now, Thor literally swinging his hammer around like a badass in fights. It was perfect, and felt right out of the comics. Loki is as Loki does, so not much to say there. Jeff Goldblum was Jeff Goldblum as the Grand Master, so take it or leave it. Valkyrie was good but she left something to be desired IMO. With the backstory they gave her, and how it tied into the overall story, it felt like a missed opportunity for that character.Seeing Doctor Strange's cameo was fantastic, i loved everything about it because you could see that he had gotten a lot better at using magic, compared to his own movie where he was struggling. Hulk was good and I wish we had gotten more information about him and how he's been, but alas it's not his movie. Visually the movie is fantastic, it's a Marvel Studios movie, so you know the production value is gonna be there. The score is pretty forgettable, as usual, but the trade off is that they use Led Zepplin's 'Immigrant song' from the trailers.I guess my main gripe would be that the movie has the word RAGNAROK, in the title, but it never feels like it. Everything is so lighthearted and jovial, that even when serious scenes happen, they don't resonate long, if at all. The film moves so fast, that it ends up becoming emotionally unbalanced. Any time the movie tries to be emotional, the scenes either fall flat or are undercut by a joke. Almost every time Anthony Hopkins was on screen, it got on my nerves because he felt so out of place visually with the rest of the movie, if he didn't wanna dress up, he shoulda just stayed home. If he wasn't so important to the story, I'd say the movie would have been better off without him. Cate Blanchet looks incredible as Hela, and she's a villain you really want to like, with kind of a tragic backstory, but she's almost completely wasted as a villain here. The revelations about her origins and the significance they hold for all of Asgard, are practically buried under a mountain of jokes and pretty visuals. It was a little frustrating to see so many great story pieces on the board, and then slowly realize that they were going to waste every single one of those opportunities.Ultimately, this movie had a lot of good to great ideas going on, that it chose not to use to their full potential. That being said, Thor honestly feels reinvigorated as a character here, and the movie feels like the start of a new beginning for the franchise. If any Marvel character deserves a 4th movie, I'd have to say, it probably should be Thor. In the end, THOR RAGNAROK is a fun and colorful, but pretty flawed, popcorn movie, that chose to be funny, instead of epic... still, i am definitely interested to see what the future holds for Thor. :D",7,0,3,10 September 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not really Spider-Man
","SPIDER-MAN HOMECOMINGRATING: 3.2/5
Okay, so i didn't hate Spider-Man Homecoming, contrary to popular belief, but i went into it with the mentality that all the MCU stuff is probably gonna be good, so I need to focus on the Spider-Man stuff alone. I'm sorry to say, but as a Spider-Man movie, Homecoming fails and it kinda fails hard.We all knew Michael Keaton was gonna show up to play, so he made for a great villain as The Vulture but everything else was a bust. Outside of Peter's best friend Ned, the high school kids were worthless, in fact the entire high school setting didn't even matter in the end. Marisa Tomei was nothing more than eye candy as Aunt May, totally worthless, the connection was so superficial, it was a joke. Peter's intelligence is dwarfed by the A.I. suit he wears telling him what he should do. That's not Spider-Man.Honestly, if you took out all the Marvel Studios stuff, Tony Stark, Happy, the Captain America PSAs, the Karen A.I. for the Spider suit, the Avengers, the movie cannot stand on its own as a Spider-Man universe movie. That's where Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies win in spades and even the Amazing Spider-Man movies to a degree.Yes, Tobey McGuire and Kristen Dunst may have been cast wrong in the Sam Raimi films, but everything else in that universe was perfect, even the extras. Those movies had real vision. The Amazing Spider-Man movies were worse but as far as the Spider-Man universe went, Sally Field as Aunt May, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey and Dane Dehann as Green Goblin, that universe was in pretty good hands outside a bad script and mediocre director.Homecoming didn't bring enough to the table to be a great or even good Spider-Man film, but because of all the Marvel Studios sugar coating, it passes, barely.",6,1,1,24 August 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Almost there
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri
RATING: 4.3/5The movie starts off at a good, steady pace, and then escalates little by little as it progresses. You're presented with this mother, who's daughter was raped and murdered, and the case has gone unsolved for months, so you think it's a murder mystery. As the movie goes on, you start to notice that you're following some pretty angry characters that don't know how to deal with the reality that has become of their lives. Yes, the murder is there in the background, but what you're really seeing is how this deep loss and anger affects the lead character and the people around her. Hell, she even drags some people down into her own anger as you watch them try to deal with situations in their own angry ways, and see how it ripples across the small town they're in. Once i realized that, the movie became pretty interesting to me, since their actions became more and more self destructive, and i wanted to see how far they'd take it.This is very much a character driven piece and there's a lot of great acting going around. I honestly can't think of a single bad performance. There are some black supporting characters in the background, but they're really only there to establish that the town is a little backwards with some racist undertones. There's no KKK and the movie isn't trying to preach to you about race, it's just trying to let you know more about the town itself. They're small scenes and pretty subtle for a movie like this, but i can see how someone might take offense at first by jumping to conclusions.I went into this movie cold and ended up leaving pleasantly surprised and a little disappointed at the way the whole thing ended. That's really the only negative thing i can say about it without nitpicking. The film ends on this ambiguous, typical indie style movie ending, and you just kinda feel cheated. You've been with these characters, seeing their anger and their actions grow and grow. You think it's all coming to a head, something that was looking to be a really satisfying ending. I was so onboard with what was about to go down and then the movie just ends. I was left sitting there thinking, 'Where the hell is my payoff???' That's probably the films biggest mistake that stops it from being a great movie, and leaves it in 'really good' territory. That being said, I think it's definitely worth a watch, for the great performances alone, if you get a chance.",8,1,3,22 August 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Way better than expected
","Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse
RATING: 4.4/5This movie puts the last 10 years of Disney animated features to absolute shame. It's crazy how overly stylized this movie is, it really just oozes creativity. The offbeat frame rate is a stylistic choice that really helps sell the fact that you're watching a comic book movie, and it doesn't take long to get used to it either IMO. I saw it in IMAX 3D and at first I thought there was something wrong with the film quality but it turns out it's actually all colored like a classic comic, dots and everything.The movie does move kinda fast but it does take the time to explain all the different Spider-Man characters you're seeing. Interestingly enough, it brings up how long each different Spider-Man character has been doing the superhero thing too. By doing that, you get to see the difference between a character who just got their powers and doesn't know how to use them, versus one who's been doing it for years, or decades, and is a veteran who's seen it all. It's a great contrast, with my favorite being the older, very jaded, Peter Parker that they show in the trailers. He's been around the block so many times that he knows villain plots by heart, so he's very nonchalant about everything. It's a pretty fresh, and funny, take on the character. The star here is Miles Morales, of course, and I have to say he's handled quite well, even his family.If I had to say anything negative about the film, it's that not every character gets used to their full potential. There came a point where I just noticed there were a lot of spider people fighting villains that hadn't really been fleshed out at all. The film could have probably used another 10 to 15 minutes just to doll out some basic characterization to some of the villains, and even some of the spider characters. The spiders all have their own personal issues, but the only one that really gets addressed is the older Peter Parker. Something even happens late in the film that is presented in such a way that it implies something significant just happened. However, the ground work is never properly laid for it to mean anything to the audience, so the moment just kind of awkwardly lingers.Outside those minor complaints, this is definitely a good, you could even argue great, movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen. There's a level of craftsmanship and creativity here that you just don't see in movies in general anymore. The film has a lot of heart, you can tell the creators really cared about what they were making here, and it wasn't just a cash grab. Be warned, you may get hit with some emotional moments in this film, even Stan Lee's cameo was sad, despite it being funny as well. The film has a very positive message about being good and doing good that I think the world needs to hear more of these days. Definitely one of the best films of the year.Oh yeah, and stay until after the credits. There's a pretty clever Spider-Man joke at the very end.",9,0,1,25 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Stressful
","A QUIET PLACE
RATING: 3.9/5Gotta admit, don't think I've been that stressed in a movie in a long time. It's a really slow burn though, as the film slowly builds up the tension. You're following a family that has been surviving in this world for almost a year and a half, so they're not gonna screw up unless something big and unexpected happens. Enter, the pregnant wife trying to give birth, that they've been showing in every trailer the studio has put out there, so it's not a spoiler. Once the movie gets to that point, it sticks with it to the bitter end. Things get intense, as the family just tries to survive this one childbirth. You really don't know where the movie's gonna go at that point, and that's one of the film's strengths. Every time i kept thinking it was over, damn thing would keep going. That monster was relentless, the smallest sounds would bring it over. It was a great movie monster, compared to everything we've had from Hollywood lately.For the majority of the movie, it's kind of a 'slice of life' film, as you're introduced to this family and how they live their day to day lives in this desolate world. It's great because you get a real sense of what it's like just living in this world, where making loud noises can get you killed, almost instantly. You start wondering if you could survive in that kinda world, it's actually done pretty well. The main issue for me is really with the family you're following; they end up being such ciphers, that they don't have any real depth to them. You get nothing more than surface level characteristics for each of them, which is fine to a degree, but they don't give you anything to really latch onto. The end result is that you end up feeling for the family and the terrifying situation they're in, but you don't really care that much for them individually.I can't quite jump this movie to a 4, because i think there needed to be some real character development in it. Even if the director meant for the family to be blank slates, there's just too much time where nothing happens, for them not to get any kind of real character development. The last issue might be a nitpick, but the final shot feels completely out of place with the entire film. This movie has such a serious tone to it the whole time, but the last shot comes off as something out of a corny action movie. It just doesn't fit, and I think it was the wrong note to end on. The entire movie sets you up to feel one way, and then the ending takes a slight left, but it's just enough to make you feel like something is off. They could have done the same scene and just played it serious, like the rest of the movie, and it would have been great. Even so, i think this is a movie worth checking out, even if you just do a matinee.",8,0,0,19 August 2019
Logan," Almost perfect
","LOGAN
RATING: 4.5/5Not gonna lie, i shed a tear at the end. 17 years of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, comes to a close in all its bloody glory. Same goes for Patrick Stewart as the iconic Professor Charles Xavier. There's times in this movie where it looked like a horror movie to me with all the slashing and blood being spilt, which is exactly what a Wolverine movie should always look like. Plus, after all these years I finally felt the rage come through the screen, and i really appreciated that. I noticed i was clenching my fists during all the fights, the blood really adds a whole new dynamic. Kinda sucks that it took the last movie to finally get it right. This really felt nothing like a superhero movie and it's all the better for it. Gonna have to pour one out for Logan.Damn, i need a hard drink after that. :'(",9,1,2,24 August 2019
Parasite," Unexpected
","PARASITE
RATING: 4.7/5Heard a lot about this movie, so i finally decided to check it out. The name implies a possible horror movie, hell, even the main poster feels horror-ish. In reality, it turns out to be a twisted dark comedy that comments on the disparities between rich and poor families, and even how the gap between them keeps widening.You're following this dirt poor family who struggles to just get by. However, there's no doubt that they all love and support each other. Miraculously, the son gets a job tutoring English for this rich family's daughter, despite not really having the qualifications. At this point, the son starts scheming up ways to get his family involved in taking advantage of this rich family, and hilarity ensues.The first half of the movie is a straight up comedy as this poor family takes advantage of the rich family, that clearly doesn't know any better. My theater was laughing up a storm, regardless of the subtitles. Reviewers, and the director, keep saying that a twist happens in the 2nd Half, which should be kept secret. However, i thought it was just par for the course, and was not surprised at all when the supposed twist happened. As you enter the 3rd Act, things start getting kinda serious and questions start being raised about who's in the right. You have a rich family that's out of touch with the world around them. On the other side, you have a poor family doing whatever it takes to survive. There's even a small discussion about how easy it is to be nice when you have tons of money.This movie has layers upon layers in what it says about the rich and the poor. Where Joker held up a mirror to society and said 'You are to blame for what happens,' Parasite presents the good and bad between the families and kind of asks the audience, 'Who's worse?' Yes, the rich family has it easy and seems to have it all together, but they fake almost everything about their life and are borderline disconnected from each other, and society, while even looking down on others, and not realizing it. The poor family is tight knit, but you start to wonder if they keep each other down because of how close they are. Even when the idea is presented that the brightest family member could easily transition into the rich lifestyle, the movie makes you ask if they should, as that world has a tendency to chew people up and spit them out. There's even a moment where someone in the poor family tries to make an emotional connection with the rich family, after going through a traumatic life changing experience, only to be reminded that they're nothing more than a lowly employee.Honestly, this movie is great. It can be interpreted in so many different ways, and you wouldn't really be wrong, no matter what you took from the movie. This is a high recommend from me. If you hate subtitles, suck it up because this is a movie that's definitely worth watching.",9,2,6,28 October 2019
Wonder Woman," Tripped at the finish line
","WONDER WOMAN
RATING: 3.4/5Well i have to say, Gal Gadot really owned the role of Wonder Woman. She did a great job and i think the character is totally safe in her capable hands. This movie had a really solid, arguably great, start. Finding out about the Amazons and their warrior origins, was super interesting to me. The 2nd Act, shifting over to the World War 1 stuff, was pretty good and i actually wish they did more with that, but somewhere along the way, you could just feel the suits in Hollywood get involved. The 3rd Act literally devolved into nothing but excessively bad CGI and explosions. It was kind of sad to see because the movie was on its way to being great before getting totally derailed.The quiet moments in this movie, where the characters were allowed to just breathe and be themselves, is where this movie shined IMO. Chris Pine did a solid job as Steve Trevor, definitely well cast, you could feel both characters struggle trying to work with and understand each other, coming from different worlds. The villains weren't built up very well, and that normally wouldn't be that big a deal, except the way they were used at the end, meant that they needed to be fleshed out more for it to really resonate with the audience the way it was supposed to.The movie is by no means bad, it's just painfully okay, you could even argue good and that would be totally fine, but the fact that it was headed toward being great, is what's really getting under my skin here. I feel like this movie was just outright robbed of how great it could have been, and that's a crying shame... guess i can find solace in owning the animated Wonder Woman blu ray, that one's pretty great ^_^",7,1,4,1 September 2019
Incredibles 2," Elastigirl: The Movie
","INCREDIBLES 2
RATING: 3.2/5Honestly, this should have been called 'ELASTIGIRL: THE MOVIE' because she's really the main star. The rest of the Incredibles family takes a back seat to her, so much so that you barely even get to see the family suit up, much less work together as a real team. Dash suffers the most out of the family in that regard. If you're looking for character development, it's not really here outside Mr. Incredible learning how to be a stay at home dad, and even that's questionable. Frozone gets more screen time, so he's not just the token Black guy this time around. The villain is pretty meh by the end of it, and if you give their evil plan more than a passing thought, it ends up being pretty dumb and pointless overall.This film is basically a time capsule, being that it takes place pretty much right after the first Incredibles movie. After 14 years, 3 Presidents, and 10 years of Marvel Studios superhero movies, Incredibles 2 needed to be way more than just a run of the mil sequel. This may have worked when they were at the top of the superhero mountain in 2004, but they've been lapped by so many other superhero movies now that this really doesn't cut it in 2018. Add to that the fact that they're still on the whole superheroes being illegal thing, which Captain America Civil War covered much, much better, and Incredibles 2 just ends up feeling outdated.The score is pretty fantastic though. It's loud, it's bombastic, very 60s James Bond but with a superhero flair to it. The voice acting is solid with Mr. Incredible being the MVP with all the range of emotions he has to go through. The animation is great, no surprise there from Pixar. The action is pretty fast paced and serviceable, but for some reason, i just wasn't impressed by it. I really don't know how many other ways Hollywood can shoot a runaway train scene. It also didn't help that the first fight just reminded me how much of a Fantastic Four ripoff The Incredibles are too. I chuckled twice during the whole film, but my theater laughed a lot, so the jokes were clearly working on some level.One of the other issues is that there are really no clear positive male figures in the film. Mr. Incredible is relegated to a stay at home dad, and he can't even figure that out on his own. Mrs. Incredible though, she can apparently do it all. In fact, almost every female in this film is infallible, while almost every male has some character flaw or has messed something up somehow. It's really weird. Like, the movie props up the women at the expense of the men, which i think sends a bad message.If you're looking for a few laughs, action, and to go back to 2004, you'll probably have a great time with Incredibles 2. If you're looking for a good story, good villain, balanced positive male and female figures, and a superhero team that actually practices teamwork, then you should probably look elsewhere. Outside the animation, music and jokes, the movie fails on almost every other front and that's just unacceptable after 14 years. Beware the hype with this movie, cause it simply does not live up to the first Incredibles, at least not for me, not by a long shot.",6,5,7,21 August 2019
