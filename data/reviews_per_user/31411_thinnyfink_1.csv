Marie Antoinette," So Much Wasted Potential
","The only reason I even decided to watch this movie was because Marie Antoinette and her story was so interesting to me. I thought for sure that it would be a great movie.Well thanks Sophia Coopla, you just ruined the whole story for me.So much more dialog and plot could have been added to this incredibly boring movie. I could not even understand what was even going on half the time, and the plot wasn't even completely relevant or correct to Marie Antoinette's life.I should have slipped into another movie when I saw that the theater was almost completely empty besides me and my friends. I really was so close to watching Borat instead.And everyone keeps saying that the movie would really 'connect' with teens. Well, I don't know anyone at my school who liked it, and it was taken out of the theater right after I watched it. Congratultions.I admit, the sets were really beautiful and the costumes were so elaborate. The music was pretty great too(That's why I rated this movie a 2). But I'm sorry, the missing plot line to Kirstin Dunst's fake crying(maybe laughing?) makes me hate this movie.And they didn't even behead Marie or anything. Don't waste your money or your time.",Null,2,3,8 November 2006
