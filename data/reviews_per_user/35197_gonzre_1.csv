Hereditary," Terrible
","Terrible is the only word that comes to mind when thinking about Hereditary. Hereditary is painfully slow; we kept thinking it would eventually get better, but it never did. Little time is given to explaining certain important aspects of the story and there are gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity which do not push the story along or lend to any discovery. Quite possibly the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time. I'm still angry I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this mess.",1,33,70,12 June 2018
