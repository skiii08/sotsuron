First Man," Terrible
","Terrible sound (mumbling). CGI is even more fake than the fake moon landings. Seen better and more convincing acting in Sesame street. As boring as an episode of some fake 'reality-tv' show and totally overhyped.
Total waste of 2+ hours. Completely ruined by PC.

First Man," Disgraceful
",As the review is otherwise too short I'm gonna keep it short... This is a ridiculous load of disgraceful crap! Nuff said...,1,5,9,16 February 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Total disappointment
","How to throw all storylines on one big heap, put them through a blender and see what's left.
What is the point of this movie? Find out which characters are worth saving for the next installment?
What a waste.",3,3,7,13 October 2018
