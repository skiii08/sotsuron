The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The BEST so far in the Twilight Movie Series!
","Yes! 10 out 10 because I SO love everything about this movie. I'm not sure why the overall rating here in IMDb is so low but for all Twilight fanatics like me, this is so far the best flick in the Twilight Movie Series.All the ignorant critics can say what ever crap they want to throw, but they can't take away how Twilight has been absorbed and has been interpreted by its millions of fans worldwide.This is not just about a teenager wanting to marry the guy she wants but this is all about the colliding of two different worlds - that of a HUMAN and that of a VAMPIRE (plus there's a werewolf too).Twilight is a very entertaining story that doesn't only appeal to teenagers but to middle-aged people as well. Twilight is like a porn, an obsession, a fantasy that is overwhelming - the very reason why there are a lots of people who go GAGA over it.Breaking Dawn is the last book of the Twilight Series and it sure has all the elements that make all the characters more lovable - so adorable.For all Twilight fans out there who haven't watched Breaking Dawn Part 1 yet, then you SHOULD watch it. Can't wait for part 2. (;",10,1,8,18 February 2012
American Beauty," A Family Drama that is BIT weird
","First, I watch this movie because it has a very high rating. I thought that this must really be sooo good because of the 8 plus rating. I was a bit confused with the very first scene but got it eventually after watching for several minutes.This movie has no spectacular scenes and while watching the half naked teenagers, I felt like I was watching a semi-porn movie.I really don't understand the need to show tits and sort f molest the teen actors. Also, the father fantasizing her daughter's friend is sooo GROSS. I hate the 'grossness' of this sort-of 'fee-good' movie.I'm also disappointed of the ending. What a pointless death.",5,1,3,11 December 2011
