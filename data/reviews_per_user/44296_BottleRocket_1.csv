Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's better than 'Jedi', but needs Episodes II and III
","The theater is roaring.  'One minute left!' a fan screams.  Sixty seconds later a packed house is warped into outer space for the first showing of Episode One.  I came into this with fairly high expectations, despite the 'expert' reviews I had read.  My guideline -- I'd only be happy if this were better than Return of The Jedi, what I feel was the weak link in an awesome trilogy (but still a great film).  Rest assured, Phantom Menace does entertain, but it is going to need the rest of the trilogy to be appreciated.  If 'Empire' and 'Jedi' were never made, Star Wars would still be a landmark film, but Menace relies heavily on the big picture.  It serves as an appetizer for the main course to come.  Do I recommend it? YES!! Don't be surprised though, if you come out of the theater asking friends 'When does Episode II come out again??'",6,1,2,19 May 1999
