The Blair Witch Project," Different does not mean excellent
","It's pathetic that so many viewed this film as excellent just because it wasn't 'Hollywood' or was shot by a jerky hand-cam (which gave me motion sickness).  This was one of the worst films I've ever seen, and not scary in the least.  The 'dialogue' (if one can call it that) was gratuitously foul-mouthed and the acting lame.  I suggest a title change to 'Dude, Where's My F*cking Car?'",1,17,33,8 April 2001
