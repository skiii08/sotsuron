It," No!
","I make this one short: it's the first time I use this phrase but seriously, if I could give minus-stars, I would in this case! What was that? It has nothing, and I mean NO THING to do with the book and even less with the wonderful original movie of the 90s.
Actors - bad and unconvincing, locations - bad, violence - grotesque, graphic level, clown - ridiculous! nothing of the really scary Tim Curry clown who worked with expression, voice, psychological fear, no, here we have ever screaming kids, (and not for a second did I believe these were kids of the 80s, I am an 80s kids, and it was all just off, the haircuts were just not really like they were etc. and these kids had a way of talking, no one used back in the 80s), oh, and a totally overanimated clown-thing. Storyline - none, plotholes - lots! I could go on for ages, I just can say I have not seen such total tosh in years, an insult to any viewer with half a braincell left.",1,1,2,6 May 2020
Romeo + Juliet," difficult to rate
","Oh well, this one is difficult for me to rate. On the one hand I have a fanatastic memory of this movie, of 1996, me being 18, sitting in the late night smoker cinema (yes, something like that existed back in the 90s, a cinema where the audience could smoke while watching the movie - unimaginable today ;)) with a friend and through all the smoke we watched the really intense pictures this movie offers, the darkness, the many candles, paired with the classic and wonderful poetry of Shakespeare. Then and now I was impressed by DiCaprio and Danes, both gave such a believable and intense show of the doomed romance. And yes, in that last scene in the church it is hard not to cry.Back then, being 18, I was totally impressed and amazed by the movie, coming with the described cinema setting and the fact I was just 18.
Now, almost 25 years later, I watched the movie again last night. Weirdly enogh I got kind of annoyed now by the fact that the wonderful Shakepeare language is a bit, well, stained by the fact it is spoken in slurry American English. I have meanwhile seen English Shakepspeare plays with British native actors, and I guess that's the reason it just bothers me now in the movie as it kind of cheapens the beautiful language and at several times the pronounciation is so bad that it's hard to comprehend.Another thing is, that these over the top party scenes with all that screaming or the screaming and shooting scenes annoyed me now too. I fast forwarded here and there as the pronounciation was so bad and it was all screaming so it didn't matter anyways.
What still really makes the movie worthwile is the scenes with DiCaprio and Danes, they are so lovely and intenses, they alone make it worthwile and still worth seven stars.",7,1,1,20 February 2020
How to Train Your Dragon 2," not as good
","I absolutely love the first part of the series, I don't know how many times I've watched it and I cry every single time. After years now I bought the second part and watched it and hmmm... emotionally nothing happened. The only thing still super touching is Toothless, who is quite in the backround in this movie. But for the rest, well, it just get's too unreal. It of course had a touch of unreal when in the first part Hiccup's father understood his son in the end, said sorry and changed his behaviour. (in real life that is something that probably doesn't happen ever, but we all wish it did)
But in the second part now, they just overdid it for me. Hiccup meeting his lost for twenty years mother, who is of course the wise dragon lady. Both are not awkward but HIccup just makes flapsy jokes and the mother is all wise and in no time they smile at each other and everything is fine. Next, HIccup's dad finds out his wife is still alive. And after these two people parted in anger twenty years ago, they just kiss and then dance and again - everything is fine?And apart from that I couldn't help myself but getting annoyed of Hiccup with his behaviour. His father tells him, and rightly so, that there indeed are people who are evil and won't change their views and ways. He underlines this with telling him a story, that Mr. Bloodfist caused a whole hall of vikings to die in fire, and Hiccup still doesn't care and goes onto this mission to just talk the evil master out of his evilness? In in doing so, he endangers his loved ones, Toothless several times and with his behaviour, he actually causes the death of his own father, who tried to warn him. What is the message of this movie supposed to be? Just talk to psychopathic terrorists like Bloodfist and they will understand and from then on be nice people? Sorry, but that was just too much, and instead of touching me that movie annoyed me mostly.Also the actually wonderful soundtrack themes of the first part go totally under in the second movie due to too much action sequences for the sake of it.I understand that they want to have a positive message in these movies, and in the first part they did it so perfectly. But in the second part they just overdid it and made the shown emotions between people seem totally unreal and kind of forced.
I still have to watch the third part and really hope they get back on track with it.",6,0,0,3 April 2020
The Shape of Water," Me and Guillermo del Toro - won't happen
","After having seen 'Pan's Labyinth' many years ago and really disliking it firstly for its awfully detailed violence scenes and the general mood in the movie which was just not nicely melancholic but somehow off for me, I now watched 'the shape of water' and well, what can I say? Same thing again.B. del Torro seems to have a fascination with sadistic, brutal male characters, in the Pan movie it was the stepfater of the girl, here it is exactly the same character with just a different name, here now torturing the aquatic man. Also, although again the movie was somehoe beautifully equipped with old-fashioned furniture and a kind of nice 50s/60s vibe, it again had this unpleasant nightmare-like vibe to it I already disliked in the other movie.I watched the whole movie and I must sadly say it left me completely cold concerning all the characters, it just didn't get through to me at all. And no, I'm no generally not into these kind of fantasy movies, I was one of the few who really likes 'Lady in the water' which had me crying. So it really is just this particuar del Torro-vibe that puts me off completely.I would have still given the movie four stars but what botherd the heck out of me was the del Torro had quite the cheek to just badly copy from 'Amelie' - (a wonderful movie I still cherrish after almost 20 years!). A mute main charater, almost the same haircut, the little detail stuff she does and he even used French music instead of English music? I had watched the first five minutes of the movie and already thought, common, that's from Amelie?So, sorry, me and Benicio, it really just won't happen. I find his movies unpleasant, kind of nighthmarishly vibed, and for my taste he even steals from other great movies. I don't like it, I will never like it.",2,8,11,6 May 2020
