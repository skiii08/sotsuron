United 93," Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made
","United 93 succeeds at creating, what Greengrass called, a 'believable truth.' The power of this motion picture, using the improvisation of professional and non-professional actors and a documentary look, is in its drawing directly from the 9/11 Commission Report (cell calls, ATC data, NORAD data, eyewitness testimony) adding only a speculation on whether or not 93's passengers breached the cockpit door. As Greengrass points out in his commentary, the commission report said they were 'seconds away.' You are never anywhere but where the filmmaker wants you to be: on board the aircraft, in the various ATC centers, with the hijackers. It is impossible not to feel the fear and the rage of the passengers and ultimately impossible to escape remembering our own sadness and emptiness and resolve.",10,1,3,17 October 2006
