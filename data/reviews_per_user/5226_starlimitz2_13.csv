The Avengers," What happens when you love and respect your movie
","Very few times are my high expectations over-come by even GREATER PAYOFFS but Avengers definitely did that for me. I, for one, think that it had a lot of action scenes (and a few of them took a really long time) but then again it was a really long movie, so it also had plenty of time to develop plot and characters. Thankfully it allowed the movies to do a lot of the backgrounds for the characters, otherwise we would have been in for an extremely long ride.The Hulk was the standout character for me. Out of all of the superheroes in this movie he was by far my favorite (and has been my favorite for a very long time). Joss Whedon seriously knew how to make this movie into a Fanatic's wet dream and he held plenty of tension and plenty of drama in all the right places along with the kick ass action sequences. Though I would have liked Ed Norton to be the Hulk in this movie, the actor they picked for a stand-in was right on the money for a GREAT Bruce Banner. He was mild-mannered, smart, and cool-headed (well, you know what I mean). And the greatest parts were his action sequences, BY FAR! I loved just about everything in this movie, ESPECIALLY the cliffhanger at the end. STAY AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF END CREDITS! If you're a real marvel fan you'll go YEEEEEAH! Like I did in the theater. This one is definitely for the Marvel DVD collection!",10,1,3,13 May 2014
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Go watch it, Webheads!
","Finally! The movie that Spider-man truly deserves. While other Spider-man movies have plenty of merit (and others don't), Homecoming is by far the greatest rendition of Spider-man movies ever created for the silver screen! It had everything that encompasses Spider-man, but in smaller doses so that they are easier to digest and enjoy. The inside jokes came at a great pace, and the comedy traveled far and wide for all kinds of humor. Even the darker humor was not too dark, and still suited Spider-man to a T. Tom Holland was great with his reactions to the humor going on around him, while also giving off his own jokes the way a spider can. His friend, Ned was not over done, he was given, once again, in small doses, and never got annoying, which is really hard for a comic relief character. The only thing I think they could have really done without was Flash. While Flash Thompson was good for a few laughs, he just didn't contribute a whole lot to the overall quality of the film itself. That, however, is the tiniest of nitpicks, and does not at all affect its score.It gets triumphant echoes of joy with the action scenes. They are fast pace, high octane, and show that Spider-man has a lot to learn before he reaches his prime. You truly feel like this is how Spider- man would act were he put into these situations. He gets his butt kicked as much as he kicks tail himself, but that's more from his inexperience, and again, it is not shoved into your face, it is delivered in a moderate quantity for maximum efficiency. Characters have their roles, and all of them play them off to their utmost and pull their own weight. The character Michelle is a quiet giant in her field of comedy, and is one of the funniest characters in her own rite. Michael Keaton as the Vulture is fantastic! He is not really evil, he has his own motivations, they just happen to be outside of the law. Peter's crush, Liz, plays a far bigger role than expected, but a necessary one in the long run. The moment we are introduced to her, I figured she may be the thorn in the movie's side, but, once again, small doses prevail.The story is rather small potatoes in the spectrum of the M.C.U., but that is perfect for a beginner super hero movie, which is where Suicide Squad's biggest failure can be observed. Homecoming stays within its bounds, and is as big as it needs to be for when it needs it the most. Flaws in this movie are hard to find, beyond nitpicking it to death (which some will, it's inevitable). It is more than welcome in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is a must-own for hardcore fans and casual fans of Spider-man (and Marvel) alike. Do not miss this movie, it is well worth the full price of admission, even if it is the 3-D price! Yes! It is that good! Now stop reading this review and go watch it, Web heads!!!",10,160,283,9 July 2017
Underworld Awakening," Get your Riff on!
","I don't know who had the wet dream of having yet another attempt at an already failing series of movies. There was a whole lot of muscle, but the mind was straight down the toilet. The plot points, the acting, the sequencing, and the overall script was a disgusting mess of plot holes and underplayed blocking. How can they so badly under-use what star power they actually had? While I will admit, there were action sequences that kept my interest, but then there was the fact that they dulled down the werewolves to diseased-ridden, giant sewage rats. Then there was the little girl that they had to save. It was bad enough that she couldn't act to save her life, but it really didn't help that her cgi/makeup job for her hybrid form looked like a monkey-symbol doll painted blue. I'd like to go into more, (Micael Corvin's obvious off-set performance which he taped for another sequel, or even a huge cast of overall useless characters) but if I did, then I'd just turn this into an all-around rant. I don't want to do that. So I would also like to say that if you want to watch an actual bad movie that's easy to sit through and make fun of, then this is definitely your movie. It really wasn't so terribly repulsive as to turn off in the first ten minutes, especially if you have friends over. So in that case, I recommend this movie. But if you want an awesome action/horror movie, just watch the first Underworld.",2,0,3,13 May 2014
Man of Steel," Finally, they got it right!
","First off, this is the best Superman movie that they have made in, literally, decades. It set a great tone, murky and dark in all the right places, while also offering a good sense of comedy, at least in the first half. While it could easily be argued that the movie's run time was far too long, it still used what time it took wisely in both back story and character development. That is to say, when it's not blowing up everything in sight along the way. The action sequences were very well put together, though some of them could have used some toning down. Overall, it brought a new light of hope for the Superman franchise that Superman Returns missed, and could help rebuild the damage that Lester did back in the 70's with his cinematic atrocities. The characters were very well kept with their roles (with Fishburne making a surprising appearance) and I cannot wait for a sequel to show itself in the next three years. Definitely a proud addition to the DC film collection.",9,6,10,13 May 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," Gamer Warning: Mind could be Blown
","A delightful film of cgi bliss! Wreck-it Ralph has some of the most dazzling displays of bright colors as well as dark, sinister gloom that creates a wonderful spectrum of eye-candy for the whole family. I do mean the whole family, too. Not only does it have many clear nods to current games on the market, but it also has some of the retro cameos that many adults will be able to relate to. The characters are very three-dimensional (in several ways) and the setting is clever, even creative in their design. You find yourself choosing your favorite characters on the spot, and even caring for them even before you get to know them better.Though the creators did miss a golden opportunity, while the story line is enticing, they could have had Ralph visit many other video game worlds, even if they weren't real games, it would have been more fun to see his reaction to some other types of games. Still, it was clear that those sorts of things may have interfered with the broad spectrum of the film itself. This movie has several potentials for gigantic sequels, and I'm even curious enough to actually play the video game itself, even though I haven't confirmed that they made one, I think it's obvious. This is a movie to catch in the theaters, as fast as your legs can carry you.",10,2,3,13 May 2014
Frozen," The new Disney Crowd Pleaser
","Frozen has a good amount of child-like mystique, and mythology of its own, and it uses it quite well throughout the film. The characters are, indeed, something to behold. Though they do delve into their own type of humor a tad often, it doesn't distract from the light-hearted drama that makes it an interesting film. Then there is another distraction that does get a little heavy after a while, and that's the start of the songs. They have songs very often throughout the films, and the beginning of them just seem out of place and forced into the scene. Though they are rather catchy and decent songs, they really could have done without them. A lot of the antagonists could have used a little more characterization, seeming to just shout 'I AM A VILLAIN' when you first see them, although there is the cloak and dagger effect that I rather liked. All in all, it was a solid film, just not one of Disney's better animated movies. Definitely a good family sit-down.",8,4,7,13 May 2014
Brave," Beautiful
","A very different type of Disney film. They did a brilliant job with such a small scale plot, and the comedic element. The greatest thing about this flick, however, is the characters, especially that of our main protagonist, Merida. They were not just one-note characters, they were given personalities and realistic qualities that define human beings. You find yourself caring for each of them throughout the movie, and this is thanks to the voice actors. Their voices brought life to this production in a way that did not seem at all forced or dull. The problem lies more with the scenes where Merida changed the Queen and tried to make up for it. These scenes have their moments, but for some reason, they seem to drag, and you find yourself guessing what's going to happen much of the time. The story picks up more often than not, but it does tend to go off the beaten path in a way that can distract, but not in a real positive light.Still, overall, the movie does not disappoint. It is not a masterpiece, but it is definitely not one that you should pass up. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, and the images are so easy on the eyes that you'll find yourself staring at the background from time to time.",8,1,3,14 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Whelmed!
","I was very pleased with how whelmed I was when I saw this movie. I had very high expectations for it, and it delivered on all fronts. I honestly did not expect there to be so much comedy involved throughout the whole thing, but they went that route and it definitely paid off. Although, I will admit there was a bit of clumsy dialogue when it came to introducing the characters. As I expected, the movie picked up and we got to the real meat of the film. Out of all of them, of course, the one who stood out was Rocket Raccoon. He was meant to be the cool character that everyone loved, and he played the part very well. Even Batista, a wrestler in his first major motion picture, played off a very good Drax. I say that not knowing how Drax was depicted in the comics, but I could just tell, he did very well.Then there came our dancing hero, Chris Pratt, who is very quickly becoming a household name. I love Parks and Recreation, and I love the Lego movie, and I am proud to say that I would trade both of those for his part in this. This has to be the best we have seen him yet (especially since he so obviously bulked up for the role.) As the movie so eloquently hinted at, we will be seeing a sequel, so I say bring it on! If it was made with the intent of a sequel, I can't see a reason it would fail so have at it! I'll just sit here and wait.",10,1,5,1 August 2014
Dark Shadows," What did I just watch?
","A movie that lacked so much direction that the original plot doesn't enter into until the last 2 minutes of the film. Tim Burton apparently had ideas for about seven other movies that wouldn't work on their own. He crams all of those ideas into this one movie, where they don't work anyway. In this film, once there is a plot point of any kind, it is either not discussed for 1/3rd of the movie, or it is immediately resolved that very scene, then we move on to yet another one. This movie has absolutely no focus what-so-ever. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, horror, drama, or romance, so it decides to be one of those every other scene and it is just exhausting. The Bella Heathcote is in the film for a total of five scenes of the movie, and she is in the first few scenes of the movie as the main focal point. Johnny Depp is the focal point for the majority of the film, and decides that he loves her for no other reason than meeting her once, and walking with her on the beach once. This movie has no build up on any front, and decides to hit it out of the park without even battering up. Dark Shadows has no audience. It's one thing to reach a demographic, but be good enough for others, but it's another thing to reach absolutely no audience at all because of how vague the plot is, and how childish/adult oriented the movie turns out to be. There are some genuinely funny moments, and the movie has shown promise more than once through out, but these moments of glee are interrupted by large portions of sporadic jumps across the screen. There are times when we truly feel for Johnny Depp's character, and his overacting is actually humanizing to a degree of someone who was a fish out of water or a man out of his own time. Yet he still murders innocent people and handles his problems so blatantly bad that the sympathy for him is limited down to nearly nothing. It's a mystery of how Tim Burton wanted to play this film out in the first place. He obviously had some good ideas, but every single idea that is brought to the screen is soon wiped off in order for another to take its place. Then there comes the third act, where we are treated to the most uncalled-for horror-fest money can buy. Remember when I said there was no build up to this movie? The third act was the prime example. All of the sudden we are shown things that had absolutely no build up to it anywhere throughout the film. They are just brought to the screen and we are supposed to accept them, and after being beaten with so many random plot points, you feel like you've ran a marathon, and the movie ends with very little to recollect.This film is not worth the time nor the effort to attempt to watch. It paints an obvious picture of how hard times have fell on a formerly great director, and why it may be time for him to hang up his director's chair for good. Do not give this film the time of day unless you are just such a die-hard Johnny Depp fan that you want to see everything of his in the first place. Either way, you have been warned.",3,2,4,1 September 2015
The Conjuring," The Horror Genre has a new Come Back!
","My rating should give a good picture of how I felt about the movie as a whole. I must admit, I have not been that sincerely freaked out in a very, very long time. There was an absolutely amazing atmosphere throughout, and instead of the simple, childish jump-scares that we have been so accustomed to over the past decade. The characters are very likable, for the most part, and it even tends to work a bit of humor here and there to relieve the tension every once in a while. Then it draws you right back into a world of mystery and mischief. It would be bad to give away too much of the film. If you are looking for something to scare you inside and out, get this movie immediately, close out all of the light, and grab your teddy bear.",10,1,1,13 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Wake up!!!
","The force truly has awakened! Any one who is even a casual fan of Star Wars will tell you that this movie is the very essence of what Star Wars stands for in all of its wondrous glory. The cast was very well selected, it's very clear that they selected the right people to populate the new generation of the universe, and that J.J. Abrams is, indeed, the man for the job. It really comes as no surprise that Abrams was able to do the series justice, but it was indeed refreshing to see to what extent. The scenery was so amazing, and the new planets, while the terrain was not exactly original, Jakku was kind of a clone to Tatooine, but the village was vastly different to that of anything from the originals, or the prequels. If the fans will be very honest with themselves, these planets were refreshing in a very, very grim way. Then there's the story, while it was not entirely original, it did bring about the necessary setting and development to help us along with our new characters and their full introductions, as well as a deeper look into their psyches. Not to mention a revisit from our main cast in the originals. Though it may seem a little forced (no pun intended), it did not hinder the story in any way, in fact much of it was very much needed.The film itself was gripping in every positive manner, and there were even some genuinely hysterical moments! It didn't need to dumb it down for children, as there is proof that even some of the younger kids liked, even loved this movie, and there were sounds of begging for their mothers to bring them back to see it again. Take that Jar Jar, you old HACK! Now, let's get down to brass tax, was it good? Yes. Was it great? YES! Was it as good as the first one? Well, break my skull if you want, but YES YES YES it was actually just as good as the first trilogy, and that is coming from someone who grew up with the original trilogy on VHS. It was amazing. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to see it in theaters, and own it on Blu-Ray, and we much NOT let that chance get away from us. So what are you doing still reading this review? GO SEE IT!!!!",10,21,57,21 December 2015
The Purge," Potential Waste
","A very mediocre movie all around. It has a mediocre plot, mediocre characters, mediocre creepiness, and mediocre acting. It's just all around very, very bland. The surprises are so predictable, you can literally call when someone will jump out and shoot or stab someone.The idea around the movie had such potential, it's such a shame they didn't do more with it. They decided that a hide-and-seek movie was more preferable, one that turns into nothing but a mindless bloodbath. There was such hype over this movie, and there was a lot of real excitement surrounding it, thinking that it would be a great premise for a lot of really cool scenes, but they decided to stick with Hollywood crap. That's not to say that it was totally awful. There were parts that were enjoyable. The guy who kept talking at the door to the family was pretty creepy, and he didn't over-do it. Even without the mask on, he was quite convincing as a psychopath. There were a few tiny gems like that in this movie, but none of them came close to saving this movie. Overall, it was a gigantic bore.",4,0,0,13 May 2014
Godzilla," The Monster is Attacking the City!
","A fun ride through and through. A clear improvement on the American franchise of Godzilla. The plot is very well outlined with not only our giant lizard friend, but also tell the story of a Naval Bomb Disposer, and his journey to get back to his family. The acting, while not the greatest ever seen, was well portrayed.It was quite the wait through the first thirty minutes of the movie. It was very well worth the wait. The suspense is built up until the bursting point, and it was paid off with a show that could only be described as devastating in a wonderful way. Godzilla is a commanding presence as he should be. This time, they got his character design correct, as well as his character as a whole. While their sequencing can lack here and there, the movie does very well in its payoff. The human tale is very gripping entertainment, but it is augmented by the presence of a true King of the Monsters. Definitely a great start, now on to the next!",9,6,12,17 May 2014
