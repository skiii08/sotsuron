The Hangover," The Funniest Movie That I've Seen In Years!!!
","I absolutely loved this movie! Strange as it may be, out of all the movies I've seen this year at the cinema, this is now my highest rated film. (And I like to see at least one movie per week) Without a doubt, this is the funniest movie that I've seen in years. It starts with a constant chuckle as they establish each character and then kicks it in to high gear. Perfectly structured and purely hilarious, this film throws one outrageous situation after the other and you actually feel like you're the fourth (or fifth) member of this road trip. The photos over the closing credits had the audience I saw it with literally laughing all the way in to the parking lot leaving the film. This is as funny and as fun as it gets.",Null,7,15,5 June 2009
John Wick," Huge Disappointment To Be Honest
","I have to say given the hype, I was quite disappointed in this effort. I expected way more story and at least some intrigue. Instead, the film is an hour and a half of Keanu running around slickly shooting various different people in the head. He's angry that they killed his dog (his only chance at acceptance and peace after the death of his wife) and goes around dispatching everyone who gets in his way with head shot after head shot. That's it. Honest to God, THAT is the entire film and it's not even a spoiler because the trailer tells us as much. There's no other plot and nothing to any supporting character whatsoever. The kill action is, again, slick but nothing rises above cut video game type sequences. At least it does make a viewer stop and ponder why all the action movies we grew up watching don't factor in close range gun shots to the head more often.",Null,19,45,25 October 2014
Iron Man 2," Masterfully Executed Sequel! Action AND Heart... A Perfect Mix
","Yes, I'm one of the fortunate few who got to see this gem a bit early and I'm happy to report that they took what worked so well in Iron Man and ran with it in an extremely gratifying way. The complexity, depth, heart and action are even more off the charts than the first film. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one and built upon it masterfully. Now we get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer weaved with a celebrity who should have never let the cat out of the bag in the final moments of Iron Man 1. They promised to up the action from the first film and they certainly did but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. It has the same flavor and humor of the original and it may even focus more on the fabulous relationships already developed. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film. I didn't think that was possible. Everyone came to play and this great cast brought their best stuff and it shows on screen. Everyone knew Downey, Paltrow and Cheadle could act but Bill O'Reilly and The CNN anchor? Yes, they show up and do a GREAT job in extended cameos. Rourke and Rockwell are PERFECT as the duel foils for Tony Stark, I mean PERFECT. From the Grand Prix in Monaco to the amazing finale, buckle up because this is one intense, interesting, intelligent and fun ride. My only real complaint is that Scarlett's Black Widow has too little screen time. Still, a film that leaves you clamoring for more isn't the worst sin in the world.When I was done viewing this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great sequels. What was said about classics like Spider-Man 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back, TDK and even Godfather 2 holds true for Iron Man 2. I honestly can't wait to see it again.",Null,62,125,26 April 2010
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," I enjoyed everything about this movie.
","My initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that I've seen in years. The genre has been pretty devoid of quality lately. So, I don't know if that plays a part or not and I really don't care at this point. I enjoyed everything about this movie. It has tremendous heart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters. A certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know. Steve Carell's character is the one everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the 'A' story you wonder why and start to think that the 'B' story is going to be muddled or cliché or one to endure. Well, they're not and everything comes together in a wonderful fashion. The entire cast here is perfection. The overall message may be one to debate but it doesn't matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well done.",Null,212,270,4 August 2011
Ant-Man," As Good As An Origin Film Can Get! Pure Fun.
","Either it was a lowered expectation factor or else they really did deliver an instant classic, it's hard to tell at this stage. I love this movie. Somehow it didn't feel epic enough to warrant a 10/10 perfect rating even though I really can't think of one thing I'd change to make it better. Ant-Man is fun first and foremost. It has true heart and soul and the best humor possible without it being too much. I enjoyed the heist angle and the many surprises that kept popping up throughout its running time. Everything felt more intimate and it was the perfect way to follow Age of Ultron for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Everything doesn't have to be large, grim or of a world-changing flavor. This may signal the perfect way to move forward for their phase three. Deliver large and then small as they rotate between Avenger and solo films. Whatever the case, I hope to see more of Scott Lang as Ant-Man and his entire supporting cast. Everyone was absolutely wonderful in their roles.I saw this with a group of 15 family members and every last one of them loved it. Kids and adults, men and women everyone was smiling and raving about the film... that doesn't happen often.",Null,0,8,25 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Yes, An All-Time Adventure Great Film!
","When I saw this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great films in its category. What I said about classics like Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, X2 or X-Men First Class holds true for Captain America.I love the range of emotions and development you experience following Steve Rogers from beginning to end of the film. He grows in to the hero role and you grow to like and admire him as you watch, maybe moreso than any other Marvel hero. I know, that's saying a lot since that's what truly makes Marvel great. It's not superpowers but relatable pathos and depth of character. Well, Cap delivers all that and more. It all works remarkably well as they humanize Steve and draw you in to the story. First Avenger is not just a good comic book movie. It's a great movie period.The complexity, depth, heart, emotion and action are off the charts. I honestly can't believe we're going to see a better movie this summer and, for that matter the rest of the year. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are raving about it. The complexities of a man dressed in a flag are more then anyone could have been expecting. The evolution and growth of the characters is also something you rarely see in a summer film. I loved the supporting cast a lot, how many summer films can you say you've seen that flesh out supporting characters? I'm so glad this movie turned out as good as it did and that most people are finding it and loving it as well.",Null,11,25,3 August 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A very good and intense mystery thriller.
","Reading a bit here, it seems to be a key to enjoying this film is NOT reading the book or seeing the Swedish movie.This is one very well structured and intense mystery thriller. It boarders on over-the-top in terms of adult theme but I was riveted and intrigued every step of the way. The performances are incredible and Rooney Mara deserves every bit of praise that she has generated for her portrayal of this complex and troubled character. There are a few logic flaw moments but they don't hinder the film at all. I do like that they gave us what amounts to a sequel tacked on to the end of the movie. Once the main plot is resolved, we get a resolution to a secondary plot that I didn't think they would go in to so thoroughly. It was like watching a later director's cut version of the film without having to wait for the DVD. That's what happens when a studio let's a big name director release what he wants, good for them.",Null,1,5,23 January 2012
Captain America: Civil War," This Is Literally One Of The Best Action/Adventure Movie Ever Made! 10/10 Perfection.
","The main theme centers on Cap's internal struggles and Cap's relationships with everyone from previous film. This is indeed a Captain America film and NOT Avengers 2.5. Everyone from Sam Wilson the Falcon to Bucky Barnes to Tony Stark plays a huge role but it's all in relation to Cap being the main focus. Even interaction with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Clint Barton/Hawkeye are important. Previous films are paid off nicely and it's why even smaller roles are pivotal. This movie stands on its own, but it certainly respects its roots of everything that has made the MCU great. It not only respects it but it quite literally pays off a lot of it but in a natural and even a surprising way. It's not necessary to have sen previous films but it certainly adds to the remarkable depth and the impact of this movie.The film is really grounded in a believable world that supports the political thriller and psychological thriller aspect, and it's helped by the caliber of the cast involved.A core theme surrounding Cap is the idea that he once used to represent America and has now become alien to modern thoughts and values due to the passage of time and the events of the Winter Soldier movie. Seeing this level of emotional stakes of this hero's journey is rare and incredibly captivating.All the fighting is very visceral and believable. Early on it's amazing and when it comes to hero vs hero, it becomes even more so. This is no 'scrimmage' or fake fight. The stakes are VERY real and very intense.This movie puts Cap through a lot and the audience is right there feeling everything with him. It's an incredible ride and one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Not just superhero films but movies in general. It really is that good.",Null,25,51,21 April 2016
Gone Girl," Performances = Great ........ The Film Itself = Overrated
","All the performance accolades are right on the mark, everyone was superb. Honestly, I can see multiple award nominations for numerous cast members. The under the radar performance for me has to be Carrie Coon in the role of the twin sister. No one seems to be mentioning her but they should be. As for the story, it's an intriguing tale involving events that keep the viewer fully involved. Yet, the pacing seems off and the payoff extremely muted. Even though I've never read the book, I knew exactly what was happening right from the start. There were very few twists and turns that challenged me but it was interesting to watch it all play out nonetheless. The media circus mockery and satire are perfection. Overall, it's a worthy film that seems to be leaning towards overrated (judging by all the overt praise) but that shouldn't take away from the fact that it delivers material that showcased a wonderful cast perfectly.",Null,1,6,3 October 2014
Kick-Ass," Good Shallow Fun
","This movie turned out better then I thought it would, and really is better then advertised. The start of the film (about the first 30 minutes or so) was as bad as I was expecting. I found myself wishing for a fast-forward button but still managed to care where the story was going. Then, the plot became interesting as the 'Hit Girl' and 'Big Daddy' character arcs came in to play. The story still finishes in a shallow and unbelievable way but I have to admit that I was entertained. The kid committing violence controversy didn't affect me one way or the other. Being a comic book fan helps... seeing John Romita Jr's art on the silver screen during the 'Big Daddy' origin sequence definitely made me smile. I love his work. While I didn't love this film, I did enjoy myself enough to get my money's worth.",Null,1,9,24 April 2010
Jurassic World," Turn off your brain and HAVE FUN!
","I enjoyed this movie warts and all. Yes, I was expecting more 'wow' in terms of dinosaur action but it did deliver enough for me to happily crunch my way through a giant tub of popcorn. The first 20 minutes or so is simply bad cinema. Cartoon level characters with no depth setting up the rest of the film. Then, somehow I grew to care for those characters by the end of the movie. I believe this has more to do with great casting and really nothing to do with story. Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt ooze charisma and charm. The call backs to the classic original certainly help. I wish we would have had better dinosaur fights and I really hated the horribly written bad-guy with alternative motives that have zero feasibility. Still, I went in expecting a monster movie popcorn flick and that's what they delivered for the most part.",Null,2,14,16 June 2015
The Da Vinci Code," Just Awful.
","If anyone thinks this mess of a movie and its poor presentation is a quality film then they are just fooling themselves. It's OK to praise a quality director (which he is) but at least let his latest effort earn that praise. It doesn't make you a true movie connoisseur to rave about an idiotic movie just because huge names are attached. It makes you a pathetic follower who can't use his or her own head and feelings to decide what is good. Forget the individual award nominations that are based on reputation. This movie is just flat out bad.Though unoriginal in its allegations, The Da Vinci Code proves that some misguided theories never entirely fade away. They just reappear periodically in a different disguise. This movie's claims resemble those of numerous fools throughout history, who have contradicted the united testimony of the Apostles and the early church they built. Those witnesses have always attested that Jesus Christ was and remains God himself. It didn't take an ancient council to make this true. And the pseudohistorical claims of a modern movie or novel can't make it false. That aside, it's just a dull film.",Null,6,15,19 May 2006
Thor," A Truly Enjoyable Film On Every Level
","This spectacular film works on so many levels but in large part because of the great cast and the fact that the director took this subject matter seriously. Casting an unknown like Chris Hemsworth was perfect. Veterans like Anthony Hopkins really shine in their roles. What can you say about the stunningly beautiful Natalie Portman? She's just fabulous and is actually better here than in her Oscar winning role from Black Swan. It's written well and the special effects truly are Oscar worthy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.If you are concerned that this film may not live up to the hype, don't be. Also, don't believe the naysayers at all. I'm betting they are ALL DC/Green Lantern fans afraid their film is going to get lost in this crowded summer. Thor being exceptional gives them pause and actually something to worry about. Do yourself a huge favor and ignore them and see this wonderful film.",Null,6,13,8 May 2011
Mad Max: Fury Road," Overrated and Tedious To The Max
","To quote a different old Mel Gibson action flick, maybe 'I'm getting too old for this spit.' (TV censored version) I honestly don't understand the seemingly universal praise of this effort. I hesitate to even call it a movie because in reality it's a two hour chase scene. It certainly has its moments and I can appreciate the impressive real world stunts and explosions. I also give it high marks for being exactly what it advertised itself to be a balls-to-the-walls insane action romp pivoting off the original films. For me, that romp played out like watching an insane person's nightmares over and over and over. The first two acts grew tedious and became something to endure rather than enjoy. Then, the third act hit and the last 20 minutes were amazing. You almost come to care about characters even though none of them were bothered to be developed along the way. Almost.",Null,7,16,21 May 2015
