Antz," so lifelike, so didactic
","It's probably the first time Woody Allen is so much like himself when he isn't at all. Ant Z, a neurotic, fatalistic, depressive, sorry ant with a record low level of self-esteem transforms into a (part-time) content, revolutionary hero of his utterly totalitarian and fascistic colony ever imaginable. Apart from the incredibly precise animation and 'logical' fantasy, one feels a bit distracted with the subliminal messages the picture tries to impose. While it would be easy to reduce the moral to the frequently recited motto: 'think for yourself once!', there are too many of them to ignore. This definitely is not a kid's flick, it is meant for and appreciated by adults, with many philosophical, psychological and social references and conflicts. One big 'bravo!' to Dreamworks. I think they have achieved the point where adults can actually enjoy animation movies while believing the whole stuff. These insects are surely going to bite some Disney bugs.",8,33,44,18 December 1998
Meet the Parents," Ben Stiller in trouble again...
","A comedy, not brighter than a sitcom, starring Ben Stiller and Robert deNiro. Not many things to comment on, except that the script seems like written by a team again, because there are tiny bits missing I believe.
Well Ben Stiller is again in trouble, except that he has no 'hair gel' to meddle with, instead the father of his fiancee, who is almost paranoidly obsessed with his daughter, and the family cat. Not a bit of improvement on acting skills in Stiller's compartment, De Niro is the same, shining and leaving the audience in sheer curiosity: why does he act in these ludicrous movies? If there are no movies to go and see other than this, OK; but if you have time and an alternative to 'Meet The Parents', just wait until they release it on tape, rent it, just laugh through it, and forget about it in an hour.",6,0,0,23 January 2001
There's Something About Mary," how dumber can anyone get?
","This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. It is unbelievable to see Cameron Diaz making such a fool out of herself acting in this 5th class situation comedy, especially after the flawless 'My Best Friend's Wedding'. Not even Matt Dillon could rescue this vessel sinking. Such a shame and waste of time, money and effort.",3,0,0,18 December 1998
The Truman Show," a voyeuristic classic
","Many thanks to Peter Weir for winning us a surprisingly talented actor, Jim Carrey. This dark comedy-drama with its beautifully and precisely webbed plot, cinematography and string of ideas is definitely deserving many academy awards, but will not get them. I was overwhelmed (and scared) by everything the director superbly presents us what we already know, and enjoyed every moment of being the voyeur (and when I got out of the theater, the voyee). The soundtrack is definitely worth buying, and the movie itself is worth seeing for a second time. But the trailers, thanks to the well-praised (!) media I think spoil the surprising and spooky feel. Ed Harris steals many scenes even from the superb Jim Carrey. A must see for the media-aware crowd.",9,0,0,17 October 1998
The Matrix," quite good indeed... but still disappointing
","Yes, one has to admit, The Matrix is maybe 'the' representative of the new-millenial hype-action movie. It is a well acted, well directed, well 'designed', and obviously well thought movie. There should be no doubt that the action movies of the 2000s will more or less look like, feel like, sound like and be flashy like The Matrix, IF the producers have enough money as the Wachowsky brothers. So what's disappointing? Everyone left the theater feeling dizzy and confused, having conversations over their personal pseudo-lives and the ambivalence and vagueness of their perceptions of reality. Keanu Reeves as Neo and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus dazzled the audience with their superb acting. Carrie-Anne Moss became every guy's dream date (watch the Jiu-Jitsu moves!). But.... but The Matrix is so close to being just the pumped-up, pretentious, expensive, star packed candidate of the 'Kafkaesque Action Movie of the New Millenium', thanks to Dark City. It was so frustrating not hearing anyone mention this romantic prototype of the parallel world/deceived citizens plot. And, oh! That absolutely clich√©, and almost stupid ending with that mindless and laughable monologue! Now that would be more suitable with a 70s low-budget space adventure.
Yes, one must confess that The Matrix is truly and certainly good. It is indeed mind and eye boggling. But, it is not *the* movie after all. For a refreshing retrospective, Dark City by Alex Proyas and Bound by the Wachowsky brothers is strongly recommended.",8,0,0,16 September 1999
