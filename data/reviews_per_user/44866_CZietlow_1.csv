Angels & Demons," Failure to accurately represent the book, not worth your time if you've read it.
","This movie has way too many errors, it appears that if you haven't read the book then the movie is fine for you. Characters are added that aren't in the book, and main characters are absent at the same instant. A cardinal survives when he's supposed to die, fight scenes don't happen, Vittoria isn't kidnapped, and the entire beginning is wrong. Basically the story the movie laid out was a horrible representation of the book, I sat frustrated and enraged for over 2 hours in a theater with readers and non-readers of the book. I understand that it is hard to incorporate everything but you can at least make an accurate attempt on the movie, the movie isn't even 50% correct based on the text. I'm amazed to see that this movie has gotten a 6.9 so far, the book readers must not have viewed it, and I wish I could get my money back for that epic failure of cinema.",1,13,22,26 May 2009
