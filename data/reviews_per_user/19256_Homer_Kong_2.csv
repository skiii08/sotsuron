The Blair Witch Project," Scary, but not in a BOOO! kind of way
","The choice to film it using 16mm film and a normal vcr was brilliant, it makes the film more realistic. The actors are great and very believeble! This film is probably the best film of the year because it shows you don't need SFX to make it scary, just good acting and ...I'll never walk alone in the woods again!",10,2,3,26 November 1999
The Day After Tomorrow," What a disaster movie should be
","Well, I've been reading a lot of things on this movie about the lack of plot, acting and inaccuracies. Let me reply to those by saying that if you're going to see a costume drama, you want to see great acting and plots.However, disaster films are meant for entertainment. This is certainly the case in 'The Day After Tomorrow'. I saw the first trailer a couple of months ago, and drew a big red circle around the release day on my calendar. It's been a long time since I last did this for a 'popcorn film'.I somehow got the same ambiance that you get when seeing the classic seventies disaster films. The peril is portrayed brilliantly by a special effects team that raised the standards once again. Emmerich made the right choice when he went flat out for baffling people instead of boring them with 170 plotlines and detailed accuracy (which would cause the film to span almost 5000 years).The film's stars are the twisters, tidal waves, hale, snow, and ice. In short: the storms. They're just eye candy.The film delivers great entertainment, the way a trouble forgetting film should be. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.I'll give it a 7/10!",8,0,0,28 May 2004
