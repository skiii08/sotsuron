Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome!
","I think this movie has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has great special effects, great characters and great action. It is a great addition to the star wars trilogy. It was definitely worth the money I paid, even more. I suggest that you see this movie as soon as possible. I really don't want to tell anything about the movie to you. You just have to see it for yourself. Terrific.....",10,0,0,22 May 1999
