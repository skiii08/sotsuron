United 93," United 93 Movie vs. TV Production
","I saw a movie entitled 'United 93 (2006)' on the Arts and Entertainment TV Channel about a week before the 'United 93' movie was released in theaters.Can anyone tell me the differences between the two? Cast? Writers? Directors? Story? I'm curious because the one I saw fit the accounts I've heard and read of the theater release so closely. I thought the TV production was all-around outstanding. It was straightforward and informative and, even though I felt the terror and grief as I watched, I never felt that my emotions had been gratuitously manipulated.The events surrounding 9/11 are an important and tragic part of our history that I want to understand as well as I can. I would like to see the theater release, too, if the differences between the two productions are substantial.Thanks for any information you can offer.Donovan",Null,1,3,19 May 2006
