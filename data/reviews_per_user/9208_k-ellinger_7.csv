Casablanca," Casablanca
","Overall, this was a fairly good movie. The lighting and the characters are good enough to create a romantic feel to the movie. This movie would be a good movie for any romantic movie lovers out there. Ricky and Ilsa are old flame that seem to have some serious issues with each other when they meet again at his business. Ilsa tries to get the help from Ricky to help her and her husband, Victor, to help flee the country from the Germans that are on his tail from a crime that he committed. The love that Ricky and Ilsa had for each other obviously still deeply hurt them when they found each other again. Luckily, this movie has a very good movie that is portrayed very well with its ending.",7,0,2,7 March 2016
Citizen Kane," Rosebud.
","When this movie first starts out, we hear the famous Charles Kane mutter his last word, Rosebud. As the audience views this scene, we are left to wonder who this man was and what that one last word is supposed to mean. Of course, the people surrounding Kane are curious as well what this man could possibly mean. Fellow reporters are determined to find out what this man could've meant and almost go crazy trying to discover what he would mean. We are taken through a series of flashbacks of Kane's life and how he became so successful and why this last word was so important. This movie is all about the journey of success, power and greed. I would recommend this movie because of all of the mystery and suspense provided throughout the movie.",Null,1,2,15 March 2016
Annie Hall," Old Love
","This movie is all about the life of Alvy Singer and how he reflects on his life. He had always believed that love was overrated but from some reason also desired it. After meeting singer Annie Hall, he realizes that love may not be as overrated as he thinks. Singer talks about the struggles he faced while dating Annie. He briefly talked about his childhood and how his life led up to where it was with Annie. He takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster when we watch the ups and downs that take place between him and Annie. I would recommend this movie for others to see, especially those who are lovers of romance movies.",8,0,0,28 April 2016
The Graduate," Seduction
","This movie is full of seduction, sneaking around, lying, and relationships. When Benjamin gets home college, his parents have high expectations of him. Of course, Ben finds himself in a position that he didn't expect to get into. He finds himself starting an affair with his father's business partners wife, Mrs. Robinson. Soon later, Ben and Mrs. Robinson end their affair but the trouble doesn't end there for Ben. He meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, and quickly falls for her. Ben finds himself in a messy love triangle with wanting to be with Elaine and not wanting to upset Mrs. Robinson, who is completely against Ben and Elaine dating. This movie could've been a big shock for audiences in the '60s because the Hayes Code had recently been broken. However, it still is an entertaining movie that is still enjoyable to watch even to this day. I would recommend this movie to others.",10,1,1,27 April 2016
Singin' in the Rain," Musical
","If you are into musicals, this is the movie for you. Unless you live under a rock, you may be familiar with the song, Sinin' in the Rain, which of course comes from this movie. The on- screen romantic duo, Don and Lina try to pursue a romantic to their fans while behind screen, their relationship isn't what it seems to be. When movies start coming out in sound after the debut of The Jazz Singer, Don realizes that he can't have Lina speaking or singing in any of her films. He uses the beautiful voice of a musical singer named Kathy to cover up Lina's nasal sounding voice. Lina soon discovers what is going on and does anything to try to keep her face in film because she wants to be as successful as anyone else. I believe that this movie was easy to get into with all of the good music that was played.",8,0,1,4 April 2016

Psycho," Fantastic
","Alfred Hitchcock was the master of making films full of suspense and horror. Hitchcock is able to get into the mind of his viewers and leave them shocked and horrified that anyone could do what Norman Bates did. The title describes exactly what Norman Bates is. A psycho. Even though this movie is old school and filming has changed and improved a lot since this movie came out, I still believe today's generation can still sit and enjoy this movie. In this psychological thriller, viewers are left screaming at their T.V. screen trying to tell the characters to get out while they can. This popular 1960 horror film was so successful, there was a current television series created that is just as successful as the movie.",10,1,2,4 April 2016
