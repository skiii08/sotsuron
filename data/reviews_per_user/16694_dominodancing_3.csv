Minority Report," Yawn
","I bought this film on DVD before I'd seen it. Well, it is Speilberg after all. I sat down with my girlfriend to watch 'Minority Report' with much excitement and anticipation. Twenty minutes later I was struggling to stay awake. Had it not been for her, I would have whipped it out of my DVD player and put it with all the other beer mats. Speilberg is a legend... but my God this is bad. The plot (or what paper thin plot there is) seems to be the illegimate child of 'The Fugitive' and 'Mission Impossible' (btw, Steven watch 'The Fugitive' and see how it's done son). Tom Cruise yet again faxes his performance in. I do honestly believe that there is a genuinely average actor bursting to get out of Mr. T. Cruise but we have yet to see him. But until then we have to put up with these love letters from Cruise to Cruise. Now I'm not going to waste any more of my life writing about such an unimportant and dull film. PS One copy of 'Minority Report' (used only once) for sale. OK, OK you can have it for free...",Null,0,0,28 January 2003
Titanic," 'Smell ice can ya... bleeding Christ!'
","'Titanic' is OK. It is the sort of film that really satisfies when it is first seen, especially in the cinemas. However when you watch it again, or think about it, the flaws are all too clear.The script is the main problem. Some of the lines are absolute stinkers (for British viewers, the two 'cockneys' in the crows nest are dreadful... to all Americans out there, no-one in Britain says 'bleeding Christ') and the acting could have been a bit better. There was not much chemistry between Di Caprio and Winslet and this makes the love story a bit on the unreal side.
However, the film is a winner on the technical front. Hard to believe that a director would be so keen to get a full size replica of the Titanic, but Cameron does and it looks impressive on screen. The effects are superb as well - except the iceberg which looks like a great big blancmange. So no argument about the technical oscars but come on, best picture! I don't think so. And Kathy Bates was awful. Still, 5/10. But Winslet, Di Caprio and Cameron will all do better than this.",8,1,2,27 August 2001
Casino Royale," Wonderful
",Let's start off by saying this - Daniel Craig IS James Bond. He is totally different to any of the previous actors (with the possible exception of Timothy Dalton in 'Licence To Kill') to play this role. He is just awesome as a newly qualified 007 on his first mission. He really looks the part and excels playing a gadget-less (no Q in this film) Bond who survives on his wits alone. The film is also noteworthy for two great fight scenes (in a bathroom and stairwell) which are just brutal.Director Martin Campbell deserves credit for injecting new energy into the franchise - much as he did in 'Goldeneye'.The only two gripes are the title track (just dreadful - down there with Bono and The Edge's effort for 'Goldeneye') and the lack of a traditional gun-barrel sequence. But minor gripes they are - 'Casino Royale' is wonderful. The third best Bond film after 'Goldfinger' and 'Licence To Kill'.,10,1,4,16 November 2006
