Blade Runner 2049," A damn good sequel! This is how a true Sci-Fi masterpiece should be made!
","Loosely based on Sci-Fi maestro Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', in 1982 Ridley Scott created an amazing neo-noir cinematic experience, titled BLADE RUNNER that has been improved with ages. And that's just not only because of those numerous cuts, edits and improvised versions produced by the studio over the years but more for its one hell of a thought provoking story line...What defines us as Human & our identity? In what sort of 'better future' we are actually heading as a specie? A dream like technology driven world where reality will depend on our improvised senses or implanted memory, trying to hide an absolute dystopian nightmare beneath all of that?! In that bleak, polluted, morally & environmentally degraded world, a Blade runner get hired to track down & 'retire' a group of androids 'who have seen things' that eventually made them more human than ever where they movingly throw a question mark to our known concept of humanity at the end. After 35 years, Denis Villeneuve not only just honored the legacy here, he also remarkably extend that epic tale of human enigma where another young Blood Runner is trying to solve a mystery that planted its seed years ago. Through a deep emotional journey, Villeneuve took it to another level of cinematic excellence that convincingly outshines most other contemporary, so called Sci-Fi masterpieces (even including his 2016 film ARRIVAL!). Actually we couldn't bargain & get better than this, a perfect combination of the finest talents of current Hollywood that you'll find here in almost every department of the film, resulting a damn good sequel in compare to today's Hollywood standard. But I guess, for its slow burn nature, dark tone & the overall aesthetic value, only the ardent fans of the original going to get it properly & they'll love it for sure.",9,2,8,8 October 2017
Airlift," India's own 'Schindler's List'!
","This is a magnificent effort by Indian cinema for finding & telling their own 'Schindler's List' story. But other than a common businessman turning into an unlikely hero by saving thousands of innocent lives in a horrifying war setting, both Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning SCHINDLER'S LIST and Raja Menon's AIRLIFT basically have only one thing in common...the triumph of human spirit; a selfless individual's exemplary initiatives to come forward & rise to the occasion for the greatest cause of all during a very difficult time of war. Ironically both the films inspired by two separate true events and this tells us again that history not only repeat itself through bloody wars & countless human sufferings but also it recalls the very basic core of humanity as long as there are saviors like Oskar Schindler or Mathews & Vedi (inspired the character of Ranjit Katiyal in Airlift). Over the years, Indian cinema has developed a lot particularly in terms of production values and AIRLIFT is another shining example of that. Really liked the way they depicted the 1990s war torn Kuwait & the havoc on the streets demonstrated by Iraqi soldiers. The cast did a really good job in their respective roles and specially for Akshay Kumar, I believe AIRLIFT is going to seals his place in the history of Indian cinema like the way LAGAAN or SARFAROSH did for Amir Khan & SAWDES for SRK.",9,0,0,28 April 2016
It," One of the most entertaining horror films of recent years.
","As an adaptation of Stephen King's IT – CHAPTER ONEthis turned out quite satisfactory; Andy Muschietti & his team did a pretty good job overall. The great bunch of young actors nicely shines in their respective roles but yesdidn't't get why they switched & changed few original ideas or things about characters like Mike, Ben & Bev...what's the point of making Ben as the history nerd instead of Mike without revealing anything about his family or background, particularly just moving into a new town & staying over at an Aunt's house, where he's having kind of difficult time to adjust because of an annoying cousin & aunt. Personally I loved that aspect in the miniseries which I found quite relevant for many kinds around that age passing through the similar sort of problem. And the other things that kinda bugged me were Bev's missing slingshot skills and the way they gave away the little mystery around 'the Secret admirer' thing to her so early in this phase of the story. But manthat stunning young actress (Sophia Lillis) turned out quite a catch for this movie, I'm sure she'll have some damn busy days with great prospects in coming years of her career. Pleasantly surprised by Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise! Mostly because of my early impression about this portrayal of Pennywise wasn't much positive or hopeful from what I've seen in the first teaser/trailer. Thought it was going to be somewhat cheesy but glad it turned out I was wrong. Enjoyed his every encounter with the kidsparticularly the major selling point was his very first appearance & interaction with Georgie and he nailed that segment with his own charisma of portraying the fabulously creepy 'dancing clown' of Derry (btw, shocked to see that ended in gruesome fashion! I wasn't expecting at all to see such explicit & gory death scene of such a young victim!). Anyway, coming out from the reels (inside the garage) & the freezer (in Neibolt house) were another favorite parts and also that 3-scary doors part was a clever touch by Muschietti. But I wouldn't call them jump scares as I was expecting something like that to happen at those parts of the movie. Those were deliberate scares for menicely done, entertaining & loved them all. The whole kid's viewpoint treatment worked so well for a change considering how most other major modern horror films came out in recent years. I think they can still add few more short scenes regarding how adult community was dealing with those child missing cases more elaborately while grown-up characters recalling about the old Derry in next chapter(s). As a whole, I'd say Andy Muschietti's IT is the most entertaining horror film of 2017 so far. Excited to see who they eventually cast in the all grown-up roles for these characters.",8,3,5,23 September 2017
Hereditary," A distrubingly melancholic mix of the grief & the supernatural
","Quite an unpredictable & unsettling tale of a seemingly dysfunctional family where almost every member become torn apart inside by tragedy after tragedy. And what begins as an emotional roller-coaster about a family tearing apart with grief, eventually descends into madness and the supernatural that demands careful attention to almost every scene & dialog from the very beginning.
In this remarkable debut feature, director Ari Aster keeps a wonderful balance between the elements of mainstream & art-house horror films through an unnerving experience till the end. The film had a lot to say about grief and trauma and the way it was put together & keeps a moving, yet an eerily melancholy tone all over is its strongest part. Particularly that heated arguments between the mother & the son at the dinner table was quite heart-wrenching and one of the most moving segments of the movie, IMO.All four of the main cast shines in their respective roles, the highlight was the Oscar worthy, emotionally moving performance by Toni Collette. Throughout the movie, she expressed a fear of something shifting in her brain, beyond any control, inflecting her world with a terror, dread or uncertainty that she was unable to shape or contain or wake up from. One that just keeps unraveling and commands you to watch.
The two younger actors respectively delivered some strong performances as well where they convincingly embodied the horrific nature of certain moments, while those scenes were disturbingly underscored with a desperate sense of dread & helplessness.Though this should definitely regard as a modern masterpiece of Horror but not sure whether or not it'll become a fan-favorite in coming days for its slow burn nature & thought provoking elements, as nowadays even masterpieces like THE BABADOOK or IT FOLLOWS often gets panned by the genre-fans.",9,2,5,22 August 2018
Captain Marvel," A decent addtion to the MCU
","While the teasers & trailers indicated a very routine & ordinary superhero flick with a cliched formula, the movie surprisingly turned out quite decent & fairly entertaining. Obviously it could have been better with a better script & director(s) who could have play with the story arc more creatively but overall it was a fine addition to the franchise. There are worse films than this already in MCU and at least it didn't feel like a tie-in episode like Ant-man & the Wasp. Expected more from Nick Fury's contribution here, other than mostly being a comic relief and surely his lost eye deserved a way better backstory. Goose the cat was a nice surprise though.
Anyway, can't wait to see how Russo brothers going to treat her in the ENDGAME (particularly after that mid-credit scene)!",7,4,13,8 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," A total entertainer!
","It was delightfully funny indeed but didn't find over the top kind of funny at all, especially after reading such comments or reviews like total comedic trash etc. Even GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY vol. 1 & 2 were way more comedic than this one. Though bit under used but Blanchett still shines as a badass, sexy Marvel villain. Glad to see Loki & Hulk got a good deal of screen time than I anticipated. Overall, a total entertainer and found this even better than Spider-man: Homecoming (2017) and the 3rd best superhero film of the year after LOGAN & WONDER WOMAN so far.",9,1,6,5 November 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The pain underneath the rage
","No parent in this world deserve to loss a child by an unspeakable tragedy or a brutal crime but when they does, not every tragedy teaches us tolerance and not everyone can get to channel their grief & anger through an unorthodox way like Frances McDormand's Mildred did in this emotionally moving dramedy. And as we know the world is far more complex & unpleasant place than most celluloid projections but it takes a remarkable storyteller & filmmaker to convey that in a convincing manner and Martin McDonagh did this wonder in his latest and this year's one of the best films here. When the little town almost starts to forget about the vicious rape & murder of her young daughter, the aggrieved mother Mildred Hayes rents the three abandoned billboards near her home to protest over the lack of progress in the investigation. This leads to pressure on the townsfolk's favorite chief (beautifully played by our favorite Woody Harrelson), resulting anger from his loyal officers, and so on down the line. This is a darkly funny, yet a very profound film where most of the major characters were flawed by their decisions or actions, torn apart inside by grief or frustrations and that made it so grounded & compelling. Almost every actor in their assigned role did justice to the solid & neatly written scripts where the character developments turned out one of the most strongest elements of this movie. McDormand on the lead delivered clearly an Oscar worthy performance, she was so great with her character's internal language...time to time slowly revealing the pain underneath the rage was something so stunning & compelling to watch that I haven't seen in most of the acclaimed & major films of recent years. Sam Rockwell just nailed his supporting role of Dixon, a small town racist police officer, the development & along the way the changes in his character were another striking part of the film. Not just being a fan of McDonagh's IN BRUGES (2008), I think this is the best film of the year that really deserve some major recognition in coming award season.",9,2,5,30 December 2017
Justice League," Whedon saved it! Flawed but entertaining.
","JUSTICE LEAGUE isn't a perfect superhero movie. One dimensional-weak villain, rush in the story line, almost zero emphasis on how's the world dealing with the events...there are issues to get critical about it. But does that really means it's another entertaining mess of a DC film?! I definitely wouldn't call it a mess but yeah..still it was damn entertaining!! It's basically a superhero movie mostly about the superheros, from character introductions to all the fun & actions, JL was a triumph of DC's supreme superheros. The entertainment level was so high that all those critical issues didn't actually bothered me much; the heroes steals the show entirely, the villain & the crisis felt like minor issues or an excuse to bringing them all together. All the actors shines in their respective roles; Miller surprised me as Barry Allen, Jason Momoa was great & badass as Aquaman, even Ray Fisher as Cyborg was pretty adequately fits into the group. WW & Batsy have grown with their characters and man...Sup returned as the best of them, one of the versions of Superman that we've been waiting for. If you are familiar with the style & execution of Snyder & Whedon's filmmaking then I'm sure you'll see the difference here, the style of 2 different directors were somewhat quite visible throughout the movie but in a good way. In Justice League, we have somewhat got the best of both of them. I'm glad Whedon stepped in & saved the movie from being another Snyder's signature entertaining mess. His light & full of life & fun touches were noticeable and made this such an enjoyable ride from start to finish despite having several issues.DCEU still alive and I'm looking forward to see further installments.",8,1,3,17 November 2017
Dunkirk," Enemy: flat & one dimensional characters, Winner: cinematography
","As for the 'critical praise' goes, I understand Nolan tried to capture here a macro point of view of the historic event/evacuation story of Dunkirk but it turned out another disappointment (after Interstellar)! Thing is most of the epic & classic war movies comes with an individual or a set of characters, backed up by a rich screenplay that eventually made us started to care for them while we witnessed the horror of war to gradually unfold with a graceful touch of heart or humanity at some point in the story. In Nolan's Dunkirk, the single character development was minor issue with mere importance, as I guess he was more interested to depict the event as a 'character' itself that's facing a struggle to survive in one of the most awfully cornered situations in the history of world wars for an allied force. Most of the 'major characters' were either desperately trying to escape or determined to follow the course of their duties without much portraying emotional aspects of their convictions. Frustrating part is, after all these years it was a great opportunity (missed!) for a film maker like Nolan to really make a remarkably true epic war movie based on such an intriguing war event like Dunkirk...started from the point of Nazi war plan to skillfully corner the Brit & French allied force and their historic rescues at the end! I understand that not every war movie needs to be character driven with great cast like PATTON, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or SCHINDLER'S LIST and there was even war film made in such approach where they remarkably portrayed an horrifying event of war without much focusing a set of characters i.e. COME AND SEE (one of the best war movies ever made, IMO) but Dunkirk sadly failed to left any sort of moving impression on me as a viewer.Though the presence was there but directly (with characters) there wasn't much portrayal of German enemy side in Dunkirk. The irony is actually the 'real enemy' were flat & one dimensional characters and the only real winner in this movie was cinematography, stunning!",6,4,10,29 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," What a moving homage to a decade old franchise!
","Not every highly-anticipated movie lives up to the expectations but Avengers: Endgame is one of those few that delivered almost everything that's been promised or to some extent, even more. Not only this is the perfect follow up to INFINITY WAR (2018) but a remarkably done, moving homage to a 10 year long successful franchise consisting 21 films!While the first hour & so skillfully sets up the high-stakes, gradually reveals the remaining avengers in an utterly emotionally wounded & frustrated post Infinity War world, the film cleverly picks up the momentum right after that with lots of twists & turns backed up by little & big moments of excitements as well as tears of joy & heart-pounding loss at the end.Kudos to the director-duo Russo brothers, the writers and everyone involved with this absolute epic conclusion of the saga that ultimately pulled off the most satisfying ending this whole story arc could have.Can't figure at the moment how they or anyone will be able to top this one in coming years.",10,2,4,28 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," THANOS Rules!!
","Freaking amazing!!! I still can't gasp what I just saw...it was effectively moving & superbly action-packed that comes with a jaw dropping ending which may going to disappoint some moviegoers but I'm sure it'd really make sense to the true comicbook fans. Kudos to the MCU team for making it so bold & masterfully crafted. Some may find lack of concentration or character development for some of their favorite characters but as a whole it didn't bother me much, cause you can't expect each & every character of MCU to shine in their own way of glory in one single movie. Moreover, there's the sequel coming next year and that's where many possibilities lies, even changing the course of its reality!
Btw, THANOS RULES!!! Awesome character building & surely going to be one of the best superhero movie villains of all time.",9,2,8,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One can only wish that night could ended like this.
","Quite simplistic in narrative & plot structure, yet one of the most beautiful films of Tarantino so far, IMO. His passion for cinema, particularly a bygone era of Hollywood shines here throughout every frame for his top notch cinematography & spot on set designs & costumes. The A-list cast did a terrific job in their respective roles who carried the film remarkably all through the way till the end.Tarantino wonderfully captured a challenging time of a fast changing Hollywood with a pretty simple tale at the center where a struggling actor & his stunt double trying to survive & find their place in the industry by keeping a beautiful friendship at core. On the other hand, there was Sharon Tate; a stunningly glamorous actress & the wife of an acclaimed director as their next door neighbor, enjoying every bit of success at the same time. But this is not only just a film about a particular period of an industry or how artists from different state of success meet each other through a dramatic chain of events...it was more like a lover letter to the late 60s cinema & its artists through the eyes of a film aficionado who give us a warm & beautiful taste of an alternate reality at the end; where Tarantino as the savior, rescued his dream girl from the evil clutches of fate.Personally I used to have a keen interest about the Sharon Tate murder & watched a number of films & documentaries about the Manson family & this specific story. And as being a fan of both Polanski & Tate, it shocked me terribly when I first came to know about this vicious crime. On that regard, I'd like to thank Mr. Tarantino for not glorifying the violence of those brutal murders on the screen this time and very much appreciate the way he reimagined it instead with his own engaging style of cinematic interpretations. Found the ending quite moving actually...one can only wish that night could ended like this.",9,17,28,25 August 2019
A Quiet Place," A Refreshing & Phenomenal achievement in genre film making
","In an apocalyptic setting of near future, where most of Earth's human population has been almost wiped out by a race of sightless, vicious creatures of unknown origin. This creatures hunt their prey only by sound, as they got incredible hearing ability. And against this odd, the film starts with a family of 5 scavenging for daily supplies while communicating non-verbally through sign language. Within few minutes with an unexpected turn, you'll get to see what the consequence of making noise is, in this terrifying world of silence.
John Krasinski's A QUIET PLACE is a refreshing, phenomenal achievement in genre film making where SOUND & SILENCE played like a character in their own right through creating a chilling atmosphere from start to finish.
The cast delivered some amazing performances in their respective roles as their characters were forced to live life in a constant fear of making noise in the high possibility that seemingly unstoppable. Particularly, the stunning Emily Blunt shines in that 'water broke out' sequence remarkably. Kudos to her husband, the director & co-writer of this new masterpiece of Horror, John Krasinski for skillfully making such an effective narrative with rare moments of dialog. This is one of those kind of movies which proves that the great horror stories & films aren't always about guts & gore or jump scares, it's about the tale of human survival and the depth in its characters and the challenges in their relationship.Glad to seen it in its first day-first show here in an almost empty theater where even the audience was like afraid to make a noise while watching the movie.",9,2,4,13 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not bad but expected a lot better
","Just came out from the theater...got some mixed feelings. It was more of like a connecting film between TFA and the one(s) that will come next. Not so much as a standalone episode. Felt like they weren't sure enough on what to do with Kylo Ren/BenSolo. I understand his torments and past but Johnson kinda played with him, resulting some sort of inconsistency. First half was quite flat but liked the 2nd half, particularly the finale though. Overall, not a bad film at all but expected a lot more twisted & entertaining.
Among this new line of films (JJ Abrams era), here's my ranking:
1. Rogue One
2. The Force Awakens
3. The Last Jedi",6,0,0,15 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A fairly decent sequel.
","For any comic book/super hero movie lover it's somewhat like another DARK KNIGHT RISES(!)...there were rush & too many things going around but you're still going to love it as it packed with your favorite characters, plenty of awesome, eye catching action sequences and good dose of humor. Considering superbly well balanced storyline & characters of its predecessor 'THE AVENGERS (2012)' which is one of the best superhero films ever made, AGE OF ULTRON is a fairly decent sequel, IMO. I think the super siblings, Ultron and even to some extent the 'surprise' addition to the team 'The Vision' needed some more time to develop finely or may be it'd be better if they gradually introduced & developed this characters through some earlier other Marvel films like Loki for The Avengers (2012)...the audience already more or less knew about him through THOR (2011) and easily get cope with his motivations & schemes. And not only Loki, there weren't actually any new or fresh characters in 2012 Avengers Assembles who needed some time & space in character development area but this time there were one too many of them. Moreover, the plot was way simpler & more entertaining in first outing of the Avengers. Anyway, overall it won't be fair to say I'm disappointed with AOU but yeah...definitely could have been better.",7,2,7,2 May 2015
Midsommar," Overly long narrative killed the momentum
","As a movie featuring a Pagan sort of cult, it was interesting, specially the whole idea behind the cult, the Harga commune was fascinating at least but it all delivered in a long winded format while the center plot was quite simple, IMO...a girl struggling in terrible grief by losing her family suddenly & having a challenging time in relationship with her boyfriend...takes a trip to Sweden & find themselves in a strange commune & their seemingly normal but weirdly screwed up rituals.The visuals, set designs & cinematography all were excellent but the story did felt like dragged excessively at times which affected the momentum it was trying to build, mostly in the 2nd half.There's no complaint against the central character, Dani, who almost got a perfect treatment but her supporting ones, specially the one-dimensional, self-absorbed boyfriend needed some little more closure & focus, I guess.Where Aster's HEREDITARY had an uncanny feel all around with segments unfolding through a good pace of twists & turns...MIDSOMMER failed to achieve that here for its overly long narrative. It could have been more intact & little more exciting, something like THE WICKER MAN (1973).",7,0,1,26 September 2019
3 Idiots," The story deserved a better climax at the end.
","Definitely it's blast for the fans of Aamir Khan. Great story starts with perfect cast & acting. Then just move forward with a great pace & fantastic humor that everyone expects from any Rajkumar Hirani film. Moreover, the main content & message proves that surely it was another a very much needed film for the respected audience. And as usually Mr. RH delivered the package very well. But my only little disappointments goes with the final climax. The sequences of final climax are very much important to closing the main statement in a way that stays in the mind of the audience for an adequate amount of time. And that can then help to form a judgmental & thought provoking ideas. For example, MUNNA BHAI MBBS. The whole vacuum baby delivery idea may be new for the viewers with a little demonstration of usefulness of WEB CAM tech. Though I haven't get the chance to read the original novel but personally I think this climax sequence didn't quite fit in a proper way with the content of the story like the climax of MUNNA BHAI films were superbly coped with those stories. I think 3 Idiots deserved a better climax at the end rather than found them busy to have a successful delivery with the help of a vacuum machine. At least I didn't expect that coming. Other than that it was perfectly entertaining.",6,10,21,9 January 2010
Joker," There's something more than an origin stoy for the Clown Prince of Crime!
","Joaquin Phoenix portrayed Freddie Quell, a traumatized, shell-shocked Navy veteran in Paul Thomas Anderson's 2012 film THE MASTER. As one of the greatest character-actors living today, Phoenix was so shockingly convincing in the character of Quell that not only gained his 3rd, deserving Oscar nomination but also showed his capability to nail any role of a psychologically disturbed individual or a troubled mind any day. To some extent, there's already a shadow of someone like Joker existed in Freddie Quell! Needless to say, once again he delivered a masterclass powerful performance as Arthur Fleck a.k.a Joker this year.From the very beginning, JOKER captured a captivating atmosphere of grimy despair, while there's this slow & haunting score in the background that gradually sets the mood to take you into the heart of a damaged man's psychosis as well as to the gritty streets of Gotham, an unmistakable mirror of late 70s or early 80s New York city, filled with wealth disparity & rampant crime. Though the inspiration from the greatest films of that same era (TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMEDY) also more or less visible here but what makes JOKER is a masterpiece of its own right is the point that this is a film that not only provides an origin tale for one of the most popular comicbook villains of all time, it also delivers something special at the end....where a failed comedian not only turns out as an unpredictable & merciless sociopath, called Joker but we also get to see how it all leads up to a symbol of rebellious ideology for the oppressed & the unfortunates of a divisive society; which can generate someone more menacing than Arthur Fleck's Joker in the future where a Cape Crusader may going to rise someday as his counter part!",10,2,4,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," You can't expect better than this from Hollywood these days
","A beautifully done sequel that turned out lot better than my expectations, particularly after reading some critical reviews from early screenings.Really loved the way they treated all those nostalgic elements for the Losers' Club and all the Pennywise encounters, not all of them were creepy but quite entertaining for sure.Kudos to the cast and specially Mr. Muschietti for giving it a heart-warming & satisfying conclusion.",9,15,27,7 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," All Hail the King !!
","An absolute blast of a monster mayhem flick! Unlike Gareth Edwards' GODZILLA (2014), liked the way this time they made it sure of nobody can complain on Kong or any other monster's lack of screen presence time. A must see & quite a perfect entertaining flick for monster movie lovers. I understand how or why some of the critics are complaining on cheesy dialog & lack of character development parts of the film but to me, those issues were nicely compensated by releasing one after another vicious, weird & interesting massive creatures on screen along through the 'survey job' turned survival journey of an expedition team on Skull Island. Moreover, this time it isn't that tragic 'The Beauty & the Beast' tale of a colossal ape who all just wanted to have a long date with his woman of love but ended up falling down dead from the Empire State Building. This Kong is quite an angry young lad who's damn serious about protecting his territory and its all helpless inhabitants & creatures from anything that's threatening his kingdom. The epic final battle was a treat to watch & will be remain as something to highly regard & talked about for the monster lovers for a long time. My only complaint is that they really did showed too much (almost all the creatures) on those countless clips & trailers before the release that left little amount of surprise in terms of newly introduced M.U.T.Os for 'MonsterVerse'.",8,16,32,11 March 2017
Mother!," Is it only about God Vs Mother earth Vs Mankind or more?!
","'mother!' can be defined as Darren Aronofsky's major, bold move into the segment of avant-garde cinema which got a pretty close tie with Horror. While I referred BLACK SWAN as his love letter to Roman Polanski's psychological horror films, now I like to consider this as his own way of homage to some other maestros of cinemafrom Luis Buñuel to Stanley Kubrick, along with twisted flavors of Polanski to Micahel Hanekethe inspirations were evident in this one hell of a magnificently bizarre, odd movie. With a set of nameless characters & the limited set up of a house in the middle of nowhere, Darren Aronofsky made a total allegorical film that manifest itself into multiple layers of meanings or symbolism including religion, politics, troubled conjugal life dealing with fame & personal will etc. The thing that intrigued me most was whenever I tried to reach an idea of what's it actually about, the twists and turns of events just amazed me over & over againlike Aronofsky was saying 'Why so hurry, my friend? I think there's something more that you may find interesting!' At times while the first half was somewhat like a twisted Hitchcockian thriller directed by Kubrick or Haneke, the second half gradually descends into total chaos & horror which kind of reminded me of the madness of Luis Buñuel's The Exterminating Angel! At the end, you may find an answer to get a relief for a while (like it's all about God Vs Earth Vs Mankind or God & Earth Vs the Mankind) but that may not be the only key to unlock all the doors of confusing & mysterious stuffs happened to that house of strange chaos, triggered by 'few' suspicious guests & the baffled owners.In time, I believe this film will become a cult favorite for the ardent horror fans (at least) and can be regard as Darren Aronofsky's a matchless masterpiece which may going to inspire him to work around more closely to the horror territory in future.",8,3,11,23 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Safe & decent effort, way better than what critiques said.
","Not simply a follow up story of MAN OF STEEL (2013), BvS: DOJ is more of a DC's formal first take to introduce its cinematic universe in a desperate attempt against the continuing huge success of MARVEL's establishments so far. And like Rome, MCU also wasn't built in a day. So, it was a huge task for Snyder & his team to live up to the expectations of finally bringing DCs 2 most beloved & 'World's finest' superheroes together on the screen for the very first time. The stake was high but the wait was long due The movie kicks off with Bruce Wayne's perspective on the destructive battle between Superman & General Zod and his ideology as well as different popular opinions regarding whether our world is ready to deal with such a super powerful & independent man from another planet which have been destroyed already. From that point the whole first half was all about this introduction & build up of all the major characters & the basic plot line of the story. The approach & execution in response to that plan wasn't perfect but at least they didn't rush to show & introduce so many things all together at a time.The second half comes with the most anticipated & 'the greatest gladiator match in history'and that's the best part of the movie, IMO (though they stupidly already gave away most of those scenes in the clips, teasers & trailers officially released online). This was a much better 2nd half than MOS; liked the way they put & justified Lex Luthor's plan behind all this along with his back up plan of introducing a common threat where Gal Gabot as Wonder Woman mostly steals the show. But yeahthere were some aspects that I like to point out as the disappointments or failures. First of all, I didn't get why Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Lex Luthor strangely borrowed elements or character attributes from Batman's pivotal nemesis 'Joker'?! At times it was indeed felt like watching a character blend of Luthor & Joker. Luthor is not only Superman's one of the major villains in the comic book stories who as 'a smart ass evil genius' often carefully team up with other popular & alien bad guys to fight against even the Justice Leaguehis characterization doesn't need to look like smarter or more devilish than what he already is in the comics or animated series. Eisenberg tried too hard here, I guess the responsibility for making him like a 'Lex-Joker-Luthor' mostly goes to the writers. My 2nd disappointment was about the major elements of the popular DC Batman & Superman stories that they borrowed or get influenced by here. Not only the title itself, director Snyder even admitted in numerous interviews while making this movie that Frank Miller's epic THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS would play a major influential role in this movie, which was more than fine enough to digest & enjoy in this very first encounters between the Batsy & the Sup. But the thing that surprised me here when there was another very popular story arc emerges at the very end & heavily impacted the story & the ending. Definitely it wasn't necessary to borrow elements from 2 very fan favorite stories & then blend them together in this very first film of DCCU & the prequel story of JUSTICE LEAGUE; as if DC is running out of time to tell all the great stories at once & catch up with the MARVEL(!). As a whole, the ending was too much off beat & comes so early in the series. Lastly, the way Luthor as 'Frankenstein' launched Doomday herewas merely convincing even for the die hard DC fans! It was like one of those 60s & 70s Hammer's Dracula & Frankenstein story arcswhere sometime a drop of blood was enough for a resurrection! The screenplay was alright but sometime their frantic effort to make every single line sounded like an epic play was evident. Last but not the least, though I was one of those Batfleck haters but kudos to Ben Affleck for giving his best efforts to portray a passable Bruce Wayne & Batman here, as I still think there are much better actors out there to play this most iconic comic book action hero of all time. Loved Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Alfred also, as at times some of his style of dialog delivery & voice work highly reminded me of the greatest horror movie icons of all timeSir Boris Karloff! Overall, Snyder's BvS was a safe & decent effort, nothing much spectacular but at least he didn't ruined it this time like the heavy chaotic ending of MAN OF STEEL; surely it could have been a pure epic extravaganza but still & at least it was better than what I anticipated after all the recent negative reviews from the movie critiques.",8,5,10,25 March 2016
Godzilla," For His Glimpse Only...
","THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT!!! The story centered more around on the MUTO monsters than the big G and though it deliberately tried to follow JAWS steps regarding building up the anticipation & but as a whole couldn't able to become as masterclass of modern celluloid art like the way JAWS (1975) succeeded & become such classic. They were excessively too conscious about showing off the King. And needless to say, the weak character development with a wrong choice of/on lead. It was frustrating to see Bryan Cranston's character's such early departure from the story, he should have take the lead on confronting the monsters or they should have give that lead to a more mature young actor. A.T-Johnson as Ford Brody looked totally blunt throughout the film. CGI was top notch but it was kinda failed to provide any sort of '3D feel' at most of the part. BUT...after of this drawbacks, still I can't say I didn't enjoy Gareth Edwards' GODZILLA. Probably my love for this monster & huge anticipation about this movie were the reasons but I must admit it did satisfied me on many level. Though at times looked kinda mechanical but MUTOs are now amazing new additions to the franchise, looking forward to see them more in coming sequels along side with other legendary friends & foes of Godzilla. And about Godzilla...all I can say is...HAIL TO THE KING! Loved & cherished each & every moment he appeared on the screen & even in the 'TV' news broadcasting sequence! Though the director's JAWS-theory of showing less & building the anticipation for the final pay-off at the end weren't up to the mark but still it kinda worked 'finely' overall & glad he at least put an effort for it which is appreciating from a new filmmaker these days. I'll definitely won't mind to spend excessively higher ticket price for Godzilla again & even to see more of his actions (with freaking astonishing atomic Breath!) in whatever the sequels they're going to make in the future. Perhaps as I was so desperately waiting for a Godzilla movie & my excitement to see him once again after all these years was so on top of my expectation level that I'm now happily ready to forgive & overlook all those negative aspects of this movie. So at the end, it was indeed a visually stunning & satisfying experience for me as a Godzilla fan.",8,1,3,19 May 2014
Spectre," An Unspectacular SPECTRE!
","When QUANTAM OF SOLACE (2008) came out, one of the major complaints was QOS was more of a Jason Bourne flick than Bond. There were too much actions and less of Bond materials in the story. Now in compare to that, if I say this in a short, simple and to the point manner, the news is yesterday I went to the theater with an expectation to see at least a decent, time passing James Bond movie but after spending nearly two & half hour in the theater what I saw...wasn't a Bond flick at all! Daniel Craig's most probably last outing as 007 and Sam Mendes' 2nd consecutive Bond film SPECTRE was nothing but a travesty of a Bond movie! Though it did try to follow the traditional Bond formula in its basic plot line with a great line of cast (wasted!) but from the very beginning all it was able to did was to become something else other than a Bond movie. The most weird thing was, intentionally or not, this time Sam Mendes unnecessarily gave totally an offbeat, dark and strangely depressing mood all over in SPECTRE. At times it was even surprisingly slow and irrationally dragged for a Bond movie. Action sequences were very average and more than that the Bond-momentum was terribly missing from the beginning to the end! As a lifelong 007 fan, it was painful to see when they finally but forcefully put the signature Bond theme at those final last shots, it was like some regular, average action flick just used that soundtrack in the background not only for some weird funny reasons but illegally as well; it was totally out of place. Now the frustrating thing was it actually had some interesting idea but Mendes and his team completely failed to play with them creatively. Now to live up to the expectations of the fans and compete with younger agents like Jason Bourne and Ethan Hunt at the box office, I think it still very much possible to provide a typically entertaining and successful Bond movie by keeping things faithful to its tradition, style and source material but this franchise seriously need some bit more brave and imaginative writers in coming days as well as young and talented directors like James Gunn, Edgar Wright or not sure Guy Ritchie may be.If you still really want to see the unspectacular SPECTRE, better wait for the DVD or skip it. It doesn't worth your time and money at the theater for sure.",4,6,16,6 November 2015
