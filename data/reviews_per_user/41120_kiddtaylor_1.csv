Miracle," Excellent trip back...
","Kurt Russell performed brilliantly as Herb Brooks. I didn't mind the low coverage of the gold medal game cuz the game against the Soviets was 'the game'. And as Al Michaels says in the final seconds against the Soviets, that game WAS the 'Miracle'. I didn't realize just how much of the movie would be centered before the Olympics and Brooks' training techniques...that was interesting to see, especially with them starting out with him trying to get the job. Too bad Brooks missed the movie, even though he lived it. He will definitely be missed!",10,0,0,6 February 2004
