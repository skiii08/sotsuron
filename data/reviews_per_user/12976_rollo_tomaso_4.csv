Requiem for a Dream," Bad Trip
","Keep on playing those mind games forever!  What a wasted of a talented cast giving their all from top to bottom.  But this that wants to prove how hip it is by plotting the most senses-assaulting grizzly death possible for its characters, and the drug trips the audiences are put through are all bad. So, in the end, all this talent is wasted.",1,11,22,16 June 2001
Empire of the Sun," Pretentious and stupid
",Christian Bale is absolutely the most obnoxious lead actor It has ever been my misfortune to watch for three hours -- and he's the BEST part of the film.  This began Spielberg's artistic phase when he started reinventing himself as an artist so he could finally win Academy Awards.  This may have paid off for him but is extraordinarily painful to the audience.  This isn't even worth watching as a joke.  My score: 1 out of 10,1,33,68,9 January 2001
The Caine Mutiny," My third favorite movie of all time
","I watch this movie every time I get a chance.  The acting, top to bottom is superb, especially Robert Francis as Willy Keith, and Van Johnson as Steve Maryk, and of course Bogey as Capt. Queeg, but perhaps the best is Fred McMurray as Tom Keefer.  He is riveting from start to finish.  The entire supporting cast is excellent.  Watch for Jerry Paris in a small but pivotal role as Ensign Harding, and E. G. Marshall as the prosecuting attorney. The photography and direction are absolutely top-notch.  and, the world it creates is every bit as real as the one around us.  Don't miss this truly great film!",10,0,1,20 February 2001
High Fidelity," Tawdry, whiny, and trivial excuse for a comedy
","Obnoxious and insipid John Cusack has an obnoxious and insipid waste of a life in a music store with obnoxious and insipid friends dating obnoxious and vacuous women.  This could easily have been titled, 'The Worst of Seinfeld.'  And, where is Jerry anyway?  Nearly everyone else makes a cameo in Frears' latest exercise in self-importance.  Somehow, he continues to have the PR staff needed to garner decent reviews so he keeps getting work despite complete wastes of time such as this film.",2,3,8,21 September 2000
