Hereditary," Blowing mind story
",The story is solid and unpredictable with many blowing mind twists. Very good acting by lead and supporting cast. Great directing and camera work. Slow pacing with gradually building suspense that lets you enjoy the scenes in the movie. I recommend this movie for big drama and horror lovers as both genres are strongly presented in it. I enjoyed by the depth and the quality of the movie.,9,10,18,17 June 2018
Monster," Amazing movie!
","I consider this movie is a masterpiece!What a brilliant performance by Charlize Theron! I did not expect such performance from her. She proved in this movie that she can not only play fatal beautiful women, she discovers to us a hidden part of her talent.Christina Ricci plays excellently too as she usually does. Besides, I like both these actresses as women very much and that was maybe first time in my life when I found that love between two women can be beautiful and exciting!I highly recommend seeing this unforgettable movie!P.S. Watching this movie and a wish to express myself made me to register on this excellent website.",10,0,1,13 December 2004
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," One the best movies in romantic comedy genre
","This romantic comedy is perfectly shot, directed and edited. The movie is about a young composer, Peter Bretter (Jason Segel), whose girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), dumps him and Peter falls into a heavy depression. Trying to escape the depression he travels to Hawaii and surprisingly meets Sarah and her new boyfriend, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), at same hotel he stays. Peter decides not to change the hotel anyway and trying to meet people and hang out as he can that is not easy because his ex is around and having romantic time with another guy that of course hurts. However, Peter meets a pretty girl Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) at the hotel front desk and they become romantically involved. Peter falls into Rachel... The casting of the movie is top notch. Especially I want to note the quartet of leading characters Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Aldous Snow and Mila Kunis. Jason Segel brings excellent performance. I became immediately sympathetic to his character. Jason actually contributed a lot to this move by writing the script and the soundtrack for it. Music in the move is lovely.Russell Brand who plays a singer in the movie, performs a few singles in the move with quite unique style that I did not get at first but then I loved it. I happened not to know actress Mila Kunis till this movie. This gorgeous actress with big beautiful eyes impressed me, not to mention her great performance. Overall this movie is one the best movies in romantic comedy genre. The movie combines lead character drama, funny and interesting plot and great soundtrack. I highly recommend watching the move to the genre lovers.In the end I'd like to post the sad and beautiful Peter Bretter depression song from the movie (How could I not feel sympathy to the guy?): Everybody hates you.Everybody wishes that you were dead. Peter you suck. Peter you suck.Peter your music is f*ing terrible. Peter you suck, Peter you suck. You don't do anything of value. Peter you suck. Go write some music. But instead you sit and write these bullshit songs. It's so self-loathing.Go see a psychiatrist. I hate the psychiatrist. Go see one anyway. :)",8,1,6,6 April 2009
300," visually excellently done work, but the plot is poor
","I'm a bit disappointed by this movie. I expected more after I saw the trailers. The movie visually entertained me, but hasn't touched my feelings. The movie really lacks deep and entertaining story along with characters development. I haven't felt that this is a real movie Â– it's just a comics adoption and, unfortunately, you have to treat it this way. I've never been a fan of comics, maybe that's why the movie didn't impress me much. Other movies in this genre such as Gladiator or Troy kick this movie ass easy, in my opinion. However, visually this movie looks beautifully. Cinematography is done excellently. You will see Matrix-like effects of moving camera. I saw the digital version of this movie and counting the visual beauty of this movie I suggest see it digitized. The backgrounds in the movie are really catching eye. They are enjoyable. Every single shot detail in the picture looks sharp, bright and beautifully art-designed. Make-up on actors is excellently done as well. Rock music in the movie during the battles really rocks! But in my opinion the music could be more aggressive to correspond to the movie's brutality.Overall, I give to the movie 8 of 10 supporting visually excellently done work.",8,0,2,15 March 2007
Alien: Covenant," Long waited new authentic Alien movie arrived
","I have been waiting for authentic continuation of Alien story since Aliens (1986). I'm glad that this movie was the one.Here is what I like and not so much in this movie:The pros:-The story. The story was interesting to watch and kept me glued to the screen. I liked the pace of the movie. The move had a balanced combination of dialog, fight scenes, planet exploration scenes. It did not look neither forced nor stretched - just right.-The characters. Many of them are easily likable. The character development maybe not perfect, but it works for me. I see that characters were selected carefully: they are different and look like real people.-The sound. I watched the movie in IMAX. I was impressed by realistic and deep sound of the guns. -The music. The music composed with respect to original Alien and Aliens. It has music elements its predecessors and this works well on integrity of this movie within Alien franchise.-Fight scenes. The fights are intense, dynamic and well- orchestrated. Many of them have some jump scare moments.-Visual design. The visuals are great. The ship design inside out, the habituated planet - all look rich and bright.The cons:-One of the main protagonist in the movie is Daniels (Katherine Waterston). The actress plays her role well. However, her makeup and haircut are very awkward, and this is a miss. If they wanted her to look like Ripley, the attempt failed.-Ridley Scott, like in his Prometheus, selects main hero to be a woman that automatically makes us comparing her to Ripley. It is sad to say that Ripley easily wins this comparison: her performance and character are one of a kind.10/10",10,8,21,22 May 2017
