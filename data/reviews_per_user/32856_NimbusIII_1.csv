Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Brilliant Art!!!
","I love this film. As a militant film fanatic, and fan, I defy anyone who knows anything about film, movies, and entertainment in general, to state that this is not a great film. Tarantino knows how to make a movie! I found the screenplay for this film to be so powerful and well written, that I haven't been able to enjoy any movie I've seen in the theater since. Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 are a breath of fresh air amid stinky, overbloated, cinema of Hollywood today.I can't wait for Tarantino's next project.",10,0,1,13 June 2004
