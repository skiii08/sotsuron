Raiders of the Lost Ark," Adventure DOES have a name!
","THIS MUST BE THE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Indiana Jones' first film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, made in 1981.  Featuring amazing acting, state-of-the-art special effects, a very memorable soundtrack and a great plot, this movie will entertain people for generations to come.  I love this film! 'It's just a priceless medallion Marion, you going to give it to me or not?'The priceless part is wrong, but the Medallion part, yes. This is definately a golden idol of films.  Every even remote movie fan should see this.  WHAT an amazing film!  RENT IT!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!'Trust me.'",Null,0,0,17 August 2001
Caddyshack," The best comedy film ever!
","Here is the funniest film of all time...Caddyshack!  A must-see for movie fans and moviegoers, with Chevy Chase as a silly Buddhist-golfer, Rodney Dangerfield (his best) as a has-it-all millionaire, Ted Knight as a snobby club-owner, Michael O'Keefe as a boy making life decisions, Bill Murray as a stupid gopher-killing greenskeeper, and Mr. Gopher as himself.  Great music, funny.  See it now!",Null,0,0,11 August 2001
The Cannonball Run," A very funny film, laugh-a-minute!
","The Cannonball Run...one of the funniest films of all time!  I dare say that this ranks 2nd to Caddyshack as far as funny goes.  Featuring one of my favorite (and most funniest) movie characters ever...HIM!  A must-see for moviegoers, Burt Reynolds is great, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin are hilarious, and Roger Moore is very funny.  Rent it at your local video store!",Null,0,1,16 August 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'Junior! Junior?'
","Dunt-duh-da, dunt-duh-da-da da!  INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE!  The most popular of the Indiana Jones series (around non-movie freaks) introduces a young Indy (played by River Phoenix) and his bumbling father, played wonderfully by Sean Connery.  Finally, 5 years after the inferior INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, disappointed Indy Jones fans walked back into the theater to see this wonderful entry in the Indiana Jones series.  Great for a family movie, but rated PG-13. But, is this the last Indiana Jones crusade? The world may never know...",Null,0,0,27 November 2001
