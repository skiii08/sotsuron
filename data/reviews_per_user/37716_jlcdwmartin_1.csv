Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Lincoln by Norman Rockwell, and on film
","In the documentaries 'Lincoln: Trial by Fire' and 'Lincoln's Last Night', and the movie 'Abraham Lincoln' starring Walter Huston (in the five documentary collection by Mill Creek Entertainment), there is plenty of 'tightly corseted' historical accuracy.Too often in historical films, Lincoln has been portrayed as a stiff-backed academic.In 'Vampire Hunter', it can be said that the historical personages are portrayed in a much more human (pardon the pun) vein.Enjoy the twist on history. Enjoy 'Hunter' as a really 'fun', somewhat historically accurate horror movie. Good night. Pleasant dreams! Or, to phrase it classically:'We are such stuff as dreams are made of, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.' -- Shakespeare, 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'",10,1,2,18 May 2017
