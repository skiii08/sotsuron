Ford v Ferrari," An exhilarating ride!
","James Mangold is a great director and has given us amazing films like Walk the Line and his last film Logan which has impressed us immensely. His newest film, Ford v Ferrari, is another entertaining and well made film that adds to Mangold's filmography.Ford v Ferrari tells the story of car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles who build a race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 hour race known as Le Mans in 1966.This movie is one of the best of the year which audiences and car enthusiasts will enjoy throughout. You can tell how much care and effort was put into this project once you watch the film. The racing sequences were really well shot and a blast to witness. None of it felt fake or seemed like a CGI fest because of how practical everything seemed. It must have been really difficult to film those scenes but the crew pulled it off beautifully. The overall look of the movie was gorgeous. It really captured the essence of the time period this film is set in which contributed to the authenticity of everything shown.The acting from everyone was amazing. Matt Damon gives a solid performance and his partner in crime, Christian Bale, also provides the same result. Both stars have great chemistry with each other and are a joy to see. Jon Bernthal was also great as well as the rest of the supporting cast.The film clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes but it didn't feel like that all. The first half did drag a little bit as it mainly consisted of business meetings and proposals but it doesn't affect the pacing much. Once the racing starts, the time flies. James Mangold does an excellent job directing especially during the racing scenes which flowed well and was easy to watch. He adds a level of intensity to them through the visuals rather than using loud music or crazy slo-mo which I admire. The screenplay had great moments of character and a surprising amount of funny dialogues. Not once did it feel boring.I have to admit I wasn't expecting Ford v Ferrari to be THIS good! The characters were engaging, the acting was spot on, the races felt intense and the aesthetics were great. If this film were to be nominated at the Oscars, I wouldn't mind. Hats off to everyone who worked on the movie as they gave it their all.",9,3,6,17 November 2019
Requiem for a Dream," Not for the faint-hearted!
","Darren Aronofsky is one of the craziest filmmakers working today. His latest film, mother!, was crazy but Requiem for a Dream was on another level.Requiem for a Dream follows four characters and the effect their drug addiction has on their physical and mental state.When the credits started rolling, I was in a state of shock and horror. I don't think a movie has left me feeling so disturbed. I breathed a sigh of relief as this film gives an experience that's completely anxiety inducing. This is most certainly a film NOT for the faint-hearted.The way Aronofsky handles this film is perfection. We start with each character at the best point of their life and then see their addiction slowly spiral out of control over the course of the runtime makes the film engaging from start to finish and shows Aronofsky as a master of build up. The camerawork and editing is very stylish and fast paced, not allowing you to take a breather at any given moment. The quick edits and close-ups puts the audience into the state of mind of each character creating a more terrifying and immersive experience. The soundtrack is also great. It's filled with music that's ominous which fits the tone perfectly.What makes the film even more horrifying are the fantastic actors on-screen. Jennifer Connelly delivers a solid performance for a role that requires a lot from her and Jared Leto proves to me he's a capable actor with a powerhouse performance here. Marlon Wayans really surprised me as I'm used to seeing him in comedies and I wish he would take on more serious roles as this film shows his talent. However, the winning performance here was done by the excellent Ellen Burstyn. Especially for her age, her role was very challenging and demanding and she gave the performance of a lifetime here. It's sad she didn't win an Oscar for it.If there's ever a film that deters you from taking drugs, it's Requiem for a Dream. It's definitely a challenging watch but if you're up for it, I would highly recommend it.",10,1,1,29 June 2020
It," Lives up to the 1990 mini-series
","I liked the 1990 It mini-series. The adult part wasn't good but I always found the child portion to be fascinating so it's great to see another good adaptation of the first half of It.The film follows a group of kids, known as The Losers Club, who try to get rid of a monster that frequently takes form of a clown and feeds off the kids of Derry.Straight off the bat, I thought the acting overall was really good. Whenever I see a child actor in a film, I'm always worried about their performance since it can be over the top or not good at all but thankfully this wasn't the case. All the child performances were really good. Each character felt relatable and so I could connect with them. All the kids played off each other which made their chemistry seem believable. Bill Skarsgard had a lot to live up to since Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise was the best part of the mini-series and I found Skarsgard to be sublime. His take on Pennywise was very scary. Every time he was on screen I could feel a strong sense of threat. It wasn't just the effects that made him scary because his expression alone gave creepy and unsettling vibes.Visually, this film looks great. Andy Muschietti's direction is really good. The movie is shot well and the cinematography portrayed the 80s just like how it would be. The writing was pretty good. We learnt a lot about each character and this made me want to root for them more. I thought the character of Henry Bowers was well realised and it made sense as to why he acts as a bully. I wish the character of Mike was more developed though since we don't see or learn much about him.As for complaints, I didn't like the overuse of jumpscares sprinkled throughout the film's entirety. It took away some of the fear and scare aspects of the film. The sewer scene would have been much more effective and creepy without the use of a jumpscare. It would have felt more terrifying if they scared the audience visually rather than a loud noise which makes you jolt for a few seconds.Aside from that, this is a well made Stephen King adaptation. For me, this is on par or even better than the first half of the mini-series. I look forward to see how Muschietti handles the adult segment of It and his future films.",7,0,0,3 September 2019
Hereditary," What true horror is really like
","Hereditary is undoubtedly one of the best horror films I've seen.Horror is a genre that's really looked down upon. It's a very subjective genre and depends upon what scares you. For me, personally, I think Hereditary is one of the scariest films made. I've heard a lot of negative reception about this film where people claim it was boring or not scary. This comes back to when I mentioned how horror is subjective. However, it also made me realise that some people have truly forgotten what horror actually is.Hereditary is Ari Aster's first feature length movie. As I was watching this I knew that this man has a strong passion for his craft. The opening scene alone proved to me how masterful his direction is. Everyone in this movie is downright amazing particularly the performance of Toni Collette which is her career's best and oscarworthy. Her acting as Annie in some of the scenes seem so raw and heartwrenching and makes the film extremely difficult to watch. The cinematography and music work so well together to create an eerie and uncomfortable setting throughout that fully immerses you.The first half of the film is slow but at the same time it's investing as we learn more about each character and their descent into madness. This brings me back to people forgetting what horror is. Nowadays some people go to horror films to get scared instead of watching it for the characters and story. Whilst Hereditary doesn't have cheap tatics to scare people like jumpscares, it uses the idea of family drama, mental illness and people losing their sanity which I believe is truly disturbing. Even though the movie contains creepy imagery and goes supernatural at times, Aster balances each of these themes perfectly. There are images still in my head of some of the events that take place and thinking about them really disturbs me.Honestly, Hereditary is one of the most disturbing films I've seen. There are some definite jaw-dropping moments especially during the last 20 minutes of the films where it becomes unimaginably insane. The outstanding direction by Ari Aster as well as the music and cinematography contribute to the terrifying atmosphere and makes your skin crawl.I would highly recommend this to people who really love horror and movies. However the slow-burn treatment won't work for everyone.",10,3,6,20 June 2019
John Wick," Mindblowing action!
","Action films nowadays have been a joke. Aside from the Mission: Impossible series, there hasn't been one where the action makes you extremely excited or grip the edge of your seat. Luckily, we have John Wick to show us how action is really done.John Wick is a hit-man who is in retirement but some gangsters take away everything he loves which forces him to come out of retirement and hunt them down.John Wick has a very basic plot. It's a revenge story that's been done many times and hence why its story doesn't feel very innovative but what sells this film is the ACTION! As directors this is Chad Stahelski and David Leitch's first film and they've done an exceptional job. As both of them are stuntmen it's logical for them to know a lot about action and it's evident from this film that they do. Each sequence has a stylish flair present within them and each kill is different from the other which makes this movie so entertaining to watch. The choreography and camerawork is simply perfect. There are some long takes used during the action which increases the intensity of the scene and keeps your adrenaline flowing.This film is filled with action which never ventures into boredom. This is largely due to the fantastic direction and extraordinary commitment by Keanu Reeves. After The Matrix, Keanu Reeves's career did go downhill. He needed something huge to bring him back into the Hollywood scene and John Wick did exactly that. Reeves is perfect for this role. He is the definition of awesome as he possesses this swagger that's present in each scene. His commitment to the action is praiseworthy. You can tell that he's doing most of the stunts rather than having a stuntman to do it for him. It conveys to us how much he cared about this film.Whilst the story is very predictable, the film does do a great job of showing us who John Wick is. Throughout the movie we learn how powerful this man was in the underworld before his retirement. We see how many people are associated with him and the film repeatedly shows how fearful people are towards him which portrays how unstoppable John Wick is.Overall, John Wick is one of the best action films made. The USP of this movie is its action and there is plently scattered across this movie. Keanu Reeves does a fantastic job as John Wick and I praise his dedication towards the film's stunts. If you want to have an exhilarating experience for 1 hour and 40 minutes then John Wick is the film for you.",8,0,1,31 December 2019
Se7en," Bleak, thrilling and crafted to perfection
","David Fincher's Se7en isn't just your ordinary detective investigating murders and trying to catch the killer film. It's much more than that. What makes this movie really stand out from the rest is the impeccible direction by Fincher and unpredicable nature of Andrew Kevin Walker's script.Se7en is the story of two detectives who investigate murders committed by a serial killer who uses each of the Seven Deadly Sins to kill his victims.After Alien 3, which Fincher doesn't consider as his film, Fincher creates a film that's jarring, disturbing and leaves a bad feeling in your stomach. His use of dark, ugly colours uplifts the depressing tone and the sound design makes Se7en feel as close as possible to reality. This film isn't one to forget easily. What sticks with you is the film's underlying message about the sadistic and violent nature of our world. How crime is rampant within each city. All of this is shown visually which makes me admire the way David Fincher helmed the movie.I loved how far Se7en went in terms of its content. The aftermath of the murders are disgusting and give you the feeling of throwing up. The filmmakers didn't shy away from all the gore and this made me appreciate the film even more. In spite of the investigation taking up most of the film, there are some great character building moments as well. The scene taking place at a bar and the dinner scene strengthens the bond between our two leads and help us learn more about their personalities. These scenes made me genuinely care about Pitt and Freeman and that feeling made the ending seem even more shocking than what it originally was.Aside from the aesthetics, the acting here is simply superb. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt create wonders together. Their acting seems really believable and elevates every scene they're in. The killer, I won't mention who, surprised me when he showed up and for the short amount of time he's in the film, he steals the show. His motivation is well realised and well though out which makes his character fleshed out and someone who'll make you think deeply regarding the cruel state of the world.Se7en is a total winner and one of the best mystery thrillers to have ever been made. Everything is done to perfection and it wouldn't have been done without the direction, acting and screenplay. Se7en will get under your skin and stay there for a really long time.",10,1,2,4 October 2019
Fight Club," I have to break the first two rules!
","It's been a while since I've seen this film but I cannot keep quiet any longer. I have to talk about Fight Club!Fight Club is about an insomniac office worker and a soapmaker who create an underground fight club which slowly evolves into something bigger and catastrophic.This was on my watchlist for the longest time and I cannot believe how long it took me to finally see this insane film. I expected Fight Club to be an extremely violent venture but what I got was something deeper and psychological and loved every second of it. Having a director like David Fincher work on a film like this is a massive blessing. His way of directing is something else. The film looks absolutely stunning with its murky and dark colour palette which sets the tone and style perfectly. The screenplay by Jim Uhls is fantastic. It's filled with some of the most memorable and witty dialogue I've heard as well as one of the best twists ever put into a film. It's one I felt I shoud've seen coming but it really took me by surprise. Then thinking back to everything that happened before makes the twist so obvious and believableYes, this film is really violent but that's not what it focuses on. Fight Club presents us with many underlying themes and commentary such as hypermasculinity, death, isolation, he consumer-driven society we live in and more. It's ideas thicken and get complex as the film goes on which is why it's been on my mind for a long time. It's a film I would love to watch again and again to analyse its meanings further.Aside from Fincher's direction and Uhls's screenplay, the performances are what make this film special. Brad Pitt gives an outstanding performance. One that'll be remembered for a really long time. He brings the character of Tyler Durden to life and owns every scene he's in. Edward Norton gives his breakthrough performance here and it's the best I've ever seen of him. I did not expect Helena Bonham Carter to do a role like this but she pulled it off really well.Fight Club is a very unique film. The film gave us some of the most memorable characters, Oscarworthy performances, an engaging and unpredictable plot as well as one of the best twists in film history. David Fincher can mark this as another success in his book and let's hope Tyler Durden doesn't come after me for breaking his rules.",10,0,0,3 May 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Bloody sensational!!!
","Quentin Tarantino is one of those few directors who never had a misstep. I haven't seen all his films but from the ones I've seen, I could tell that this man had a huge talent and passion for cinema. Once again, he stands his ground.Inglourious Basterds is about a group of Jewish American soldiers who plan to assassinate the Nazi rulers in France during World War II. At the same time, a cinema owner plans for the assassination as well.What I love about Tarantino's films, aside from the violence, is the characters and dialogues to go along with them. This film has all of that and more. It's hard for me to say which spot Inglourious Basterds takes compared to the rest of Tarantino's filmography but I'm certain that it'll be high up.Just everything in this film is done so well that you're in constant awe at what you're witnessing. The opening scene alone had me transfixed to the screen. What really sold me were the constant interactions between characters. Majority of the film is dialogue driven rather than gory, over the top violence which is what I loved. I enjoyed listening to the conversations each character since they defined what kind of person they were. If you consider watching this movie just because of the violence then you may be disappointed. The film does have Tarantino's repetitive use of violence but this film mainly revolves around the characters.The acting overall was solid. Brad Pitt and his team of 'Basterds' were entertaining to watch. They all worked well together and some of the comedic scenes were really funny. As soon as you find out what his team are all about, you immediately root for them based on the entire premise of the movie. The same can be said about Mélanie Laurent. As the movie takes place during a time of unimaginable cruelty and savagery, you want to see these people emerge victorious. However, the best part of this film is undoubtedly Christoph Waltz. He is so good in this movie. I have to praise him a lot because his dialogue delivery was immaculate. You hate his character but at the same time you enjoy seeing him. Tarantino deserves a lot of praise as well since the lines he wrote for Waltz seemed so intriguing. Waltz's expression and tone made his role feel believable. You're not meant to cheer for him but you do anyway.The direction is brilliant. If you're familiar with Tarantino's work then this shouldn't come as a surprise. The use of violence was handled really well. The violence wasn't there for just looks. Every time you see it, it has a sense of purpose. The pacing was well done. I couldn't believe how fast 2 hours 30 minutes went by.Inglourious Basterds is definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's best works. There are some great memorable characters and performances from everyone involved. The dialogue is phenomenal and above all, it's a blast to watch.",9,0,3,6 September 2019
Knives Out," A great rejuvenation of the murder mystery genre
","Rian Johnson is a fantastic director. Even though many criticise him for ruining Star Wars with The Last Jedi, he has proven his skill in previous films like Looper. His new film Knives Out may be his best.Knives Out follows Benoit Blanc, a detective hired to solve the mysterious death of Harlan Thrombey, the patriarch of the eccentric and conflicting Thrombey family.I'm a big fan of the murder mystery genre so I was obviously very excited to this and the ensemble cast increased my anticipation. Rian Johnson has very cleverly and skilfully put together a fantastic homage to the 'whodunnit' genre. The film has a very old fashioned feeling to it, despite its modern aspects, that is reminiscent of murder mysteries from the 1900s and the Clue board game. The set design, cinematography and costumes built up this incredible atmosphere to the time it's set in.One of the best parts of this movie is the cast. Everyone did a fantastic job as their characters and played off one another exceptionally well. Daniel Craig, with his Southern accent, was really funny at times and his acting was really good especially during the third act. For me, personally, I thought the standout was Ana de Armas. She plays a crucial role in this story and this is the best I've seen her act.Rian Johnson's direction is fantastic throughout as he incorporates a range of style to each shot but it's not just style over substance as his script is witty, hilarious and keeps you invested through the film's entirety. His take of this genre is vastly different from whodunnits in the past which made the experience better in my opinion as I constantly doubted myself on what direction the film was taking.A character I felt was really underutilized was that of Jaeden Martell since he does not contribute much to the film compared to the rest of the cast. Apart from that I don't have any other complaints regarding this film.Knives Out is a really fun time at the theatre. Just the premise of a whodunnit is interesting enough to watch but Rian Johnson's amazing direction, script and ensemble cast make this film shine and unique from previous whodunnits in the past. This is definitely my favourite film of his and cannot wait to see what other ideas he comes up with. Knives Out is one of the best films of the year.",8,7,18,8 December 2019
The Irishman," A dream come true!!!
","Scorsese has always been one of my favourite directors. His films are simply spectacular and I always look forward to what he brings next. When I heard that he was revisiting the mob and crime genre I was thrilled but when I heard that it starred De Niro, Pacino and Pesci my excitement went through the roof. Having seen it, I can confirm that this is one of the best films of the year.The Irishman follows the life of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver, who gets involved with the Bufalino crime family and Teamster Jimmy Hoffa.It felt so good seeing a Martin Scorsese film after a long time. Goodfellas is one of my favourite films of all time so to see another crime mob film with three legends in the lead roles was just a dream come true. However if you're expecting something like Goodfellas, you may be disappointed because The Irishman is very different compared to it. This movie takes its time. It takes its time by fleshing out the characters and creating the feeling of that time period. A lot of the film is dialogue heavy which, by no means, is a bad thing because writer Steven Zaillian brings this world and its characters to life through it.The dialogue is constantly investing and does not get boring at any point. You are sold on the fact that these are real people and not actors portraying them which goes to show how strong everyone's performance is but it also shows the talent Zaillian and Scorsese possess as both are able to keep the story and its people interesting through the film's 3 hour 30 minute runtime. Scorsese's direction is mesmerizing. There is no particular style to it but then again it did not have to have one as the film itself is quite old fashioned. He once again proves to us why he's the best in the business.The acting is outstanding. This is De Niro's best perfomance in a long time and the same goes for Pacino. It felt incredible to see Joe Pesci acting in a film after his retirement. All three had amazing chemistry with one another and it's sad to think that this may be the first and last time we ever see these three together in a Scorsese film. The supporting actors Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel and many more were also great in their roles. The CGI used on the actors may be distracting at first glance but as you learn more and more about the story and its characters, the CGI becomes seamless and less of a distraction.The music used is also very appropriate for the time period the film is set in as it creates a wonderful atmosphere to the movie. As mentioned before, the film is shot beautifully but the final shot is one that is quite thought provoking. It really made me think a lot about the many themes the film presents itself with.The only problem I had was to do with Anna Paquin's character. Her character plays a big part in De Niro's character arc but I felt it was not explored as deeply as I wanted it to be.All in all, The Irishman is a fantastic film. Scorsese has given another film that will definitely win some Oscars next year. It felt really refreshing to see a mob film this well executed with three absolute legends acting alongside each other.",9,10,20,30 November 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee's return to form
","BlacKkKlansman for the most part was good. I was impressed with the way Spike Lee handled the film considering his last few ventures didn't work out. This was a film I could tell he really cared about.The overall presentation of the movie was great. It was well shot and had some great cinematography. The soundtrack, in particular, got me into the mood of the film. The main theme, to this day, is very catchy and still playing in my head on loop.This was the first time I witnessed John David Washington act and I felt he did full justice to his role and played it off really well. Adam Driver was also fantastic and hilarious in many parts of the film. His chemistry with Washington felt believable. Topher Grace was great as well. The acting overall was solid.I liked Lee's approach to the film. Whilst trying to spread awareness of themes like racism, Lee mixes the seriousness of this issue with some lighthearted humour which kept me invested with these characters. Whilst I did feel the story was predictable and knew what direction the film was taking towards the 3rd act, I didn't lose interest due to the subject matter and interactions between each character. I also thought the film was a bit too long. If around 15-20 minutes were trimmed off the runtime, then it would have been more smoother.All in all, BlacKkKlansman was a decent film. It may have not surprised me but it was a fun experience which you can take a lot away from. I'm happy Spike Lee is back into his territory and hope he continues to make good films more like this.",7,0,4,17 July 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A different take on Spider-Man
","WARNING: *SPOILERS*Spider-Man: Homecoming was quite surprising. I didn't expect Marvel to take a route like this with a superhero like Spider-Man but I'm glad they did.What I instantly loved about the movie was how relatable of a character Peter Parker was. We see his school life, his school crush and his normal life rather putting too much focus on the action scenes with Spider-Man. Peter Parker has a very innocent and awkward personality which connects the audience to his character and makes us want to root for him even more. In spite of this, some people may find the movie boring because of lack of action scenes and heavy focus on Peter Parker rather than Spider-Man.The acting overall was solid. Tom Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man is very well done especially in a scene where Peter feels genuinely scared that he may die. The emotion given by Holland felt so real and suited his character perfectly. Michael Keaton as the Vulture was great to watch but I feel they could have developed his character a bit more. Jacob Batalon, who played Peter's best friend, was hilarious. A lot of his jokes land and reaction to finding out that Peter Parker is Spider-Man felt like how someone would react in real life.The action scenes were fine but I kept on noticing how incompetent the direction was during it. The very last action sequence was a bit hard to see due to the shaky camerawork.Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fun watch. I loved the new take on Spider-Man's character. Tom Holland gave a terrific performance and the lighthearted humour and action kept me entertained.",7,0,1,25 July 2019
Shutter Island," You may go insane...
","Martin Scorsese is a director who I've always respected. All the films that I have seen of his are outstanding. Shutter Island proves why he's such a talented director.Back in 2010 when Shutter Island came out, it only got mildly positive reviews and didn't really win many awards which is something I don't understand. This movie is a gem that is equally interesting and intense.The cinematography in this movie is great. This is a movie which requires the full attention of the audience. When I saw this movie, especially on my second viewing, I noticed many clever hidden clues and details that were so purposeful to the main storyline. The music is really good. It forms this ominous notion that leaves a cold feeling in your stomach.Our main star, Leonardo DiCaprio, gave one of the finest peformances of his career. DiCaprio invoked a variety of emotions to his character which made us really care about him. Mark Ruffalo was also really good but I felt that if someone else would've done his role, they might've done a better job. Ben Kingsley gave a really good performance as well. Michelle Williams is such a good actress and she shows it here. The level of depth and emotion she brings out to her short but meaningful role is incredible. She is terrific here.Having seen the movie twice, my appreciation towards this film grew a lot. The writer, Laeda Kalogridis, did the source material justice. Her script brought so many twists and turns to the plot that I had completely no idea where the film was headed. I loved the sense of ambiguity given to the story and its characters as it made the ending of the film much more surprising. The screenplay along with Scorsese's direction made it feel larger than life. Scorsese used this script and his approach to directing it was marvellous. The atmosphere created throughout is consistent. There is a constant sense of intensity and suspense lurking within each shot. As the film progresses, it starts to get more insane and this feeling of insanity is what goes through your and Teddy Daniels' mind. This allows us to relate to Daniels and be with him on a personal level. There are many subtleties that are included in the framing of the shot which Scorsese purposely implemented. That's what makes Shutter Island a smart film.If you watch the movie once, you may notice a few editing errors. However, after seeing it again, you perceive those errors in a different perspective and realise that there is a reasoning for it. That's the beauty of Shutter Island. Each viewing gets better and better as you discover more and more. If you haven't seen this movie, I urge you now to go see it as soon as possible.",9,1,2,10 August 2019
The Revenant," One of the most visually stunning films made!
","Alejandro G. Iñárritu is back with The Revenant after the masterpiece that was Birdman and this is one of the most stunning films I've seen.Iñárritu returns with a brutal revenge drama set in the 1800s where we see Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) trying to find the man who left him for dead.Hands down, this is one of the most visually breathtaking films you will ever see. The choice of utilising natural lighting instead of studio lights really paid off. The gorgeous cinematography is amazing to look upon and full immerses you into this world. DiCaprio delivers a phenomenal performance as Hugh Glass and his expressions fully convey the pain he's going through. He definitely deserved that Oscar. Tom Hardy is amazing as the selfish and despicable Fitzgerald. Not for one moment do you think of the actors during this movie as they're so believable as these characters.You can tell Iñárritu was very passionate about this project since his direction and choice of shots are incredible. He uses a lot of long shots, especially during the intense action scenes, to really portray the rawness and realism of this world. There are some scenes in the movie which I have literally no idead how the crew did it. The violence is very brutal but not over the top in any way. Iñárritu makes the violence seem convincing through his long shots and not shying away from any of the brutalilty shown. The costumes and makeup are very fitting for the time period which further adds to the realism.My only problem is that the plot is predictable and the runtime is a bit too long but the impressive cinematography, direction and acting makes up for it for me to say this is one of the best revenge survival films made. I praise everyone who contributed to this film as it is something to be proud of.I definitely recommend this movie! This is something that cannot be missed.",9,1,3,17 June 2019
The Shining," Horror can't get better than this
","Stanley Kubrick has been a filmmaker whose work has influenced many countless films and set a huge change within the industry. Each and every one of his movies has affected a lot of present and aspiring filmmakers but his most notable work, The Shining, was ground-breaking!To this day people talk about this movie because of how convoluted the storyline is. This movie brings out one of the most tension filled, nail biting and horrifying experiences. Everything in this film is top notch. Kubrick's direction is amazing. His way of visual storytelling was like no other. The film begins with these gorgeous aerial shots of the scenery that make you feel you are there. The shot selection added a lot to the continuous eerie atmosphere. It's saddening to know how negative the reception was when the film initially came out. I mean Kubrick was even nominated for Worst Director at the Razzies.The editing in this film is sharp. Not once do feel bored or have any intention of turning the film off. The film builds up a constant sense of dread and mystery which fully engrosses you and never lets your eyes off the screen. Aside from Kubrick's direction, the other aspect which made me shudder throughout was the haunting score. The music is used in a very meticulous way. Not once does it feel cheaply used to get a scare out of the audience. Each scene involving the music contributes to the harrowing atmosphere and insinuates an even darker feeling to the environment.The performances in this movie are perfect. Words cannot describe how genuine and phenomenal Jack Nicholson's acting is. This is probably the best performance of his entire career. Shelley Duvall is incredible as well. She is consistently devastated. Her performance brings out the right amount of vulnerability to her character that we whole heartedly care for her. Young Danny Lloyd gives one of the best child performances I've ever seen.Even though Stephen King hated Kubrick's adaptation of his book, many consider this to be the best horror film made. The ending of this movie is equally shocking and thought provoking. After 39 years, film lovers still create crazy theories about what the ending might suggest.Thank you Stanley Kubrick for giving us this gem of a film.",10,1,1,14 August 2019
Face_Off," Highly entertaining but quite silly
","John Woo's Face/Off is a classic amongst the many action films made in Hollywood. This movie belongs to the 90s. It's a movie that is very entertaining to watch but has quite a few flaws in terms of its storyline.Face/Off follows Sean Archer, an FBI agent who goes through a surgery to look like the criminal Castor Troy in order to stop an attack on the city. However, trouble ensues when Castor Troy takes on the look of Sean Archer.Let me start off with the acting as that is the most credible part of the movie. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are solid throughout. It's not easy to play two very contrasting personalities but both of them make it look extremely simple. Without Travolta and Cage, this film wouldn't be as entertaining. All the other supporting actors do justice to their roles as well.John Woo's direction is good but it could definitely be better. Majority of the time, Woo's direction is really good but the area where he falters is the shootout scenes. During the shootout segments you can tell something is going on but you don't what since you don't directly see the action taking place. There is just a lot of quick cutting and shots of guns being fired. In the final action sequence you can tell where a stunt double has been used instead of the actors. There were some errors as well during the action scenes. In one scene where Castor shoots an agent, you can see the wire being used to move the agent backwards. A lot of films have errors like this but they aren't as visible as the ones in Face/Off.The actual storyline of this film is very creative and unique but parts of it doesn't make sense. Both actors have a very different physique so how do they change their body structure so quickly after the surgery? The surgical procedure itself would take a long time to recover from but the film shows an instant recovery. Like this, there are quite a lot of plot holes within the script.Face/Off isn't a perfect film. In fact it's nowhere near one. The entire premise has a lot of areas that aren't patched up but what sells this movie is the ridiculous action scenes and impeccible acting from Travolta and Cage.",7,0,1,19 August 2019
Dunkirk," It made me feel like I was in the moment
","Every time Christopher Nolan makes a film, I get excited. He is a filmmaker who has made countless classics and possesses a lot of creativity. It's interesting to see him make a war film like Dunkirk and after watching it, I wish I witnessed it in a cinema.Dunkirk recounts the extraordinary event where soldiers from Britain, France and Belgium are trying to get evacuated from Dunkirk whilst being surrounded by the Germans.If there's one thing you can be sure of when going into a Nolan film is that the film is going to be a cinematic experience. I really regret missing Dunkirk at the cinemas and watching it in IMAX because this film is a technical achievement. I love Nolan's usage of practical effects in all of his movies. It shows how much he cares about realism in his films. Dunkirk uses real boats, real planes and thousands of extras to make this event look as authentic as possible. I couldn't stop marvelling at how amazing this film looked. The camerawork was absolutely incredible. There are a lot of beautiful shots and it wasn't too shaky.The sound design and sound editing were fantastic. The spitfire scenes looked so real and the sound they made whilst firing didn't seem unrealistic at all. The editing is very tight. This is one of Nolan's shorter films but that's not a bad thing because it doesn't waste time or overstay its welcome. Right from the beginning you are in the moment and doesn't give you any time to breathe until the end. Hans Zimmer gives us another impactful score that heightens the tension during every scene.A major complaint will be the lack of character. This film follows three different perspectives of the event but there isn't anyone you feel a personal connection with. That is the only flaw I can pick out. I would have loved to connect with someone particularly but it's important to remember that Dunkirk is about the event and not the people. During an event like this, it wouldn't feel right for characters to talk about themselves or their family since their main priority is surviving. I feel all the actors involved conveyed the intensity of the situation and fear of survival through their expressions.Dunkirk was a riveting experience. It's a humongous spectacle that's makes you feel like you're there with the rest of the soldiers. It's a film that intense all the way through and another successful triumph for Christopher Nolan.",9,3,4,16 April 2020
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," The perfect blend of video games and anime.
","Edgar Wright is one of my favourite directors working today. His films are oozing with creativity, style and innovation that I don't think anyone else can replicate. Only a visionary like him can make a movie like Scott Pilgrim work.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is about Scott Pilgrim who falls in love with the beautiful hair dyed Ramona Flowers but has to first defeat her seven evil exes in order to win her love.This is a movie that could have EASILY gone wrong but thankfully Edgar Wright manages to pull it off. This is one of the most entertaining films to ever be made. Everything in terms of the film's presentation is extremely creative. All the battles between Scott Pilgrim and the evil exes never become boring or tedious due to the variety of fighting styles each one possesses. Not only does this film feel nostalgic but it's also refreshing to see something different and unique. This doesn't feel like a studio-led movie but one that had a lot of effort put into its story, dialogues and craft. The visuals provide for some really hilarious moments and the subtle nuances in the dialogue add to the creativity of the movie.Michael Cera essentially plays Michael Cera in this movie but it's effective as it perfects reflects the character of Scott Pilgrim. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is terrific as Ramona and has great chemistry with Cera. Chris Evans, Jason Schwartzman, Brandon Routh and the rest of the evil exes fit their roles perfectly and look like they're having the time of their lives. Kieran Culkin is really funny. The cast is generally fantastic.A staple in Edgar Wright movies is the fast paced editing which is no different here. The movie does not contain a single boring moment. Just by watching the film you could see how well thought out every element was. The constant X symbols and numbers telling you which evil ex Scott is facing are a few examples of the clever cinematography. The fights are really well choreographed and are directed with such grace and style. There really is no film quite like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.If you are someone who loved playing video games and watching anime or martial arts, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is for you as I believe it has the perfect blend of all of these.",10,1,1,18 February 2020
Toy Story 4," Surprisingly great
","When Toy Story 4 was announced, I became quite skeptical. I thought Toy Story 3 had a perfect ending and sendoff to the characters we've grown to love over the years. So initially I was scared. However, I'm happy to say that Pixar have proved once again why they are one of the best animation studios working today.From beginning to end, this movie was a blast. I had so much fun throughout its entirety. Let's start off with the animation. The animation in this film is downright gorgeous. The colours and textures of everything make the film look very photorealistic. It's safe to say Pixar has excelled in that department. This movie is directed by debutant Josh Cooley. What a debut! His style of direction is impressive especially for a debut. There are so many clever shots utilised especially during scenes that involve a lot of action.The new characters in the movie are great. Ducky and Bunny, voiced by Key & Peele, are hilarious and a lot of their jokes land. Keanu Reeves voices a character named Duke Caboom who is also entertaining. The main story revolves around the new character Forky who could have been annoying but Pixar made the character more likeable which worked out. It felt so nostalgic seeing Bo Peep once again. I was a bit worried Pixar might change the character to act in a certain way but thankfully that wasn't the case.The only issue I have with the film is that other supporting characters from the previous films don't have much of a role in this film since the story mainly focuses on Woody, Forky and Bo Peep.Despite that one negative, this film is awesome. It felt really nice seeing these beloved characters on the big screen once again. The story, animation, screenplay and direction were all superb. There are some great lessons about friendship, change and importance that can be learnt by both children and adults alike. Even though Toy Story 4 is unnecessary, it still is a fantastic installment in the franchise.",9,1,3,23 July 2019
Climax," One word: INSANE!
","I've been wanting to see Climax after hearing all the buzz surrounding it. After a few months, I finally got the chance to view it and it was the MOST INSANE EXPERIENCE EVER!By the end of it I was just in awe at what I just witnessed. This film was like no other. Climax was helmed by director Gaspar NoÃ© who is known for the controversial films IrrÃ©versible and Enter the Void. He has a style for making very disturbing films that will be polarising between audiences. Climax goes through the same treatment. NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE.First of all, I have to praise Gaspar NoÃ© on his direction because it was shot masterfully. The camerawork on this film is one of the best I've ever seen. The way the camera moves in the small location it's set in, especially in the second half where it gets crazy, makes The movie feel more anxiety inducing than what it already is. The camera lingers on the scene for long periods of time, one lasting over 40 minutes. I find it a huge achievement for everyone involved to stay in character for that long.The music creates a fearful and disturbing atmosphere which suits the overall tone. The cinematography and choice of colours also intensifies what's going on.The acting is top-notch. Considering that this film is most of the dancers' first film is incredible. Everyone did an incredible job especially when they all get drugged. All of them had great chemistry with each other as shown when they have conversations with one another. Their reactions to the situation felt so real that it made the film so much more engrossing and hard to watch.The only problem I have was the story. At times, during the film, I wondered how will the story progress and by the end it didn't progress much. If the story was tighter then this film would have been perfect.Overall, Climax is an experience that's worth watching. It may be a film that will haunt and disturb you for days and make you feel extremely anxious by the end of it but you should watch it just to appreciate the amount of effort put into its craft as well the praising the outcome.",8,1,2,11 July 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson does it again
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is an experience like no other. Never have I seen a movie so original, creative and beautifully made.Wes Anderson is a director who clearly understands his craft and knows what he's doing. The camerawork is simply sublime. Every shot feels artistic in some way and works well with the time period the film's set in. The set design is gorgeous. The wide range of bright colours creates this joyous and retro feeling. I love the change of aspect ratio as the time of year changes. Each one is respectable and used to its advantage during each time period.The acting overall is just outstanding to say the least. Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance in years as M. Gustave. He adds so much charm and wit which adds a lot of likability to his character. As a debutant, Tony Revolori was brilliant and is a great accomplice to M. Gustave. Two other characters which I thought were amazing were Jopling (Willem Dafoe) and Deputy Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum). Both actors portrayed them perfectly and brought some of the most precious moments in the film overall.Wes Anderson's script was something you've never heard before. He adds so much interesting and investing dialogues which embellishes the characters completely. Anderson doesn't stop his imagination from running wild. His story has a mixed bag of darkness, excitement and humour to keep the viewer from getting bored at any point. Accompanied with his stylish direction, the costumes, cinematography, score, set design, acting and crisp editing this fairy-tale like film is a one of a kind experience that has to be watched at any given cost.",10,1,2,2 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's most polarizing movie
","This movie was on my radar since it was announced. Having a talented filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino working with extraordinary talents such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie can make any Tarantino fan burst with excitement. However, this film will certainly divide audiences.Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood follows Rick Dalton and his best friend/stunt double Cliff Booth as they traverse through the fading golden era of Hollywood.This is a film that will bring about a mixed reception amongst audiences. Tarantino fans who come to this film expecting an abundance of blood and gore may become disappointed due to the film's moderately slow pacing and lack of action. This is a film dedicated to 1960s Hollywood and is aimed at cinephiles rather than the average moviegoer but I feel many people, cinephile or not, will adore this movie.This film put a huge smile on my face. As someone who loves cinema, it's great to see a film full of nostalgia from a creator that is clearly sharing his passion for films. What I love about Tarantino movies is the level of authenticity each film has in relation to their time period. The production design is fantastic. At no point does this film lose the 60s atmosphere. There are scenes where you see Pitt driving his car through the streets of LA and the sets look absolutely gorgeous. No wonder it won the Oscar for Best Production Design. We are also accompanied with Tarantino's exquisite dialogues. This is definitely one of Tarantino's funniest films. Apart from the humour, the characters are well written, especially Rick Dalton, which helped me be constantly invested throughout.The technical aspects are great but the performances are a huge positive. After a gap of 4 years, DiCaprio is back and he shines in this film. His character goes through a variety of emotions and struggles with his fading stardom which DiCaprio effortlessly conveys. Brad Pitt plays a great contrast to DiCaprio's character and is, without a doubt, the fan favourite of the entire movie. Pitt's chemistry with DiCaprio is wonderful allowing both of them to be a very memorable part of the film. Despite her limited character, Robbie portrays Sharon Tate with utmost sincerity. The rest of the cast ranging from Pacino, Qualley and Fanning give great performances as well.This movie is not going to be for everyone. The lack of an actual story may make people bored. Despite this, I loved the route Tarantino decided to take with a film like this. The slower pacing and character driven narrative made me never lose interest in what I was watching. The third act is especially entertaining as that's when old Tarantino kicks in. He certainly knows how to deliver a satisfying ending.I really liked Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. The movie looks stunning and Tarantino writes a screenplay filled with hilarious dialogues and memorable characters. The acting is exceptional and the 60s atmosphere the film gives off made me feel really happy.",9,1,1,19 February 2020
Gone Girl," Captivating to its core
","After seeing this movie I became speechless. The only word that came to my mind was 'WOW' but I don't think even that justifies how amazing this movie was. Gone Girl is hands down one of the best thrillers I've ever come across.David Fincher, known for his previous films like Fight Club, Seven and The Social Network, has masterfully directed this movie. He brings out tension throughout this film like no other filmmaker. The cinematography is top-notch and the screenplay by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the book, is extremely engrossing. Flynn adds a ton of development to the characters accompanied with many twists and turns which allowed the film to be riveting as well as unpredictable. On a technical level, Gone Girl is perfect.The acting was superb. Ben Affleck is terrific as the husband. He portrays a great amount of emotion whilst being under media scrutiny in the film. An actor who I was skeptical about, who is in the film, is Tyler Perry due to his filmography consisting of the poorly received Madea films but to my surprise he shouldered his role well. However, the best part of the film is Rosamund Pike who gives the best perfomance of her entire career. Not only is her character so interesting but her portrayal of that character is Oscarworthy. Her dialogue delivery and body language is perfect. I can't envision any other actress playing this role after seeing Pike's performance.Gone Girl also has a lot of social commentary on the media and the way we perceive them. It's incredible how one headline can change a person's view on someone or how one small detail can be manipulated to make someone look bad. This message, alongside the main story, were done in such a realistic manner that we, as an audience, can relate to and believe what the characters are going through.All in all, Gone Girl is outstanding. The nail-biting script, Fincher's harrowing direction and the amazing performances by everyone make this film really intense, dark and disturbing. If you're a fan of thrillers or enjoy films as a whole, definitely seek this film out.",10,1,3,24 July 2019
Django Unchained," What's not to like?
","As Tarantino lived through the 60s, it was expected that he would make a western sooner or later and he sure enough delivers.Django Unchained follows the journey of freed slave Django and his trusted bounty hunter friend Dr. King Schultz as they try to locate the Brittle Brothers and save Django's wife from a cruel plantation owner.Tarantino returns three years later to present us with a terrific, over the top western that provided the audience with memorable character, laudable dialogue and action that is a direct crowdpleaser.The characters are well written and wouldn't be the same if other actors played them. The chemistry between Django and Schultz seems very authentic due to the fantastic performances of Waltz and Foxx as well as Tarantino's impeccible writing. The role of Schultz was made for Christoph Waltz and he owns the film. His delivery is so endearing and likeable to the audience that when he's not in a scene, you do wish to see him in it. Jamie Foxx also does a good job. His transformation from being a quiet freed man to a gun-slinging hunter is well done and his performance shows it. Despite DiCaprio's late arrival, he shines in his role. His character bares resemblence to Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds in terms of the way he speaks to the two bounty hunters but DiCaprio makes Calvin Candie his own and leaves a great impression on the film. As well as DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson makes a late appearance but steals every scene with his hilarious delivery and expressions. Finally, Kerry Washington gives an earnest performance as well.The film has a runtime of 2 hours and 40 minutes but not once does it feel that long. Tarantino's trademark of excessive dialogue is present throughout but none of it is boring. Each conversation is investing as it gives an insight on the personality of each character fleshing them out completely by the end. The story is predictable but Tarantino adds elements of unpredictability during the dialogue driven scenes which invests the audience further and when something huge takes place, you feel it and wonder what will happen next.The costume design and sets are beautiful to look at which in return add a level of authenticity to the style of the film. The music is well utilised. I mean Tarantino even used rap songs by Tupac and Rick Ross in the film and somehow it worked.Altogether, Django Unchained is another amazing film in Tarantino's arsenal. The acting provides a sense of realism to the characters as well as the dialogue which is equally as intriguing. The film has some really funny moments and character building scenes that allow the runtime to feel as short as possible and the action is just a beauty to behold. As Django says in the film, 'What's not to like?'.",9,1,6,5 November 2019
Room," Very touching!!!
","This film was honestly really touching. It brought out a lot of emotions and really changed my perception of Brie Larson.Room follows Joy and her son, Jack, who've been held captive in an enclosed area which they've referred to as Room. One day, they get their freedom and her son gets to finally experience the outside world.What I really loved was the first hour. Director Lenny Abrahamson really managed to capture the claustrophic aspect of the 10 x 10 room as well as the lifestyle they had to adapt to for the years they were in there and made me genuinely care a lot for Larson and Tremblay. Putting us through the perspective of Jack was a clever choice by writer Emma Donoghue as we got to see his interpretation of the world compared to ours, making the film wholly interesting.For me, personally, the second half wasn't as engaging. It was still fascinating nonetheless as we got to witness Jack discovering and exploring this new world he wasn't familiar with as well as the psychological issues Brie Larson's character goes through when coming back. However, the film wasn't able to carry the same level of interest that I had in the first half.Aside from the tight script and direction, the two lead performances are what carry the film. I'm not really a fan of Brie Larson but I have to give credit where credit is due. She was terrific. Her emotions and facial expressions were executed perfectly. No wonder she won the Oscar. The one who really suprised me was Jacob Tremblay. It's insane how good he is throughout this film especially for his age at the time. These two are really believable as mother and son and have a wonderful connection with each other.Room will definitely make some people tear up. The story is very touching and the relationship between Larson and Tremblay make it all the more heartwarming.",8,0,0,8 May 2020
Kick-Ass," A great mixture of action, comedy and drama
","I heard of Kick-Ass for a long time and when I finally got the chance, I saw it. What can I say? I enjoyed this film throughout its entirety. This is a popcorn flick that remains humourous and fun all the way through.Kick-Ass tells the story of Dave, a comic book lover who wants to become a superhero but arrives into trouble with a man known as Frank D'Amico. In a parallel story, two other people want to exact revenge from D'Amico after what he did to them.In our lives, we must have thought at least once how much fun it would be to become a superhero. This simple idea is what makes Kick-Ass so relatable. From the opening, I connected with the protagonist as I shared the same thought. The writing in this film is so good. Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn make the film feel as realistic as possible. The opening also sets the tone. This film isn't meant to be taken seriously and both writers capitalise on that aspect really well. The jokes are hilarious and keep this film from being a bore. The characters are simple but well realised and the motivations for each one makes sense. Vaughn's direction has a lot of style. The action sequences are shot really well and are awesome to witness.The acting is brillant. Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems like a high school teen and portrays both Kick-Ass and Dave well. Mark Strong did a good job as the villain. I always remembered Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fogell from Superbad but he managed to shrug off that label here. The two best parts of the movie hand down were Chloë Grace Moretz and Nicolas Cage. Both of them did a tremendous job with their roles.Whilst the film is very funny and contains stellar action, the first half feels a bit slow but it does pick up during the second half. The film is predictable and towards the end there were some cliché elements but at the same time, there is so much entertainment that you're ready to forgive these issues.Kick-Ass is a wonderful experience. It definitely feels refreshing after seeing the abundance of other serious superhero flicks. The characters are well written, the acting is great, the premise is innovative and is just a delightful, hilarious movie that can be watched many times.",8,0,0,8 September 2019
Call Me by Your Name," The power of LOVE!
","Call Me By Your Name is one of those films which doesn't feel like a film but rather a journey of self discovery which we witness and feel as if it's happening at that exact moment.Call Me By Your Name is the story of two people, Elio and Oliver, who fall in love over the course of the summer.This movie brings one of the most beautiful relationships ever put to film. The way writer James Ivory and director Luca Guadagnino portrayed this story felt so real and in the moment. Not even for a second does it feel like you're watching actors playing these characters because of how well everyone played their roles and the excellent direction by Gaudagnino.TimothÃ©e Chalamet is a force to be reckoned with. This man displayed such raw and tender emotion as Elio that it's impossible to think that Chalamet is acting. He is essentially our main focus since we see him learn more about himself and his sexuality as the film goes on. Elio is a character that you connect with and actually care about. He will make you feel a whole bunch of emotions as his character develops and grows.Let's not forget how terrific Elio's other half, Oliver, played by Armie Hammer was. The chemistry between these two seemed so genuine that you instantly root for both of them being together. The love and sweetness Oliver gives to Elio is something that can't be found or forgotten easily. There's something so sincere and authentic between these two that just makes tears stream down your face like a running tap. If there was one thing that I would've liked more, it would be learning more about the character of Oliver.This movie isn't your typical love story filled with obstacles and conflict. This is one that celebrates the ideology of LOVE and shows it in a touching and emotional way. By the end, there will be nothing else but sniffling and tears throughout the end credits. This film conveys one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful relationships the world has ever seen.",8,2,4,28 September 2019
Ex Machina," An engaging piece of sci-fi
","I've never delved deep into the sci-fi genre so I decided to dabble in it by first visiting Ex Machina, a film that's regarded as a sci-fi masterpiece.Ex Machina starts off with a young programmer named Caleb, who manages to get the chance to take part in an experiment evaluating human qualities and emotions of a newly developed humanoid AI.I personally thought Ex Machina was great. I don't love it as much as other people but I find it to be a very compelling sci-fi movie that raises a couple of questions. The film looks absolutely gorgeous and includes some incredible special effects. The locations that are shown bring about a sense of paranoia and claustrophobia as the film goes on. This is Alex Garland's feature film debut and I'm definitely on board with whatever he has in store for the future. Garland brings about many interesting ideas surrounding manipulation, the future of humans and how far AI can go. It's these themes that make Ex Machina memorable and stay in your mind.Not only that but the performances are also strong. I loved watching Oscar Isaac in this movie. His character was really interesting and kept on getting intriguing throughout. Alicia Vikander, who played the humanoid, was outstanding. She finds the perfect balance between being human and robot with her mannerisms, way of speaking and expressions that all reflect that. The only character I had a problem with that of Domnhall Gleeson. I just wasn't invested in his character and didn't find his portrayal to be that great either.For a debut, Alex Garland shows his skill in sci-fi and didn't disappoint at all. He is a director that's very interesting and cannot wait to see his other film, Annihilation. Ex Machina kept my interest piqued by its ideas and story that got more and more suspenseful towards the end. It's certainly a very strong piece of science fiction.",8,0,0,6 April 2020
1917," Give Roger Deakens his 2nd Oscar!
","It's been a while since Sam Mendes's last feature film. Spectre was quite a disappointment but I'm sure that 1917 will be a definite crowdpleaser.1917 follows two British soldiers who are assigned a task to deliver a message in order to stop 1,600 men from dying.Like Birdman, the main selling point is how the entire film looks like it's been shot in one single take. Through long demanding long takes and clever editing, the makers were able to achieve this. Whilst Birdman was shot in a very small area, 1917 traverses through many different locations which makes it really difficult to achieve the goal they were going for. What we got in the end is nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. You never feel bored since the location and action that takes place feel extremely real. This movie acts like a VR game as it genuinely feels like you are there with them about to embark on a perilous journey that may prove to be fatal.Roger Deakens has always been my favourite cinematographer and here he gives it his all. If he wins an Oscar for Best Cinematography, I wouldn't be surprised. The way the camera moves in front and behind the characters is fantastic. There are some absolutely gorgeous shots including one with George MacKay running which is just a feast for your eyes. What impressed me the most was the use of lighting during the dark scenes. There is one which involves flares and it's incredible how Deakens lit the scene up just using that. I really have to commend Deakens and Mendes for their work here. Making a war film seem like it's done in one shot is not easy at all but they managed to do it extremely well.Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay were required to do a lot for this movie but they both gave off very believable performances. On the other hand, their characters could have been better. Through the whole film it's very hard to care about both of them since we don't learn much about them. There is a very important scene that tried to bring an emotional reaction from me but I could not feel it due to how one dimensional the characters are. If Mendes and Wilson-Cairns tried to flesh out the characters more then this film would be much better.Altogether, this is a great achievement that should be viewed in the cinemas to get the full experience. The lighting, acting and camerawork are all done with tremendous skill. 1917 could have been better in terms of its writing but the aesthetics are what make this film unique from the other war films. Roger Deakens deserves another Oscar for this film and I have no doubt he will win it.",7,1,2,21 January 2020
Prisoners," Gripping till the end
","Prisoners is a terrific film. I found everything to be outstanding. The acting, direction, cinematography and writing were all so well done.Prisoners gives us an insight on how far someone would go to save their child. It also shows us how a tragedy like child abduction can affect the people involved. This film captures all these moments in such a realistic manner which is what makes the film all the more interesting.The screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski is truly brilliant. Guzikowski clearly understood the genre and added some great twists, turns and situations to keep the viewer gripped till the end. Denis Villeneuve's direction is perfect. Villeneuve understands which type of shots to use where, adding to the intensity of the movie.The performances all around were amazing. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best whilst Jake Gyllenhaal knocks it out of the park. Both add many layers and depth to their characters through their emotions, complimenting the script by maintaining the realistic approach it was going for. In no way did I feel their characters were unconvincing. They kept it fully grounded to match the tone of the film. Everyone else also played their roles perfectly. Even the children seemed real to me by some of the actions they do in the film.The final hero of the film is Roger Deakins who deserves every amount of praise for the cinematography. The movie looks stunning by his choices of colour and weather which enhances the drama and conversations taking place.Honestly, Prisoners is one of the best mystery thrillers made. Its mix of developed characters, impeccible acting, cinematography and dialogue is what makes this film interesting and intense all the way through. Don't miss out on it",10,1,1,13 July 2019
Silence," Speechless...
","What can I say about Martin Scorsese that hasn't already been said. He is an astounding director who's explored many different genres of film but Silence unveiled a side of Scorsese which I haven't seen.Silence tells the story of two Portuguese priests who travel to Japan in search of their mentor, who has been said to have apostatised the Christian faith, as well as spread Christianity to the residents of Japan.This film conveyed to me the diversity of Scorsese's skills as a director. A lot of his previous films arefast paced and made to entertain the audience. Silence separates itself from that body of work due to its much slower pacing and intense atmosphere which general audience won't enjoy. It's inevitable for some people to feel bored throughout. This is a movie that isn't made for a high box office collection but rather to respect cinema as an art form.Silence is a journey. An emotionally intense journey that studies humanity and religion as a whole. We see our main character Rodrigues, played by Andrew Garfield, go through a huge amount of turmoil as he becomes a man who believed in his faith as strongly as possible to someone who's completely broken and torn about his beliefs. This is possibly Scorsese's best looking film. The lighting, camerawork is absolutely sublime. Rodrigo Prieto did the cinematography for this film as well Scorsese's other films like The Wolf of Wall Street. He did an unbelievable job here. The writing by Jay Cocks and Martin Scorsese is brilliant and captures the 17th Century time period really well.Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver are superb here. Whilst Driver isn't as prominent in this film as Garfield, he still makes a huge impression overall. Words cannot describe how good Garfield is here. After seeing him in The Social Network and Under the Silver Lake, this adds to his collection of brilliant performances. Liam Neeson isn't in the film much but he's still good for the time he's on-screen. The Japanese cast are all spectacular and bring a great amount of authenticity overall.Silence is another example of Scorsese's talent. This is an emotionally draining film filled with many scenes that can be difficult to watch. I do wish the pacing was better during the first act as it wasn't as engaging compared to the other two acts but Silence overall is an encapsulating experience that will you speechless.",9,1,1,6 June 2020
Midsommar," Mesmerizing...
","Ari Aster's feature length debut Hereditary was my favourite film of last year and became one of the best horror films I've ever seen. So I was very excited to hear about his next project 'Midsommar'. Did it meet my expectations?Midsommar is about a couple who travel to Sweden with their friends for the midsummer festival but soon come to realise the strange and shocking practices the cult perform there.As mentioned before, Ari Aster was on my radar since his last film therefore my anticipation for this movie was very high and I can say with full confidence that this film delivers. Do not go into this film expecting jumpscares or any other cheap tactics to scare you because Aster doesn't follow that formula. Here, he has made a film that goes along a more psychological route which delves deep into the mental and physical stability of our main character.The performances are terrific all around. Florence Pugh gave an emotionally stirring performance that seemed very genuine. It's definitely her best performance so far. Her boyfriend, played by Jack Reynor, also gave a good performance. Throughout the whole film, you buy them as this couple whose relationship is on the rocks due to their dialogue delivery, tone and way they act around each other. All the other actors do a great job as well as the cult which provide some extremely uncomfortable moments.Aside from the story, this film looks beautiful. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and the score alongside it creates such a magical and fantasy-like atmosphere which doesn't stray away from eeriness. Ari Aster's direction is immaculate, in particular a beautiful wide shot involving Florence Pugh and a lot of flowers. The general aesthetics are a visual treat and hypnotic to a major extent.I feel the more and more you watch this film, the better the experience gets as there is so much to admire in terms of its story and characters. Much like Hereditary, this film brings themes of grief and pain but also adds meaning to bad relationships, the negative people around you and the sense of belonging. Aster explores these ideas through visual storytelling which makes me praise his vision as a storyteller. He clearly doesn't take the audience for granted and wants us to think and interpret Midsommar in our own way rather than spoonfeeding all the details.Midsommar may be one of the weirdest films to come out this year but you can't deny the craft and thought process behind it. This is a movie that I would love to analyse further and get to grips with the multiple ideologies the film presents. This is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year and I'm extremely excited to see what Ari Aster can bring to the table next.",9,1,4,2 November 2019
La La Land," Hits the right notes
","I'll be honest. Musicals are probably my least favourite genre. They simply do not interest me. After hearing the acclaim this film has gotten and the fact that it's directed by Damien Chazelle, I decided to give it a go. This is the best musical I've seen so far.La La Land follows Mia, an aspiring actress, and Sebastian, a pianist, who fall in love whilst trying to achieve their aspirations for the future.Before seeing the movie, I wondered what all the hype surrounding La La Land was. After watching it I was extremely impressed by Chazelle's vision for the movie as well as the performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. This movie starts off with an amazing song and dance number that looks like it's done in one take and lasts for five minutes. This is just one of many astounding musical moments. Not that just but the way each scene flows into a musical number was handled immensely well. Usually when people burst into song and dance, I tend to roll my eyes but I loved every single song and dance in La La Land. The long takes, stunning camerawork and choreography made me realise how passionate Chazelle was towards filmmaking and music. It wasn't just the aesthetics but the actual songs were memorable. It's been a while since I watched the film and the songs are still playing in my head.If that already wasn't enough, the performances are stellar. I believe this is a career best performance from Emma Stone. She was fabulous. Ryan Gosling is always a win and his chemistry with Stone is perfect. Their romance is believable and you root for them through the entire journey. There is an iconic dance sequence involving them both and seeing them dance for the first time was exciting.Whilst the story isn't anything new and rather quite predictable, the message that it's trying to tell you has so much heart. Many people say this film is a love letter to LA and that is evident through the gorgeous cinematography of the city but I think it's a film for people who have dreams and want to achieve their goals to be successful in the future. Plus the film pokes fun at Hollywood through its representation of Hollywood parties and auditions.Damien Chazelle deserves all the praise for his creative vision on this film. He's slowly becoming one of my favourite directors working today. With Whiplash and La La Land, I feel he will go very far. La La Land is filled with incredible musical numbers, beautiful cinematography and terrific performances by both leads that culminates in a finale that will bring out the tissues.",8,6,8,14 March 2020
Reservoir Dogs," The birth of a legend
","It's so impressive to see a film like Reservoir Dogs come along and change the entire crime genre. With a budget of around $1.5 million, it goes to show how you can do wonders regardless of how low your budget is.Reservoir Dogs follows a group of criminals that are trying to find out who amongst them is the rat after a heist goes wrong.This was Quentin Tarantino's debut film and what a debut it was! This movie is packed with a stellar cast including the likes of Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Alongside that we were introduced to Tarantino's impeccible writing. This movie grips you with its tight dialogues right from the beginning with the infamous 'Tipping' discussion and keeps you hooked throughout its short runtime due to the talent onscreen and fast pacing. The music choices were very fitting and suited the film's tone. Whilst the film does get really violent, none of it is unnecessary. I feel it reflects the personality of each character perfectly especially Madsen's character.The performances are all very strong. Harvey Keitel does an impressive job as well as Tim Roth. Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen are really fun to watch and make their characters really believable. Lawrence Tierney and Chris Penn are also great in their roles and play them equally well.What I really loved about the film was the way it was structured. The fact that we don't see the heist from the beginning makes the film really unpredictabe as we're constantly doubting who the rat is. There are some really funny and memorable moments throughout that make you realise why this movie is such a classic. The only problem I had was the way some scenes were shot but it also shows how much Tarantino has grown as a director.Reservoir Dogs is really entertaining. None of the characters feel boring, the plot doesn't stray and the fantastic writing by Tarantino gave an amazing first impression of his undeniable talent.",9,0,0,3 April 2020
Titanic," What an achievement!
","James Cameron's Titanic was something else. It's amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997. Titanic is a film that many will remember that broke ground. Not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in general.Titanic is very, very well made. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for James Cameron. He wanted to make this movie special and he has. The amount of research that Cameron had to do to make the film look realistic is evident.The entire set is a whole world in itself. Cameron's direction transports us to ins and outs of the ship which all look so beautiful. The atmosphere and grandness of the ship sticks with you especially during the inevitable sinking scene where you can feel the terror and panic aboard. The cinematography is pure brilliance. The ship has a very elegant feel and the set design and costumes from the inside also adds to that feeling. Visually, this is one the best looking films of all time.The acting was sublime all through the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are in top form and have some of the best chemistry in a film ever. Their romance seemed so believable that I never felt bored during it. The supporting cast are also great, especially Billy Zane.I have to give immense praise to James Cameron for handling this film. He took a lot of time researching and working to make this movie the grand spectacle it is and feel as accurate as possible to the real incident. Whilst some think this film is overrated, you cannot deny the sheer effort that went into crafting this movie.",9,4,6,15 July 2019
Zombieland," A unique take on zombie movies
","In 2004 we got one of the greatest zombie films made which was Shaun of the Dead. A film that tried something different that set it apart from the rest of the zombie films. Five years later, Zombieland arrived which fuses, both, comedy and zombies once again. However the film feels fresh enough to make itself stand out.Zombieland is told through the perspective of Columbus as he joins forces with Tallahassee, Wichita and Little Rock as they make their way through a zombie infested America.Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick write a script filled with blood, gore, jokes and heart. Majority of the jokes in the film are executed well and had me laughing throughout the film's entirety. What made this film feel refreshing was its cool visuals and implementation of 'rules'. The 'rules' alongside Jesse Eisenberg's narration made this film its own thing and kept it aside from being compared to Shaun of the Dead. The narration is interesting and witty which keeps the flow going and the performances of the four leads are terrific.Woody Harrelson is hilarious all the way through and his chemistry with Jesse Eisenberg is a treat to watch. Emma Stone is also very good as well as her on-screen sister, Abigail Breslin, who is also entertaining to watch. There are some great situations involving these four which are guaranteed to bring a laugh from you. Aside from the comedy, there are also some heartfelt scenes with our protagonists that just strengthen the bond between these four and make us root for them.Ruben Fleischer does a great job with the direction considering this to be his first film. I think the story could have been better. There is a situation that takes place and you can easily guess which direction the film was going to take. If only the film had more of an unpredictable feeling through its story then it may have been better.Besides that, Zombieland is a fun zombie flick that can be watched multiple times. The jokes are funny and the group play off each other quite well. The film has great visuals that add to the comedy and create a sense of uniqueness to the genre. Altogether, it's a bloody great time.",8,1,2,20 October 2019
The Witch," Not your typical everyday horror movie
","The Witch is a very different type of horror. I'm saying this now, NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS FILM! In a world where we're used to films that rely heavily on jumpscares, The Witch goes on a more psychological route where it doesn't use any of the modern-day horror tricks like loud noises or jumpscares. This is what makes it very conflicting for the audience. For me, I found this technique highly effective.As a huge fan of the horror genre, I haven't seen a horror film which is so capable and insanely crafted like The Witch. This is the writer-director Robert Eggers' first feature film and I could tell he has a lot of talent. Each and every shot is handled so meticulously that I'm surprised that this is Eggers' first movie. Eggers really cares about this project. From the colour scheme, the costumes, the lighting to the atmosphere. All of this became so important to make the audience feel like they're in the 1630s. The attention to detail fully immersed me to this world. The decision to make everyone speak in the Old English language further enhanced the realism and brought you even closer to the characters and atmosphere.The acting by everyone involved was perfect. The way everyone spoke and emoted felt so real and so believable. Each performance was strong and felt like this was a real family. This aided me into believing all the events that take place over these 90 minutes. The script is thought-provoking and requires the audience's full attention to understand what's happening. A core element in a horror movie is the music. The Witch has such an uneasy and terrifying background score that adds to the atmosphere.I loved the way the makers portrayed the Witch in this film. Despite not showing the Witch much, you still sense its presence terrorising the family allowing the film to become more unsettling. The only problem I have with the film is its pacing. I felt it was a bit too slow. However, the film's harrowing atmosphere and characters made this feel like an experience like no other.As a debut, I have immense praise for Robert Eggers' take on the horror genre and look forward to his future projects. As mentioned before, The Witch isn't for everyone. This movie is made for horror and film lovers who appreciate the craft that goes into creating a movie as well as understand what true horror is.",9,3,5,29 June 2019
Joker," Spellbinding to say the least.
","The Joker has always been one of my favourite, if not my favourite, comic book villain of all time. I've was fascinated to find out how the Joker became this crazy, delusional psychopath and I feel Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix gave us the a fantastic origin story that will make fans and audience members ecstatic.Joker follows the story of Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded by society, and the way he became one of Gotham's most feared criminals.This film shook me. It REALLY shook me. I'm astounded that Phillips and Warner Bros. were daring enough to go down this route but I thought it was a perfect path to express the origin of the Joker. Everything about this film is disturbing and frankly unnerving. The ugly colour palette, haunting score, Phoenix's insane performance and dark themes all mixed together to create a dish that leaves a bad feeling in your stomach once devoured.It's extraordinary to see what Todd Phillips did with this idea since it's something completely different from his other projects. The camerawork is excellent and captures a truly vile and distressing atmosphere. The writing is great and the character arc from Arthur Fleck to the Joker is no short of mesmerising.Aside from Phillips, the only other person who makes this film even more insane is the spellbinding performance of Joaquin Phoenix. He has proven time and time again what an amazing actor he is but this is something really special. The legend definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck is gritty, sympathetic and realistic. The way Phoenix laughs stands out immensely. Every time he laughs uncontrollably, he holds onto his neck showing the pain he's feeling. Phoenix makes this depection his own and something with no other actor can replicate. Heath Ledger would most certainly be proud.I don't think this film deserves all the controversy and flak critics are giving it. I think people forgot that the Joker is a mass murdering psycho, who has no regret whatsoever towards his victims, and so it would make sense for the film to convey violence in the way it's been shown.Joker is a one of a kind film. There is no comic book film quite like it. The film deals with mature themes relating to mental illness and how society treat people which is sure to get people thinking and talking. This was a great experiment with a beloved villain and I'm satisfied with the direction the makers took. Believe all the hype surrounding Joker as it's something you don't want to miss.",8,0,1,5 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Went on for too long...
","This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. The whole premise of It fascinated me and I thought Chapter One was a good adaptation of Stephen King's source material. What worried me was how the adult portion would be handled since the 1990s mini-series had a very disappointing take on the adult segment. Whilst this is an improvement on the mini-series version, it doesn't reach the level of its predecessor.It: Chapter Two follows the reunion of the Losers Club, 27 years later, as they try to defeat Pennywise once and for all.My feelings towards this movie are quite mixed. There are portions which I enjoyed and parts which I disliked. What I thought was perfect about this movie was its casting choices. Seriously, the adult cast fit right into every one of their characters. You actually feel like the kids grew up to be like the adults. The best amongst them was Bill Hader who effortlessly acts like Finn Wolfhard's Richie Tozier. I felt the chemistry between them in the same way as the kids. This is one of the film's biggest strengths.A big issue I had with this film was its runtime. Whilst the first chapter had a continuous pace, you could feel the 2 hours 40 minutes here. Some scenes dragged on for way too long and some didn't feel necessary. If 20-30 minutes were trimmed off the length, then the pacing wouldn't suffer as much.A few flashbacks to the kid versions of themselves felt distracting. I couldn't help but notice how some of the kids, especially Finn Wolfhard, were digitally de-aged to fit the time period and because all of them grew up since the last film. Some of their dialogue had a sense of ADR done to them as well which put me off during my viewing.An important element that a movie like It should have is scary scenes. There were a few good scares in the first one but Chapter Two fails to recreate that same impact. Apart from one scare which genuinely shook me, nothing else affected me. A complaint I had with the first film applies here as well. There were too many jumpscares. I wish some of the effects were practical as I think that would've been more effective when it comes to the scares.However, what I loved about this film was Bill Skarsgard. His performance as Pennywise is so creepy and entertaining. It's not just the make-up that creeps you out but his way of speaking alongside his expressions make the character of Pennywise all the more scary.It: Chapter Two is by no means a bad film. Despite its flaws, there's a lot of appreciate. The camaraderie between the Losers felt really believable and the humour was actually funny. Muschietti's direction is once again great and the cinematography is good as well. I feel that they tried to fit in too much which affected the end result.",5,0,2,14 September 2019
Jaws," An unforgettable classic.
","JAWS! A film that came out in 1975 is still being remembered to this day for completely changing the Hollywood scene. The film that started the whole shark genre, won numerous awards and brought a new perspective to the art of filmmaking. That is Jaws. It truly is inspiring to see a film with this much ambition behind it and come out perfectly executed.Jaws follows the story of Brody, Hooper and Quint as they hunt down the great white shark that is terrorising the beaches. A story that's so simple but so effective at the same time.Whilst watching the film you realise that Jaws wasn't just great because of the shark but it was great because of its characters. The characters of Brody, Quint and Hooper all played by the late Roy Scheider, the late Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are so memorable. Their chemistry is perfect due to their conflicting personalities but in the end they work together as a team which is what makes this film feel so satisfying.Despite the many problems Spielberg encountered during the production of Jaws, he perservered and created something really magical and groundbreaking. It is impressive the amount of work he put into this film considering this was his second feature film. And how can I forget about the revolutionary score by John Williams. That shark theme will NEVER get old.Jaws is such a magnificent film. A film that millions of people have watched and still consistently view. A film that has influenced filmmakers around the globe. A film that can be rightfully deemed as a MASTERPIECE.",10,0,1,21 July 2019
Inception," PURE GENIUS!
","GENIUS! That's the best way I can describe Inception. Christopher Nolan has crafted one of the most widely original and unique films ever.Inception is pretty much near perfection. Everything in this movie is handled with immense care. The plot, characters, sets, score, visual effects and direction are all masterfully helmed. Christopher Nolan's story is special. There isn't anything quite like it. The plot has so many layers and complexity to it that I found it so enjoyable piecing it together. I love how Nolan decided to let us work everything out instead of spoonfeeding us all the information. This way we would have to pay attention closely to what's taking place which I find more satisfying. There are many moments throughout the movie where Nolan builds character to each role. That added depth allowed me to understand each character's decisions and get a better feel as to what some characters are going through.Leonardo DiCaprio shines in his role of Cobb. He adds so much more to the character through his expressions. He truly is a talented actor. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was amazing as the more reserved person of the group. Tom Hardy was really good and funny. Ellen Page did really well and Ken Watanabe was fantastic. It didn't feel like anyone outshined anyone. Each actor was given a time to shine. A stellar cast like this were bound to give praiseworthy performances.The cinematography was gorgeous. Not once do you feel like looking away from the screen because of how incredible it looks. The special effects are jaw-dropping. The effects aren't just there to make the film look good but it also complements the story. Hans Zimmer's score, which is perfect, accompanied with the cinematography and effects create an experience that you won't forget easily.Inception is one of those rare films that change the Hollywood scene. This is a film which I feel the masses and filmmakers will remember for a long time. Nolan proved once again why he's one of the best filmmakers working today. His vibrant script combining the genres of sci-fi, action and heist come together in perfect harmony. The sheer complexion and ambiguous themes will definitely get people to think and discuss what it all could mean. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself.",10,0,0,7 August 2019
Parasite," Bong Joon-Ho is a genius!
","Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I'll definitely check out more. I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius.It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible.The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing.Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch.I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles.I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb.2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss.",10,29,48,26 January 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The pure definition of a masterpiece!
","To me Birdman wasn't just a film. It was an experience. This is truly one of the best films I've ever seen.Everything in this movie was done so perfectly that I couldn't find any flaw with it. Michael Keaton gives the best performance of his entire career and one that isn't just Oscarworthy but one that is ground-breaking and will be remembered for a long time. The rest of the cast also provided some extremely powerful performances. The movie is made to look like one continuous shot as if it were a play which solidified my judgement of Alejandro G. Iñárritu being one of the best filmmakers present. His direction brings a whole rawness to the story and characters that makes them believable.The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is incredible. You feel like you're at Broadway witnessing this character driven drama and immerses you throughout the film. The story handles so many themes and ideas like Family, Hollywood, Critics and many more to a point where you feel worried whether the film can convey so much in a runtime of 2 hours but I can assure you everything is handled perfectly.Overall, this film is a MASTERPIECE! You won't see anything like Birdman and its commentary on Hollywood, Actors, Family and Critics is sure to make you think. I HIGHLY recommend this! This is what cinema is all about.",10,2,2,16 June 2019
Marriage Story," What I love about Marriage Story is absolutely everything!
","This was one of my most anticipated films of the entire year. I loved Noah Baumbach ever since I saw Frances Ha and this film isn't just my favourite film of his but also my favourite of the year so far.Marriage Story follows Charlie and Nicole, a couple going through a divorce and how the actual legal process of that divorce is affecting them.Noah Baumbach is an extremely talented filmmaker. I love his approach of making films about mundane life as there is so much that can be done from a character perspective. He possesses the ability to make characters feel real and create wonderful interactions between each of them. However, what he achieved with Marriage Story is stunning in every way.This is a film that really focuses on its characters and their thoughts and feelings. We really understand the pain and struggle both protagonists are going through as Baumbach allows us to spend alone time with both characters and hear their perspective on the situation. There are some truly heartbreaking scenes that may be hard to watch and none of that would have been achieved without the brilliance of Baumbach's screenplay and magnificent acting from Johansson and Driver.I don't think words can justify how phenomenal the acting is. This is Adam Driver's best performance yet. He deserves a lot of awards and merit for his work here. You can tell his character is breaking down inside as Driver packs a lot of emotion into each scene. This is also the best I ever saw Scarlett Johansson. There is a scene where she explains why she's getting a divorce and that scene is so moving due to the amount of emotion Johansson expresses whilst reciting the dialogue. The most distressing scene is when both of them argue and it contains some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. Laura Dern and Ray Liotta also create a great amount of impact in every scene they're in.Baumbach's script is one of, if not, the best script of the year. Each dialogue and conversation between characters feel extremely real and bring a sense of authenticity to what's taking place. It also sheds light on the nature of each character so we, as an audience, learn how everyone behaves. Apart from the characters, this film also focuses on the legal process of the divorce as well and how it can worsen the phase the couple are going through. Baumbach's direction is also fantastic. He uses a lot of long takes which effectively brings out the emotional punch that deeply affects the people watching.Hats off to Noah Baumbach, Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and everyone who worked on this film. Marriage Story is a masterclass in terms of its characters, script and acting. This is definitely going to take all the awards home which won't bother me at the slightest because Marriage Story deserves all of them.",10,6,10,8 December 2019
Mother!," A symbolic piece of art.
","At the time of its release, Mother! was a very polarizing movie. Some people loved it and some people claimed it was the worst film they've seen. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that Darren Aronofsky got people to talk and contemplate about the film's hidden meanings and metaphors.Mother! follows the story of a couple whose peaceful life gets destroyed by some uninvited guests.As mentioned before, some audience members will dislike this movie wholly. In fact, people disliked it to the point where it got an F grade on CinemaScore. I, on the other hand, found this movie to be an uncomfortable but intriguing piece of art. It's not perfect but majority of the time everything is executed well.The performances in this movie are staggering. Jennifer Lawrence does particularly well. A lot of the shots throughout are fixated on her and so the film did rely on her acting skills but thankfully she managed to pull it off. Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer also do the film justice with their performances.Aronofsky has done an incredible job. He made a film which will get me thinking for a long time. There are many interpretations that can be made since pretty much everything you see during the movie has a meaning or is metaphorical for something else. Even on a surface level I think this movie's enjoyable. You're constanly interested in figuring out what's actually happening whilst at the same time feeling extremely anxious and awkward at the events that take place.The cinematography is terrific. The whole movie you're wandering around in this house. There are shots of the outside scenery but we never go there. This added a huge feeling of claustrophobia within me especially during the last 30 minutes where it all turns into a nightmare that's not easily forgettable.If there is one problem I have with the movie is that the pacing can suffer. There are scenes where we go from seeing a regular, mundane life to something completely shocking. This may catch some people off guard.All in all, Mother! is a film that I won't be forgetting anytime soon. Its visual imagery and metaphors will keep me engaged until I can decipher the many meanings the movie contains. Aronofsky has crafted a piece of art.",9,1,2,30 August 2019
The Truman Show," Completely blew me away!
","The Truman Show, an absolute classic, was a movie that blew me away. This film is genius on so many levels.The film follows Truman Burbank, a man living in the perfect world of Seahaven, who is unaware of the fact that his entire world is a large set and he is the star of a grand TV show, known as The Truman Show, created by Christof.If you've only heard the synopsis now and never watched the movie then you must be wondering 'How will this movie work?'. I had the same thought before watching it. After viewing it I can say that The Truman Show is exceptionally made and one of the greatest films ever to come out.What makes this movie undeniably amazing is the direction, screenplay and acting. Peter Weir's direction is simply outstanding. There isn't any moment where you feel bored since the film paces extremely well. The cinematography and shot selection is perfect. Both add to the realism and make the idea of this world being a TV show very believable.The acting all around is fantastic. Jim Carrey plays Truman effortlessly. Aside from the script, Carrey makes the character of Truman believable and lovable with great emotion and personality. Ed Harris was also brillant as the manipulative creator of the show. Everyone else's performances felt real as they pretend to be in the same fictional world as Truman.The most praise I have to give this movie to is Andrew Niccol for giving us this unique and thought provoking script. He has wrote a script that will get people to think because The Truman Show is much more than what it looks like on a surface level. As you dig deeper into the many underlying themes of the movie, that's when you realise how profound it really is. The film's plot is very interpretive. Many viewers will come up with different theories trying to piece together the actual meaning of the movie. There are ideas relating to the way media manipulate people, God, reality shows, desires and much more.The Truman Show is an example of how great cinema can become. Weir and Niccol have done an exceptional job and I applaud their efforts. This is a movie that gets people thinking and highlights many relevant ideas in an entertaining and accessible way for everyone to enjoy.",10,1,1,29 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The start of a saga
","Back in the 60s, it was mesmerizing to see Stanley Kubrick create an out of this world (literally!) film known as 2001: A Space Odyssey but what George Lucas made in 1977 started a huge trend in culture known as Star Wars.Star Wars: A New Hope follows Luke Skywalker as he teams up Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 to destroy the Empire's most destructive station and save Princess Leia from the evil mastermind named Darth Vader.Just imagine watching a movie like this in the late 70s. It would have been nothing like anything else shown in the theatres before. The film had a reported budget of $11 million and the effects even today still hold up. It's astounding to see something so original and unique be made for it to become one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons. The film looks gorgeous. A lot of creatures shown and fight sequences look real making the realism stay throughout.The characters are really well written. Mark Hamill portrays Luke perfectly. His transformation from a whiny kid to a mature leader was great to see and this arc added so much depth to him. Carrie Fisher fit right in the role of Princess Leia. She's not the standard damsel in distress you would see normally because Lucas fleshed out her character completely accompanied with Fisher's mannerisms and dialogues. Then we have the almighty Harrison Ford playing one of the best characters to ever exist. Ford lives and breathes as Han Solo as he is so entertaining to watch and has great chemistry with Hamill and Fisher. We also have Alec Guinness who played Obi-Wan Kenobi perfectly. Finally we have one of the most iconic villains, Darth Vader. Lucas made Darth Vader also interesting to watch by showing off his power and leadership to audiences to really show how evil he may be.A New Hope has so many great scenes (the bar scene) and character interactions that keep the flow going without a second of boredom. The concluding battle is something so intense and fascinating to watch. You being to wonder how they created it in the 70s. It must have been spellbinding and hypnotic to see something as cool and fun as Star Wars at the time of its release. It's filled with many memorable characters, awesome VFX and action sequences that'll make you root for each and every one of the protagonists. This was the start of a legacy that kept millions of fans eager and excited to see the rest of the series.",10,2,3,23 November 2019
50_50," Simple but effective
","There was a time where Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a really promising career. Seeing him in Inception and Don Jon showed me how capable he was. It's sad we don't get to see him nowadays because he had huge potential and 50/50 is a great example of his acting abilities.50/50 follows Adam, a young man who gets diagnosed with a rare type of cancer and has a 50% chance of living and we see how he struggles to fight against the disease.This is a film that is the definition of simple but effective. The story is not complicated at all but it's told in a very lighthearted and touching way. Writer Will Reiser found a great balance between comedy and drama as they never clash with one another. There's not a moment where the comedy goes too far or the film gets overdramatic. It's all kept fairly realistic which makes the story all the more believable. It may feel weird having comedy in a film about a dark subject like cancer but it's used in a way to show the positive side of it. It shows us how we should live our life to the fullest and always keep on smiling day in day out no matter what.The performances by every single actor is spectacular. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is absolutely terrific here and makes us feel really sympathetic towards him due to what he goes. Seth Rogen is perfect for playing Joseph Gordon-Levitt's best friend. He's very funny throughout and there's a great amount of character development to him. Anna Kendrick is also great and the bond she builds with JGL is executed brilliantly. Anjelica Huston and Bryce Dallas Howard also do their roles justice.The writing in this film is excellent. It's clear how Will Reiser takes his own personal experience and makes something incredibly moving. I love how each character develops and the impact they have on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character which helps him grow as a result.50/50 was executed really well surprisingly. It's got a great amount of humour to make you laugh and a great amount of drama that's both emotional and heartwarming.",8,0,0,18 June 2020
Da 5 Bloods," A mixed bag of feelings
","Spike Lee is one of the most interesting filmmakers out there. His films have a lot to say and he isn't afraid to voice his opinions. I thought BlacKkKlansman was pretty good but this film is definitely a step down from that.Da 5 Bloods is about four soldiers that return to Vietnam years after fighting in the Vietnam War and try to find their fallen squadron leader and the gold they all hid.This film really put me on the fence. There are parts of it which I like and other areas which I didn't like. I get what Spike Lee was trying to convey relating to African Americans in the war and the problems with it but I feel his execution of the subject was lacklustre.A few things I did enjoy were the four main cast members. At the very beginning of the film I really felt a sense of camaraderie between them and I especially liked watching Delroy Lindo's performance throughout. The use of archival footage added to the realism of the film with some creating a very intense and uncomfortable feeling to the viewer. I thought the changing aspect ratios worked for the most part. The war scenes that were shot in 4:3 seemed like footage that was actually filmed long ago.Apart from that, the film is flawed. A huge technique which bothered me throughout was how Lee wanted to tell the audience the film's themes. There are many moments where the characters just talk about the film's themes without us trying to figure it out ourselves. It gets to a point where it feels preachy. Clearly subtlety is not a strong factor in this film. There's a sequence where a character miraculously finds something which seemed way too convenient for that to happen. The dialogue was pretty bland and I wasn't a fan of some of the editing choices. With a runtime of 2 hours 30 minutes, it could've been cut down to be a tad shorter as some scenes drag.I don't think Da 5 Bloods is as bad as some people say it is or as good as some critics say it is. There are good parts to it but it's unfortunate Lee took a few bad decisions to convey a story that had potential. You can watch it if you want but I would skip out on this one.",5,1,2,21 June 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," It gets more intense and brutal
","I love the first John Wick. It had such a simple premise and presented itself better than majority of the action films nowadays. John Wick: Chapter 2 expands on its universe which pushes the boundary of realism.John Wick: Chapter 2 continues the story of John Wick who is forced to pay a debt that leads to a bounty put on his head.What really stood out in the first installment was the presentation of its action. Never have I seen action this well choreographed and shot in an action film before and Chapter 2 builds on the action and stunts further to make this as enjoyable as the first one. The action in this film is as entertaining as it is violent. This is one of the bloodiest films in the last few years but at the same time it gets your blood pumping. The testosterone part of me just gets excited whenever I see John Wick fight. Whilst the story could be improved, the action is practically perfect.Aside from the action, the first John Wick had a story with depth to it and a great motivation for John Wick to come out of his retirement. This one focuses more on the world John Wick takes place in and once you learn more about how this assassins-filled world works, the film becomes more intense and fascinating to watch. However, Derek Kolstad went a bit too far as the universe seems too unrealistic. At the end it's shown how a lot of people are involved with this system and I personally found it hard to believe that this many people were assassins.Keanu Reeves is practically John Wick at this point. You simply can't deny this man's commitment towards the action scenes. All the other cast members like Ian McShane, Riccado Scamarcio and Laurence Fishburne are also fun to watch.John Wick: Chapter 2 manages to increase the intensity with phenomenal action scenes and unveiling a world that keeps your interest piqued. Despite the universe's unrealistic nature, this is a strong action film that any action lover would not turn down.",8,0,0,4 January 2020
Annihilation," Plot holes aside, this is a very thought provoking movie
","After watching Ex Machina, I immediately saw Alex Garland's next feature Annihilation and it was one of the most interesting films I've seen.Annihilation is about five scientists that sign on a dangerous mission into The Shimmer, a mysterious zone that's unlike anything on Earth.When the movie finished, I couldn't help but think about it for a long time. Yeah there are a few plot holes which I couldn't ignore but there is also so much that this film offers that makes you want to talk about and that's one of the best parts of Annihilation. This is a sci-fi that will really stick in your head. Like Ex Machina, Alex Garland implements many themes and ideas that will get fans of the film to analyse in immense detail.The movie also looks incredible. The look of The Shimmer is gorgeous and once we actually go inside it, the experience is further enhanced by the fantastic cinematography. There are some really suspenseful moments especially one including a bear that increased my heart rate and kept me on the edge of my seat. The execution of tension is done really well. The music towards the end is great and adds a great amount of intensity and atmosphere to what's taking place.The performances weren't amazing but they weren't terrible by any means. I enjoyed watching Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh as I thought they did a good job. Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson were fine. I thought they could have been a bit better. Oscar Isaac was also really good.Despite its thought provoking story, this film is nowhere near perfect. There were a couple times where I questioned characters' decisions but thankfully it didn't ruin the experience as a whole. The pacing could have definitely been better. All the events that happened before they entered The Shimmer felt a bit dull due to how slow everything progressed.Annihilation had caught my attention without a doubt. It certainly has its flaws with its pacing and some plot holes which are hard to dismiss but I love what Alex Garland is doing with the sci-fi genre. Both his movies aren't perfect but they do raise interesting questions whether it's related to AI or nature.",7,1,3,8 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My favourite Star Wars film
","I remember watching The Empire Strikes Back when I was young and just completely loving it. Even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back follows Luke Skywalker training more and more to become a Jedi whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia are pursued by Darth Vader.After A New Hope, everyone was so excited to see the next Star Wars film. It became one of the most anticipated films of the early 80s and once it finally came out, people just fell in love with it. This is the best Star Wars film to date and here's why.First of all the camerawork in this movie is absolutely excellent. RIP Irvin Kershner, you did a great job. The special effects definitely evolved since Episode IV as they look really good. It's astounding to think that this movie came out in 1980 because how beautiful the set design and effects were. Whilst A New Hope didn't have many fight sequences, this one has plenty and the action scenes are extremely entertaining to watch that keep the adrenaline flowing.Apart from all the positives mentioned, the area where this film shines is its characters. The acting by everyone was superb once again. Writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote a beautiful script as we learn more about each of our beloved characters. The chemistry between Leia and Solo is fantastic and quite funny at times. We learn a lot about Luke's past and his relation to Vader which makes up for a great conflict between the two. If you thought Darth Vader was evil in the previous film, wait till you see how menacing he becomes in The Empire Strikes Back. This film also gave us YODA which was an absolute treat.The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars film and I don't think any other film can reach its level. The film is well paced alongside some incredible action sequences that keep the intensity going. Our heroes are given a lot of depth which makes us root for them and care about them throughout and the villains have never been so menacing. The Empire Strikes Back is a classic and will remain a classic for a very long time.",10,0,0,10 December 2019
The Nice Guys," Absolutely hilarious!
","Apart from Iron Man 3, I haven't seen Shane Black's other work but after seeing this film I definitely want to explore his filmography further.The Nice Guys follows private investigator Holland March and tough guy Jackson Healy who team up to find a girl named Amelia and solve the mysterious death of famous porn star, Misty Mountains.This is a movie that people don't make nowadays and I love how Shane Black decided to revisit a genre of film that became really popular in the 80s and 90s. A buddy cop film in this generation could've easily gone wrong but Black made it work. The 70s atmosphere feels very nostalgic and memories of films like Lethal Weapon start flooding in. The script by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi is extremely witty and funny. The jokes aren't cheap and the overall amount of them keeps you engaged till the end. The plot is very absurd but it feels right for a film that doesn't take itself that seriously. Aside from Black's script and direction, there are two more reasons to see this film.Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are superb onscreen together. They have a great amount of chemistry and make each scene all the more funny. I'm used to seeing Gosling do serious roles but this film shows his capability as a comedic actor. His comic timing is brilliant and without a doubt the highlight of the film. Russell Crowe's character is far more serious which plays a great contrast to Gosling. The action scenes involving him are enjoyable to watch. Another star is Angourie Rice who's really entertaining as Gosling's daughter. The only person I'm conflicted about is Margaret Qualley. I think she could have been better.The Nice Guys is a fun way to spend two hours of your life. The film's jokes and gags are absolutely hilarious and the cast make it even better. It's great to see a revival of the buddy cop genre. I hope Shane Black makes a sequel because this looks like a promising series.",8,2,3,2 June 2020
The Social Network," One of the most interesting character dramas made
","The Social Network was never a film on my radar but upon hearing that David Fincher directed it and Aaron Sorkin wrote it, I had to go check this film out. I have no regrets.The Social Network is definitely one of the most engaging dramas I've had the pleasure of watching. Everything was pretty much bang on. Fincher's direction was immaculate. Every scene was clear and had a great style to it. What really stood out to me was Sorkin's script. I knew Sorkin was one of the best scriptwriters working today but here I was just in awe at his work. Each and every dialogue felt captivating and added a lot of personality to everyone's character especially Mark Zuckerberg. The cinematography was top-notch and the music throughout felt very fitting to whatever was going on in the scene.Jesse Eisenberg owned the role of Zuckerberg. He delivered his lines so well and proved to me that he is capable of handling a serious role. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake were also perfect in their roles and gave their best performances.Even if the film is factually inaccurate at times, the drama and conflict that takes place between the characters creates such an investing experience that you tend not to think about what aspects of the film are true or false.I would highly recommend The Social Network. On a technical level this movie is outstanding. The direction by Fincher and screenplay from Sorkin provides us an engrossing insight into the troubles faced by Zuckerberg after the creation of Facebook. This film has to be watched if you've never seen it.",9,0,0,6 July 2019
