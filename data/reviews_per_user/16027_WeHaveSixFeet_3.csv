Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Characters I cared about would have been nice.
","I'm a huge fan of the original, but Phantom Menace seemed to me a cold, uninvolving picture about its own special effects.  I didn't care about any of the characters, if you can call them characters.  Anakin Skywalker didn't seem to have any of the fear or anger he should have, and the Jedi knights have nothing to say.  As for Jar Jar Binks ... must KILL.",1,0,1,7 June 1999
Apocalypse Now," The rerelease is AWFUL.
","What possessed Coppola to add all this silly footage back?  The movie was unwieldy to begin with, but now it's a rambling, often pointless everything-and-the-kitchen-sink art film.  And the music.  Oh, the cheesy sounds-like-John-Carpenter-wrote-it electronic organ music!  Not only bad, and badly produced, but occasionally laughably inappropriate. 
Bring back the studio cut!",2,8,16,27 August 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I you haven't a trace of magic in you, you'll love this...
","It's a movie made for people who think that magic is cute and fun.  If you're a fantasy fan like I am, and believe in magic (in a fictional sense) then you may very well detest this movie, as I did.  Magic comes easily to little Harry Potter, who has no personality to speak of except that he is occasionally sad that he never met his mum and dad.  Years of abuse and neglect have left not a mark on him, so when he gets invited to Hogwarts Academy of Magic, he has nowhere for his character to go.  There he flies around on his broomstick and gets to be a big hero quite by accident without ever confronting any serious obstacles or anything resembling a plot.  In all this, the film is an excellent adaptation of the book, which also thought that magic is cutesy wootesy.",1,21,56,8 December 2001
