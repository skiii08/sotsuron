The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant filmmaking. A great idea made into a great film.
","The Blair Witch Project is the scariest movie I've seen in long time, if not ever. As an adult, growing up with horror films by Carpenter and Craven, it now takes quite a film to even bring a shiver anymore. The first ten minutes of Scream looked to fill that void until it devolved into a mimic deconstruction of the horror genre. But Blair Witch takes you on a realistic, psychological journey into a terrifying myth and keeps you hooked (and scared) for 90 minutes. The last 30 minutes creep by as the overall sense of dread turns into living, breathing, palpable fear, both on screen and in the audience. A fantastic film that deserves a large following outside of the cult/college/festival circuit.",10,1,2,23 June 1999
