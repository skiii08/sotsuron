Howl's Moving Castle," A solid Miyazaki film with a little too much deus ex machina
","First to note: This is probably one of the best English VA'd Miyazaki films, especially for Calcifer (who is portrayed perfectly by Billy Crystal.) Anyway, this is another solid Miyazaki film, though probably not his best. The film begins with a character named Sophie in another magical world. There is a French commune undertone in the city. She is transformed into a very old woman and learns to live with her problems by living in well, a magical Moving Castle with Howl, Calcifer, and Markl. The plot becomes convoluted by the end but overall, it's the relationship between these characters that makes the film what it is.However, the villain is a bit underwhelming here, the oddity between Calcifer, the Witch, and Howl is strange, and the ending has a deus ex machina feel to it. At least past the scene at the King's castle, the movie feels quite rushed as well which results in the ending feeling a bit too weak compared to his other films.As with most of Ghibli's films, it deals with the environment. The main girl is also older than in many of other Miyazaki films, being in her late teens rather than early or younger like in other films. It is overall different but similar, but not the best of either type.7.7",8,0,1,3 November 2014
Interstellar," A movie with a large amount of tesseract-ion
","If you get the pun from my summary, you'll probably like the film as much as me. If you like physics, you'll probably really enjoy this film. If you wanted a more scientific/grandiose/unique/different version of Gravity, you'll probably LOVE this movie.Before I go on, I have one sole complaint about this film (well 2 but one of them contains a spoiler.) My main complaint is that while Zimmer makes another excellent soundtrack, this movie has an Inception-esque problem. The music becomes way too loud at certain points, enough to make the audience not being able to hear some of the important dialogue. The second one refers to someone breathing a bit too long. I won't say more as not to spoil.The movie is headlined by an excellent performance by McConaughey as Cooper, a farmer/engineer/astronaut, as well as a well done supporting cast including 'Murph' by a few people, Hathaway as Amelia, a fellow astronaut, and Caine as Amelia's father. The visuals are beautiful as is the cinematography, the worlds are well-made, and the plot, while convoluted (though not as complex as some of Nolan's other works) works out well.As someone who finds the concept of black holes fascinating, I highly enjoyed this film.8.8",9,0,6,17 November 2014
Spirited Away," One of Miyazaki's best
","This was the film that introduced a whole lot of Americans, including myself to Miyazaki. While it isn't my favorite anymore, it's still one of his absolute best. The English VA is also pretty good as well.The film starts with a whiny girl named Chihiru. As with many of his other films, the girl develops through magic and choreography. The visuals are stupendous with creatures of various sizes, colors, and shapes. No-face is probably the oddest character in the movie, and the one that could potentially give kids nightmares. I'd recommend this movie for 10 and up because of that guy alone.My single complaint for the film is that the scene in Swamp Bottom is just a bit too happy for it's own good. It somewhat removes the watcher from the experience of the film and makes it a bit to sappy.Otherwise, this film is well paced and well balanced. I don't want to spoil much as this film is just wonderful.9.6/10",10,0,2,3 November 2014
Grave of the Fireflies," A film that shows both the cost of war and the idea that animation is not just for kids
",Grave of the Fireflies is possibly one of the saddest film I have seen. It isn't one for a feint heart but one for those who wish to see the true cost of war. It should be a required viewing for teenagers maybe...maybe it's a bit sad for that but it probably should be anyway.The main character are Seita and Setsuko. The film starts at the end and the knowing idea that what happens happens is part of the depressing nature of the film. Seita is a wonderful older brother but it shows how powerless a young citizen such as himself can be in time of war.This is not a film for a lot of people but it should be shown to that many. It is depressing but for all the reasons that it should be.8.9,9,0,1,3 November 2014
Inception," One of Nolan's Best: The world of dreams, as seen in a blockbuster
","Is this life? If everything is realistic, what is fake? Am I, in a dream? The concept of this film is excellent, take the idea of dream interpretation and turn it into a film, add some Nolan-style plot and some blockbuster visuals and Bam(!), you have this glorious film.A little complaint before beginning this review is that Zimmer's music becomes a bit too loud at certain points. However, there is rarely dialogue so it isn't a problem. * Dicaprio, Page, and Cotillard star as the main three characters of the film and all three of them give excellent performances.Page's dream sequence in the early portion of the movie is fascinating and I wish they spent more time dwelling on what can happen in a dream than go quickly into the action in the later sequences.The plot thickens, almost a bit too much and then it goes back to the guns and explosions seen in a blockbuster. It somewhat relies a bit too heavily on these guns in the next dream sequence but thankfully it goes back to the plot. I won't say much more as I don't want to spoil anything. Speaking of which **: * Also, his score is excellent, 'Time' being one of his best pieces, which is saying a lot.** In terms of the ending, I do not think he was. See, no spoilers and I gave my opinion.",10,0,1,17 November 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A mesmerizing, but bizarre film backed up by outstanding performances by Keaton and Norton
","The first thing to note, for those who do not know is that the film looks as if it was done in 1 take. Big 'revelation' aside: I came into this movie knowing just about nothing outside of what is listed above, the odd preview, and the fact that I knew I would enjoy the score. I also knew I enjoy the actors in previous films and I knew I previously didn't like the director in Babel. I came out thinking this is my favorite film of the year so far.Keaton plays Riggan, an actor who is most famous for writing, well, Birdman. He is shown to be rather psychotic, having an altered personality, shown through almost dream-like sequences with him arguing with his creation known as Birdman which results in among other things broken glass. Through him dealing with these sequences, he is trying to make a play while dealing with his self-conscious, the other actors (especially Shiner, aka Norton,) his mentor, his relationship with his daughter, and the 'insatiable' movie critic (had to poke fun there, sorry.) Norton is outstanding as well, portraying his relationships as well as his view of his own life compared to what he can act as. He steals the show in the majority of scenes, especially in the roof-top scenes and the play scenes at the table.The other actors/actresses serve their parts outstandingly as well. The critic is as pessimistic as she should be and his daughter shows the angst and uncontrollable emotions of someone her age. The new actress shows her doubt but how she enjoys what she wants to mean to do.The film is backed up with an outstanding realized drum-solo score that keeps up with the brisk-unrelenting pace. You feel as tired as the actors but also in awe. Jokes are occasionally said but they work just to calm down the emotions of you and the characters. It builds and builds.Nominations for sound editing and cinematography are potentially a shoe-in for this movie. Everything just works together, thanks to the powerful direction as well.9.6/10",10,4,12,3 November 2014
Princess Mononoke," One of Miyazaki's best
","Fun info: This is Miyazaki's first forgo into computer animation, used in the dark 'snakes' near the beginning and a few other scenes and is also one of his most violent films. It also has a solid English dub.It concentrates on a different type of character than most of his films, a young man, Ashitaka, rather than a young woman. His quest does not change him like in many other films but rather he changes many others. The film leans just enough on environmental issues to show a cause while allowing the graphics and story you desire from a Miyazaki film. Special note to the soundtrack which is one Ghibli's best. It concentrates on an iron-works and the battle between various factions of humans, the beasts, and others.I don't plan on spoiling much else as the films plot speaks for itself. My only complaint is that certain scenes drag a bit too long and if anything a bit too much blood spills at a certain part of the film. Otherwise, this film is excellent and one of his best.9.5/10",10,4,6,3 November 2014
