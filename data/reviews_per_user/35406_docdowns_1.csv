Iron Man 3," Less on screen time for Iron Man than the Avengers movie.
",Why don't movie makers understand that when we go to a super hero movie.. we don't want to see the hero struggle with NOT having their powers? I honestly believe that if you break it down.. Iron Man had more screen time in 'The Avengers' than he does in Iron Man 3. I'm completely sure the suit is in functioning order more often in Joss's spectacular.Also.. they make the same mistake as 'The Dark Knight Rises'. The over the top.. but very well played villain turns out to be a lackey. A useless nothing that is completely disposable. Thanks for setting us up for a twist that neuters the interesting part of the story.My advice. Wait until you can see it for free or for just a couple dollars as a rental at most.,4,5,11,5 May 2013
