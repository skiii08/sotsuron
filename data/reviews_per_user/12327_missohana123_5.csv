The Ring," Best Horror I've ever saw!
","The Ring, that movie wasn't just disturbing and mysterious, but special. No other director could film a horror movie like this. Not a lot of gore in the movie, but shows lots of details that can wet your pants. The sound effects were great, such as the unearthy wind passing by. The graphics where great, like grayish clouds movie fast, and sinster looking places. This movie might be a PG-13 movie, but it's a hell of a horror movie compared to R rated movies. I've NEVER saw a scarier PG-13 movie. Compare it to Gothika, which ones scarier? I have to say The Ring was more scarier. This movie is a must see! It's my all time favorite horror movie! you'll want to watch it over and over again. And oh yeah, remember to disconnect your phone....",Null,1,1,3 November 2004
Hostel," A great example on a piece of crap
","This movie is just another one of those 'movies'. What I mean by that is the stupid teen comedies where boys are craving for boobs and sex. Hostel is just about the same of Eurotrip, except it has horror in it. The horror I see in this movie is nothing. There is basically no plot to it at all! I mean, we don't even give a sh** if the guys die because you seriously know nothing about it besides their sex cravings. The first entire half was this one word: sex, sex, and MORE SEX. Actually, make that boobs. This is more like a porn movie instead. Come on, Oli is ****ing some broad in her ass in a club, then some sex house in Amsterdam or whatever! It's either Eli Roth is just a retard who's obsessed with sex and has nothing better to do or he's too stupid to direct any movie at all. Shockingly, even Cabin Fever was much better than this.Now, I can't blame everything in this movie. The setting and props were amazing and very eye-catching. Rusted chairs and torture instruments were set out pretty good. All that vomit gave you an extra touch of disgust. What disgusted me was when Josh's ankle was cut off in order for him to 'escape'. It showed really good detail and realism. One last thing that amazed me only for a few seconds was the suicide of Kana. The expressions after seeing her gruesome face showed how much sorrow she felt.The thing is, there was nothing in this movie that made your mouths open wide and leave with shock. Just obvious conclusions and a thought of 'THIS WAS A PIECE OF SH**!' I best off say, don't rent this movie. Especially if you don't like torture and violence. The torture wasn't that heavy, but if you haven't noticed all of it was basically shown on Yahoo. If you have high expectations for this movie, like I did beforehand, then watch it. Just be prepared to see lots of boobs and moaning. And yes, lots of rust and blood too.",3,1,2,30 May 2006
Saw II," The Shocking Sequel...
","Saw was already a movie with a deep, terrific plot. The sequel contained the same, although it just isn't as great as the first one. First off, there are much more people locked inside the trap. Therefore, if one gets angry or upset, they can kill each other, like Xavier did. Chaos and fights will start between people, unlike the first one where there were only an amount of two, so if one dies the other one will most likely go too. Torture scenes were just as brutal and left you with eyes opened wide enough to make your eyes dry up. Such as Amanda jumping into a pool of syringes, Obi being cooked up in an oven.Parts of the movie weren't as confusing and mind boggling anymore. I understand that 'The Devil May help You' for Obi, but it's kind of obvious. Also, the first one tells the story of each person and WHY they are in the trap and HOW they aren't appreciating their lives. This one only explains probably one or two.I'd give props to the ending, because it was just a complete shock to me. I couldn't believe the fact that Amanda was faking the whole time and how she was actually helping Jigsaw, and that the surveillance camera was set 2 hours back already. As Jigsaw said, if Eric Matthews would have listened, his son is SAFE. Instead, he didn't listen, and he ended up dead, when his son was in a safe next to him.Overall, this movie was pretty good, just wasn't AS good as the first one. I would watch it again, but it wouldn't give me much interest after a while since it's pretty shady and dull.",7,4,6,10 June 2006
Saw," Looking Forward...
","This movie seems like it's a puzzle its self. It's really interesting. After watching the exclusive clips at yahoo.com, it made me look forward to the movie. This movie is more like a Action, Suspense, Mystery, Puzzling type of movie. It COULD be put into the category of Horror, but it's more like a action/mystery/suspense.I like what they mean of 'The victims are finding a way to kill themselves.' or 'How much blood will you shed just trying to stay alive?'. In the movie, there's a mastermind serial killer that doesn't kill YOU. YOU kill yourself. The killer sets up something, but no, he doesn't kill you. Then he tells you what to do, and you try to get out by doing what the clues he's telling you. BUT, when your trying, your in great danger and very close to DEATH. So is the killer killing you or are you killing yourself???? Tough decision....",Null,4,9,2 November 2004
Shark Tale," Not as what I suspected...
","One day, I was browsing the T.V, then I saw this commercial. I thought it was going to be a stupid movie, and the commercial was the trailer for Shark Tale. Today, my cousin was begging me to see it, so I went to see it. I thought I was going to be bored for the next hour and a half. BUT, the minute the movie started, I laughed and laughed, every part of the movie was funny and cool! I misjudged this movie. The actor/actress's were really using effort into this movie! It's great for kids! There's lots of humor in it to make you laugh loud in the theatre, like I did. Shark Tale is a movie you will want to see again and again, just like Finding Nemo. This movie is great for kids and adults, and it's fine and great like Finding Nemo!!!",Null,1,1,2 November 2004
