Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace Stinks!
","I can't believe how complete awful The Phantom Menace was! This film had no plot, originality, or storyline. The film had the most BORING characters with the exception of Jar Jar Binks who is quite possibly the most annoying, childish, and irritating character ever to be shown on a big screen. The Matrix deservedly won four Oscars over the awards that The Phantom Menace was nominated for making TPM the first Star Wars film to NOT win a single academy award. Also, the numerous Razzie (Worst of the year) awards just goes to show how awful this film was.The Phantom Menace feels NOTHING like the classic Star Wars trilogy. Let's hope that Episodes II (Attack of the Clones) and III (Fall of the Republic?) are a 1000 times better than the complete travesty that is The Phantom Menace! One on a scale of 1-10 and that's because I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, just not a TPM fan!",1,30,58,13 March 2002
Minority Report," Best Spielberg movie in years with Cruise's best performance! The best science fiction thriller since The Matrix!
","After seeing the Minority Report attached to Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones I knew I had to see this film. It combines the directoral expertise of the best director of all time, Steven Spielberg with super star talent of Tom Cruise. Now while I'm not the greatest fan of Cruise (His Mission Impossible films are quite silly at times) I do enjoy him in his dramatic roles such as The Firm and Magnolia, and I even liked his comedic role in Jerry Maguire. However, Eyes Wide Shut was terrible and don't even mention Vanilla Sky. Now, not only does Cruise star in an action film, but quite possibly the best film of his career. Spielberg gives audiences not only great special effects, but also great direction, a great screenplay and a cautionary tale of big brother government watching our every move.The special effects are actually BETTER than those in Attack of the Clones, and the jetpack scene alone is worth the price itself. The only thing to be cautionary about is a weird eye operation scene (Obviously a nod to A Clockwork Orange) in the movie which will make some audience members squeam. Other than that, a TERRIFIC science fiction masterpiece and the best science fiction thriller since The Matrix kicked The Phantom Menace's butt back in 1999! By far the best film of 2002 so far!After the BORING A.I. and the AWFUL Vanilla Sky Both Spielberg and Cruise are finally back on track! A 10 out of a 10!",10,0,0,8 July 2002
Fight Club," Quite simply, the best film of 1999!
","Wow, unlike the very OVERRATED American Beauty, which won the best picture Oscar (What was the academy thinking?!), 1999's other film about mid-life crises, Fight Club, at least had the guts to say what was on it's mind without the complete hypocrisy found in American Beauty! Sure, Fight Club used anarchy to prove the point that American society is based on commericalism, but at least it wasn't hypocritical like American Beauty was! Great acting from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, great social commentary, and great direction from the always terrific David Fincher makes Fight Club the best film of 1999! A 10 on a scale o 1-10!",10,0,2,27 March 2002
Lost in Translation," By far the best performance of Bill Murray's career, he deserves the Oscar!
","Even after all of these months, Sofia Coppola's amazing second feature, Lost In Translation continues to amaze audiences worldwide with it's intimate tale of two lost and lonely Americans staying abroad in Tokyo. Here, Murray emphasizes restraint in a performance that is definitely the best of his career. His Bob Harris is the embodyment of an actor truly on the downslope of life. After decades of playing lovable clowns in mainstream movies, his has wisely chosen to work on more independant and personal projects. This film, which was written specifically with Murray in mind was tailor made for his cynical type of humor. (Sean Penn was also very good in Mystic River, but I thought his performace was too over the top, and I felt his performance in 21 Grams was a lot more restrained, but, the academy will ultimately have to decide.) Matching him perfectly is the beautiful and talented young actress Scarlett Johansson who does an amazing job of convincing the audience that not only is she a Yale philosophy graduate, but, also a mature young person looking for her direction in life, despite the fact that she was only 18 when playing this part! Both Murray and Johansson were recetnly honored with best actor and actress awards at the British Academy Awards. I hope that the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences can also honor Murray with a Best Actor Oscar this year!This movie is not for everyone in that it is a slow, and meaningful character study of two people drawn to each other in a foreign city. If you are looking for another wild and zany Murray comedy, you might be disappointed in that this movie is more of a quiet character study with some humorous moments spread throughout the film. However, once you relate to these two characters you never want to see it end.This is one of the best films of 2003, and proof that Sofia Coppola, the first American female to be nominated for Best Director has a very promising career ahead of her.This movie proves that you can often find true love where you least expect it!A 10 on a scale of 1-10.",10,0,1,20 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," SPOILERS: MUCH better than The Phantom Menace, but not quite as good as thefilms in the classic trilogy, MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!
","I was able to catch an advanced showing of the Star Wars prequel, Attack of the Clones in Westwood. The showing was for a large group of theater owners to get them excited over the film.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!      MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!
Attack of the Clones starts out with an explosion of a boomerang shaped Naboo starship and an attempt on former Queen, now senator Padme Amidala. The film, after an exciting chase on airspeeders, through the vast openness of Corescant breaks down into two seperate sections, Anakin traveling with Padme to protect her from potential assassins, and Obi-Wan sent by the Jedi Council to investigate the recents attempts on Padme's life. One of the things that make this prequel far better than The Phantom Menace is that the storyline is designed for a more mature audience, as much of the kiddie humor is eliminated as Anakin is now more fully grown as a Jedi Apprentice.There are even some nods to the classic trilogy, (Obi-Wan slicing off a bounty hunter's arm in a Corescant bar, a chase in an asteroid field above the surface of Coruscant, etc) I also like how much more fully developed the characters are in this film as compared to Episode One, instead of a whining, pouting Obi-Wan Kenobi, as a Jedi Apprentice, we see this character better developed into a younger version of the old wise Jedi Knight that we all know and love from the classic trilogy. Even though Anakin has replaced Obi-Wan as the whiny Jedi apprentice this time.Some parts of the film still get quite silly though as the romantic elements could have been better written, I mean, I realize that Anakin and Padme are supposed to fall in love so that they can produce both Luke and Leia, from the classic trilogy as their children, but instead of a mature romance, Lucas goes for a usual teenage romance with many of the same consequences and bickering. The sequence where Anakin and Padme share time on a Naboo lake can get quite irritating to watch as it disrupts the flow created by some of the earlier action sequences. The scenes with Anakin and Padme on Naboo talking about politics and their course in life, in my opinion was the weakest part of the film. Those scenes just really slowed things down quite a bit. Plus, yes, folks Jar Jar Binks IS in the film as a bumbling senator with much of his juvenille dialoge attached, forunately, his scenes are brief, and his vote on an important scene in the senate shows the important element he is to this film. Also, this may sound a little too picky, but as watching the movie I couldn't help but notice that the characters from The Phantom Menace (Obi-Wan, Padme, Mace Windu, etc.) don't look much older than they did in that film. However, Anakin looks a lot older in the film as it takes place ten years after the events in The Phantom Menace, which is another small problem that bothered me from time to time as I was watching this.Obi-Wan then begins his investigation into the attempts on Padme's life on a watery planet called Kamino the source of the Clones in the film. (The special effects in this sequence make the rainstorms in The Perfect Storm look outdated by comparassion!)We begin to see Anakin's turn to the dark side as something dreadful happens to his mother and the actions that he takes in revenge. This is a very emotional scene and will bring chills to the audience.Which finally leads to the all-out battle action sequence on the planet Genossis, where hundreds of Jedi battle all sorts of battle droids and Genosians, (who look like tall walking/flying grasshoppers with weird laser guns), Another thing which slightly disappointed me was the lack of a major space battle at the end making this the first Star Wars film of the saga to not end with a major space battle of some sort.In short, Lucas has more than made up from the downfalls and mistakes displayed in Episode One, and this time has thankfully returned to the fun and excitement displayed in the films of the classic trilogy! The audience of theater owners gave the film a loud applause after the credits ended and many of them cheerfully stated that Attack of the Clones was really the film that episode one SHOULD have been. My faith in the Star Wars saga has cheerfully returned after many years.The performances are much better than those in The Phantom Menace, Heyden Christensen makes a much better Anakin than the bratty, Jake Lloyd. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan seems more comfortable than he was in Episode One, and Natalie Portman's Padme Amidala has eliminated much of the monotone performance she had in the last film. The REAL standout however, is Christopher Lee whose Count Dooku is on par with his evil performance as Sauroman in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.So to break it down here are the high points and low points of Attack of the Clones:HIGH POINTS:Better character development than in The Phantom MenaceMore mature screenplay with less juvenille jokes.Amazing special effects on par with The Phantom Menace.Jango Fett and Count Dooku are much better villians than Darth Maul was in episode one.LOW POINTS:Romantic elements between Anakin and Padme can get quite silly and conventional at times.Slow pacing as a result of those scenes.Jar Jar still has some of his juvenille dialoge intact.No big space battle at the end.
An eight on a scale of one to ten.",6,1,1,6 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Lord of the Rings trilogy has replaced the Star Wars prequel trilogy as the new science fiction franchise of the 21st century!
","Wow, Peter Jackson has accomplished the impossible, by bringing the most beloved book series of the 20th century to audiences of the 21st century with magnificent results. The characters really stand out, the costumes are terrific, and the special effects really give Industrial Light and Magic a run for their money. It's a shame that Jackson didn't direct Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, because he would have brought a lackluster script to life!Peter Jackson has now become one of a very select group of directors such as Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to helm a true timeless masterpiece!Nominated for 13 academy awards and winner of four Oscars, The Fellowship of the Rings is one of the best films I have seen in over ten years!A 10 on a scale of 1-10!",10,1,1,11 June 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," This third film has great action, but isn't quite fulfilling!
","I just saw The Matrix: Revolutions, which is a huge improvement over the lackluster Reloaded, which opened earlier this year. However, with that being said, it's not the trilogy ender that many had hoped for! The first Matrix is by far the best science fiction film of the 1990's and even though Reloaded wasn't nearly as inventive, I did want to see what loose ends were in store for our heroes in this third and final film in the Matrix trilogy!MILD SPOILERS AHEAD:Highlights: The battle of Zion between the APU's and the Sentinentals is easily the best part of the film, and I actually felt sorry for Mifuni after he stood up to all of those Sentinentals, in fact I felt more emotional for the passing of his character than in the passing of a certain major female character towards the end of the film. Also, the Neo vs. Smith end battle has tremendous special effects, but we've seen it before and after the exhausting Zion battle nothing could top that! Also, interesting is the battle in Merovingian's S&M club at the beginning of the film.
However, with all of that great action, I have to say that there are some questions to be answered, as the end of the film wasn't the ending that many had hoped for and left a lot of unanswered questions. Plus the way that the Neo and Trinity characters are finalized may frustrate those who are passionate about these characters. Morpheus has little to do in this film as opposed to the action he had in Reloaded. The standout characters in my opinion were Niobe, a great pilot, Captain Mifune for standing his ground against that massive flood of sentinentals and, Seraph, who shows he can kick as much butt as Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus.If you're looking for great action, Revolutions has the most action of the three movies, but if you're looking for a philosophical resolution to the trilogy, you may be disappointed.A 9 on a scale of 1-10 for all of the great action.A 3 on a scale of 1-10 for the storyline and script that we've come to love from this science fiction trilogy!So I would round out both numbers and give it a 6 on a scale of 1-10!With that being said, it is still THE science fiction trilogy/ franchise of the 21st century to beat!",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
American Beauty," This movie won best picture?! This movie was just plain TERRIBLE!
","I know that American Beauty won the best picture Oscar in 1999, that being said, this movie has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever seen, it is quite hypocritical and left leaning, two things I hate most about films. It involves a man who is enduring a 'mid life crisis' instead of taking responsibility for his life, he quits his job, makes his family life hell, and fantasizes over a teenage girl. (Is this guy a pediophile or something?!) The only 'normal' people are a gay couple living next door. (The writer, Alan Ball, is openly gay so he wanted a black comedy with gay people in it!) Even the next door neighbor is shown as a sadistic bully! Anyways, the film shows how messed up our society is if we work hard to achieve the American dream. I didn't buy it, and found the whole movie to be a complete hypocritical mess. If you want to explore similar themes without the hypocrisy, go see 1999's Fight Club starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, which is ten times better than this OVERRATED mess. A one on a scale of 1-10.",1,8,21,27 March 2002
Independence Day," Independence Day is really dumb, stupid, and pointless!
","I had completely forgotten about the AWFUL mess known as Independence Day until I saw Men In Black II and I remembered that Will Smith also starred in this film. Watching parts of it again on the F/X cable channel confirmed my earlier opinions of this film. Roland Emmerich is a terrible director, (Stargate, Godzilla, and the goofy Mel Gibson film The Patriot amoung his credits) but none are as truly bad as Independence Day was.This film rips off those cheesy Ed Wood science fiction films so badly I had to leave the theater before it ended. Goofy special effects, and some of the worst banter ever written! (Can you believe it won an oscar for special effects, even over the terrific work done by ILM on Twister!)The success of Independence Day is summed up by one word: HYPE, it was the hype, just as in the case of the similarly awful Titanic, that got people into theaters nothing more. Now that time has passed on both of these films we can call them two things, AWFUL and OVERRATED!A 1 on a scale of 1-10.",1,13,23,8 July 2002
Batman Begins," Batman is back and better than ever! Begins is a whole new Batman!
","After four films, (since 1989) and years away from the big screen, Batman 'Begins' in a whole new way, and it's by far the best adaptation of the caped crusader on film yet.Batman Begins, written by screenwriter David S. Goyer, and directed by Christopher Nolan, is definitely the best screen version of one of the most popular icons in American history.After more than half a century of his adventures in print, and on television, we now find out about the beginnings of the caped crusader, where he got his state-of-the-art Batman fighting costume, his utility best, his cool gadgets, his Batmobile, and how the Batcave was conceived. Best of all, Batman Begins allows the audience into the mind of Bruce Wayne and why he became Batman himself in the first place.For the first time on film, Batman is not upsided by the villains of the piece, but rather Batman/Bruce Wayne himself becomes the most interesting character of the film with some of the coolest gadgets seen in a comic book movie. Christian Bale does a terrific job of becoming Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman, while Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman shine in their supporting roles.Only Katie Holmes is wasted as Bruce Wayne's supposed love interest, Rachel Dawes, an assistant Gotham District Attorney, and is given nothing much to do in this film.Cillian Murphy, known to audiences in the film 28 Days Later, does a great job of portraying the frightening Scarecrow.All I can say is that Batman is back and better than before, bring on the sequels of young Batman and many more to come! After years of Marvel dominance at the cinema, DC comics is finally back on track!A 10 on a scale of 1-10!",10,2,4,10 July 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," As amazing as The Fellowship of the Ring was, The Two Towers is superior and the best film of 2002!
","Yes, fellow Rings fans, I have seen it, the film that millions have been patiently waiting for, the sequel to the 2001 smash hit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, along with top studio executives at New Line Cinema who all cheered for nearly twenty minutes after the film's end!Unlike my other reviews, I won't spoil my review with spoilers until the majority of fans have seen the final film!WOW! This is by far the best film of 2002, and as terrific as The Fellowship of the Ring was, The Two Towers tops it by a long shot!This film, as everyone knows, is the middle chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films. It has no beginning story, and no end story, but is simply the middle chapter, and like most middle chapters, it's darker, a LOT darker than the first film with a lot more action and detail. (Gimli, in my opinion, steals the show with his humor!) If you are waiting for a long exposition like at the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring, it comes half way through!The special effects, well, let's just say that Gollum is the best looking CGI character to ever hit the big screen and wait until you see Treebeard and the Ents!The battle of Helm's Deep, involving thousands of Uru-Kai warriors, is one of the most amazing action sequences ever to be put on film!This film, like the last one, ends on a cliffhanger with all of the characters facing new dangers. And I won't spoil any of it for those looking forward to it!It looks like once again, Peter Jackson is indeed the Kiwi George Lucas!!Great action, cinematography, acting, and direction make this by far the BEST film of 2002!The Two Towers is quite possibly one of the best sequels to ever hit cinemas!Harry Potter, eat your heart out, The Two Towers will show the world, once again, who is the top fantasy film series!!!If an 10+ rating were possible I would definitely give The Two Towers one!!!!!!!!!!Expect, once again, massive box office returns , and several Oscar nominations next year for The Two Towers!PRE-ORDER YOUR TICKETS FOR THE TWO TOWERS NOW, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!A 10 on a scale of 1-10.",10,0,0,4 December 2002
Schindler's List," Steven Spielberg's best dramatic film is finally on DVD!
","I distinctly remember seeing Schindler's List in a darkened theater during my last year attending the University of Southern California, back in late 1993. The buzz about this film was astounding. Fresh from directing the summer 1993 box office smash, Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg was about to completely abandon the famous popcorn movie for which he was so well known to take on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, the holocaust. Many critics doubted that Spielberg was up to the task of directing such a dark moment in human history.This film is by far Spielberg's best dramatic film, this and Saving Private Ryan proves beyond any doubt that Spielberg is more than capable of directing a powerful dramatic film as well as other great directors like Martin Scorese and Francis Ford Coppola. His use of black and white only illustrates how great and mature a storyteller he has become in recent years.The 11 years since it's release has deminished it's impact on society, but let no one forget the haunting images of this masterpiece.The DVD looks completely amazing with terrific digital clarity, and great sound. Unforunately, as with Spielberg's other films on DVD, this one has no director's commentary whatsoever.This is defintely the best film of the 1990's and winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Oscar worth performances from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley, and of course, the memorable Ralph Fiennes!This haunting film also proves without a doubt that Spielberg is one of the best directors to ever work in Hollywood!",10,9,13,4 March 2004
Men in Black II," Not quite as funny as the 1997 first movie, but still a very funny movie overall.
","Back in 1997, after the huge success of Independence Day, (A film I will never watch again, it's THAT stupid!) I was not a fan of Will Smith. His television show was annoying to watch, and I didn't like any of his films with the exception of Six Degrees of Seperation to which he tried some dramatic roles and succeded, (Far better than he did with Ali) However, with the original Men In Black, I actually liked Will Smith as his charming personality won me over. I liked the chemestry between Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as secret policemen who protect the Earth from the scum of the universe.Now it's five years later, and both Smith and Jones put their black suits back on for more alien busting in Men In Black II. Now while the sequel doens't have the freshness of the first film, it has a lot more action and I actually liked the action packed ending more than the slow finale of the first film. Smith and Jones are a joy to watch and I'm sure America will be watching Men In Black sequels as long as they continue to make money at the box office. (Please, Will, don't make an Independence Day sequel, though, that movie was awful!)In any case Men In Black II is a funny film, that while not as original or fresh as the first film, it does have a lot more energy than the first one does.7 on a scale of 1-10.",7,0,0,8 July 2002
Titanic," A summary of why Titanic is the most OVERRATED film of all time!
","I have said it before, and I'll say it again, Titanic, along with Gone With The Wind are two of the most OVERATED films in history, with no plot, stupid characters, and irritating dialoge! Think Romeo and Juliet aboard the Titanic and that best sums up this three hour plus film.Titanic continues to be one of the biggest movies of all time, (why on Earth did moviegoers pick this mess to be a hit?) It involves a very spoiled and irritating girl known as Rose, played by Kate Winslet, who goes aboard a state of the art ship known as the Titanic with her snotty finacee, played by Billy Zane. She doesn't care for him so she hooks up with a drifter/artist named Jack played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The majority of the film is about Jack and Rose trying to avoid her fiancee while the ship itself hits an iceberg and sinks, killing many of the passengers aboard. The reason why so many teenage girls went crazy for this film is because it has a story that only a teenage girl could love with it's simplistic dialoge and cliched characters. I was hoping by the end that Rose herself would be hit by an iceberg as her character was really becoming annoying fast!Now, what bothers many moviegoers is that instead of being about the ship itself and the people who died, the film focuses on another silly 90210 teen romance. We have seen this type of romantic film hundreds of times before, and the romance in Titanic is about as interesting as a can of flat soda.While there are some nice costumes, and effects work done on the sinking of the ship, audiences must endure over two and a half hours of some of the most irritating and cliched dialoge ever written ('I'm just a tumbleweed blowing through the wind?!') as well as a lot of boredom waiting for the ship to sink. I had to be woken up by my wife when the ship sank while seeing it on DVD (I never saw it in theaters, because no film could live up to that amount of hype and after finally seeing it on DVD, I was right) Everyone I have talked to says that seeing the movie on the big screen makes a bigger difference in the special effects, well I have a HDTV big screen and that's about as close to a motion picture screen you can get watching a home video DVD.All in all, Rose isn't a woman searching for herself, but rather a spoiled brat looking for attention, and I never related to Jack one bit. I guess the only characters who I felt any real sympathy for were the captain and the ship's designer, as the film doesn't really focus on any of the real victims of the event other than the ficticious Jack and Rose.I enjoy some of James Cameron's films, (True Lies and Strange Days, which he wrote, are two of the best action films of the 1990's!) But, Titanic wasn't the 'classic' many have hailed it to be!A 1 on a scale of 1-10. If you want to see a real film about the Titanic rent the original, not this awful mess!Sure, most teenage girls will go crazy over this, but, I'll take Good Will Hunting anyday over this mess!",1,8,14,13 October 2002
Titanic," The most OVERRATED film of all time along with Gone With The Wind!
","I cannot for the love of God, believe how extremely OVERRATED James 
 Cameron's pile of garbage known as Titanic is! This film, which should 
 have been about the actual sinking of the great luxary ship Titanic, 
 instead relies on a 90210 idiotic love story to 'carry' the picture 
 through. IF the two main characters had been interesting, it might have 
 been a better picture, but, alas, the two leads, Jack Dawson, and Rose 
 Bukater are about as interesting as watching paint dry. Rose isn't 
 suffering from oppression, she's suffering from SPOILED BRAT syndrome! 
 Jack comes along like a teenage pretty boy rather than a compelling 
 character that the audience relates to.
 
 The film does have a few assets such as costume design, and some of the 
 special effects are pretty good. However, it's the whole script and 
 it's 90210 meets the Titanic setting that makes this the most OVERRATED 
 film in the history of motion pictures! This film grossed $600 million 
 in the United States?!?! James Cameron must have put mind altering 
 drugs into the prints of the film to hypnotize movie audiences and 
 academy members who gave this stinker Best Picture of 1997 over the 
 great L.A. Confidential.
 
 One on a scale of 1-10. Great costumes and special effects cannot make 
 up for a ridiculous screenplay and dull leads. Want a great motion 
 picture try L.A. Confidential, or Citizen Kane instead!",1,23,155,16 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The movie is SO overrated, Lord of the Rings will RULE!
","I have seen both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings during the past couple of weeks. Both have an unbelieveable amount of hype behind them, and both films are based on extremely popular fantasy book however, that's where the difference ends. Harry Potter is just hype and Lord of the Rings is what delivers. But, that's another review. Harry Potter is an eleven year old boy living in England with his irritating aunt and uncle who really don't care for him. He is wisked away to become a wizard at Hogwarts school of wizards. From there he makes a lot of friends and learns to become a wizard. He plays games on broomsticks, and fights a lot of fake looking monsters. And in the end, he meets the evil wizard who killed his parents. Now, the film isn't that bad, but it's really silly and got quite boring after a while, some of the sequences were ripped off from The Phantom Menace, (The Quidditch match, etc) Anyways, kids love it, I didn't A 3 out of 10, decent special effects, and sets, but, a bland, and unoriginal script that only children who are diehard fans of the book will enjoy. (I have not read any of the books, and this movie makes me want to stay away from them.)Wait for the hype to end and see it on video!",1,7,17,12 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry OPENED big, but The Two Towers will be the REAL deal!
","Okay, this is my second posting after someone felt the need to trash my first review of this AVERAGE film. Everyone knew that this film would OPEN big. However, with Die Another Day opening this weekend, look for the grosses to drop. As for the film, it follows the book TOO CLOSELY, and there is absolutely no originality to this or the first Harry Potter film.Only the true diehard HP fans will appreciate everything this movie has to offer, and thus has a niche audience as well. I have noticed a trend: It seems that instead of watching the HP films for what they are, people are constantly comparing the movies to the books, noting the similarities and differences in each. Given, anyone that watches a movie after reading the book will more than likely make comparisons. It seems that the director was trying too hard to please the diehard Harry Potter fans more than make a film for his own sake.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring managed to do what the first Harry Potter couldn't, to be a great book AND film at the same time. Both Harry Potter and The Fellowship of the Ring were big hits at the box office, but Lord of the Rings managed to win just about every kind of award conceivable while, (Four Oscar wins) Potter was recognized for what it is, a children's movie with NO Oscars!In contrast, The Lord of the Rings films (also based on books) are Peter Jackson's own vision of the series, rather than just a routine retelling of what happens in the novels. He managed to incorporate the entire LOTR phenomenon into the films, not just the books themselves, and as a result, the world of Middle-Earth is a living, breathing tangible entity. Plus he didn't feel the need to stage things exactly the way they happened in the novels. A good example of this is his use of elements mentioned only in the appendices of the last book, most notably the scene in the first film between Aragorn and Arwen. Arwen was barely mentioned in the first novel, but Jackson manages to make you care about this little known character who's willing to give up an immortal existence to spend a mortal life with the man she loves. It's these reasons I feel LOTR is the far better series, and I have complete confidence that The Two Towers will knock everyone's socks off just as The Fellowship of the Ring did!An average 4 on a scale of 1-10 for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!GET READY FOR THE TWO TOWERS OPENING ON DECEMBER 18TH, 2002 ORDER YOUR TICKETS EARLY!!!",1,3,10,20 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Okay, young kids will love it, but I'll take The Two Towers!
","A couple of minor spoilers are ahead:Working for the film industry, I, along with my young nephew, were among the first people in the world to catch an advanced screening of the new Harry Potter movie. Now I'm not a Harry Potter fan in the least, (Sorry, but I prefer the Lord of the Rings books) and, while this IS a better movie than the first Harry Potter, I didn't think it was THAT spectacular.
Once again, in the beginning, Harry is picked on by his aunt and uncle until a small elf like creature named Dobby warns him against going back to wizard school at Hogwarts.Sure, the three kids are a likable trio of magicians, but, it seems that Ron, the redheaded fellow, has little to do in this film until the end. And, I also found Kenneth Branagh's professor character to be quite silly, not to mention that there is this REALLY annoying computer generated character in the movie, named Dobby which is nothing but a huge pest, always warning Harry about bad things to come at Hogwarts complaining to him about bad things that happen to his fellow students, after a few of them have turned to stone.While the film has some great effects, (The flying car ride to Hogwarts, the kenetic Quidditch match which is done better than in the first film, a wizards duel between Harry and this blond headed bully, I can't remember his name, and the ending within the Chamber of Secrets,) I still havn't been able to discover what so many  children and teenagers find so fascinating about these books. And, like the first film, it's too long.These films seem to follow the books too closely, and while children may love the idea of how the films match the books neatly, it gives filmgoers no surprises in seeing them. To be fair, my nephew who is 9, loved the film, even more than the first, and he says he will see it again on opening weekend.As for me, I'll be waiting until December 18th, the day that Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers hits theaters, THAT'S the film real fantasy purists REALLY want to see this holiday season! (Maybe it's a generational thing, with younger people prefering Harry Potter, and young adults prefering The Lord of the Rings.) However, as I stated earlier it is a better film than the first one although barely.Sure, this film will make LOTS of money, but The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring proved that it can also make lots of money, AND earning numerous film awards while being a great book AND a great movie at the same time. Sadly this is not true for the first nor the new Harry Potter film.An average 4 on a scale of 1-10.",1,3,10,13 November 2002
War of the Worlds," Steven Spielberg is back with one of his darkest and frightening films yet!
","I have always admired the films of Steven Spielberg from the horror of Jaws, to the drama of Schindler's List, from the terror of Jurassic Park, to the onslaught of Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg is a director that rarely disappoints, and War of the Worlds has Spielberg back at the top of his game.War of the Worlds is the latest of alien invasion films that once again has unkonwn entities from other worlds attacking our planet for reasons unknown.Unlike the extremely insulting Independence Day, War of the Worlds does not insult or injure the audience with a stupid script. It's terrifying events will haunt audiences for years to come.Tom Cruise is Ray Ferrier, a divorced New Jersey dockworker/crane operator whose two children visit him for the weekend.In the middle of his weekend visit, lightning strikes occur all over his neighborhood, and all havoc breaks loose.From that moment on, War of the Worlds has you in it's terrifying grip, and never lets go.From a jaw dropping ferry sinking, to an all out battle between alien tripods and the U.S. military, to it's frightening conclusion, Spielberg carefully balances out all out science fiction battle sequences and scary moments perfectly.The great thing about War of the Worlds is that the film focuses of Ray and his family, rather than stupid action sequences like those found in Independence Day. Ray isn't a hero, but rather a father trying to keep his children alive.That is why Spielberg has become our modern day master filmmaker.War of the Worlds is a terrific movie and gets a 10 on a scale of 1-10.",10,1,6,10 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Star Wars Saga Ends Gracefully and Tragically With Revenge Of The Sith!!
","Some Spoilers Ahead:After six films, and nearly thirty years, the Star Wars saga, which is the most popular films in cinema history, ends once and for all, with it's tragic third episode, Revenge of the Sith.I am happy to say that Revenge of the Sith is the prequel Star Wars fans have been waiting for!For Star Wars, and for it's fans, the six episode saga has been a bumpy road, with the highest of highs, with the classic Star Wars, and the lowest of lows, with the first episode, The Phantom Menace, regarded by many as the worst Star Wars film, which chronicled the beginning of the saga by focusing on the younger Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi. It was followed by 2002's Attack of the Clones, which was a big improvement, but followed by some moments of silly dialoge, and a very cheesy ending. However, once again, it was a big improvement over the awful Phantom Menace.Thankfully, Star Wars Episode III, titled Revenge of the Sith, remedies many of the problems found in the first two episodes of the saga, and thankfully links perfectly with the classic trilogy started by Episode IV, A New Hope.The three main characters of the Star Wars prequels, Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala, and Obi-Wan Kenobi show up for this tragic episode of the Star Wars saga. This time Anakin Skywalker is a full fledged jedi knight, and Obi-Wan Kenobi has been promoted as a member of the jedi council. Padme Amidala, now married to Anakin, is now pregnant with his children, and a full fledged member of the galactic senate.The things that have changed the most from the previous episode is that the galaxy is in full battle of the clone wars between the separtist forces and the armies of the galactic empire.The thing I liked most about Revenge of the Sith is that the tragic events that unfold in this film take center stage, and childish jokes and outbursts are put on the sidelines for a much darker and much more enjoyable final episode of the Star Wars saga.For the first time in decades, I knew that I was watching Star Wars again, and I throughly enjoyed it, as well as seeing Darth Vader on the big screen for the first time in decades.This is by far my favorite of the three Star Wars prequels, and I think that George Lucas has done a great job of wrapping things up in his fantastic science fiction saga!Of course, as dark as events transpire in this episode, thankfully they are followed by the three films of the classic trilogy known and loved by millions of Star Wars fans around the world, which wraps things up completely in the saga!An 8 on a scale of 1-10! Thanks for thirty years of great science fiction, George!",10,2,7,11 July 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Not only the best film of 2003, but the best film of the Lord of the Rings trilogy!
","I just came out to see The Return of the King, the third and final chapter in the highly successful Lord of the Rings trilogy.WOW! Not only is this the best film of the year, it manages to top both the first and second films.The battle outside of Minas Tirith is possibly the greatest action sequence ever put on film, and it will be talked about for many years.The scene in Shelob's lair, both frightening and exciting!Every one of these characters has a moment to shine.Of all the characters, Sam shines the brightest in this film!Thank you Peter Jackson for creating to film, the greatest literary achievement of the 20th century.This trilogy will become the highmark of professional film-making for many years.This is by far the best film of 2003, and if the academy doesn't reward Peter Jackson, there is no justice! He has redefined the fantasy film the same way that George Lucas redefined science fiction nearly 30 years ago!A 10 on a scale of 1-10!",10,0,0,17 December 2003
The Matrix," By far the best science fiction film of the 1990's!
","I remember back in 1999, movie audiences were also treated to what is by far the best science fiction film of the 1990's, The Wachowski Brothers brilliant science fiction masterpiece, The Matrix.Now, I was a little sceptical at first of seeing the film, because I am not a big fan of the below standard acting skills of the wooden Keanu Reeves, however, after seeing the fantastic trailer, I knew I had to see this film. WHAT CAN I SAY, The Matrix gave science fiction fans the best script in nearly a decade, since 1991's Terminator 2, by combining action, philosophy, and intelligence all tightly wrapped up with the most state of the art special effects.No wonder The Matrix completely stole the thunder from The Phantom Menace, it had originality, and some of the best action scenes ever put on the big screen. A 10 on a scale of 1-10!",10,0,0,31 January 2002
Fantastic Four," Forget The Naysayers, The Fantastic Four ROCKED!
","Okay, so Fantastic Four wasn't Shakespeare, heck, it wasn't even the best Marvel film yet. However, I will say that I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this silly, but ultimately fun movie.Fantastic Four, as everyone knows is about five scientists who travel into space to study a space comet, when the comet hits the shields of the station they are on.Each of the scientists returns to earth with a new power. Reed Richards becomes Mr. Fantastic, and can make his body stretch like rubber, Susan Storm becomes the invisible woman, who can turn invisible and can create shields, Ben Grimm becomes The Thing, a superhuman of enormous size with incredible strength, and Johnny Storm becomes The Human Shield who can 'flame on' at any time and fly! Also on board is the evil Victor Von Doom who eventually becomes one of the greatest villains in Marvel history, Doctor Doom who can generate massive amounts of energy and whose body becomes the hardest metal on Earth. He's definitely my favorite character in the film! Of course with this being an origin story, it takes time for things to get moving, but once the chips are firmly in place, the film takes adventure to new heights.Sure, it's not the best film of the summer, but I did enjoy it throughly. If you go in with reasonable expectations, you'll pleasantly enjoy this movie.Ignore the critics, Fantastic Four is fantastic!A 7 on a scale of 1-10!",10,72,136,10 July 2005
The Island," Despite all of the hoopla, I didn't really like this movie at all!
","Yep, I caught a preview of Michael Bay's new film The Island over this weekend, and to say I was unimpressed is an understatement. I realize that Michael Bay is an over the top director, but it seems every movie he does is the same.The Island, is about cloning and focuses on two characters, Lincoln Six Echo, played by Ewan McGregor, and Jordan Two Delta, played by Scarlett Johansson.The film's premise is that these 'clones' are working in a utopian society, when they are really part of a harvesting project that creates clones for high paying users.The films action sequences, such as a freeway highway chase are somewhat exciting, but the storyline is predictable and completely unbelievable. Never once did I find a shred of believability in this film.Ewan McGregor, terrific in the right roles, just doesn't seem right for this film, and Scarlett Johansson isn't quite believable or ready for action films yet, in my opinion, she should stick with independent films, where she completely shines! With many other great films this summer, I would best say wait for The Island on video.A 3 on a scale of 1-10.",1,13,49,10 July 2005
