The Blair Witch Project," Frightening to the Core!
","This movie scared me; not from the things I saw, but from the things I didn't.  With virtually no budget, this extremely original idea for a movie freaked me out more so than any other horror I've sat through.  It kept my interest and was one of the best films I've seen this year.  The realism was unbelievable, and that's what makes it so brilliant!",9,1,2,19 August 1999
