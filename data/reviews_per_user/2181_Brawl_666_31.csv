The Devil's Advocate," banal, pretentious, amateurish.....
","So, in this film they pair one of the the greatest actor of all time, Al Pacino, with the worst actor of our generation, Keanu Reeves. The premise is audacious and intriguing : no matter how terrible your crime, no matter how obvious your complicity, Kevin Lomax can save you from conviction. He's a brilliant young criminal defense lawyer with a small problem : he has a conscience, and a very real one. With every case he wins, his personal guilt mounts, because he is all too aware that all his clients were guilty....Soon, Mr. Lomax gets a call to the big boys' club, in the form of an enormously powerful law firm in New York. He is befriended rather quickly by his new boss, John Milton, a fiery, enigmatic and strangely charming man who always seems to know things the others don't.....Lomax and Milton's first meeting, on a designer rooftop, is spectacular, both visually and symbolically. There's an elevator scene where Lomax's mother and Milton meet, which is one of the eeriest things I've ever seen. TDA sets itself up beautifully, and then like most other films blows it all to hell. Now who else but a criminal defense lawyer with a perfect record would get a call from Lucifer, right ? It sounds perfect, metaphorically, and it IS perfect, but instead of taking the film in that direction, it turns into a freak show (i.e. cheap-thrill-type horror). Its an engrossing film that runs out of steam just when its getting interesting, and the final act is bizarre and anti-climactic. Too bad. This could have been a truly great Al Pacino film....",1,13,33,19 December 2009
Se7en," grim
","David Fincher's fiercely idolized Seven is certainly an interesting and well-made film. Finely acted, meticulously shot and composed. It very effectively portrays the greatest city on earth as dark and Gothic, rotting and falling to pieces, its citizens weary and confused. What prevents Seven from being a true masterpiece is that there is very little meaning or depth below the layers of supposed erudition. It doesn't help to allude to Dante and Chaucer when your film has nothing to do with their work ; it seems to me that these references were deliberately added just to create a false sense of meaning in the minds of viewers who don't know any better. Ah, Thomas Aquinas ! Hemingway !!! Deep stuff this must be......well, not really, though. The film is content to scratch the surface of difficult ideas, hinting at more interesting things but resolutely going for the cheap thrill nine times out of ten. John Doe is a grand and terrifying killer, but one that exists only in the imaginary world of movies.",8,1,3,24 April 2010
Insomnia," under-appreciated Nolan film....
","Nolan's sophomore effort is unfortunately jinxed as being his most underrated, although arguably his strongest film so far. A detective whose task is to nail a killer finds himself murdering a colleague, because he might have compromised his decisions on past cases to Internal Affairs. The man is conscientious - did he kill him on purpose, or was it a genuine accident ? He cannot decide, but either way he did fire the fatal bullet, and this robs him of his sleep - hence the title. Worst of all, the killer he's looking for saw him do it and is now threatening to compromise him further. So very Shakespearean - Nolan himself calls it 'Hitchcockian' on the director's commentary. Pfister's camera takes in some gorgeous Vancouver scenery, and Al Pacino hits this one right out of the ballpark. Just watch Pacino during the interrogation scene. There's a beautifully acted moment when he is restraining himself terribly from lunging across the table and strangling the murderer - so much does he hate his guts. Nolan is so intensely focused on the internal drama of the leads, he chooses very simple and direct shots, which are nonetheless elegant. Compare this to David Fincher's Seven, an exquisitely stylized movie that is ultimately about nothing real. Unlike the chilling but wholly unrealistic John Does and Hannibal Lecters of the film world, killers in real life are most often the weakest of human beings - Fincher admitted this with regard to the Zodiac killer - and that is the whole point of Robin Williams' character in Insomnia : a weak, cowardly and very ordinary man who becomes a killer simply by unfortunate accident ; a forlorn middle-ager who dares to imagine himself in love with the first seventeen-year-old girl who gives him some attention, and then kills her when she offends him by literally laughing at his advances.Admittedly Nolan's austere visual style may leave something to be desired for. Occasionally the film feels too talky - too much dialog and character-based exposition, and too little of things actually happening. But these are minor nitpicks.Apparently there weren't enough Batmobiles and explosions to satisfy the popcorn-munching hipster douche bags who also saw this film. Empty thrillers like Seven and The Silence of the Lambs which are thematically hollow and pointless will always garner greater popularity than a deeply psychological film like Insomnia.",8,1,2,19 December 2009
Alien," what nightmares may come...
","Extraordinary sets, visuals and perfect pacing create a mood and tone that has perhaps not been achieved by any movie before or since. Scott is aware that the anticipation of fear is far more chilling than the actual fear itself, and this cardinal law defines his whole approach : Economy. We barely get a few glimpses of the creature, and even at the end we don't see it fully. The film's characters disregard good sense at every stage, and do everything to put themselves in harm's way for the benefit of the audience. The only thing that looks dated in this three-decade-old picture is the alien itself (although it is still a frightful beast). To miss the film's mind-boggling production design and photography would be a crime, even for those who dislike horror films (me!). The images of space owe their very existence to 2001. Alien is one of the earliest reminders of how revolutionary Kubrick's film was.Unlike 2001, this film will never stand up to a rigorous scientific evaluation. Its no more than a haunted-house film set in space. It is intense, but not profound. The film's gritty and vivid atmosphere creates a degree of verisimilitude which makes it particularly frightening. I wont watch this again.P.S. : Just about every sci-fi/art film has at least one bum line that I can see coming, and which makes me cringe. In Alien, you have Ash the robot mouthing the following pearls of wisdom : 'I admire its purity. A survivor - unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.' Ugh ! Disgusting line. These facile notions of 'human nature' persist to this day, meaning only that nobody really knows much about what we are.",10,1,3,2 October 2010
The Godfather: Part II," pretty amazing
","You're not allowed to dislike this film either. This is a massive achievement in every possible sense. Indeed, there is little that rivals these two films in opulence or production scale.Coppola doesn't shy away from trying new things. Michael Corleone's story-arc is more realistic, more ambitious than anything in the first film. The scale of crime is upgraded. And I had never expected to see that scene between Michael & Kay, where she tells him of her departure, 'because of this 2000-year-old Sicilian thing.' Vito Corleone's backstory follows the earlier, more conventional combination of style and myth. Actually, Coppola makes Vito's arc too obvious, as though he's following a checklist. But again its very tastefully done, so you enjoy it.I guess what this film lacks is a simpler plot and the phenomenal pacing of the first film. Also missing is the magisterial presence of a certain Marlon Brando. It is easier to appreciate this film when you place it together with the first, as one single epic of the rise of one Mafia generation, followed by the decline of another.",9,4,7,18 October 2009
Armageddon," jumpy camera + ADD editing = not good
","I always watch a few minutes of this movie whenever its on, trying to understand the 'hatred' that viewers supposedly have for Michael Bay films. I never do. I can only ever make sense of it by assuming that the masses need objects for communal hate, just as they do for communal love. In this way, Bay has unfortunately become an emblem of tasteless, disposable cinema. So Steven Spielberg = good, Michael Bay = bad. This mindset is what Orwell called the 'gramophone mind'. In principle there is little difference between the aforementioned two; Steven's films are only slightly less empty than those of Bay.On pure filmic grounds there is just one really huge problem that this movie has, and thats the editing style Bay adopts once we're in space. The jazzy, frayed film-cutting is very unpleasant, and, as it turns out, a poor choice. Because ironically, while its intended to pump up the volume, it actually makes the viewer numb and squanders any excitement the action scenes might generate. Such head-pounding montages add up to over an hour of the film. Other problems include an overkill of gay mano-a-mano moments. Liv Tyler is obnoxious. And, this movie essentially has no characterization; most of the characters are meatheads and have interchangeable dialogue.The money-men haven't held back; this is a massive, massive project. Apparently they got access to actual NASA labs and facilities. And Bay has shot it beautifully for the most part. The creepy asteroid is the most surreal and outlandish place we've been to since since the derelict spacecraft in Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. The Armadillo is as awesome as the Nolan Batmobile. I think that, with some reasonable adherence to space science and a leaner, more well-organized screenplay, this could have been a much more balanced movie. Bay's previous 'The Rock' is better, and also has great humor.The current generation of film viewers is a lazy one, having gotten used to relying on Tomatometer percentages rather than individually analyze & evaluate a film's merits & demerits. Armageddon is indeed an out-and-out corporate product, but it has undeniably inventive visuals. Image is the language of cinema, and if Kubrick is the Kafka of film, beginning the transformation of image grammar, then Bay must be kinda like Dickens, the master of conventional storytelling.The detractors of Armageddon are the equals of Jerry Falwell.",6,0,0,16 June 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Mediocre, and deliberately so...
","I have no idea how James Cameron, assuming that he did see this, did not reach for his sleeping pills. Michael Bay & Paul Anderson are unjustly derided as the worst directors working today; none of their films, with maybe the exception of Pearl Harbor, are less than watchable. The crown must belong to Jonathan Mostow, who with this mega-abortion proves himself to be the most soulless capitalist whore of them all.It wasn't necessary that this film had to be so abysmally bad - it could have been watchable and reasonably competent even without trying anything radical. But the brazen approach that Mostow and the producers have chosen, to rehash all and change squat, to deliberately aim for the lowest possible denominator, this is the epitome of the most abhorrent and depressing attitudes in mainstream film-making. Of course, these smug a-holes can get away with it because they know there's a ready market for car chases & special effects that don't alter from one film to the next. There's a ready crowd of idle, passive, self-professed 'fans' who can be whipped into a viewing frenzy by means of bombastic advertising, plus industry-endorsed film pundits who only care about their paychecks, and nobody will be the wiser. The loser at the end of day is the average movie-goer who has no idea he has been film-flammed by marketing.T3 takes place entirely in movieland, where nothing is real or plausible or of any consequence. Its the passive film-viewer's most delirious fantasy come alive. It has 'cash-in' plastered all over it. The thing couldn't possibly get worse, till you notice that this film scores 6.7/10 at IMDb and 70% at RT. The 'tongue-in-cheek' humor that everyone was clamoring about is revolting. Was that what the first two movies were about ?? Anyone who rates this higher than 1/10 deserves to have their film-viewing license revoked.",2,0,4,19 October 2009
Apocalypse Now," Rain of Madness
","Apocalypse Now is a nosedive into madness, both literally and metaphorically. A film made with sheer egoism, but in the spirit of uncompromising art.We know that this film arose out of the director's attempt to adapt the modernist novella Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad. We also know that Mr. Coppola actually went to the Phillipines to shoot this film, that too just after the war had ended, and that the film was very nearly not made at all, because of immense production hassles which might have seemed obvious to a more sober (and less successful) director.Being well acquainted with the novella, I can confidently say that the film version is NOT successful at articulating the ideas of the original work. Some of the dialog in the film - the briefing given to Willard, the photographer's rants, Kurtz's last lines - seem to be simply lifted from the novella and pasted onto the film, without any proper explanation or context. No Country For Old Men is a film adaptation of a book that is obstinately true to its source, articulates its ideas correctly, and also stands independently from the novel as a film on its own. If we didn't know the source for Apocalypse Now, there would be no way to make sense of the climax. Definitely not. In fact, the film is anticlimactic - the first two thirds are a surreal tour-de-force of visuals, sound and fury ; the last third is a disappointing damp squib.I would say that this film demonstrates the limitations of cinema. In a play or a novel, the writer has all the freedom to conjure up whatever he likes, and it is all upto him, it is as he wills. Whereas a film relies on the co-operation of literally hundreds of artists and technicians, and rarely does the director, producer or writer have complete authority over the final product. For instance, everyone knows how Marlon Brando behaved on this project, and the climax' failure is more his fault than the director's - the film was doing fine precisely till Mr. Brando shows up. Also, literature has far more freedom of technique - for example, Heart of Darkness relies heavily on ambiguity to play up the readers' perception of Kurtz and his life - while film-making often has no comparable equal to many of these techniques.The film is a must-see, however. Forgive me, thats putting it way too lightly. What it lacks in consistency and coherence, it more than makes up for in sheer visual and technical virtuosity. In an age when there was no CGI, no sophisticated camera rigs and steadicams, and no optical FX, Mr. Coppola and master cinematographer Vittorio Storaro conjured up a surreal montage of imagery that leaves one breathless, and nearly appalled in fact. The film seems to shuffle colors, textures, tones, light and shadow like a pack of cards. In particular there are two sequences - Willard's first encounter with the Air Cav, and the chopper assault on the village - that are more surreal than anything made by Kubrick or Fritz Lang or anybody. A chopper airlifting a bull for a meat roast, the choppers taking off and approaching the village with Kilgore kicking off Wagner at full blast, 'Hi tiger, bye tiger !', the playboy bunnies' lap dance, colored smoke grenades, the flare attack, the ghostlike bedlam at the final bridge - these images indelibly stab your memory.The additional footage in the REDUX version doesn't really add anything more to the original version, by way of greater insight or substance. The French plantation sequence has one comment on the Vietnam war that would not have been allowed back in 1979, had the US government had its way. For instance, Black Hawk Down was made entirely with US military support. Which is to say that the Pentagon suitably airbrushed the script, completely throwing out the Somali perspective (which the book included) and portraying the Somalis as the bad guys and the American troops (surprise surprise) as the good guys.In short, far from perfect, but perfectly insane, and also perfectly unavoidable.",10,0,1,19 December 2009
Collateral," Dazzling....
","Tom Cruise used to be so cool, even despite his overt narcissism. I think the last good role he did was in 'A Few Good Men'. Its been a downhill ride ever since, and it took Michael Mann to get a somewhat credible performance out of the guy. This film portrays Cruise as a ruthless , nihilistic and ultra-violent sociopath (wonder if Nicole Kidman wrote the script) who spews bullets and philosophy with equal ease. Cruise does somehow manages to ditch behind his usual confidence-lacking arrogance. In fact , he doesn't look OR feel like the annoying superstar we've known for years. There are moments where a chill will run down the spine of even the most jaded viewer. The assassin Vincent with his icy composure, forward momentum and cold, understated humor is one of the most genuinely frightening screen fiends we've seen in years, and even more astonishing is Cruise who inhabits the role with seeming ease. Vincent the assassin represents the end product of several ages of psychological evolution : the script presents him as an almost cyborg-like killer who does what he feels is necessary, seemingly without emotion, but we also see that Vincent is obviously highly self-motivated. He is in perfect control of his senses and intellect, he keeps his own counsel, and he is perfectly aware of how his ugly past has molded his present state of mind. In short, this is not a serial killer or an adrenaline junkie out for thrills ; such people are propelled mainly by an inner emptiness and a lack of awareness of their own motives. Whereas Vincent is highly self-aware and psychologically astute, and he is no stranger to the ambiguities of life. He is a career criminal, just like Neil McCauley (De Niro) in Heat. He does what he does because it is all he knows how to do, and because it pays well. He is a murderer for hire.I don't know what made Mann choose the Thomson Viper digital camera for this film, but it simply works wonders. Because digital cameras are currently better suited for low lighting, there is not much artificial lighting, since the whole thing takes place at night. And the result is that for two hours, you are transported away, not to movieland, but to the sprawling urban landscapes of LA. This is distinctly NOT the LA of Heat - a dusty oil canvas - but a nocturnal, otherworldly LA where there are seemingly no bounds between mind and reality. The city seems to reflect the characters' minds, and the characters themselves portray a city on the brink of unconscious chaos. Violence lurking behind every false facade. No other film that I've seen seems to be so real AND dreamlike both at once.Michael Mann's greatest talent is precisely as a PHOTOGRAPHER. This film doesn't have a realistic story (for one thing, Mann makes Cruise seem a lot smarter than he actually is), but he shoots it so well that it creates a believable illusion of reality. Collateral is not a film whose brilliance you notice on a first, or perhaps even a second viewing. Its not jammed with wall-to-wall action. It doesn't have frenzied camera movements or gimmicky '24'-style editing to compensate for a clueless screenplay. And to tell the truth completely, Collateral lacks even a competent story. But what Michael Mann has always been great at is conveying the FEELING, the sensation of being right there, of knowing those people in front of you. You will instantly recognize the characters played by Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith. You see a window open into the lives of these individuals.",8,1,1,24 October 2007
City of God," viewers are humbly advised to look beyond the stylistics
","'Cidade' has its merits. The photography is unmatched and the editing/structuring is extremely clever. Its an effective and pretty bewildering film, but on subsequent viewings this looks more like a barrage of cinematic tricks and literary devices rather than a study of human nature. All those dazzling stylistics are a knockout on a first viewing, but they also allow passive and ignorant viewers to vicariously enjoy the violence, like an action movie or a cartoon. Thats why this film is so popular. After having recently viewed Slumdog Millionaire, I seriously doubt this film's pretensions to realism. Though I'm sure its still far more factual than SM.When you watch the film again with some care, you'll notice how contrived it really is. All films and all stories are contrived, I know, but there ARE films that overcome this problem. Even purely theatrical films like 'Glengarry Glen Ross' and 'Quiz Show' are far more realistic, convincing and illuminating than 'Cidade' ultimately manages to be. The filmmakers succeeded in their primary endeavor, but they forgot to stitch up the seams. Examples : In Brazil, motel = whorehouse. Rocket sleeping with the white journalist was ridiculous. And not being detected by the cops in that barely concealed hiding place was equally unbelievable. Also, the Runts kill Lil' Ze like what, FIVE SECONDS after the cops leave the place ??? Knockout Ned's death seems to be the hokey 'violence-begets-violence' message you can expect from a film like this.This is an unnerving, mind-boggling cinematic tour-de-force meant for one viewing only. Its exhilarating and visceral. But for me its not a perfect film because it doesn't make me think too deeply about any substantive non-filmic ideas. Surface shock seem to be the goal here, rather than any art or psychology. Also, the English chapter headings & subtitles (with Americanized slang) indicate that this was made with foreign viewers in mind, intended as a vehicle for voyeurism. It worked.",9,1,3,2 July 2009
Good Will Hunting," typical mainstream film product
","The only reason this movie got made, I suppose, is that Robin Williams found a role he liked and wanted to do. A few notes : (1). The type of 'genius' that is portrayed here does not, to my knowledge, exist. Mathematics and the humanities emanate from two different areas in the brain, both of which are NEVER simultaneously developed to the extent indicated here. On top of that Will Hunting has what is apparently a photographic memory. AND he's very good-looking, *AND* he's a tough. Wow. This is really yet another dumbed-down Superhero movie in disguise.(2). Psychiatry is a highly complex and arcane field, as intellectually formidable as anyone could want. You can neither embrace it nor reject it wholesale. The pompous, self-deluded disdain shown by uneducated people for 'shrinks' is here also shown by Will, thereby negating his supposed intellectual worthiness. Also, psychoanalytic theory ceased being at the forefront of psychotherapy decades ago. People who are still bashing Freud should really do a bit of reading.This falls into the category of 99% of films that are designed for passive viewing, and not to challenge or stimulate the viewer in any real sense. It all adds up to a big nothing ; just a bunch of oversweetened moments that will work for people who have no real mental life. The 'math' here is little more than a set-prop with no real depth or detail (Disclaimer : I am an engineer). Will Hunting and his coterie of 'friends' are really total dumbasses. The 'girlfriend' is skin-crawlingly obnoxious, but then again men are desperate fools, so I guess he COULD endure her.The two kids who wrote this movie have never actually read a difficult book. Its a film made BY the uneducated, FOR the uneducated. If you liked this, you are a pseudo-intellectual.",4,5,8,25 October 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Woo takes it up the --- from Cruise
","Powerfully lousy film-making. Lets see now, most good action films justify the pretext for the ensuing violence very well. Or they have some decent drama & emotion to prop up the action. Die Hard, T2, Speed, Point Break, The Rock are some examples that follow this basic template the best. And as such these are great, if empty, pieces of entertainment. You don't HAVE to be a teenager to enjoy these films.This film essentially has no organizing principle whatsoever. Cruise has hijacked the entire production. His 'ghost-direction' is painfully obvious and proves to be the death knell for the film (and Woo). The whole thing is in thrall to his infantile pretty-boy narcissism (ugh!). The man STILL cant get over his looks. Cruise is *not* an authentic human being with genuine emotional response. You'll notice he has this weird thing going on in his films where his real life & thoughts creepily show up in whatever role he may be doing at the moment (Jerry Maguire, this, MI-3). And it usually has to do with his attitude to women. He turns into this psycho creep around them. His scenes in 'Lions for Lambs' with Meryl Streep made my skin curl. Oh, the horror.No more unkind words are left to heap on the hideous Mr. Tom Cruise. He's a madman, we all know that. You, dear reader, may be wondering why I'm wasting my time on such a wearying dud. I read Roger Ebert's review after watching this film last night, and it made me re-evaluate my perception of the man. The only way to make sense of that review of his is to look at it as some kind of Kaufmann-esqe parody where he's laughing at the viewer/reader. He uses some obfuscating, post-doctoral Derrida-speak to describe what is quite obviously a very bad movie. Surprisingly, for once IMDb gives this a pretty sane (though still very high) rating of 5.6/10.Marketing blitzkrieg saved this stillborn project. No wonder Paramount got fed up of Cruise. The guy is an egomaniac, and a no-talent to boot.",6,1,2,26 November 2009
The Insider," spectacular storytelling
","I am not normally a fan of mechanically moralistic films like this one. These are essentially feel-good movies; the perspective is that of a highly simplified morality play where good and evil are radically drawn. But this particular presentation is so expertly delivered that it blows your mind. The whole thing is composed with extreme care and grace. There is a harmony among writing, acting, music and photography that is unequalled in my experience. This is one of the finest American films ever made.The point the film makes is that tobacco companies go to great lengths to deliberately make an addict of every consumer, and they go to equally great lengths to conceal the nature of their actions from the authorities as well as the public. In this film, both Crowe and Pacino's characters become 'insiders' at some point, and each man is forced to confront his conscience and make a choice between his career and conscience. The story isn't very new, but the storytelling is absolutely incredible.",10,2,3,19 August 2010
Quiz Show," Excellent
","Based on a non-fiction book by one Richard Goodwin, a former US Congress investigator who played a key role in unraveling the American TV quiz show scandals of the late 1950s. An exquisite and beautiful film.The time is the fifties, the place America : the Soviets have just launched their Sputnik, the first man-made object to enter space, heralding the US-Soviet space race and heightening Cold War tensions ; Dwight Eisenhower is in his second term as US President ; and two in every three households has a TV set. To ensure greater viewership, the producers of certain TV quiz shows secretly provided the quiz contestants with questions and answers beforehand. This virtually guaranteed the shows' popularity, because the viewers 'just wanted to see the money', as one character says.Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren plays another of his idealistic yet morally ambiguous characters, who is sucked into the morass against his will by the producers' guile, and also by his own need for fame and attention. And so Van Doren comes to make his own little Faustian pact with the Devil. Fiennes is one of those rare actors, like Al Pacino or Michael Douglas, who simply exude charisma, and whom it is always a delight to watch no matter what they're doing. And yet it is John Turturro who steals the thunder right from under Fiennes' nose. If you really want to understand the phrase 'disappear into a character', just watch Turturro in this film. In his voice, his walk, his physiognomy and right down to the movement of his eyes, he becomes Herb Stempel, the geeky and disgruntled contestant whose antics lead to the whole controversy. Every scene he's in, no matter how serious, threatens to become uproariously funny.Robert Redford as director proves to be a consummate storyteller, fully self-possessed and in control of the medium. The story is told as part drama, part history lesson and part comedy. The script is so interesting that even though one knows the outcome, its a lot of fun watching it happen. Every line of dialog is perfect, every scene is necessary no more no less. The whole film is peppered with literary and scholastic references, from Shakespeare and Keats to more obscure figures like Proudhon. The Shakespearean motifs are especially pronounced, from the verse game played by Charles' family, to the comparison of Charles Van Doren to Hamlet.This is yet another film that enough people haven't seen, or have simply forgotten. One of the very best films I've seen in some time.",9,0,0,19 December 2009
The Dark Knight," fanboy cacca
","A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like 'masterpiece' and 'crime-epic'. Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I don't blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys' hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious.I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want 'more realism' as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents' murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isn't a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks don't pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what.I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works.EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros. & the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things.",1,52,119,6 April 2009
Into the Wild," the guy needs a good shrink
","For me, this was by far the single most pretentious and overrated mainstream film of 2007. Even without reading the article on Wiki, I guessed that this guy was either schizo or bipolar. For a guy who supposedly majored in History and Anthropology, Chris McCandless was hugely sentimental and romantic, and ultimately just foolish. So he reads Tolstoy and Thoreau, and trudges off into the wild ?? Perhaps he ought to have read some Kafka and Dostoevsky too : he would have realized that for man there is simply no escaping himself and the world. So yes, society is indeed based on mutual deception and empty conventions, but rejecting everyone and everything isn't the solution. Far from it. Its much more challenging to be a part of society and yet try to lead an authentic life. How many such radicals and 'total solutions' have we already seen in the past ?? They always fail.The film itself sheds zero light on the motives of the real Chris McCandless. I don't think it tells the truth about what actually happened to him. He lives in an alternate universe where he can happily live in the wild and on city streets after living a pampered upper-class life for 22 years. No troubles, no complaints. And throughout its long runtime, the film goes on hammering the point that society and civilized men are terrible, and bums, hippies and the dregs of society are the Lord's cherished angels.It figures that Sean Penn, the fashionable self-styled outsider, would make something like this. Its right up his alley. I didn't enjoy this at all. Above all else, its dreamy and unrealistic. Its an ironic film, in that its a lesson for young people what NOT to do, i.e. turn your back on your responsibilities and look for ultimate solutions.",2,29,51,12 March 2009
Avatar," the maverick delivers....
","I was lucky enough to see this in IMAX 3D, and for what amounted to about 8 USD. I had felt that much of the hoopla about 'game-changer' and 'enter the world' was just that - marketing. How wrong I was. This is really an amazing, immersive visual experience. Much of that has to do with how the visual effects are used (in technology terms), quite apart from their actual quality and magnitude.From the trailers you just cant tell what this is actually going to be like. It looks pretty, but not so very novel, and maybe even a little disappointing. While what we get in the theatre is of another visual order. The third dimension allows for a presentation of objects that the flat screen simply cannot. Thats what seems to have worked in its favor - people going in with reduced expectations and then coming away stunned by the actual experience. Because the WAY in which photo-real CGI and stereoscopy (i.e. 3D) are combined is the key to this new threshold for visual verisimilitude.Think about the worlds that we saw in the Pirates and Spiderman movies, the Rings movies, the Harry Potter films, even the Matrix trilogy. Compare that to what we see in Avatar. Credit must be given where it is due, and the fact is that very little of what we've seen earlier compares with this film. This is essentially a different approach - they've actually created a new world out of whole cloth, and they found new ways to deliver this world visually, in spatial terms. The director's intentions - that the viewer should feel no distinction between real and artificial, that photo-real CGI should necessarily surmount the Uncanny Valley - these are achieved, at least to a far greater degree than anything we've seen before.Unfortunately the story and characters are as banal as everyone reported. I was shocked at how unmoving this was non-visually. This completely fails to engage on an emotional or thematic level. I actually felt that 300 was far more emotionally rousing, and thats pretty damning. Both the story and the storytelling were needlessly trite. Why ?? Was it a deliberate strategy to aim for the 'broadest common denominator' ?For now I believe we should see this as an experiment that largely succeeds visually. That it does not do so in other ways, that it does not enter our minds and souls, is hardly the point. This is a new way of doing things, and it is only the beginning. What James Cameron and others are doing is freeing the filmmaker from the bounds of hardware and physicality. A film can now truly be ANYTHING the filmmaker wants it to be - that seems to be the promise realized by Lightstorm and Weta. Think about when someone like David Fincher or Tarsem Singh or Zack Snyder get their hands on this technology. Someday someone will integrate narrative, imagery and music in the 'new way', and we as viewers will greatly evolve in our conceptual reasoning abilities. Audiences did not necessarily appreciate the water tentacle in The Abyss for what it was. But recall what came after that : the T-1000.Dear Lord. Fox gives this guy half a billion to make a film with untested methods, and it becomes the highest grossing film ever. Unbelievable",8,1,2,10 August 2010
Up," not just cute.....
","*SERIOUS SPOILERS* I'm amazed at how many Hollywood movies today explicitly acknowledge the power of cinema to shape minds and lives. Since this is now a trend, how can Pixar be far behind ? This film opens with a film within, the documentary on exploration which is seen by our hero as a very young child. The notions of mystery and adventure, conflated with the larger-than-life celebrity figure of Charles Muntz, burn themselves into the child's consciousness. They virtually define his life and existence. Along the way, he meets a girl who is similarly besotted with Muntz and the fantasy he represents. They get married, and their mutual love is founded on the film they both saw and fell in love with. Soon they get swept in the grind of everyday life, but they keep their dream alive. When she dies, leaving him an abandoned old man, he attempts to transform their dream into reality.So the movie begins, but the rest of it is more or less generic animated fare. And its oddly more Disney than Pixar. Sure, the animation has the usual high level and the color palette is much wider, but the comedy and action sequences are rather tame by modern standards. I actually think that 'Kung Fu Panda' (which is quite lowbrow) is more effective as an action comedy, and has a far more rousing third act. I'm surprised they didn't try to make this deeper, or extend the self-reference to the entire film. Too bad. But that opening was very nice.",7,0,0,6 September 2010
The Departed," spy versus spy
","The original Hong Kong film 'Infernal Affairs' was a cerebral tour-de-force, packed with enough original ideas to give you a sensory overload. What it lacked was polish and cinematic intensity. Imagine having an almost revolutionary script, but not enough cinematic resources to take your ideas and vision to their apex. What the script needed was precisely the sledgehammer Scorsese method, but with the emphasis on ideas rather than actors. The new screenplay, despite literally stealing every single good idea (entire scenes and even lines of dialog) from IA, manages to be distinct & original in its own right, by altering characterizations, adding some much-needed humor and expanding the scope of the tale. The story rises from a mere cat-&-mouse chase to a universal human drama. Combined with Thelma Schoonmaker's crisp, rapier-sharp editing, the film as a whole is worthy.Essentially there is much more clarity here as regards psychology and motives. Its much darker, more savage, brutal, corrupt and harrowing. To their credit they've studied the original film very, very carefully, and the ideas that the original merely touched on have been more fully fleshed-out and emphasized. The director's method earlier involved focusing the camera completely on 'strong' actors like De Niro and Pesci, so that the world would emerge FROM the characters rather than vice versa. This is different. Here too we have strong, indeed savage and nefarious individuals, but the film's focus is on motives and ideas. The blurring of identity, the illusion of loyalty and trust, the reckless moment-to-moment nature of modern life ; all these notions become transparently clear. The humor, the vicious cat-&-mouse game, the ideas and idea-characters reach a near-Dostoevskian pitch of intensity and violence. Its awesome.The screenplay improves on the original with some ingenious alterations that heighten the loss of identity and solidity. It merges the two women characters (what if the psychiatrist's hubby was the gangster-spy ?). And it adds a triple-twist by making the lead gangster himself an FBI 'mole'. I interpreted the ending as follows : the 'good' guy dies instantaneously, without the consciousness of death. He dies quickly & painlessly. The 'bad' guy, conversely, accepts his death consciously. In a sense he kills himself, he accepts his moral/psychological defeat as final. Again, this resembles the life-arcs of the characters of Dostoevsky and Kafka.Both the remake and the original are superb, each in its own right. Most people who were blown away by the remake first will not find the original film so thrilling. Its a cognitive thing, kind of like the differences between The Matrix and Dark City : whichever one you watch first, you will naturally like that one better.",9,0,2,29 June 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," someone doesn't know their Eisenstein....
","This one was a shocker all right. Its a f**k-up on a scale you couldn't imagine till you see it. This is a film in which absolutely nothing works. It is truly, incredibly embarrassing to watch, displaying cringe-inducing levels of incompetence rarely if ever seen in such high-profile films. All this is made more puzzling by the fact that they actually got the first film right on nearly all counts.In every way possible, this film makes an enormous mess. The fundamental problem here, over and above everything else, is that Michael Bay seems to have no idea WHY one shot is placed next to another. Its an editing nightmare coupled with a narrative disaster. The moderating influence of Mr. Spielberg is nowhere to be seen or felt.Wow. So much effort and money spent, and there is no impression made at all. The fanboy term 'epic fail' is very apt for this film.",1,4,14,26 July 2010
Inception," its different, and yes, thrilling too, but.......
","In Chris Nolan's films, the narrative (and not anything else) is the main character, the center around which all else assembles. In terms of narrative complexity, this film doesn't really hold a candle to what 'Memento' and 'The Prestige' (or even 'Following') gave the viewer. The narration is linear, and the story ultimately harbors no mysteries. None at all. My guess is that all potential complexities were ironed out in order to secure finance and avoid risk. Even the human drama is totally unengaging and non-complex. This film doesn't give the viewer anything non-filmic to think about. Its a decent thrill ride, albeit with a new concept.The 'money idea' here is the notion of nesting dreams within dreams in a potentially infinite sequence, like a Russian doll. This part of the film is really done well, and I'm sure everyone must hold their breath at the moment when all four (five?) levels 'synchronize' and the 'kick' is transmitted top to bottom.I suppose Nolan and his group must get credit simply for attempting something like this. Unfortunately there are problems here. The biggest one is how the dreams are constructed. They are mere action set-pieces. This is certainly not how we dream, not at all. Even allowing that, the dull and careless way in which the film is shot and edited is jarring. Worse, all the different levels are shot in the same visual style; there is no way to distinguish a dream state from reality, even when the viewer knows its a dream. Compare this with Martin Scorsese's use of two distinct visual palettes in 'Shutter Island' : one was surreal, and one prosaic; to denote two different states of mind. 'Fight Club' and 'Matrix' come to mind too.Nolan prefers an extremely wordy exposition over showing things visually. He expects viewers to understand concepts like the 'unconscious', when truly speaking, few understand it well. Everyone has heard the word; how many people have studied it as a psychoanalytic concept proper ?? Even the particular interpretation that the unconscious and lucid dreaming are given, it is all just way too literal.With all due respect, someone needs to tell Chris Nolan to allow the use of second units. I'm sorry, but it seems he just cant shoot a decent action sequence to save his life. I'm surprised how no one has pointed this out.'Inception' was financed for one reason, and one reason only. Think of the amount of money that Batman 3 will make, if only they can get Nolan on board. It will obliterate any losses that 'Inception' may make.",9,9,20,24 July 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," narrative symphony
","I'm glad that this and not 'The Dark Knight' is considered the greatest movie of all time. TDK lost that battle if nothing else. And I love how you literally just cant stop watching this film once it begins, despite the fact that it offers the viewer no challenge whatsoever. The artistry here is not in the tale itself, but in the telling of the tale. Its a hope-in-the-face-of-tragedy fable, with a miraculous twist that turns the whole thing on its head. You are not meant to ask too many questions, else the whole thing falls apart.The key to this film is the editing and the photography. The filmmakers have used the simplest possible visuals to frame the story. Two giants in the film profession lent their enormous talent to this production : editor Richard Francis-Bruce & cinematographer Roger Deakins. About 99.99 % of films rely on heavy-handed editing and camera gimmicks to tell the story, and ironically they fail. In this film you just don't perceive the role of the editor or the cinematographer, despite their continual presence. Watch how the narration, images and score are welded together in a flawless lock-step precision. There isn't a single false moment or an out-of-place/unnecessary scene; the vignettes are masterfully assembled into a seamless whole.I'm afraid I cant give this film a 10/10 because it isn't better than dozens of other films that I've seen. In this world, events occur as the story needs them, not as they might in the real world. This is done so extraordinarily well that a passive viewer will NOT notice the tricks involved. And so it gives me almost nothing non-filmic to think about. But watch this film for its narrative mastery.",9,0,0,7 July 2009
Raging Bull," career zenith for De Niro & Scorsese
","Jake LaMotta is a middleweight boxing pro. Inside the ring he's an unbridled sociopath. Outside it, he's a very, very typical and unremarkable product of his age. He's an emotionally weak, testosterone-crazed loud-mouthed roughneck, as conservative and bourgeois as they come. He's terribly paranoid about people, and has a knack for alienating his friends and peers. He's also intensely chauvinistic, seeing women as no more than f**k toys and domestic chattels. His extreme paranoia about other people's motives, his basic unsociability, his lack of self-awareness coupled with his intense jealousy for his beautiful wife inevitably destroy him. At the end, he is thrown onto the garbage heap of civilization.People say that Raging Bull is the 'we'll make our point so obvious that there's no way you can miss it' type of film. In a way this is true, because there is no ambiguity about it. It is equally true that the director is so aware of his intentions, so clear about the material he is handling, and at the same time has so much command over his craft that his film succeeds in communicating with almost anyone who watches it. Raging Bull is Scorsese and De Niro at their peaks, individually as well as in collaboration.",6,1,6,3 August 2010
Blade Runner," something different....
","There are certain movies that pose a challenge for a calm, unbiased viewer. Blade Runner is one of these films. Over the years this film has acquired the status of a religious cult, something almost akin to Scientology or Objectivism, and so its difficult to simply dismiss it as long, slow, tedious and overrated. Let me start by comparing this film to other 'sci-fi' movies. Scott's previous 'Alien' struck a precarious balance between commerce and art - not as hopelessly shallow as Star Wars, and yet hardly as ambitious as 2001. Blade Runner abandons the traditional narrative style altogether; it communicates almost entirely through images, symbols and motifs, and it has a loopy, splintered, chaotic, upside-down narrative pattern.The future is incredibly bleak. Corporations rule the roost. The government and police are totalitarian. A new type of technology allows us to play God - to CREATE human beings, and USE them for our purposes. And then to KILL them, once they cease to be useful, or before they acquire enough volition to become dangerous. The central question seems to be - who is truly human, the 'clones' or the 'natural' people ? The powerful seem to be inhuman in their exploitation of the clones, and the people on the lower rungs of the social ladder tend to be robotic in their behavior, since they are powerless and live only to follow orders. And so, as a friend remarks, the main idea here seems to be that the clones are the ONLY humans, since they are the final victims of a vicious cycle, and they alone experience any authentic emotions at all.First the pros. Money has been spent, and some shots are absolutely amazing. The remastered Final Cut is dazzling to look at in Blu-Ray. If you love production design, photography and original visual effects, you will be in heaven. Its obvious, however, that no consensus was reached during pre-production on what the final film was going to be. Now come the cons. Recall how streamlined and systematic 'Alien' was; Blade Runner sits on the opposite extreme of the discipline scale. No care has been tendered on producing a cogent, coherent screenplay. Shot composition and editing are terrible : the timing and sequencing of consecutive shots is shockingly bad, resulting in a distracting, unfocused and overly long narrative that will not appeal to most viewers. Terrible choice of music that works only for one scene (the 'tears in the rain' speech). Another thing that is, in retrospect, a failure, is the casting and acting. All the actors are consistently, terrifically bad.Blade Runner is a movie that will mean different things to different people. I don't think this is a film that communicates well at all. Its about ideas all right, but I think you should have a solid, fool-proof plan in place before you embark on any big project. Easier said than done, of course.",8,1,5,19 October 2009
The Matrix," the architecture of cognition
","'The Matrix' must be one of the most ambitious and highly successful projects of the past twenty years. Its difficult to imagine how this film could have gone from conception to execution, and succeeded with such flying colors. For a long time I've avoided writing a review because this was my 'Godfather' or 'Star Wars' movie, having first seen it at 13 and instantly falling in love with it. I could never be truly objective about this movie, nor could I find a single truthful, objective analysis of it anywhere on IMDb or RT. Roger Ebert's review was nice, but too harsh.'Bound' helped me appreciate better how 'Matrix' was conceived. Neither of these two films has a single wasted moment. It seems that the Wachowskis build a film by cascading a set of scenes, like a series of dominos, so that each scene projects into the next one. This is of course what all screenwriters do, but as simple as it sounds, it is no mean feat. The most important part of any film, I think, is how you connect scenes, how you work on transitions so as to create meaning and plausibility. What you show, how you show, and most importantly, what you Don't show. This is extremely difficult. It requires a deep understanding of the cognitive mechanics at work between a film and a viewer. It is, if you like, the most important part of film-making, as important (if not more) than the actual shooting process.The brothers nailed this whole conception business down to the last detail. The editor won an Oscar, but the film was streamlined by the directors for perfect editing. The cinematography and sound design is breathtaking. Joel Silver brought another influence to bear in terms of production expertise. They worked on the formidable design and effects requirements, even bringing in a legendary Hong Kong action choreographer for the martial arts scenes.And then they made casting choices that could not have been better. This film rests on the visual and vocal libido of the leads. It works only because the actors work, because we relate and identify with them. Just watch Weaving and Fishburne scorch the frame in their respective parts; these are their best roles. Moss is visually apt. Reeves is unwittingly perfect for his role, more perfect than anyone could have imagined.Another important part of this film is the self-reference. This film riffs on itself many times in many ways, such as when Mouse asks Neo how the machines could possibly know about the taste of Tasty Wheat. This is essentially winking at the viewer by momentarily snapping the plausibility of the whole idea. Also, this whole franchise is one big stab at the Terminator movies and their enduring popularity. Instead of time travel, we have virtual reality. Instead of terminators, we have agents. Instead of John Connor....None of this explains how they came up with this concept. The keystone of the arch is hidden. There are countless other 'influences' here : Phil Dick, William Gibson, Doctor Who, Grant Morrisson's 'The Invisibles' etc. And as with Tarantino, we are unable to say for sure whether it is homage or plagiarism. The innovation lies in the architecture of the whole thing, in the layering, in the flawless integration of so many different design elements to form a seamless, coherent entity. The Matrix is everywhere indeed.This is the only way to make movies.",10,4,8,14 May 2010
Casino," Rousing
","I've only seen about half of Scorsese's body of work, but I don't believe I would be too wrong in sticking my neck out and saying that Casino is probably his most entertaining movie. 'Cape Fear' was pretty much a solid thriller as well, but that film was a little too tense and frightening. This is really his one film where you can safely switch off your brain, and just relax and watch Scorsese do his thing. The fantastic visuals, the humour, the incredible sets and of course the masterful editing all together contribute to what is finally a lavish and jaw-dropping feast of a film. The way Scorsese directs his actors and sets his scenes with such utter perfection - the whole thing just makes you giddy with delight and blows your senses. Also, this movie is going to make you love 70s' American music - I guarantee it ! All the actors are a pleasure to watch here. In particular, James Woods as the 'country club golf hustler' is hilarious - strange, why doesn't Scorsese cast him more often ?? Sadly the film is unable to keep up the kinetic pace of the first two hours, and becomes somewhat dull and overlong near the end. BUT - this film very much falls into the category of must-sees.",8,1,1,18 October 2009
Heat," the illusion of reality.....
","Heat's opening heist certainly takes you aback, but thats just a mild taste of whats about to come. Somewhere in the second act is an absolutely shocking, stomach-chewing battle sequence that may well be the most numbing action set-piece ever committed to film. Nothing else like it exists, not in the most awe-inspiring war movies nor in the most fiercely adored action flicks. Its something like what Peckinpah might have done, only ten times more riveting. Heat literally climaxes at this point - in an orgasmic fusillade of gunfire.Heat is NOT a film about ideas or realism. Despite what countless viewers will have you believe, Heat offers no symbolism or metaphor, nothing beyond the literal surface story that we see. It has nothing deeper or psychologically real to say about anything, and certainly not about the so-called relationship between hunter and hunted. All that is a mere play on words and an escape for bored people. And by asking the viewer to identify and empathize with sociopaths, Heat proves that it has more to do with machismo than justice or reality.Enough grousing about what Heat *isnt*. I come to praise this film, not bury it. We are all seduced by the spectral filmic experience that Heat is. Mann's unrivalled synthesis of sound, cinematography and music. He aims for a very high degree of visual verisimilitude, and attains it. There is no one else in Hollywood who can bend the logic of big-budget film-making in this way.I'm just sorry that this film doesn't make me contemplate a thing, other than Mann's film technique. Never can I shake off the feeling that this a gigantic comic book, or a Western in techno trappings. He does try to convey something about the essential emptiness of these two men's lives, and how they seemingly need each other. Most viewers cant wait to label that as 'existential angst'. They might like to consider that maybe these two are just closet cases. That last scene especially is a bit too much.",9,2,4,12 August 2009
Jackie Brown," A Tarantino film for non-poseurs...
","Pitch perfect. So Tarantino actually made at least one film that doesn't allow viewers to get high on gore, and does require some concentration to get it. No wonder people didn't like it. Jackie Brown is like a Coen Bros. script directed by Tarantino. A bunch of people all scrambling for a bagful of cash - except unlike a Coen Bros. movie, these people aren't all morons, and someone manages to get away. The director executes it like a pro, never letting a viewer's attention wane.The dialog in this film is smart and sober. Samuel L. Jackson is the epitome of scum, and plus he's badass to the core. Pam Grier is an absolute FOX. These two were born to play their parts. The casting is uniformly perfect - except De Niro. I have no clue what he was doing here - seems like the studio wanted more 'star value'. He sleepwalks through the whole thing, dragging down the quality of the entire film.Overall this film is just a BIT slow. A couple of places require some speeding up, but on the whole the mood and pace is perfect. The character of Jackie Brown is one of the most interesting things Tarantino has come up with. He seems to have very quickly realized that his fans don't want anything even remotely resembling substance, and so he went commercial big-time with his next project. Kill Bill struck the mother lode. Its eerie; the man has a frightening grasp of the average movie-goer's likes and dislikes.",9,1,3,10 July 2010
Sin City," ugly
","First things first : this film is extraordinarily violent, without there being any sane reason whatsoever for it to be so. It can safely be classified as comic-book gore porn. While watching it, there were at least a dozen occasions when I wanted to hit the 'eject' button on my DVD player ; the only thing that kept me going was simply that I wanted to get it over with.Is this what art has come to in this age ? Were the filmmakers so desensitized that they went to these levels of harrowing cruelty to titillate their audience ? And just why is this film so chock full of celebrities for roles that a C-List actor would avoid ? Elijah Wood plays something like the ultimate misogynist-cum-cannibal......eh ? That being done with, Sin City is still highly remarkable for its novel and sophisticated filming style. The film was shot on a digital backlot, first in color, which was then converted to high-grade black-and-white, and then desaturated to give it a high contrast. Colour is added in interesting places, like all the girls' eyes, lips, hair, apparel.....you get the point. Oh yeah, and the barrels and barrels of fake blood used here was accentuated to a deep dark red. I also liked how they used CGI only as and when necessary, so the film looks like a cross between a very real and a completely fictional world.Maybe the film's only true saving grace is that unlike Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, it doesn't even try passing off as high art ; the film is perfectly aware of itself as being simply low-brow violence for violence's sake, and nothing more. Let me tell you that if you haven't seen this film, save yourself the trouble, you're not missing much. Give your time to something more worthy of it. This film isn't half as clever or funny as it would like to be, and just because a film goes into places with violence that other films don't DOES NOT make it revolutionary or original. It doesn't even matter that Rodriguez supposedly 'stayed true' to the source material, since the 'source' in question is jarringly stupid to begin with. This film will most certainly appeal to rapists and women beaters, so if you liked this hunk of sado junk, well......A friend of mine called Sin City 'misogynistic crap'. She's perfectly right. Armond White of the NY Press called Oldboy a 'virtuosic stupid movie'. Now THAT is clever, and funny too, and what's more, that phrase is even more true for Sin City.",1,1,9,19 December 2009
V for Vendetta," apparent meaning where there is none.....
","There are two central problems one faces when representing the realities of human life in fiction. One is that our modern world is bewilderingly complex and intricate, and the chain of cause & effect is sometimes so incredibly tangled as to all but evade comprehension and mislead even the keenest of artists & social scientists. The second problem (and this is more relevant to cinema) is that reality is too prosaic to be marketable. Its why a film like 'Seven' sells and one like 'Zodiac' doesn't.The guiding principle behind this film seems to be to toss together a bunch of half-understood, superficially provocative ideas that add up to nothing, mix in some glossy production design, an overbearing editing style and a wholly contrived sequence of events that are explained by character voiceovers (we have no faith in your intelligence so we'll spell it all out for you), stir liberally, and voila! You have a 'subversive' work of fiction, ready for mass consumption. The bright colors and slick execution delight and distract the passive viewer, and the presence of simplistic & half-baked notions fools him into thinking that he's actually watching something worthy.The film is so tight and enclosed that never for a moment do you believe that the world within it exists. And its so hopelessly literal and non-cinematic that its difficult to imagine that the Wachowski brothers wrote the screenplay. Its filmed straight, with little interest in the relations between the viewer and the narrative. VFV is not as dumb or empty as Equilibrium, but I find it horrifying that anyone could compare this to 1984. The two have as much in common as a swimsuit and a bulldozer. I'm guessing that the reason why this film is so highly rated is that most viewers cant wait to congratulate themselves for having seen a 'political' movie. Contrary to arguments voiced on IMDb and elsewhere, VFV has little to do with life on this planet. Really, how can people think so little before giving their assent to something ?? The greatest scourge of modern life is not totalitarian government or even extremist religion. Its mass-marketed consumerism. There's comfort in knowing that what you like is also liked by at least a few others, and this comforting feeling, along with the equally grotesque phenomenon of shallow novelty intellectualism is what drives our current 'globalized' world. Its what creates wealth disparities and leads to poverty, resentment and crime. It allows greedy hacks to thrive. Its why facile projects like this one get greenlit, and its why there are no writers like George Orwell anymore.",5,12,22,18 June 2009
The Godfather," visual wine
","My father made me watch this with him when I was 17. At first I was put off by the seemingly slow pace. But gradually the vast canvas and the gorgeous visuals began to draw me in. I had never expected that an 'old' film would be so beautiful to look at. At the end my father asked me what I thought of it. I replied that it was 'bigger' than anything I had ever seen before, but I also felt that it lacked depth. Thats when my father hit me with it : he pointed out for my benefit that 'you're not allowed to have an opinion on this film.' At 17, I used to think that having an opinion about something was a democratic and reasonable thing.With this film, Coppola managed to articulate notions & myths about the Italian Mafia, notions that had existed for decades but had never been so artistically depicted before, at least not in films. No mainstream picture before had ever depicted the mafia in anything deeper than black-&-white stereotypes of good and evil. The production design, photography, the performances and Nino Rota's score are so perfectly welded together that you never doubt for a moment that the world within the film EXISTS.I'm sure intellectuals have a field day with this film. A psychologist would detect seething undercurrents of homoeroticism, combined with a feudal & patriarchal mindset. A film analyst would probably criticise the straightforward storytelling style, as opposed to a twisting & warped narrative format of the noir convention, where the viewer changes what is viewed. A philosopher would berate the film for having no depth or inherent meaning, and its characters for lacking any real consciousness of themselves or the world. The film has one singular idea : the rationalizing of murder by calling it 'business, not personal', which is appalling.I still think this is the best monument of popular culture, over time as well as place. It is the ultimate elevation of style over substance, but undeniably the film is tastefully made. There are moments in this film that nobody forgets : the opening marriage scene, the decapitated horse, the meeting of the five families, and of course every single scene that Marlon Brando is in. To my mind, the Godfather is probably the best compromise we've yet seen between art and commerce.",9,2,5,18 October 2009
