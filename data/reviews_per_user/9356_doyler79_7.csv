Source Code," An entertaining, intelligent, imaginative puzzle.
","This second movie after Jones' very accomplished first movie 'Moon' is a modest yet satisfying science fiction thriller that keeps the mind ticking and confirms away any skepticism that this director may have been a one-trick pony. Geared towards a more mainstream crowd , this smooth, polished movie,Source Code, works as an entertaining, intelligent, imaginative puzzle. Jones' film is exquisitely constructed and steadfastly focused. As Stevens wakes up time and time again as the same events play out from different perspectives and with numerous consequences. In true Hitchcockian style,a train carriage acts as a restricted and claustrophobic setting where the action plays out. Jake Gyllenhaal is superb and engaging as usual and seemed perfectly cast here.",9,0,1,24 June 2011
Megamind," You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better.
","You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better. Megamind is nothing more than a amiable-enough adventure about atonement, about choosing to be the person you want to be regardless of what others expect of you. I'd love it a lot more if the Pixarian themes had been developed with greater care; as it is, they come across as an reconsideration. The jokes range from the modestly amusing to the mildly dumb. It's a harmless, inoffensive, moderately likable throwaway of a cartoon that you will probably start forgetting as soon as it's over.It may be difficult to find uniqueness in Megamind but it's also hard not to like.",Null,21,47,11 January 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," A love story wrapped in a blanket of Phillip K Dick
","Based on a short story by Philip K Dick,this movie presumes that our fate is controlled by a squad of sharply-dressed men with orders to keep the time line.David Norris (Matt Damon) is a opportune politician from a difficult background, who suffers a hitch in a New York senatorial election when pictures emerge of some youthful indiscretion. While practicing his concession speech, he comes across Elise (Emily Blunt), an impetuous dancer. The chemistry between them spurs him to make an impromptu speech which elevates his chances in the next election.Having let Elsie leave without finding out who she is, he sets out to find her only to be thwarted by the adjustment bureau who stop at nothing to keep the lovers apart.Norris's persistence at trying to find Elise provokes the interest of the upstairs brass. Spelling out their goals to help make him president and for Elsie to become a famous dancer, they confide in him about who they are. The price to be payed is for them to be kept apart at all costs. Bizarrely. Norris continues to peruse Elsie and pays little attention to the enormity of the revelations of the adjustment bureau.Hardly a flawless effort but what's intriguing here is that this is inherently a love story wrapped in a blanket of Phillip K Dick, with Damon doling out the charm and Blunt a good mix of feisty and frivolous as they deal with the gray men of the bureau.",8,0,1,1 July 2011
Limitless," Good enough to enjoy with a KFC meal :)
","In 'limitless',Cooper proves that he can definitely act, truly impose himself on the screen and not just show off and flash that flirtatious smile of his and his effectiveness as an actor goes a long way toward making this thriller a lot more entertaining, and more credible than it possibly should have been. You could probably rummage through the film for deeper themes, an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry, or our need to have it now and have it all or you could pick the script apart for impossibilities. But why bother? It's much more enjoyable to shut your brain off for awhile and have a good time. Limitless' may not be as brainy as it would like to think it is, but it's a relatively sharp and a surprisingly playful head-trip with satisfyingly novel twists on mindless entertainment.It could also be described as a disreputable and trashy piece of entertainment but it goes down well with the comfort of a KFC meal, and if that's what you are in the mood for, then go for it.",7,0,0,30 June 2011
Mary and Max," perverse and often immature
","In a perverse and often immature way, this movie deals with the mature issues of love, friendship, forgiveness and mental health. There's abig white elephant in the room so this movie requires a mature audience.A bizarre and strange pen-friendship is formed through happenstance by two people who are separated by both age andgeography.I loved the letter writing element of this film and it reminded me of '84 charring cross road'. Worth a watch even just to see how the attention to detail in this movie makes it possible for us to feel something for clay figures.",9,0,2,24 September 2010
RED," Enjoyable romp
","Facetiously scripted by Jon and Erich Hoeber, based on the DC Comics graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, and directed by Robert Schwentke, this is a labyrinthine, adrenaline-pumping, jocose adventure with irresistibly appealing characters whose wacky quirks and un-ending desire to get back into their game are superbly characterised by these veteran thespians. An over the top enjoyable romp that's not trying to take its self too seriously and worth a watch even just to see Helen Mirren in cocktail wear and army boots managing to look sophisticated manning a heave duty machine gun. It would be hard to imaging that this star studded cast didn't have a great time making this movie.",8,1,2,28 December 2010
The Social Network," One of the best films of 2010.
","The Social Network has achieved the almost impossible,a movie about the creation of a website should be boring but they not only made it interesting, they've made it thrilling.This purportedly true story about Facebook is primarily a legal drama, mostly focusing on the dispute between Mark Zuckerberg and the other Harvard University students who claimed to have also been contributory in the social networking website's creation. After burning a few more bridges and pissing off his few remaining friends, Zuckerberg finds himself in a litigation nightmare. A script written by Aaron Sorkin, who has created some blisteringly sharp dialogue that will leave you hanging on every word spoken by the outstanding cast. Eisenberg is outstanding and presents the Facebook founder as a socially stunted savant, unable to relate to other people as anything other than a means to some other end, his misogynistic attitudes towards women a particular flaw.The Social Network has a definite 'revenge of the nerds' feel about it, with its oafish jocks, exaltation of hackers and nerd-groupies. The film is also an interesting product of the hyper-fast social world it has helped to create: a biopic about someone still alive and in his mid-20s and relating events that only happened a couple of years ago. Just how much of the story is really true is anyone's guess but it is certainly thought-provoking, and the brilliant script and Eisenberg's performance make it worth seeing in any case. One of the best films of 2010.",9,1,2,12 January 2011
