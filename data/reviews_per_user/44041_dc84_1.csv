Mission: Impossible III," A summer must see
","A must see movie for anyone who thoroughly enjoys a good action movie with continuous intrigue. The almost non-stop action keeps you on the edge of your seat, and Tom Cruise does a magnificent job of keeping the viewer interested. While some of the love story dialog is weakly done, Abrams does a fantastic job of varying music to excite you about the action scenes, and the beginning of the movie can be described as nothing but intense. Mission Impossible III gave exactly what I expected from a summer movie, a great action flick with a great level of drama which was much more in depth. Compared to the earlier Mission impossible movies, definitely as much action as the second with more intrigue and plot twists. In short, MI: III is a must see this summer.",9,0,1,13 May 2006
