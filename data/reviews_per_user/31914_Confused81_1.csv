Black Swan," Oscar worthy performance? I don't think so...
","I'm really perplexed by the reviews this movie has. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie I disliked to this extent. When I first heard about it, I was very excited to see it, since I usually like this sort of movies. But, was I in for a surprise with this one!The first half of the movie is so boring, I actually played solitaire on my phone while I watched it. It's filled with silly images of a crazy girl, pulling her skin off. I mean, was the finger scene really necessary? And while I'm on the topic of necessary scenes, I think seeing Natalie performing oral sex on herself scared me for life. Only a man can come up with that one :)Anyway, the acting was bad, there was absolutely no character development and Natalie Portman's face remained the same throughout the entire movie. Even, when she changed into the black swan, she seemed exactly the same, apart from the wings they computer generated onto her back. I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie, or her performance. It must be the sheep factor :)",1,21,39,3 April 2011
