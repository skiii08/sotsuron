The Avengers," Saw It Twice
","My fiancé and I have seen this awesome flick twice. I am also putting it on my holiday wish list this year so that I can add it to my DVD collection. That is how geeked out I am for this movie. The cast was memorable. Robert Downey Junior was born to play Tony Stark. Mark Ruffalo excelled as Bruce Banner and even resembled the comic book Banner. Scarlet Johansen and Chris Hemsworth made for tasty eye candy as Black Widow and Thor respectively. Samuel L. Jackson wows as Nick Fury. The story was well told by writer/director Joss Whedon. There is plenty of humor and action. There is also some tragedy as well in the form of the death of S.H.E.I.L.D agent Phil Coulson,played excellently by Clark Gregg, at the hands of the villain Loki played chillingly by Tom Hiddleston. If you have not yet seen this movie run to your local movie theater and see it. If you have seen it already see it again.",10,6,12,26 May 2012
Alien," My Favorite Monster Movie
","This movie is my favorite monster movie. I have the 1979 cut on DVD and saw the 2003 cut in theaters.The premise of the movie should now be well known. This movie is very effectively directed by Ridley Scott. Sigourney Weaver gives a breakout performance in the now iconic role of Ripley. The effective supporting cast includes John Hurt as Kane who meets a nasty end in one the most iconic scenes in horror cinema. Also in the supporting cast is Ian Holm as Ash who is not what he seems as is revealed in a shocking twist.If you are an animal lover you will be glad to know that Jonesey the cat survives along with Ripley.If you're in the mood for a well made monster movie rent this movie then pop up some popcorn,sit back and enjoy Alien.",10,1,3,21 November 2010
The Wolf of Wall Street," Deplorable
","I saw this deplorable movie with my significant other/fiancé last winter. I felt dirty afterwards. The morality of this movie was dubious to say the least. For three hours I was hosed with greed,corruption,and general excess. Leonardo DeCaprio played stockbroker Jordan Belfort,who's memoirs supplied the basis of this movie. Martin Scorcese directed. The least of the movie's excesses was the profanity. I found the scene where Jonah Hill's character urinates on some subpoenas to be excessive. I especially found the scenes involving drugs and sex with hookers to be excessive. Worst of all the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler was stuck living in a modest house and riding a subway while the greed head main characters lived in big, fancy houses and drove high end sports cars. I wanted to cheer when those dirtbags all got arrested. In short spend the three hours it would take to watch this deplorable movie reading a book or going on an outing with your family instead.",1,4,7,19 May 2014
The Woman in Black," Good Old School Scares
","This movie gives the audience good old school scares. Daniel Radcliffe gives an effective performance as Arthur Kipps a young lawyer in Edwardian England who gets caught up in supernatural events involving a haunted house in a remote village. I found this movie to be utterly terrifying because of what was not explicitly shown. The supporting cast helped sell the premise of the movie. I screamed frequently in terror during this movie especially when the title apparition makes her appearances. If you are seeking a silly slasher flick where a bunch of silly teenagers get carved up by some psycho with a big knife then this movie is not for you. However, if you like old school scares in the Hammer Films tradition run to a theater near you and see The Woman In Black.",10,1,4,10 February 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fun Spoof
","Had the opportunity to see a Thursday night advance premiere screening in King of Prussia of this movie accompanied by my unofficial fiancÃ©. We both enjoyed it The story revolves around a spy who recruits and mentors a lower class young man for a spy agency called Kingsman. The movie contains references to several spy films and TV shows such as the Bond franchise and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. The tropes of such films and shows are discussed, spoofed, and at one point busted. The cast was excellent and seemed to enjoy their roles. Colin Firth was outstanding as the veteran secret agent who recruits and mentors the protagonist played by newcomer Taron Egerton. This movie has plenty of mayhem including an already famous church fight scene in which Colin Firth's character takes out about 80 people. If you enjoy spy films you will enjoy Kingsman:The Secret Service.",10,2,10,14 February 2015
