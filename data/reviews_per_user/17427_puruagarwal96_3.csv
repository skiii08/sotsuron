Iron Man 3," a different 'iron - man'
","its not as same as the previous ones. But a must watch. The movie is well directed, well poised. This movie deals more with the human emotions and the separation from real love because of the involvement of machines in the life of a human. Movie tags along well and well keep it to your seats till the very end. I have not given it a 10/10 because the plot could have been a slightly better. But, nevertheless the movie is awesome, and a must watch. a complete family thriller. ACTING - 10/10 DIRECTION - 10/10 PLOT - 8/10 CLIMAX - 8.5/10 ACTION - 10/10 THRILL - 9/10 CINEMATOGRAPHY - 9/10 VFX - 10/10 . OVERALL - 9/10. :) . ENJOY IT! MUST WATCH!",9,16,25,3 November 2013
About Time," Some movies are not just MOVIES.
","This movie or I should say a 'happy feeling' will leave you gleeful and joyous at the end. I wished this movie to never and just keep on going and make us feel more humane and more lovable. It has been by far the most touching story written by Richard Curtis and he has portrayed love on-screen with a very different, new and mesmerizing prospective. Rachel McAdams was once again perfectly suited for the role and played her part with perfection and heart but Domhnall Gleeson makes you live all sorts of emotions. The story is very different from other stories and the fantasy in it made it more wonderful to watch it. A different sort of drama. Well, I would say that LOVE is eternal and has different forms through which you can deluge to the ones you Love. A wonderful movie to watch in the Winters.",9,4,6,18 December 2014
Happy New Year," A Very HAPPENING movie, Indeed!
","Just got out of the cinema hall and I was awestruck. Everything was so beautiful and mesmerizing. Right from the start till the very end the movie keeps you entertained and doesn't let you move an inch from your seat. Shahrukh Khan was perfect as always. Deepika looked stunning. Boman Sir, Abhishek, Sonu, Vivaan were very good in their roles too. The Tricolor (Indian Flag) Dubai fountain scene was shot with perfection and was beautiful to watch it and made me feel proud to be an Indian. The movie gives a very good message about Patriotism, Unity, Love and Relations. One Word :- 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' (AWESOME).!! SRK rocked :D And AbRam Looked cute.",10,18,40,27 October 2014
