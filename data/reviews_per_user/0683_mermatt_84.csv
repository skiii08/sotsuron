The Blair Witch Project," Interesting study in the psychology of fear
","As a horror film, this is disappointing -- perhaps intentionally so to keep the audience talking about it after it is over. But as a study in the psychology of fear and self-fulfilling prophecy, the film works well. The moviemakers use fear of the unknown, fear of the dark, fear of the night, fear of unseen forces, fear of getting lost in the woods -- all very effectively.While this is not in the same league as THE EXORCIST to which it has been sometimes compared in the PR hype, it is nevertheless a good example of the old rule of horror -- less is more. The people who remade THE HAUNTING could have taken a lesson from these people instead of relying mainly on FX for the atmosphere.I think the unresolved ending is intentional to keep the word-of-mouth going. The Sci-Fi channel show 'Curse of the Blair Witch' gives more information than the movie and is actually better than the movie. I think what we have here is the beginning of a legend. The Blair Witch myth is concocted solely for the film, but now the myth will begin to grow. Clever gimmick for a small-budget film!",8,1,1,2 August 1999
Scarface," Pure Pacino
",Pacino gives an amazing performance that is both comic and tragic in this remake of the 1932 classic about corruption in America.Brian De Palma updated the original Prohibition story to the era of the Mariel boat-lift and the heavy traffic in drugs that still infest the United States. The film is an uncompromising revelation of humanity's dark side as Pacino's character learns never to underestimate the other guy's greed. He neglects to learn the other important lesson -- never get caught in the vice you are pushing on others.Pacino's character wants the world and everything in it. That's what he gets. We are reminded to beware of what we wish for.The film is violent but never makes drug dealing seem glamorous.,Null,124,184,26 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stinker!
","After Lucas' mentor Joseph Campbell passed away, Lucas lost all sense of real mythmaking and reverted to playground mentality. The plot of this film could have been told in 20 minutes at the beginning of a much better movie. The rest of the film is padded with whopper FX that are supposed to make us ignore the fact that the movie is terribly flimsy.Furthermore, Lucas' choice of the boy to play the future Darth Vader was so far off target as to make the film turn into a cartoon. This boy would be better suited to toothpaste commercials. Consider how much better the film might have been if this one part had gone to the boy who made us really believe THE SIXTH SENSE.This movie is such a radically lower grade piece of storytelling that it lessens the eloquence of the original STAR WARS trilogy. Hopefully, Lucas will get back into focus before rolling parts 2 and 3 off the FX assembly line.",1,30,58,2 February 2001
Ali," Lengthy saga
","The heading 'lengthy saga' is redundant, I know. But this film shows its lengthiness a bit too much.We follow the saga of a hero through the civil rights movement as he attains his title and his own identity. The cast is excellent. The boxing is realistic.But the film lingers and becomes indulgent. It could have been cut down to a more focused running time without losing the meaning.",Null,0,1,3 January 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A one-movie serial
","Using all the cliches of the old movie serials from the 30s and 40s, this film refreshes them and gives them to us, one cliffhanger after another, without let up. It is a wild ride and thoroughly enjoyable. As a result of this film and its two sequels, Indiana Jones has become part of American folklore.",Null,0,0,3 August 1998
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic old-fashioned adventure
","Modeled on old movie serials of the 1930s and 40s, this is an entertaining thrill-ride. The melodrama is made acceptable because of the humor, the cast, and the fact that Indiana Jones never takes himself too seriously.The novelty of making a big-budget version of old-fashioned serials was never equalled in the sequels, but this film is just plain fun.",Null,0,0,17 February 2001
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Sly retelling
","Melissa Mathison's script is a clerely disguised retelling of another sci-fi classic, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. If you see both films, you will notice that both deal with the unusual friendship between an ET and a boy, both extraterrestrials are sly Christ-figures, and both stories deal with the way humans treat each other.The movie is charming in its use of cast and mood. Notice some cleverly disguised images: the ET spaceship is, at one point, a Halloween pumpkin and, at the end, a Christmans tree ornament. Lots of interesting Biblical symbolism, including the use of the rainbow at the end to indicate the peace between God and human.",Null,1,2,1 August 1998
Casablanca," One of the great films
",I have seen the film many times. It is an amazingly durable piece. It endures because of the underlying meaning -- a man is faced with the choice of being a responsible person or simply following his emotional whims. Every character has some interesting quality or quirk. I have used the film in my classes to make the point of how a good story can have a deeper meaning without coming across as a sermon.,Null,1,1,30 July 1998
Meet the Parents," DeNiro and Stiller in grand style
","Take a cute, fluffy romance and make nuclear winter of it with plenty of broad comedy from both DeNiro and Stiller working together like Abbott and Costello. That's the best way to sum up this film.The plot is a delicious mixture of FATHER OF THE BRIDE and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY with a big dose of the Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers. Some of the props include a trained cat, an ash urn, and a lie detector.This movie is funny -- not just in the style of other modern comedies, but in the great tradition of screwball comedies like IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT and BRINGING UP BABY. It's hard to tell who steals more scenes -- DeNiro doing all his classic schtick or Stiller with his straight-faced lunacy. MEET THE PARENTS is, quite simply, a gem. Since laughter is good therapy, this is a dumptruck-full of sugar to make the medicine go down. See it!",Null,0,0,6 October 2000
Unbreakable," Handle with care?
","Just as in 6TH SENSE, this film turns on only one plot device which is almost as contrived as the one in 6TH SENSE. This very slow-moving plot about comic books, superheros, and supervillains gives us the message that you can't have heros without villains and vice versa. If you are looking for something profound, this isn't the movie you want. If there is any secret code to the meaning of this film, it is indeed unbreakable.",Null,0,0,1 January 2001
Fight Club," Like wow, man -- deep soap dish!
","This film is a nightmarish mix of PI, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, PSYCHO, and MATRIX with the old TV show 'The Prisoner' thrown in for good measure. The theme seems to be that macho anarchy is the way to counteract society, social mores, and the social mask we all wear to cover who we really are.One of the weird symbols in the story is soap -- it cleanses, but not in a true sense. It cleanses only out of our vanity and self-destructive need to erase who we are. Heavy, huh?We get a pseudo-Thoreau blended with a psycho-Socrates rejecting phoniness by creating new phoniness and turning the Socratic motto of 'Know Thyself' on its head. The film makes fun of support groups where people play 'who's the biggest victim' by depicting characters who are tourists in their own life. Heavy again, huh?There's an in-joke if you look carefully -- Brad Pitt's pretentious self-discovery epic 7 YEARS IN TIBET is playing at a theater in the background of one shot in the film. This seems to be a bit of self-mocking that this movie makes of its own self-discovery journey.To sum it up, I can think only of a line from the wonderful actress Tallulah Bankhead: 'Dahling, there's less here than meets the eye.'",5,2,8,15 October 1999
Citizen Kane," The way to tell a story
","This film deserves its reputation as probably the best film ever made because it is a wonderful study in how to tell a story. Even after the viewer knows the secret of the meaning of 'Rosebud,' the story can be viewed over and over without losing its effect. > Rosebud is merely a story-telling device for the revelation of a man's character -- to the degree that any of us can know ourselves or anyone else. The lighting, symbolism, acting, and characterization can be studies in themselves long after the secret is known.",Null,3,6,30 July 1998
Memento," Human jig-saw puzzle
","The title of this film could be Socrates' motto, 'Know Thyself.' The main character suffers from a condition that allows him only the memories he had before a traumatic event in his life. Beyond that, he has practically no short-term memory and therefore must write notes to himself, take pictures, and mark his own body with clues.But, as he is told several times in the film, he doesn't know who he really is. We are left with the questions of what the truth is, what memory is, and whether memory is merely interpretation of the truth. The film is thus a satire of the short-attention span of the modern world which makes us forget the past as well as the present.To follow the story, the viewer must pay attention as the two main plotlines move toward each other from opposite directions and finally merge. The clues are deceiving and the only signals to the viewer of what is going on is the use of black & white film and color film to illustrate which plot segments are which.Like the main character in the film, we too can never know anything for sure. We, like this wandering man, are caught in loops, replaying the past in the present and mistaking the present for the past. That is why we, like him, are such mixed up creatures as we try to assemble the strange pieces of our jig-saw puzzles without knowing what the finished pictures are supposed to look like.The makings on the main character's body are clues, but not the clues that the viewer assumes they are. Without giving too much away, I will only say that the point is that you are the clue to yourself -- but the trick is to know who you are. Is that confusing enough? It's supposed to be because we are humans, and humans are confused beings.We search for keys. We lie to ourselves. We remember only what we want to remember. We try to know who we are. It's an endless loop just like the colliding strands of this plot.",Null,0,1,19 April 2001
Amistad," Powerful History
","I arranged for the students at my school to see this film last winter. It is a powerful piece of history presented in a powerful way. The incident which is portrayed in the film should be part of American history courses since it led, directly or indirectly, to the Civil War.Everyone in the film gives an excellent performance. The real power comes from Djimon Hounsou (Cinque) and Anthony Hopkins (John Quince Adams). Hopkins' summation at the trial defines what America is all about.",Null,1,3,30 July 1998
12 Angry Men," Gritty juryroom drama
","Based on the stageplay of the same title, this is a taut drama that takes place mainly in the closed-in confines of a juryroom. The cast is superior. Each juror reveals something about himself and human nature, thus making the juryroom a microcosm of human psychology.",Null,0,1,29 March 1999
Billy Elliot," Breaking down walls
","The cast is excellent and the point is inspiring -- be yourself and bring your gift to the world, no matter what.A boxing ring, brick walls, factories, a mine, and a cemetery are subtle but effective symbols of the prison in which the characters are trapped. But Billy (played marvelously by Jamie Bell) has the heart and spirit to find something else in his life. Guided by the spirit of his deceased mother, he persists at his dream and ultimately triumphs, bringing life and electricity to all around him.This is a film about how art, music, dance, and freedom smash all walls and prejudices. What a joyful and moving experience!",Null,0,0,24 November 2000
The Mummy," Good ol' mummy
","It has everything -- chills, spills, laughs, scares.The FX are impressive and effective not only for the mummy but also for the recreation of ancient Egypt. Fraser is the dashing hero who doesn't take himself too seriously. The Jerry Goldsmith score is appropriately atmospheric and impressive.It won't make people forget Boris Karloff, but the film is a worthy descendant of the old classic Universal horror films.",Null,0,0,7 May 1999
The Terminator," Interesting parable
","When I first saw the film, I assumed that it was just a sci-fi flick. But something in the back of my head haunted me. Then I realized the odd use of symbolism in the plot with John Connor being a Christ-figure and his mother as the crusher of the serpent's head.When viewed with this subtext in mind, the film took on a much more subtle tone. I can respect what the moviemakers were doing here as they taught a lesson about not surrendering our humanity to technology.",Null,0,0,21 February 2001
Sleepy Hollow," Spooky fun!
","This is a gothic fest in the grand style of James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, even with a windmill added for good measure.Depp is highly entertaining as a cross between the craven main character and Sherlock Holmes. We get lots of wonderful achetypal atmosphere: dark, gloomy forests with mysterious, claw-like trees, a perpetual mist that hangs in the woods like the scarf of a ghost, etc. Danny Elfman's symphonic soundtrack of course just adds to the goosebumps.The old folktale that Washington Irving retold as his 'Legend of Sleepy Hollow' gets a new, intricate plot with a few surprise cameos. And if you look carefully at the suspicious town leaders, you might even recognize the Emperor Palpatine. Now, you know that means that he's one of the bad guys.The FX are well done, and yet at the same time, they don't overwhelm the story as they did in the silly remake of THE HAUNTING and the PHANTOM MENACE. Go see this film and have some good spooky fun!",Null,0,0,19 November 1999
The Beach," Interesting, but slow and derivative
","About 30 years ago, this film might have been really powerful and innovative. However, even though it is interesting, it is a slow-moving derivation of just too many other films, among others APOCALYPSE NOW, LORD OF THE FLIES, TREASURE ISLAND, LOST HORIZON, JAWS, WELCOME TO WOOP WOOP, TARZAN, THE DEER HUNTER, and yes, even THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. So that the audience gets the point, we see a scene from APOCALYPSE NOW in the movie.Leo is good in his tanned, buffed form as he searches for the cure to relieve himself of 'civilization' much as Huck Finn once did. Swinton is interesting as a female Buddha in a Bali Ha'i that is supposedly paradise. But humans always lose Eden, and Christo must die for our sins again.The film fits into Leo's canon of off-beat films and certainly is not another TITANIC. It is interesting, but one wonders why such a derivative film was needed right now. It does make an important point about ecology, but at the same time, even that isn't a new theme. If you want to see Leo and the Thai scenery, see it. If you don't want to see a conglomeration of the above-mentioned films, don't.",Null,0,1,13 February 2000
The Best Years of Our Lives," Evolutionary tale
","This classic and moving film has many wonderful qualities that will touch the viewer.One in particular, which I use in my classes to illustrate how we can change our lives, is the evolution of Fred throughout the story. We see him disheartened and then he makes a choice to stay in his hometown and work on a new job. We see this same theme in Homer also. Al, too, evolves and makes a stirring speech about the real meaning of the American Dream.The point is that we humans can survive not only world war but also interior war -- if we stay focused on why we are alive so that we can truly live the best years of our lives.",Null,2,4,1 August 1998
Empire of the Sun," Innocence Lost
","In this film, we are faced with an interesting and uncomfortable question: Is it possible to keep one's innocence in the face of the horrors of war? The grim, touching, and powerful story of a boy separated from his parents and dragged through prison camps concludes with an interesting piece of symbolism. The emotions and the depth of this film foreshadow Spielberg's later treatments of war, SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Though this film is not what can be called a happy one, it is nevertheless worth seeing.",Null,0,1,3 August 1998
Romeo + Juliet," Shakespeare according to MTV*
","Despite the unorthodox MTV style used in this version of Shakespeare's great tragic romance, the film does work. Sometimes the dialogue falls like bricks from the mouths of the two main characters, but more often, the two actors convince us by the sheer reality of their emotions. The rest of the cast is also convincing. See this film for its sheer novelty, but allow yourself to get swept away by the power of the performances as well as by the music and the settings.
Shakespeare was in show-biz. He knew that in the theater, you make a living by bringing in the crowd and filling the seats. He would have been pleased by this unusual but effective approach to one of his most enduring plays.",Null,2,4,19 August 1998
Forrest Gump," Like a box of chocolates
","A much more likable character than the one in the original novel, Forrest takes us on a surreal tour of every major event in the period during the birth of the civil rights movement and the anti-war era. He is so simple, open, and direct, that the audience can't help but like him. The film is at various times funny, sad, exciting, and moving. Tom Hanks so personified this modern Huck Finn that he well deserved his second Oscar.",Null,3,6,3 August 1998
10 Things I Hate About You," More sexy Shakespeare!
","Ol' Willy Shakespeare is having quite a renaissance! This film is the latest updating or relevance-making version of the immortal bard.It is a cute, fast-paced, witty retelling of THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (or, in this case, the 'heinous bitch'). But not only does it use the plot of that play as a framework, it is also CLUELESS and CAN'T HARDLY WAIT meet CRUEL INTENTIONS. On top of all this, it still manages to be fun and to have a meaningful point -- don't go along with the crowd because the crowd might just be crazy.We get a wonderfully satiric cross-section of the mysterious realm of teens in high school with a lesson in Shakespeare thrown in for good measure. This is a better than average teen comedy that anyone can enjoy.",Null,0,0,4 April 1999
Fargo," Dull
","While the performances were good, this film does not deserve the praises it has received. I found it flat and dull just like the setting.",Null,0,3,25 August 1998
American Pie," Guilty Pleasure
","I have to admit that while this comedy is adolescent and raunchy, I loved it and saw it several times. Then I bought the DVD and listened to the commentaries. If a teen sex comedy can be a classic, this is it. The outrageousness is done so offhandedly that you just have to laugh.The talented young cast does a delightful job with the material, making this the third part of a truly strange trilogy that also includes the weird AMERICAN PSYCHO and odd AMERICAN BEAUTY. The three films together pretty much define America at the turn of the 21st Century -- heaven help us!The film is as American as the apple pie which is raped so blatantly. Pity the poor pie -- and then laugh yourself silly.",Null,0,0,9 October 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Much ado about a piece of jewelry
","I liked the excellent cast. I liked the good FX. I liked the beautiful locations.BUT! The film is much too long.The hero's journey is told once again, and this is only part 1 of 3. I'm sure the book fans are thrilled, but I thought a more condensed version would have worked better.It's a Wagner opera with computer FX.",Null,1,1,3 January 2002
Cast Away," Time and tide wait for no man
","The title may be a pun telling us that we must cast away all the junk we call civilization. Hanks gives his trademark low-key everyman performance in this post-modern Robinson Crusoe tale which shows that choices lead to consequences and even when we think we are at a dead end, we are only at a crossroads.This is an intriguing story with no formula conclusion, and it is Hanks that holds the whole saga together.",Null,0,0,1 January 2001
Armageddon," Camera and Coffee
","This retread of INDEPENDENCE DAY mixed with DEEP IMPACT (which was a much better film), starts out well. The down-to-earth scenes are amusing enough, but once we blast off on a comet, the movie degenerates into noise and camerawork that must have been inspired by too much coffee.",Null,0,1,30 July 1998
American Psycho," A man who never was
","This is a frightening and wildly satiric look into the mentality of the high-flying Reaganomics 1980s as the American Dream turned into the psychotic American Nightmare. The film will probably turn as many people off as are entertained by this weird journey that is a slightly more organized cousin of FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.Christian Bale is amazingly energetic and even sympathetic as the deranged, soul-less creature who values nothing but surface appearances. We are given a hauting roller-coaster ride through a comedy of terrors that is the mind of this being who seems human but isn't quite sure himself. In fact, he doesn't even know who or what he is.Is he insane? Are we? That's the joker in the gamble. That's the riddle of the sphinx that we are left to solve -- if there is a solution.",Null,122,217,14 April 2000
North by Northwest," A merry chase
","From the first fandago music with its interesting opening credits design, we are off on a merry chase, a dance of intrigue and fun with the master -- who gets his cameo over with almost immediately in the first moments of the film.Every mis-lead is calculated. Every moment is mis-direction. And then, when Hitchcock allows, we learn the truth. The chase scene on Mount Rushmore is a classic -- and doesn't even involve cars. It's amazing what can be done when one doesn't think in cliches.",Null,0,2,1 August 1998
The Shining," Over-long and over-rated
","Just like 2001 and EYES WIDE SHUT, this Kubrick film is overly long with not enough pay-off to justify the length. What happens when an over-rated director makes a movie of an over-rated author's book? An over-rated movie.Ominous, ominous, toil and trouble, Fire burn and caldron bubble. SHINING is a tale told by a King, Full of Kubrick and fury, Signifying nothing!I liked the contrast between the seeming sophistication of the civilized hotel in the wilderness and the monstrous atmosphere created. But there is much less here than meets the eye. I guess I would have to say, 'All atmosphere and little story makes SHINING a dull thing.' Ironic, ain't it, considering the title.The real horror of the movie is the excruciatingly slow pace. It would have been a much better movie if it had been edited to make it move faster. But then this is a Kubrick production which means that it is self-indulgently long.",Null,0,2,4 January 2001
American Beauty," A closer look at the American Dream
","This is an odd film -- funny, wicked, and sad. The cast is great in creating both the superficial aspects of their characters as well as the vulnerable interiors which, ironically, they not only fear but also admire and evendesire. In this respect, the film has a complete tone ofirony throughout.Spacey is a suburban Thoreau who leads the search for freedom from the quiet desperation of people trapped inthe ordinary. Rebelling against the fake Bali Ha'i of couches, pleasantries, and masks in the vapid life of themiddle-class rat-race, he decides to seize the day andmake some meaning of his life. His attempt to regain hisown American Dream is woven into the struggles of the other people around him to do the same.Like everything else in the film, the title is an irony -- the American Beauty rose has its thorns and isn't what it appears to be. We must take a closer look to see what life is all about. If we don't, we will come to the end of life and realize that we have never lived.",Null,0,0,26 September 1999
BASEketball," A fun flick
","This is another Zucker film in the grand style of AIRPLANE. The story is generally fast-paced. The jokes just keep coming -- and most of them work. Plus, we get the most passionate screen kiss between men since IN & OUT. What more could you want?",Null,15,26,31 July 1998
Judgment at Nuremberg," The horrors of human nature
","A powerful movie version of a TV and stage play, the film reveals the horrors not only of war and genocide, but the culprit at the root of such terrible things -- human nature.The story includes many perspectives on what happened in Nazi Germany and shows us that it wasn't just Hitler, it wasn't just Germany -- it was human nature that created such monstrous things. If we don't monitor our own personalities, that most ancient of evils can re-create what happened to Germany: namely, hubris, human ego, pride. We see the same drama played out here that is shown to us in the stories of the Bible, in Greek myth, and throughout the tragedies of Shakespeare. When we forget what it means to be human and when we negate the value of one human life, we set in motion the same terrifying sequence that happened in Germany.An excellent cast gives us powerful performances in a film that should be a lesson to everyone about what the worst elements of human nature can create.",Null,3,4,11 April 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Excellent sequel
","This is one of those rare sequels that is as good as or better than the original. The story keeps exploding along with one interesting revelation after another. The action keeps going, sometimes a bit too long. But the theme of the film makes it definitely worth watching.As in the original movie, we are shown a lesson about not surrendering our humanity to technology. In addition, we are left with a profound thought about the value of human life. And, like the original, we are again given some Christ-figure symbolism, but this time it is even more surprising than in the first movie.",Null,0,0,21 February 2001
Duck Soup," The Marx Brothers' view of politics
","Forget all the other political satires. This is the one to see. The brothers take on politics, war, and the people who make politics and war. No hot-air balloon is left unexploded. No pretension is left intact. Dr. Samuel Johnson defined patriotism as 'the last refuge of the scoundrel.' His definition is delightfully played out here.One of the grand comedies of all time.",Null,0,1,2 August 1998
Edward Scissorhands," Wonderful fairy tale
","When the film first opened 10 years ago, people thought it was a horror movie because it was made by Tim Burton and had a 'monster' as the title character. True, it is modeled on FRANKENSTEIN, but it is really a wonderful fairy tale about being different and creative in a world that values conformity over everything else.Vincent Price is a delight as the 'mad scientist' who doesn't want to rule the world but to make cookies -- and a man who is really a robot with a heart. Like the IRON GIANT, this film appears to be a child's tale on the surface, but it is really profound with insights into human nature.Depp is totally convincing in his odd Christ-figure role. His eyes and facial expressions show his real talent and range. He manages to be funny, sad, spirited, dejected, and inspiring while hidden under a body suit and thick make-up.Edward is Tim Burton's alter-ego. If you ever see a picture of Burton, notice the fly-away hair and long fingers. He is showing us the artist in his struggle with a crass, bland world of pastel cookie-cutter houses and drab lives.Danny Elfman's music here is his best. He has time to develop beautiful themes and variations. I think this is one of the most touching soundtracks ever written.Since the movie concludes at Christmas time and has a mystical, magical ending, it is an ideal film for Christmas since it manages that rare quality of being really moving without being mawkish.In the new DVD format, the images are sharp and the music is magnificent.",Null,0,0,9 September 2000
Being John Malkovich," Know Thyself -- maybe
","Freud meets Kafka meets Alice in Wonderland in the TWILIGHT ZONE with a touch of COCOON. There is symbolismall over the place in this movie -- puppets, performances, mirrors, etc. In an odd way, the film delves the nature of the self in this collision of reality and surreality. The story gives new meaning to the ideas of rebirth, reincarnation, and multiple personalities. The film is one of the most original, clever, and funny films I have seen in a long time. See it only if you have an imagination and want to think and laugh at the same time.",Null,1,2,14 November 1999
The Exorcist," Reissue of a classic
","The 2000 reissue of this film adds a number of scenes that really don't do much for the story. In fact, they slow things down, making it clear why they weren't in the original version.The story holds up well, and the confrontation between Max Von Sydow and the demon are especially good. Von Sydow has played Jesus in THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD and Satan in NEEDFUL THINGS. Here his portrait of an aging but determined priest is strong and is essential to the believability of the final act which seems to indicate that the devil and the priest have an old score to settle.The effects are good although somewhat tame by modern standards, yet it was this film that led the way for the more vivid horror films that followed.",Null,2,3,1 October 2000
Pearl Harbor," Lotta FX and a Love Triangle
","In this big action treatment of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, TORA! TORA! TORA!, and THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO, the historical plot gives way to technical FX and melodrama. I didn't complain when James Cameron did that with TITANIC because the characters and the plot were integrated into the main story of the great ship's disaster, but here history takes a back seat.The superficial character development of the romantic triangle doesn't justify the sluggish first 90 minutes of the movie. The characters played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are not in the same league with such great on-screen rivalries as those done by Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, but I fault the director and writer for that, not the actors. I cringed at some of the trite dialogue delivered with sha-ZAM faked accents. Much of the 1940s atmosphere before the Pearl Harbor raid is slick but is as superficial as the characters.Then there are the unintentional laughs such as the mountains of Long Island, the US Capitol doubling as the Navy Department, and the classic Woody car clearly in view right after the sexual encounter scene. And isn't it convenient that we have two buddies, one for each major theater of the war? As far as the mawkish, repetitive music -- don't bother listening. We even have crucifixion imagery. I think there must be a kitchen sink in there someplace too.However, I have to say that ultimately I liked the film. It works best when it starts focusing on the Japanese preparations for war, and after we finally meet FDR and see the Pearl Harbor attack followed by the Doolittle raid. I think the director and writer could have trimmed the opening sequences from 90 to at most 45 minutes, and the film would have gotten off to a much better start.While I can't recommend the first act, the second and third acts are worth the effort. So sit back, relax, eat your popcorn slowly (get a big bag and take a good 90 minutes to savor the flavor), and wait for the real movie to begin.",Null,0,1,25 May 2001
Independence Day," Selling a movie
",The film rips off much better scenes and FX from every big sci-fi of recent times. The plot is well-intentioned but cartoonish.   Why did so many people go see this one? Hype. That's defined as 'selling a movie.',Null,0,4,30 July 1998
Gone with the Wind," A funny soap
","The people who made this film realized that the soap suds could easily plunge off the screen and drown the audience. So, wisely, they played many of the scenes for comedy to counteract the soap. Consider the scene in the library in which the very melodramatic encounter between Ashley and Scarlet is undercut quickly by Rhett's comments and actions after Ashley leaves.The study of Scarlet is an interesting psychological portrait of obsession - - nothing comes close except SUNSET BLVD.The newly restored version gives us an amazingly clear, crisp color image with sharp audio -- I understood some of the lines for the first time.",Null,5,18,30 July 1998
JFK," A good mystery
","Whether you agree with Jim Garrison's conspiracy theory or not, Stone's film is an effective mystery. The pieces of the puzzle are put together with great skill so that the viewer is kept involved despite the length of the film. The John Williams score helps to build the atmosphere of intrigue and confusion. Costner is rather bland, as usual, but that works well here since he is surrounded by such an interesting group of colorful characters. This is definitely a good mystery -- and a frightening one if even part of the conspiracy theory has validity.",Null,56,103,12 August 1998
Schindler's List," A masterpiece
","Using mostly black and white, Spielberg takes us into the nightmare at the center of human life. We are brought down deep into hell itself before we are brought back up to an enlightenment. In spite of the horror, the film is powerfully uplifting. It is a study in the worst and best in human nature.",Null,9,13,3 August 1998
Amadeus," A study in madness
","No character other than Captain Ahab in MOBY DICK comes close to the obsessive, egotistic, insanely jealous Salieri. The music is wonderful, the sets and costumes are grand, but the performances are what really makes this the powerful film that it is. Slowly we are drawn into old Salieri's madness until we at last understand why he did what he did -- but by that time, we see what a patheic creature he is. He is, as he himself says, the 'patron saint of mediocrity.' His insane anger against God causes him to destroy himself -- and yet, he is allowed to live in order to see his own destruction. That is the real horror of the story.",Null,3,6,1 August 1998
Casualties of War," 'Nobody cares'
","This is a true story of what happens in war when morality and ethics are tossed aside. The killing that is involved in war gets mixed up with murder, bigotry, and revenge in this factual horror story.Fox is excellent as the naive but ethical young man exposed to a 'Nobody cares' atmosphere in the midst of war. The film not only shows what can happen to human beings when they let go of any sense of conscience, but it is also a metaphor of the amoral mentality that was behind the Viet Nam conflict and its aftermath.The struggle depicted here is between going along with the group or maintaining one's own integrity. Are there rules of war? Are there rules of living? These are the profound questions which underlie the action in this disturbing film.",Null,49,62,19 August 2001
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Oz meets Rocky Horror at the Wall
","Amidst pictures of sinking ships in fishfood restaurants (How's that for symbolism?), Hedwig tells his/her story. Like tearing down the Berlin wall, the wall between male and female is torn down in this gender bender. And we actually are in Kansas now -- at least part of the time.There is some interesting symbolism about finding your other half or true self and reaching the edge of self-awareness. If you deny yourself, you doom yourself. Yet, at the same time, you must be powerless in order to avoid the corruption which power brings. And, all the while, God is a micromanager of knowledge. How's that for a musical?The songs are lively, but I found the surreal quality of stage play turned into film a bit plodding. Still, the movie is an interesting look into the artificiality of sexual divisions and conventions.",Null,0,1,2 September 2001
The Insider," Pacino vs. Tobacco
","This is a low-keyed but powerful suspense story of the truth behind the big lie the tobacco industry told the public for years -- namely, that cigarettes are non-addictive and non-harmful.The dark side of the American Dream is delved here in a film that reminds me of ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN, WALL STREET, and JFK. Money rules and morals are cast aside in corporate American. Silence about the truth is gained through intimidation, pay-offs, and the simple psychology of fear.The musical score is very effective -- an operatic elegy depicting the struggle for truth against titanic odds. Integrity eventually survives, but at great costs. The cast is excellent. Pacino is especially good at underplaying his seething desire for journalistic ideals. He and Crowe stand almost alone against the forces brought against them.The film also has some interesting symbolic foreshadowings. Watch for the sign 'Beat the Clock' signifying that truth is in a race against time. Notice how the main character's daughter has lung problems, indicating an unstated reason why Crowe's character is so determined in his fight for the truth. Along the way, we also have graveyards and a burning car to prefigure events to come.I strongly recommend the film both as good drama and as a revelation of one of the biggest health cover-ups in history.",Null,0,1,5 November 1999
The Mummy Returns," Fun Sequel
","I got my money's worth -- plenty of computer imagery, lots of noise, and a fun story.Once again, nobody is going to forget Boris Karloff because of this mummy movie, but it is a good action ride. The interesting twist on the story is that we have good guy vs. bad guy vs. bad guy. And it's all done with a zany sense of humor that made the previous film enjoyable.There are more rituals than you can shake an Egyptian asp at, some reminiscent of Indiana Jones films. The voice of the mummy when he is reincarnating is a delishious blend of Darth Vader and Jabba the Hut. What more could you ask?I found the pacing a bit tedious in the third act, and some of the scenes looked exactly like what they were -- computer images. But it's a beautiful little vacation into the mysteries of ancient Egypt. If you go, don't forget to bring your mummy. (Sorry -- couldn't resist.)",Null,0,1,24 May 2001
There's Something About Mary," Wonderful Comedy
",This is a revival of a type of comedy that was popular in the 1930s and 1940s -- screwball comedy but with a 1990s touch. It is already becoming a cult favorite just because of the 'hair gel' scene alone. I loved it.,Null,0,0,30 July 1998
From Hell," The beginnings of our own time
","As Jack the Ripper boasted (in the film) that he gave birth to the 20th Century. The horror of the human mind is the hell into which we see here. It is a truly unsettling view of the monstrousness of twisted thought, something far more terrifying than any physical deformity.The imagery and atmosphere are excellent to create a dark underworld hidden by the prim and proper veneer of the Victorian world. Insanity, drugs, power, misguided loyalty, and religious fanaticism -- all things we see in our own time -- are played out in this unnervingly dark mystery that would have Sherlock Holmes stunned and gasping.Depp gives a spooky, restrained performance, and Holm is wonderful in all elements of his presentation. The eyes of death have never been more dramatically revealed. And the real horror is that this story is based on one theory of what actually happened in the notorious Ripper crimes.If the Ripper gave birth to the 20th Century, what more horrors await in the 21st?",Null,2,2,21 October 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Lifestyles of the rich and bored
","Briefly: over-long over-rated movie by an over-rated director.More detailed comments?We see the rich and beautiful people on toilets, getting stripped, getting dressed, and being rich and beautiful. Just as in another of Kubrick's over-rated films 2001, the director takes much too long to belabor a thin plot. Photographed in a gauzy glow, the film could be called THE NINE YEAR ITCH. It's full of style with little substance. Some of the piano music is reminiscentm of old nickelodeon meller-dramas. I got the feeling that the film was Kubrick's failed attempt at being Hitchcock.The story takes an hour to really get started, and everything seems to be in slow motion. That's a self-indulgent method of storytelling that doesn't work here at all. Be prepared to use fast forward a lot if you don't want the film to drive you up the wall.Oddly set at Christmas time, it could have been a good Halloween film if it had some pacing to it other than a dirge. However, there are a few enjoyable moments: the comic relief of the costume shop and the amusingly baroque masked ball.As to the interpretation of the story as being a long dream that the sexually-starved doctor is having -- well, maybe, but unless that's clear in the original novel and one reads the novel, it's certainly not clear in the film. In fact, not much is really clear in the film. Of course, that's probably part of the theme. But I have to say it's much ado about nothing.",Null,1,2,15 October 2000
Titanic," Powerful Storytelling
","While some viewers were disappointed that this wasn't just another A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, I believe that the use of the fictional characters was an effective story-telling device. We are brought into the story through Jack and Rose with the historical characters and events as a backdrop. The same device is used in such great films as GONE WITH THE WIND, THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE, and THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. History is thus brought to life without being ponderous.",Null,5,10,29 July 1998
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fun with magic
","The film gives us a good use of FX to create a magic Alice in Wonderland world. It is a bit overly long, but it's fun because of an engaging cast and good use of mythological archetypes.The hero's quest is told once again. This time, it's a combination of STAR WARS, ROBIN HOOD, PHANTASM, and DEAD POET'S SOCIETY. It even offers an interesting parable about people who are different and whom the world shuts up in cupboards -- or closets.",Null,0,0,3 January 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," The darkest side of humanity
","Though this film is associated with Christmas because it has been shown at Christmas time, it is really a dark study of the insides of the human soul. George is driven to the point of wanting to die and wanting not even to exist. Frank Capra takes us through the life of a man so that we can see why someone would be willing to choose oblivion rather than existence. Then we see that, even though life may seem meaningless, we, like George, have choices and that these choices can make a great difference in the world even though we may not realize that fact. The film helps us to realize why we are alive. That is its real enduring appeal.",Null,6,12,1 August 1998
A Beautiful Mind," Beautiful look at intellect
","In John Nash's search for originality, we are taken on a journey into the discovery of what makes a human being. Clever dialogue and well-developed characters give us an insight into genius that has rarely been achieved in any other film.The story involves the struggle of the individual against society and 'reality' -- whatever that is. The atrocities as well as the imagination of the human mind are portrayed as Nash searches for a sense of meaning in a seemingly meaningless or possibly insane world.Through him, we discover that logic only has real meaning when it is integrated with the heart in love. Putting that idea into words makes it sound cliche, but the film is definitely an original work of art and intellect -- as well as heart.",Null,0,2,6 January 2002
To Kill a Mockingbird," Deceptively simple
","This is a wonderful, touching film. It seems so simple and yet there is so much going on. Through the eyes of a little girl we see bigotry, human stupidity, and courage. The story-telling is direct and focused. The cast is solid. This is one of the great films depicting the triumph of the human spirit.",Null,0,0,2 August 1998
The Bridge on the River Kwai," High Noon at the bridge
","The Carl Foreman influence is evident in the film despite the fact that his name was, for a long time, not even in the credits. Like Foreman's HIGH NOON, we have a train due to arrive at a crucial moment bringing with it some sort of doom and death.Also like HIGH NOON, this film makes us look at what makes people tick. The madness of the two colonels is an interesting study in what war does to people. This is one of the great war -- or anti-war -- films.",Null,12,25,3 August 1998
The Green Mile," Entertaining...BUT!!!
","It seems as if Stephen King had a dream one night after seeing TITANIC and FRANKENSTEIN and reading OF MICE AND MEN and maybe even the BIBLE. He or the producer must have also recently viewed FORREST GUMP and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. GREEN MILE, amazingly enough, combines elements of all of those films, books, and ideas.What we have here is an entertaining but completely contrived parable with an obvious Christ-figure (another character in movies or literature with the initials J.C.) and his chief preacher of the 'word' named Paul whom he met, not on the Road to Damascus, but on the 'green mile.'The only thing that makes this unbelievable potboiler work is the excellent cast. The plot, by itself, is overly manipulative and has loopholes big enough for J.C. himself to walk through without hitting his head. But then, after all, we must remember that this is a Stephen King story.",Null,0,0,4 January 2000
Jaws," The master touch
",Spielberg takes a novel that is nothing more than a poor man's MOBY DICK and turns the story into a real monster horror film which is all the more effective because it is realistic.The power of the film comes from the fact that we are made to get down to those deepest and scariest of emotions: fear of the unknown and fear of the unseen. The shark thus becomes the boogie man of all our nightmares. We want to wake up -- but not before a genuine thrill.,Null,1,3,1 August 1998
Platoon," The horror of war
","Unlike the more ponderous APOCALYPSE NOW, this film is more concise in revealing the horror of war. Oliver Stone uses two allusions to get his point across. One is Sergeant Barnes as 'our Captain Ahab' leading the platoon on a doomed mission into the hell of the wartime jungle. The other is Sergeant Elias as a Christ figure.The battle is for the soul of the naive Chris Taylor. Chris goes through the classic American journey of initiation into evil. The events are harrowing and the film leaves the viewer stunned by the savagery that human being can create. The film can also leave the viewer enlightened about the potential for goodness in human beings.",Null,0,1,25 August 2001
Halloween," Atmospheric scary fun
","This is one of the truly spooky movies. It doesn't rely on gore or FX. Instead, it builds a convincing sense of fright. The musical score adds greatly to the sense of tedious tension which helps make the spookiness unnerving.The film is the old story of the Boogie Man set in modern middle-America. The Boogie Man can't be killed. He has no reason, no emotion, no conscience. He has the eyes of a devil. The really frightening thing that this film portrays is the scariest place of all -- the human mind.",Null,0,0,7 January 2001
Carrie," Spooky stuff
","This is one of the very few Stephen King novels that was made into a really scary film.We see a titanic battle between the Freudian forces of sexuality and puritanical beliefs. Caught in the middle is Carrie. She has become a woman, but her insane mother (who is an interesting mixture of religion and sensuality) tells her that being a woman is evil. Not only does the mother hate herself, but she also makes life terrible for Carrie. As a result, Carrie is the butt of ridicule at her school.Nevertheless, Carrie has the last say on all of her tormentors in an interesting display of poetic justice mixed with irony.",Null,0,0,3 January 2001
Raging Bull," Pure Scorsese
","This is THE classic Scorsese film. Shot in gritty black and white with some grainy color home movies thrown in for verisimilitude, the film gives us a frightening portrait of Jake La Motta, the sado-masochistic boxer.In telling La Motta's story, Scorsese dramatizes what jealously, suspicion, and petty-mindedness can do to a person. It is a terrible journey of self-sabotage.DeNiro gives the amazing tour-de-force performance that won him an Oscar. It is not a pleasant movie, but it does reveal the tragic flaws in human nature and even offers a slight bit of redemption.",Null,1,1,26 August 2001
The Iron Giant," A parable of the 90s set in the 50s
","When I first heard about this film, I assumed that it was just a kiddy movie. But then I heard that it was much better than the usual 'family film' grool. I finally went and saw it, and I am glad I did.Combining elements of stories like ET, BLADE RUNNER, and WARGAMES, it is a great parable about anti-violence. Set during the paranoia of the 50s, it shows how humanity creates humanity and how violence creates just more violence. It has a message for the 90s and for all time. I am glad to hear a movie be so bold as to tell us the truth -- guns kill, and none of us have to be guns. We can be people.The animation in the film is beautiful with rich colors and believable characterization -- unlike the over-done wide-eyed stereotypes we keep getting in the assembly line Disney cartoons recently. This is a real family film -- both the kids and the adults can enjoy it. And to top it off, we have a robot who becomes a Christ figure. GO SEE IT!",9,1,2,19 September 1999
Shrek," Great Satire & a Good Message
","'Once upon a time' goes down the drain -- literally.All the classic cartoon fairy-tale characters are cast out of fairy-tale land by a nasty little dictator with Freudian problems. It is up to the least-likely of heros to save the day -- actually four least-likely heros.We have self-righteous villagers with torches, an ogre ban on singing, plus types and stereotypes all over the place. All the cliches get squashed till the juices splatter everywhere -- and it's great fun.The idea that appearances are deceiving is well illustrated without being preachy. We all wear illusions and masks. Maybe if we were simply who we really are, the world would be nicer. Maybe not, but who knows?While I am not as impressed with computer graphics as many people seem to be, this is still a funny film that everyone can enjoy.",Null,0,0,28 May 2001
Any Given Sunday," Too long and too little

The Emperor's New Groove," Just for fun
","This is an amusing (and almost unrecognizable) take off on SNOW WHITE with Kuzco as Snow White, Yzma as the evil witch, and Pacha as all 7 dwarfs rolled into one big lug. The film is lots of zany fun for adults and kids without a terminal case of cutsies and the instant songfest soundtrack.It's good to see that the Disney company can make a savy, fun movie that combines expressionistic art with traditional Disney imagery. The movie is lightweight and a lot more fun than many recent Disney offerings.",Null,0,0,1 January 2001

","What a mixture of the future with the past! We are in 21st Century Los Angeles which has the look of a 1940s film noir.In this odyssey into the mind and soul, Harrison Ford's character has to confront what it means to be human and what it means to be alive -- at the same time that he has to come off like a Sam Spade style jaded detective in a sordid murder mystery.And don't miss the extremely odd Christ-figure in the film. I won't give anything away except to say, be surprised! Be very surprised!The sets, music, and acting make this a cult classic worth seeing.",Null,0,0,2 March 2001
The Sixth Sense," OK, but not the movie it pretends to be
","What I liked: the performances are excellent, especially the actor playing the boy. He is totally convincing in every scene -- a true rarity for someone his age. He deserves watching. If his performance hadn't been true, the movie would have collapsed. I also liked some of the atmosphere and the basic premise of the film.What I didn't like: the movie previews made this seem to be a scary ghost film. While it does have its moments, it is more of a mawkish soap opera about Willis' character. The story moves excruciatingly slowly. And one more thing that bothers me: the story was done years ago on an old TWILIGHT ZONE or ONE STEP BEYOND. Ironically, it was better in the original because they took only 1/2 hour or hour to tell the story, while here they drag it out to almost two hours.It's an interesting psychological study, but as a ghost story it is just too sluggish.",Null,0,0,11 August 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," Disco Fun
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, but I was thoroughly entertained. It's a daffy cross between CLUELESS and 54 with some SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER (and LIVE) as well as DUMB AND DUMBER thrown in. The two brothers are deliciously out of touch, but their innocent thick-headedness causes them to make the world bend to their own view of reality. It was definitely a fun film.",Null,7,16,2 October 1998
The Truman Show," True Man
","The film is an amazing combination of existentialism, surrealism, and symbolism. Truman turns into a Christ figure by the end and represents the desire of all people to find the truth of who they are and why they exist. > What is really amazing is that all of this is poured together into one film that is entertaining as well as thought provoking. How often do we get that from Hollywood? Other than CONTACT, I can't think of many other films recently.",Null,2,2,30 July 1998
The Matrix," Keanu is the ONE, dude!
","This is over two hours of SPEED (pun intended) with lots of metaphysics thrown in. It is heavy on special FX but a little thin on depth of meaning. But then, that may be the meaning. Whoa!

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," May the force be with you
","Combining Robin Hood, Snow White and the 7 Dwarf, pirate films, World War II movies, and lots of FX that had never been seen before, George Lucas created a film legend. Why do we enjoy this film? Not because of the FX. People can't identify with FX. It is because we can relate to Luke and how he deals with his adventures. Who is Luke? He is all of us, but he is also George Lukas who puts himself into the story and then has a joyful ride. We are glad to go along for the fun.",Null,0,2,3 August 1998
Thirteen Days," On the brink of madness
","The film shows how easily human events can get out of control. The theme of the story is that we must not abandon our own judgment in the heat of crisis. The hawks and doves who, only a few years later, would fight a civil war in the US over the mess of Viet Nam are shown here tuning up. Political, diplomatic, and public fields of conflict are portrayed with restrained but excellent performances.We make our problems and we have to be able to solve them or else we will destroy ourselves. Fortunately, at least for the moment, the terrible crisis which the movie portrays has passed, and the film points out that we all share the same little boat, our planet, in the midst of a vast sea.",Null,0,0,13 January 2001
Gladiator," American allegory
","Even though the film is based on the same historical elements as an earlier film called THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, what we have here is an interesting allegory of the potential fall or rebirth of America.The Roman eagle and the US eagle are obvious connections, but there are others dealing with political corruption, vicious athleticism, and ethical indifference. Unlike the earlier film, the ending here gives some hope for the future even though the historical Rome, in fact, only had about three centuries more to go before the ultimate fall due its own internal deterioration as well as the invasion of the Goths.The FX here are well used to give us a sense of what ancient Rome looked like although some of the visuals show up clearly as fakes especially on a large screen where human beings are overly-dwarfed by CG images.The cast is strong, and we are given a grand epic in the style of films such as BEN HUR -- but without Heston's stuffed-shirt performance. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix in particular stand out as the two opposing forces, the conflict between whom will determine the future course of history.",Null,0,0,10 May 2000

","This is the first, best, and most successful of the three BACK TO THE FUTURE films. It points out that the future is something we make. It is not fated or destined except by our own choices.Michael J. Fox steals the picture as the 'future boy' who is both an Oedipal love object for his own mother and a Cupid to get his parents together. The story combines very creative imagination, romance, comedy, and drama in a charming way and without sermonizing. This is a sweet and funny delight.",Null,1,4,5 March 2001
Rock Star," All About Rock
","Mark Wahlberg didn't want to wear a loincloth in the recent remake of PLANET OF THE APES, but he gets to show off his lean torso a lot in this interesting cross between ALL ABOUT EVE and the Rock world.The goal is raunchy rock, man, in this satire of show-biz and fame. Wahlberg starts out as a copy machine repairman who copies a rock group called Steel Dragon. He dreams his dream so hard that he not only becomes Steel Dragon in his head but in reality -- or the rock version of reality.The plot follows a naive young man and woman on the roller-coaster of fame and high times. The boundaries between reality and fantasy blur with alcohol, drugs, and sex. But the strange journey eventually takes the two main characters back to themselves and their own music. Along the way, they must deal with the issue of what is really valuable in life.This is an interesting character study and a bit of fun too.",Null,0,2,7 September 2001

It is a meandering odyssey which finally ends with some answers as he learns to grow up.The film won't please everyone, but if you like exploring the deranged mind of a man looking for himself and the meaning of life and if you like stories in which the main character has periodic discussions with the audience, you will probably enjoy this strange, amusing, wandering journey.",Null,0,1,2 April 2000

This film should have been at the top of their list.The Pearl Harbor attack is the climax of the film as well as of the various intricate human relationships in the film. This is a classic piece of romantic history, and the beach scene is probably one of the most erotic ever done -- all the more impressive because it has no nudity.This is a real saga of human passion and how it is affected by history. Whether you see PEARL HARBOR or not is up to you. But definitely see this film.",Null,41,64,10 June 2001
The Godfather," Saga of the Dark American Dream
","The three GODFATHER movies are an interesting, detailed look into the dark side of the American Dream. It is no accident that the first film begins with the words, 'I believe in America.'We are taken along on Michael's journey as he goes from naive idealism to corruption, then struggles to free himself from crime, only to be pulled back into it. This is a classic American theme of initiation into evil. One cannot touch evil without being touched by evil.The cast is first-rate, and the story has become so much a part of Americana now that some of the dialogue has even become recognizable catch-phrases. Even the theme music is instantly recognizable.Watch the trilogy and see the essential American saga.",Null,1,2,23 August 2001
