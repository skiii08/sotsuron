Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Laugh after Laugh after Laugh
","Thanks to a couple of free passes, I got in almost a month early to see this. I don't normally watch Da Ali G show, or Borat so only had a vague idea what to expect. I got that and a hell of a lot more. From the first opening scenes to the closing credits my friends, the cinema and my self were almost rolling in the aisles with this 'documentary'. I hate using phrases like this but it was 'comic genius'. If you like Borat on TV then what are you waiting for? If you haven't seen him, go watch this - you're in for a treat. His co-stars in the film were excellent sports, and if some of it was candid then well done to Borat for capturing Americans at the best.",9,4,12,13 October 2006
