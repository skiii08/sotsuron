The Sound of Music," One of my all-time favorites
","I love this movie!!!  The acting is wonderful and the music is beautiful, but those aren't the only things I love about it.  One of the reasons I watch this movie again and again is because I simply adore seeing the love between Maria and Captain Von Trapp unfold.  From the stern, cold way he addresses her in the beginning to his deep sincerity when he tells Maria that he loves her, the whole development is nothing short of magical.  The children are all wonderful, considering (and I checked up on this!) that each of them were really about 3-5 years older than the ages they portrayed! Since I've seen the movie so many times, I've noticed a few picky little editing mistakes, but that hardly matters considering the great feeling one experiences while watching this classic.",Null,0,5,19 September 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Deserves all the praise it ever got!
","I don't know why I haven't written about this movie yet...I just love it! This could possibly be due to my passion for 'Romeo and Juliet,' the most beautiful love story ever told.  Only a few years ago I saw 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' in London, and was completely swept away by the genius of Tom Stoppard.  I place his comedic strength on the same pedestal as Monty Python, with a little less wackiness and a little more sophistication.  With that in mind, I knew going into the movie theater that 'Shakespeare in Love' would be nothing short of brilliant.  I wasn't disappointed. Watching all of the actors and actresses in this movie is always such a treat.  Gwyneth Paltrow is positively radiant, pulling off a virtually flawless accent; Joseph Fiennes, while perhaps a bit hunky for the Shakespeare role, is wonderful; Dame Judi Dench brings a delicious, though far too infrequent, energy to the screen; and Geoffrey Rush, whom I had associated with dark and serious drama, is just so enjoyable in his role of the quick-thinking Henslowe. If you have a special love of Shakespeare, then 'The show must --' 'Go on!'",Null,0,1,24 May 2000
Romeo + Juliet," Depressing - not because of the plot line!
","Call me a traditionalist, a purist, close-minded, or what you will.  I welcome it!  This movie makes me wince.  Go check out my comment for Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet and you just might understand why.  I don't care what people say about how this version makes Shakespeare available and accessible to the masses - I think of it more as throwing heaps of garbage at the masses.  SPOILER WARNING: For crying out loud, Luhrmann changed the plot!  Juliet is supposed to wake up *AFTER* Romeo drinks the poison and dies.  What did Luhrmann hope to gain by rewriting Shakespeare??  All he got from me was disrespect. Zefferelli's version is *not* boring.  It is a gorgeous film in all ways, with sumptuous costume, beautiful sets and FABULOUS ACTING.  The love between Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting is far and away more believable than that of Danes and DiCaprio, for all their power to attract teeny-boppers to the theater. If you're a high school student being 'forced' to read this play, I hope for your sake and the sake of literature that your teacher does not show you this version first.  If you're 'of the masses' for whom this movie was presumably written, do yourself a favor and don't watch it.  If you're like me and truly appreciate superb filmmaking and traditional, respectful interpretations, for goodness' sake help me spread the word!",Null,0,0,17 March 2002
