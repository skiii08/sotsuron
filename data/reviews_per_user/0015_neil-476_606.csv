"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Very enjoyable with a reservation
","Let me start off by saying how much I enjoyed this - my wife and (adult) daughter, too. The story, though slight, is perfectly serviceable, the dialogue is funny, the characters are enjoyable and (mostly) believable, and Pegg is his usual entertaining and appealing self.My concern here is the language. The F word is used on a few occasions - not many - and with one exception it achieves nothing: it could have been omitted with no loss. On one occasion it has dramatic purpose, but this could have been achieved by other means.I have nothing against bad language used with valid purpose - I'm fine withe the almost constant bad language in Zack And Miri Make A Porno, for instance - but here I felt it was entirely unnecessary and, as such, I objected to it.",Null,0,1,9 January 2010
The Devil's Advocate," Hugely entertaining, Pacino at his best
","I love this film.Keanu Reeves' customary impassiveness is ideally suited to playing an ambitious lawyer with a murky personal history, lured into a fast track to the big time by Al Pacino's law firm boss who, we rapidly realise, is the devil himself (as if the film's title and the character's name of John Milton didn't give us enough clues).This combination of supernatural thriller and personal drama leads us - and Keanu - up the garden path and down again a number of times until, finally, the long awaited showdown occurs. The movie then resolves in a number of different ways, all of which are completely satisfying.Everything is good in this film, but pride of place must go to Pacino, playing Milton with a reptilian seductiveness which repels and attracts simultaneously. I can't imagine anyone else playing the part half as effectively.",Null,2,4,13 July 2011
The King's Speech," Worthy and entertaining
","King George VI suffered from a stammer. Upsetting as it was to him, this didn't matter in the wider scheme of things until his older brother King Edward VIII abdicated, unexpectedly advancing George (aka 'Bertie') to the throne. Given that a war was approaching, it was important that the King's radio pronouncements not be tainted by the dreaded stammer. And so, having exhausted any number of potential 'cures', Bertie's wife Queen Elizabeth approached an Australian speech therapist called Lionel Logue.I have experienced my fair share of what I call 'worthy' films, and they tend to produce the same reaction in me as the end credits roll - 'Well, that was very worthy, but I didn't enjoy it very much.' The very worthiness tends to suck the drama and humour out of a project.This is not so with The King's Speech. This true story is interesting, gripping, inspiring, funny, and very moving. You are never in any doubt that this stammer forms a dreadful foundation which underlies the entirety of Bertie's life, and Colin Firth's performance is deservedly receiving high praise (it is early in the awards season, but it must be a serious contender for the highest awards).Having said that, Geoffrey Rush's genial but unconventional Lionel Logue is also brimful of humanity, with a compassion and humour which are understated, and all the more effective for that.Which is not to underestimate the rest of the cast. Helena Bonham-Carter is not my favourite actress, but she is excellent here, and I also liked Guy Pearce as the flawed Edward VIII - full of angst at his own position, but insensitive to his brother.There is an excellent sense of time and place.This is a very good film, and I recommend it highly.",9,0,1,14 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," Delightful
","Ex-villain Gru, now settled into parenthood with the three girls, is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to identify a villain in partnership with Agent Lucy Wilde.Much of the elements which made the first film such fun are here in this sequel, although we have lost Gru's development arc of softening from comic villain to sentimental father: here, he is already a sentimental father. But his arc develops further and the film, thankfully, goes exactly where you want it to go. Even more thankfully, it does so with a great deal of humour, colour and action on the way. The 3D is good and the voices are excellent.And the minions are, again, wonderful as they take delight, at child level, in mild rudeness and slapstick violence.This film is a delight - charming, very funny, and with a lot of heart. I preferred it to its predecessor.",9,2,3,19 July 2013
The Mask," Sometimes everything just works
","The comic from which this movie is derived is quite a dark piece of work. Happily, the movie adaptation chose to concentrate on the humorous and surrealistic elements which were always there. Even more happily, the movie coincided with an upsurge in Jim Carrey's career generated by his performance in Ace Ventura, and provided the perfect vehicle for his brand of face-pulling physical humour.The story is serviceable, but is essentially no more than a vehicle for the wonderfully imaginative visual sequences.This was one of the earliest movies in which sophisticated CGI provided truly eye catching sterling support to a storyline, and it is a joy to see Tex Avery-inspired cartoon goings on translated into photorealistic 'real life' visuals. There are some terrific musical sequences too, and the movie is also very funny.Oh, and it was Cameron Diaz' first movie. There are few stars whose first appearances on screen I recall (Ursula Andress, and then I'm searching) - Diaz in The Mask is another.",9,0,0,31 May 2010
Insidious: Chapter 2," Satisfactory
","The unfortunate Lambert family continue to experience difficulties imposed on them by assorted malevolent entities from the netherworld, and we learn some backstory about what went on in the past.In many ways this is a Ronseal film - it does exactly what it says on the tin - albeit the story does have a bit more meat on its bones than one might expect for a sequel which, like this one, simply seeks to extend what made its predecessor successful. It doesn't make a whole load of sense though.But it is mildly creepy throughout, has a number of 'made you jump' moments, features a returning cast, gives Patrick Wilson the chance to chew some scenery, and the two comic sidekicks are quite good fun. I could have done without quite so much creeping about - there is MASSES of it - and it isn't going to satisfy hard horror fans (little blood, goriness, grossness, bad language) but it is not bad of its sort.",7,0,1,1 November 2013
The Lobster," Profoundly strange, but oddly engaging
","In a somewhat skewed alternate version of somewhere in present-day Europe, David (Colin Farrell) is sent to the Hotel, where he has 45 days in which to find his match, failing which he will be transformed into the animal of his choice and set loose into the wild. Despite selecting a lobster (just in case) he initially attempts to set himself up with a woman with no kindred feeling for others, before escaping and joining a group of Loners in the woods. Unfortunately, they have their own rules which preclude him and Rachel Weisz' characters falling in love, which is exactly what happens.It was only after watching this film that I discovered that the man behind it - Yorgos Lanthimos - was also responsible for Dogtooth, another deeply peculiar film in which the relationships between people, and their behaviour, are completely incomprehensible to anyone brought up in conventional society. In The Lobster, everybody speaks with conventional politeness and an utter absence of emotion.The whole thing is completely bizarre, yet it is often surprisingly funny and, notwithstanding my expectation of finding it annoyingly pretentious (which it is) it also held my attention: I watched it all the way through and didn't switch it off.I don't think I would recommend it, but it had sufficient weirdness and an odd warmth for me to quite like it. Terrific cast, too.",7,3,5,13 August 2016
Whip It," Highly enjoyable
","Ellen Page is Bliss Cavendar, a 17 year old who spends much of her time reluctantly participating in beauty pageants for the vicarious enjoyment of her mother (Marcia Gay Harden). And then one day Bliss discovers roller derby, and everything changes.For a small movie, Whip It touches on some fairly heavy issues - families, friendship, fulfilment, fidelity, and various other things beginning with F (and some which begin with other letters). But it touches on them deftly (and, sometimes, a little glibly), and always entertainingly. This is a very enjoyable script with many smiles in it.Th roller derby sequences are well staged, if a little obviously protective of the tiny Miss Page. The film is well cast, with Kristen Wiig and Daniel Stern being particularly appealing.But, again, Ellen Page claims the film, with a performance which is funny, perceptive, touching and sexy.",9,1,5,7 April 2010
The Avengers," It was worth the wait!
","Having cracked the problem of super-hero movies with successful runs on Spider-Man and X-Men (both franchises contracted out to major studios), Marvel went independent with assorted features based on their lesser known characters - Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - and did very well with a series of one-off movies which were commercially and critically well received. Importantly, these movies were conceived, from the very start, as essential building blocks moving towards this film, which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have headlined their own movies and who now appear together (OK, so I'm ignoring Abbott and Castello's role in bringing together Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman. So sue me).The problem was always going to be how to deal with bringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have carried his own movie - surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other? Or else the movie will be nothing but a testosterone-fulled p*ss*ng contest? It turns out that it is both these things, but the mix is beautifully judged. By entrusting the script and direction to Joss Whedon - ace script doctor, master at working with ensemble pieces, and lifelong comic lover (and excellent comic writer, one might also add), the balance - for balance was always going to be critical in this movie - is perfect.I won't say anything very much about the content, because there is so much in this movie to enjoy. It is simply full of small touches among the bombast, which will bring delight to the average viewer who likes an action-packed blockbuster, and absolute joy to comic lovers. The characters which have been established in the previous movies are all here, and they are all the same people - they haven't been changed for The Avengers, but they have more depth and there is also character development here. The script is terrific and the action is stunning. Oh, and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the end...By the way, thank you so much for saddling this movie in the UK with the ridiculous title 'Marvel Avengers Assemble' (which communicates even less to a non-comics audience than 'The Avengers') and also depriving us of the iconic Avengers logo and title on the main title screen.",10,4,11,27 April 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Great fun
","This is the second of two movies to feature Nicolas Cage as archaeologist/adventurer Ben Gates. Last time. he was involved in stealing the Declaration of Independence: this time he is chasing round after a mythical book in order to disprove a stain on the character of one of his forefathers. Again he is accompanied by (mildly comic) sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha) and Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) as on/off love interest and helper/hinderer. In addition, Helen Mirren joins the cast as Ben's mother, estranged from father Jon Voight. Ed Harris is the fly in the ointment as the motley throng pursue various clues before the final set piece climax.As with its predecessor, this is very much in Indiana Jones territory, albeit modern day. And everything about it is undemanding fun - the story works well, the action is exciting, and the characters are all relatively strongly drawn and suit this as an ensemble piece.",Null,0,0,20 August 2011
Angels & Demons," Pull the other one
","I usually try not to spoiler: in this case I shall do so wholeheartedly. Don't read on if it bothers you.First I must comment on The Da Vinci Code phenomenon. Angels And Demons,(the movie) is a vague sequel (albeit the book precedes the Da Vinci book). While Da Vinci was hardly deathless prose, it told an interesting, unusual story at breakneck pace in an easy-to-follow manner. It was pacey and entertaining. It sold shedloads, and deservedly so. The movie adaptation was faithful, but lost the novel's immediacy: it still had broad appeal and did well at the box office, hence this sequel.So to Angels And Demons (where I haven't read the book). In the run up to the Cardinals' voting in Conclave for a new Pope, four of them are kidnapped. Despite reservations about Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks, hardly pro-Catholicism in Da Vinci) the Vatican consults him. He figures out that this is the work of the Illuminati, a secret group dating back to the Renaissance, who seek revenge for the Vatican wiping out many of them in the 16th century for their pro-science, anti-Catholic views. Together with a lady scientist whose research generated an antimatter bomb stolen by the Illuminati, intended to wipe the Vatican off the map, Langdon engages in a clue-laden race against time, looking for the missing cardinals and the bomb. He is helped by Ewan MacGregor's Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Camerlengo is acting Pope until the Conclave comes up with a new one - a functional rather than authoritarian position) and hindered by Stellan Skarsgard's head of Vatican police. Armin Mueller-Stahl is a Cardinal who may have his own agenda. There is further jeopardy from the fact that the Illuminati have probably infiltrated the Vatican at the highest level.So far, so not-very-spoilery. Much action, racing around, convoluted clues etc., key factors which made Da Vinci so successful, albeit with a noticeably less credible plot. We even have have a couple of likely suspects - Starsgard's unhelpful police chief and Mueller-Stahl's cagey Cardinal.Now for the rest of the plot. Three Cardinals are killed, but the fourth is saved. The bomb is recovered. However, there is insufficient time for it to be defused. McKenna takes it up in a news helicopter, and bails out. The bomb detonates, the shock wave causes relatively little damage, but McKenna's gesture in saving the Vatican and thousands of lives means he is certain to be voted in as Pope by popular acclaim. Of course, he turns out to be the villain, having murdered the old Pope and arranged the whole thing. Thank you, Robert Langdon, the end.This pleased me in one respect - while the film still had you believing that the Illuminati existed, I wondered why they would leave a series of clues pointing to where the bomb was? Of course, as it was all McKenna's masterplan, he wanted the bomb found.But then I started thinking about this masterplan. Let me list the parts of it (McKenna never does the standard explanatory monologue, you're left to figure it out yourself): 1. Steal antimatter; 2. Make antimatter bomb; 3. Poison Pope; 4. Recruit professional killer to kidnap and kill Cardinals; 5. Create trail based on incredibly complex clues from poem in priceless 16th century book in Vatican archive):6. Rely on Langdon solving clues in time; 7. Make car bomb to blow up professional killer; 8. Rely on helicopter being nearby once bomb is recovered; 9. Rely on there being sufficient time to get helicopter, fly it high enough to avoid total destruction (despite nobody having the slightest idea exactly what effects of antimatter bomb might be), bail out, get to ground safely; 10. Rely on hero factor being sufficient to result in being elected as Pope.The rationale (I think) was that, as Pope, he could prevent the Catholic Church living happily with science.As a plan, I thought that this was risibly implausible. I happily suspend disbelief and willingly did so while the hunt was on, but the revelation of who the baddie was (and, therefore, what his plan must have been) was, to be frank, utterly idiotic - so idiotic, in fact, that it devalued the rest of the film.There was some other stuff which made me scoff with derision:McKenna is branded on the chest: a large glowing brand, maybe 20 cm square, is applied forcefully to his chest for upwards of 5 seconds, following which it is dropped to the floor where is sets the carpet smouldering. Yet this doesn't seem to phase him in the slightest - he races through tunnels and flies helicopters with nary a whimper (he does hold it as if it's a bit tender later on, though).Earlier in the film McKenna tells a story about his military service which ends with him explaining that's where he learned to fly helicopters. It would have been a good deal less clumsy if he had simply whipped out a sign and hung it round his neck reading 'I'm going to be flying a helicopter later in this movie.' Langdon rewinds the security video stored on the police chief's computer. The computer makes the noise of an audio tape being rewound across the replay heads! My favourite bit was when the girl scientist tears a page out of a priceless 16th century book (the page which carries the all-important clues to finding the Cardinals and the bomb, in the form of a poem in English printed in watermarks in the paper!), not because it was an inherently good bit, but because I was immensely tickled at the gasp of horror coming from a lady in the audience.This film was mistitled. It should have been called 'Angels, Demons, And Complete And Utter B*ll*cks.'",5,107,153,21 May 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More like it
","Volume 2 was everything Volume 1 should have been but wasn't.In particular, here we see character development, and we find out (at last!) why we should care about The Bride.Tarantino told this story bass-ackwards. I understand his stylistic choice to do so, but had there been the expository character development at the start of the story which appears here, I would have cared more for the character through the events of what became Volume 1.Thurman and Carradine are excellent, and the domestic stand-off at the end, after the almost apocalyptic shenanigans of the first film, is a fine, fine conclusion to The Bride's story.",8,0,1,2 April 2008
First Man," A long, dull film about an unlikeable man and his unlikeable wife, filmed unwatchably with hand-held camera
","Neil Armstrong joins the space programme in the 1960s and ends up commanding the first mission to land on the moon. Along the way, some family stuff happens.This is a very long film about the part of Neil Armstrong's life leading up to the moon landing. It is directed by Damien Chazelle who deservedly won Best Director Oscar for La-La Land. His direction here seems to be based along the idea of filming almost everything in close-up with a hand-held camera. As a result, this is a physically difficult film to watch: it is a genuine relief when the camera rests on a tripod.What else can I tell you about it? Ryan Gosling is asked to play Armstrong as utterly emotionless. Since this is something Gosling does in so many of his films, he does it very well. But it doesn't make you care about Armstrong. Nor do you care about his wife. In fact, they are both people you are quite glad that they don't live next door to you, a miserable, joyless pair.The film is also dull and boring. How on earth did they manage that, given the story matter? But they did.The actual moon landing is done well. That's about 5 minutes at the end of two and a quarter hours.This should have been MUCH better than it is.",6,6,14,21 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Dark but good
","Having been shockingly rescued from the Hunger Games at the end of film 2, Katniss finds herself pressed into service as the Mockingjay, the figurehead of the growing rebellion against President Snow's repressive dictatorship. But Snow still holds Peeta prisoner, and Peeta is doing the same PR job for Snow as Katniss is for the Rebellion. Meanwhile, Snow continues to order genocidal military strikes as he deems necessary.The final book in the trilogy is divided in two, as seems to be the current fashion, and this is the first part. Despite only having a 12A certificate in the UK, it is much stronger in content than the previous two films, and it ends with a truly shocking and disturbing image (not that the scenes of the war crimes sites aren't fairly disturbing). There is relatively little action, but what there is is very well staged.This film is much, much darker than the first two episodes, which leaned quite strongly towards adventure. Part 3 is grittier and more political, and shows how lucky the producers were to get Jennifer Lawrence before other roles catapulted her up the ladder: she, like Katniss, is a Girl On Fire in this. Donald Sutherland is - if it were possible - even more reptilian than he was in part 2. And Philip Seymour Hoffman's small amount of time in this, his last film, shows how good he was.A good part 3, and I am now looking forward to the final part.",8,14,44,21 November 2014
Black Swan," Well made and acted, but unsympathetic
","I try to avoid preconceptions when I go into movies, but this was difficult with Black Swan as it started with three strikes against it. One, it is set in the world of ballet which is, conspicuously, not one of my areas of interest (and not from a position of ignorance either: perhaps I would like it better if there were more explosions or spaceships). Two, notwithstanding her undoubted talent, Natalie Portman's presence in a film doesn't particularly attract me to that film. And three, my experience of Darren Arnofsky comprises The Wrestler (good acting but squalid and dispiriting) and The Fountain (pretentious and incomprehensible drivel).On the other hand, reviews appear to be universally strongly positive and, if I must see a ballet-based movie, Swan Lake has to be favourites because ole Pete came up with some top notch tunes for it (less frivolously, it has one of the most intensely emotional scores ever written for anything).To be frank, Black Swan wasn't really my sort of movie. There is an awful lot of ballet in it, even though it isn't actually about ballet. It is just set in the world of ballet, but it is actually about the obsession, repression and eventual breakdown of central character Nina (Portman). As well as the lengthy dance sequences (beautifully photographed, throughout the film, and clear evidence that Portman is a talented dancer), there is also a bullying choreographer / director (Vincent Cassel), an ambiguous and sexy would-be friend (Mila Kunis), and a showbiz Mom (played in a kind of fluffy grand guignol way by Barbara Hershey).On the plus side, the dancing is well presented, the film is always gripping, and Portman's performance (including the dancing) is extremely good.Less positively, it isn't aways easy to understand what has (or hasn't) happened, especially towards the end (which may be deliberate, and it may not matter), and I found Nina such an unsympathetic character that I didn't really care what happened to her. So, although the film is undoubtedly well crafted and extremely well acted, I didn't actually enjoy it that much, and I shan't be rushing out to join the queue for Aronofsky's next movie.",7,0,2,27 January 2011
Changeling," Excellent - very gripping
","After overcoming my disappointment that this wasn't a sci-fi extravaganza, I quite happily toddled along to Changeling, having been initially intrigued by the trailers, and then by what I'd read in the press. This is a very good film, and packs an even bigger punch by virtue of the fact that it is essentially true.Produced and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also does the music), and written by J Michael Straczynski (a name probably best known to date for writing Spider-Man comics), the heart of the story may be well-known now to people reading about films - in 1928 Christine Collins' young son Walter disappears. Some 5 months later she is reunited by the Los Angeles police department with a boy they say is her son, but who is not. Her continued refusal to accept the son who has been thrust upon her is a major inconvenience to the LAPD who have her put in the psychopathic ward of a mental hospital. You can get this much from the trailers, but the film then goes on into other areas which I had not anticipated.I have heard as a criticism that the movie is slow. While I would agree that Eastwood never feels he has to hurry to tell the story, my attention was always held. The period detail always convinces, the music (by Eastwood) is attractive and serves the on-screen images nicely, and the script, while always gripping, never gives the impression that it is over-dramatising real events (although this may well be the case).But what of the performances? Angelina Jolie has already received much acclaim for her performance as Christine Collins and she is, indeed, very good, managing to convey the desperation any mother would feel in such a situation mixed with confusion at being somewhat out of her depth, and bewilderment at the perverse attitude she encounters at every level of the establishment. John Malkovich, as the anti-LAPD clergyman who supports Christine chews rather less scenery than one is accustomed to see him chewing of late.And this is where it becomes interesting. I've been watching films for nearly 60 years now and, apart from Jolie, Malkovich, and Colm Feore as the Chief of Police, I had never seen a single one of the cast on screen before, as far as I can recall. And they were, without exception, first rate, although I must single out Jeffrey Donovan as police Captain Jones, Michael Kelly (looking like a dark Steve Martin) as Detective Ybarra, Jason Butler Harner as Gordon Northcott, and young Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark for special mention.This film was gripping and unusual, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",9,7,11,4 December 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not a disaster: not brilliant
","Well, the good news is that Pirates 4 is better than Pirates 3. The bad news is that it is no better than Pirates 2, and probably not as good.Let's look at the good and bad. It is entertaining and undemanding, excepting only a need for stamina - it is overlong. The story hangs together reasonably well (as long as you are prepared to overlook 'How did he know that was there?' all the way through - Ponce de Leon's ship on top of a remote cliff, for a start off)). Depp's Sparrow is always entertaining company, and Blackbeard is also a welcome villain (although McShane's accent is a bit indecisive). Penelope Cruz never really catches fire, however, and Geoffrey Rush seems to be just going through the motions.With the exception of a chase in London and a nocturnal mermaid-baiting expedition, there are no set pieces on the scale of the cavern swordfight in the first one, the waterwheel fight in the second, and the whirlpool battle in 3. That doesn't really matter, because the rest of what goes on is sufficiently entertaining - I particularly enjoyed the interplay, sketchy though it was, between the cleric and the conflicted mermaid. There are a couple of massed battles, but they don't achieve much - they are simply well-choreographed mêlées of a lot of blokes clashing swords about.I will say that the film is very dark (my father complains about modern films being predisposed to darkness and muted colours, and I see what he means here). When things are light, the colours are vivid, but a lot of this film takes place at night, and the 3D specs darken things down still further. The 3D is at least live, not post-production, and is effective at times (especially underwater), but it is far from essential.I'm glad to be spared Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but I missed the comedy relief pirates and soldiers.And, while I enjoyed this one well enough, my memories of how excellent the first one was are still strong enough for me to say, 'I'm glad you recovered from number 3, but no more now, please.'",7,1,3,20 May 2011
Men in Black 3," A film which remembers to be fun
","Boris the Animal ('Just Boris!') is sprung from prison on the moon to seek revenge against Agent K, who put him there 40 years earlier. This revenge involves going back in time to kill him, which surprises Agent J, who only spoke to him on the phone the night before and then finds the next day that Agent K died 40 years earlier, and so has to go back in time himself to prevent Agent K being killed. The question of how come Agent J remembers Agent K from yesterday when everyone else thinks he died 40 years ago is addressed: I didn't find the explanation very convincing, but that's a minor quibble.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones play Agents J and K again, with Josh Brolin in a superb performance capturing the essence of a young, and less jaundiced and weary, Agent K. The main support players are excellent - Emma Thompson is a very funny Agent O, Jermaine Clement is both vile and funny as Boris, and Michael Stuhlbarg is funny, intriguing and touching as the pivotal Griffin.Much of the formula from the previous films rightly remains in place - well-realised aliens, dazzling effects, decent action, and good comedy. This is enhanced by the time travel element, poking fun at many aspects of 1969, as well as some fish-out-of-water humour. The relationship between J and K gives the film some heart, and there is some nice payoff material towards the end.I enjoyed this as much as either of its predecessors.",9,1,4,1 June 2012
Howl's Moving Castle," Odd and wonderful
","After shy and demure hatmaker Sophie is transformed into an old woman by a vindictive witch, she ends up lodging in the mobile home of mystical shapechanging birdman Howl and his strange household, as warfare threatens to engulf the country.A fantasy tale by a Welsh author is set in an area based on provincial France by a Japanese animation studio, and the peculiar fusion of mismatched elements works perfectly. Visually, it delights constantly. Narratively, it has you always on the wrong foot as Sophie gamely accepts her curse and strives to do the best for others and, in so doing, finds a strength within herself which she never believed she had.This film is beautiful, joyous, emotional, and hugely satisfying.",10,1,1,11 November 2018
Alien 3," Poor old Ripley
","In Alien, Ripley was the sole survivor of the Nostromo when it inadvertently brought brought a murderous parasitic xenomorph off a distant planet. In Aliens, Ripley was prevailed upon to return to that planet only to discover the xenomorphs decimating a terraforming colony: Ripley, the child Newt, a single marine, and half of artificial person Bishop were the sole survivors, journeying home on the Sulaco. As Alien3 starts, the Sulaco has ejected its escape pods onto a prison planet and Ripley is again the sole survivor. And goes what? Yes, a xenomorph hitchhiker starts wreaking its havoc among the prison inmates.David Fincher kicks off his always interesting career as feature director with this not entirely successful third entry in the Alien franchise. While it wraps up Ripley's story with a satisfactory, if not happy, resolution (and as such, brings the original trilogy to a conclusion - subsequent movies, including Alien: Resurrection can be regarded as afterthoughts), it is not as satisfying as it should be.I'm not entirely sure why this is. Perhaps it is the setting, perhaps it is the characters. Neither has much warmth and it is difficult to find a character to identify with other than Charles Dance and Ripley herself. And even Ripley leans much more towards snivelling victim than the ass-kicking survivor of the earlier films. And the xenomorph, interestingly demonstrating DNA adaptation towards non-human lifeforms, is delivered care of fairly unsatisfactory CGI.It is worth watching, but it disappoints.",7,4,4,23 March 2014
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," More good fun
","A Game Of Shadows is the sequel to Guy Ritchie's very successful reimagining of the Sherlock Holmes mythos. Holmes embarks on a battle of wits (and more) against Professor James Moriarty (whose shadowy existence was introduced tangentially in the previous film, and the occasion of Watson's marriage is one of the early incidents in the incident-packed journey from the end of this film to the final showdown between Holmes and Moriarty.Unusually for me, I spotted the maguffin which was critical to the twist in the tail when it was introduced: otherwise, this complicated film meandered satisfactorily all over the place. I'm not sure it all made sense: however, I was always so confused that it doesn't really matter whether it did or not. This is broadly similar to the first movie, where it wasn't until I had watched it a second time that I felt it broadly made sense.This film works on the basis 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it': thus, like the first one, we have a convoluted plot, we have a number of sequences where Holmes' thought processes are unravelled, we have the slow-fast-slow editing and slow motion explosions, we have plenty of period atmosphere, and we have the very pleasing chemistry between Holmes and Watson. Added to this are Holmes' brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry, very enjoyable notwithstanding the brothers' somewhat improbably habit of referring to each other as Mike and Shirley) and Jared Harris' wonderful Moriarty, a very believable Machiavellian thinker, planner, manipulator, and cold-blooded killer. And, importantly, Holmes' equal.There were a lot of laughs in the cinema - this film is funnier than a lot of films which call themselves comedies.I enjoyed it as much as its predecessor.",8,1,5,23 December 2011
Gremlins," Scary funny family fare
","Gremlins belongs to a category of movies which has very few members - it is funny, it is full of action and suspense (and some mild scares) and it is a great movie for family viewing.The story is simple but effective - the Peltzer family acquire a mogwai called Gizmo, a rare oriental creature which comes with but two rules - don't get it wet (because this causes it to bud off new creatures) and don't feed it after midnight (because this causes mogwais to turn into gremlins). Of course, the warnings are provided without explanation, so no-one attaches any importance to them and, in due course Gizmo buds off new mogwais which end up in a swimming pool - hordes of gremlins emerge and proceed to lay waste to the small town, and only Billy Pelzer (with the help of Gizmo) can stop them.Zach Galligan is an engaging Billy, and it's a shame that he never really went on to bigger and better things: his co-star, Phoebe Cates, had a run of moderate success before marrying Kevin Kline and becoming a full-time mother.But the real stars of the movie are the puppet gremlins and the physical effects. They fit well with the light tone, and director Joe Dante manages the difficult trick of generating a genuine sense of jeopardy with the malicious little puppets, yet a reassuring sense that no-one comes to any real harm.One wonders what it would be like to see a remake with CGI gremlins and some of the dark doings which were envisaged in the original script...",8,1,3,18 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk - smashing!
","The most useful piece of advice comes first - you don't have to stay until the end of the credits. The bit which you would expect to come after the credits is actually the very last bit before. Along comes the end of the film - and it's an ending which puts a big grin on your face - and then there's this extra bit, which puts an even bigger grin there. And then the titles.This film is great. The Ang Lee movie was a big disappointment but, where that movie disappointed, this one pleases. I think there is probably less of the Hulk himself in this one, but the film itself works much better.It's kind of a sequel - you can talk yourself into believing that it starts where the previous movie leaves off - although it ignores much of the origin in the first movie (and, thankfully, anything to do with Banner's father). But it is much more clearly inspired by the TV series - the opening credits clearly reference the TV series, the notion of Banner being on the run was, of course, a constant of the TV Hulk, the TV theme is quoted in the soundtrack music, there is a reporter called McGee, and Bill Bixby is gently referenced in the early minutes.Most importantly, though, it has something which I call 'heart'. Perhaps it's as simple as this movie 'getting' the Hulk, where Ang Lee didn't. But right from the off, this film emotionally involves the audience in a way which Lee's film, notwithstanding how touchy-feely the first hour was, never did.Stan cameos (of course), as does Lou Ferrigno, and I was delighted to note that Lou also does the Hulk's voice (I'm not going to reveal what the Hulk actually says).The script is miles better than the script of the Ang Lee film. Edward Norton is an excellent Banner, and William Hurt is a much better General Ross than Sam Elliott was - for one thing, you can understand what he's saying. Tim Roth is good as Blonsky. I felt there wasn't much to choose between Liv Tyler and Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross.I think I preferred this visualisation of the Hulk - it is much more filled with uncontrollable rage. The CGI is mostly fine - a bit dodgy in places (the Abomination doesn't always convince, and there's a rain-soaked scene which would, I think, have been better dry).But I really, really liked this film - more than Iron Man.",10,3,8,12 June 2008
The Monuments Men," Clooney and co. remain Clooney and co.
","A small group of specialist US art experts go into Europe just as World War II is ending, to track down art which has been ransacked and hidden by the Nazis.This handsomely mounted (based on a true) story goes efficiently enough through the motions of recounting the events, but is a curiously emotionless exercise. I was moderately entertained by the succession of sequences, but I never really cared. Perhaps this was due to the fact that the characters were poorly drawn. I watched George Cloony, Matt Damon, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett etc. pretending to be assorted individuals, but I never ever believed I was watching the characters they were playing. The one exception to this is Bob Balaban. There was something in his character, and in his relationship with Bill Murray's character, which had some depth, but this was never explored, so the film remained the poorer.This film was no better than adequate and, with the amount of talent involved, it should have been so much more than that.",Null,0,1,27 February 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Excellent entertainment
","The third instalment in Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible is better than its predecessor. It has the best start of pretty nearly any film I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot of films in nearly 60 years). The starting sequence actually comes from about the two thirds point of the movie ie. the majority of the film is a flashback from that moment. But that opening sequence tells you straight away how high the stakes are and, more importantly, that Ethan Hunt loses the game.It's not as simple as that of course but, after the screaming suspense and unbearable tension of that opening sequence, the earlier events hit the ground running and you soon forget about that opening. The stakes remain high though, and action sequences and set pieces follow in quick succession with sympathetic characters in real jeopardy.I really enjoyed this film. I was engaged from start to finish and experienced some real emotional highs and lows. As well as being visually striking, this is a pretty good ride on a deeper level than just eye candy.",8,1,3,14 June 2011
Requiem for a Dream," Superb
","I am on record here as being highly disparaging about Aronofsky's The Fountain, dispirited by The Wrestler, and just plain not liking Black Swan very much.So it is only fair that I should state, for the record, that Requiem For A Dream is, quite simply, superb. The four interlinked stories are strong, told well with immense verve and imagination, and delivered with powerful performances by all the principals. The two women have, perhaps, the stronger roles and therefore make the greater impact, but everyone here delivers, and then some.This movie, too, is dispiriting, but the characters are sufficiently sympathetic that you hope that their inevitable descent into tragedy will not happen. But their stories are worth telling, and the telling is visceral and highly effective.",9,1,2,28 January 2011
Captain Phillips," Gripping
","Richard Phillips is the skipper of a container ship, en route from Oman to Kenya when it is attacked by Somalian pirates. What follows is Phillips' struggle to protect his crew, his ship and himself.This is a true story, and is filmed by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Identity) in verite mode. It is exciting and suspenseful, and blessed with several terrific performances. Barkhad Abdi as Muse, the pirate leader, is sympathetic and nuanced, far from stereotypical, and Faysal Ahmed as Najee is pleasingly and believably batsh!t crazy - stereotypical, but rightly so.Tom Hanks (here playing Phillips) has founded a career on playing audience identification everymen, albeit he sometimes steps outsides his comfort zone. On one such occasion, Oscar came knocking. For me, Forrest Gump was a role of treacly obviousness, with one shining moment of heartbreaking reality when Forrest wonders if his son is likewise less than normal. Captain Phillips is an everyman but, towards the end, Hanks pulls something special out of the bag, and makes us remember why he has two Oscars.This is a good movie - I enjoyed it, and I recommend it.",8,0,1,7 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good but not great
","While there was much to like here, there were some pretty thunderous flaws.I didn't mind meeting young Annakin (although Jake Lloyd was pretty charisma-free). Jar-Jar was fairly horrific, and none of the principals (with the exception of Liam Neeson and Frank Oz) offered much commitment to their characters.But, to me, the two main flaws were a) overkill - there was simply too much of everything, particularly on the visual side - and b) the story. Trade embargoes? Really? That's the best way to start off your epic 6 part space wars saga? Lucas adds plotting to dialogue as areas of scriptwriting which are not his strong suit.Ian McDiarmid starts to emerge as the single strongest performance throughout the entire saga.Subsequent addition to review:Having just seen the 3D re-tooling of Star Wars 1, I thought I would try to approach it from the point of view of watching the saga in chronological order of the story. And it isn't good. This first episode, about trade tariffs and blockading the planet Naboo is unnecessarily dry and complicated, and I am not sure that the ultimate reason for this - shoehorning Palpatine in as Chancellor on the back of the phantom menace of the title - is all that clearly explained, especially as so much of the story is taken up with the sidetrack to Tatooine in order to bring Annakin into the story. The story itself is poor, badly written and badly told.The performances, with exceptions, are adequate. Liam Neeson and Ian McDiarmid stand out as giving performances of power and commitment. Ewan McGregor and Sam Jackson have fun. Natalie Portman is saddled with funny wigs, makeup and voice as Queen Amidala, but gets to have some nice moments as Padme. Jake Lloyd is moderately annoying as young Annakin and his perfectly spherical head is distracting. Jar Jar Binks is incredibly well realised, and still as profoundly irritating as he was first time round. And Ray Park's Darth Maul is pretty good, too.The visuals are fairly solid, with the exception of the battle on Naboo where the boundless green grasslands have never, to me, looked anything other than computer generated.I'm a big fan of 3D, and I was looking forward to the 3D conversion - so much of the film was CGI in the first place that the conversion seemed to me to be likely to be relatively straightforward and, therefore, effective. But it was OK, no better, and added little to the movie.",7,13,26,14 February 2011
Sucker Punch," Adolescent stinker
","I enjoyed 300: I loved the look of it. I enjoyed Watchmen: I loved the look of it. I loved the look of The Owls of Ga'Hoole. So, on the basis of my enjoyment of Zack Snyder's back catalogue, I have been looking forward to Sucker Punch for months, although I have been getting a little worried at some of the negative comment I have been hearing. In fact, given that the only solidly positive comment I have encountered comes from someone who strikes me as having some fairly serious mental health issues, I might have been seriously concerned had I not been firmly of the opinion that I should always form my own opinions, uninfluenced by others.So now I've seen it. Before I comment, let me try to synopsise the plot. On the death of her mother, 20-year-old Baby Doll's stepfather kills her sister (possibly after sexually assaulting her) frames Baby Doll and has her committed to an asylum, where we learn she is scheduled for a lobotomy in 5 days, courtesy of a seedy orderly forging head psychiatrists Carla Gugino's signature. Fortunately, the asylum also runs on another level of reality, where it is a brothel. And whenever Baby Doll dances in the brothel, she and some of the other girls are transported into yet other alternate realities, where they carry out video game-type tasks to collect artefacts which they will need in order to escape from the asylum.Let me say that there is much here which is eye-catching. Let me then go on to say that this is a dreadful, rambling mess. It makes no sense, nothing which needs explaining ever gets explained, it is full of things (starting with the initial set-up) which simply defy credibility and, worst of all, it is hatefully misogynistic. I have seen that Snyder says that it actually is about empowering women. Not in the version I saw, I'm afraid. I saw women leaping about in fishnets carrying out adolescent fantasy sex-object video game activities on the third fantasy level, but on the first and second levels, they are consistently victims - in fact (and please excuse the spoiler) Baby Doll ends up lobotomised and the man responsible in the first place gets away with it.Snyder must take the blame. It is his story and he co-wrote the screenplay, which comes across as the work of a 14-year-old with ADD who has skipped his Ritalin, and who has only ever read comic books. The script is awful, truly awful (in the first 5 minutes we are brought to an establishment, the sign for which indicates that it is an 'Asylum For The Mentally Insane' - excuse me, but did I miss the other types of Insane?).If you absolutely must see this, wait for it to come out on DVD - it will end up in the bargain bins very quickly. It stinks.",5,17,34,7 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Soppy drivel
","I do so want to be fair to the Twiglet films and not condemn them out of hand just because of what they are, but they do make it so easy to be dismissive of them. To put it another way, a film which is not that good gives you plenty of things to make fun of when you are assembling a review, and Breaking Down part 1 is just such a film.Sulky teenager Bella has finally got her man (or, rather, vampire), dishy (if moody and, on the basis of this film, incredibly stupid) 100-odd year old pasty-faced Edward. The entire first half of this film comprises wedding, honeymoon, and Bella's immediate (and problematic) pregnancy. If you have seen the trailer, then you needn't bother turning up for the first 45 minutes, because you don't find anything out during that period that you didn't learn from the trailer. This part of the film is terminally soppy - I mean, deeply drippy. So much so that it might even be off-putting to the drippy Twiglet teens who dote on this stuff (I don't mean to be rude, girls, but come on - this really is the soppiest drivel ever committed to celluloid).The problem is that Bella and Edward have not only gone for no sex before marriage, they've also gone for no vampirising before marriage either so, when Bella falls pregnant with a half-vampire baby, she is still human. This means that the super-strong foetus proceeds to kick 7 bells out of her from inside, which wipes the smile off her face - oh, wait, Bella never has a smile on her face, does she? (actually, there are times during the wedding-y bits where she does - Kristen Stewart was so unrecognisable that I thought they had cast another actress for a moment). The entire second half of the film is given over to Bella's pregnancy which looks increasingly likely to end with her death, the werewolf pack which seems to have its nose out of joint over something or other which completely escaped me, and Bella's werewolf friend and would-be second-string boyfriend Jacob keeping the two factions at bay and being angry at hubbie Edward for causing all this . Blahdie blahdie blah, it all arrives at an ending which is ripe for the start of what (oh please let it be so) should be the final part.The first film was grim - desperately bad. The second film was terminally tedious. The third one I found myself enjoying, to my surprise. This one - it is laughable. For instance, on seeing that Bella is very noticeably pregnant (and looking a bit rough), lovelorn werewolf Jacob launches himself angrily at husband Edward with the words, 'You did this to her!' I burst out laughing. Yes, mate - her husband got her pregnant: it is the sort of thing which sometimes happens on honeymoon, do you werewolves know nothing? Some of the Twiglets in the audience didn't find it as funny as I did, mind you.The werewolves did angry telepathing among themselves while they were in doggy form, which was comical (I don't think it was meant to be). In human form, they started talking about imprinting. This is the first time the term has raised its head in the Twiglet movies. Previously I had understood it to mean that Canada Geese thought that a motorised hang-glider was their mother, but I didn't have a clue what it meant in this film. My only thought was that it would probably turn out to have some plot relevance, and so it does. Indeed, it turns out to be something of such importance that the fact that it was introduced just before the plot needs it, struck me as extraordinarily bad writing - we should have known about it a couple of films ago.I could go on, but there seems little point. This, in my view, was a poor effort in a generally poor series, possibly - probably - because the source material is also poor.",5,8,16,27 November 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Touching but soapy
","16 year old Charlie (Logan Lerman) is not looking forward to high school. He has no friends, and little idea of how to make them. But when he is friendly towards eccentric and camp loner senior Patrick (Ezra Miller), he gets introduced to Patrick's stepsister Sa (Emma Watson), and their circle of non-cool students - 'The Island of Misfit Toys' as Sam puts it. An interesting year develops, as Charlie opens up and forges relationships, while all the main characters turn out to have areas of darkness behind locked doors.This film, essentially a coming of age story, crossed with teen romance, and mixed in with a big chunk of soap opera, is very effective. It gives us three very sympathetic protagonists, a supporting cast of characters who are all fairly sympathetic, a simple story with enough mystery to keep us interested, and a damaged but beautiful heart, and three wonderful central performances. Watson and Miller are both excellent, but Lerman's central performance, necessarily understated through most of the movie, is ultimately heartbreaking and heartmending.I really enjoyed this.",8,2,4,10 October 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Claustrophobia, psychological, monsters...
","Following a car accident, Michelle wakes up chained to a basement wall: it transpires the basement is a fallout bunker belonging to Howard, who saved her from the car crash and, together with Emmett (who helped him build it) is standing by for a stay of a year or more, giving the attack which is going on overhead. But Howard seems a bit intense, so is he telling the truth? Cloverfield was a found footage movie showing an alien assault on New York. 10 Cloverfield Lane is an entirely different kind of film. Staged tightly and claustrophobically more or less within the single setting of the bunker, this is a study of the interactions between three people: John Goodman is Howard, a truly intense performance. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as Michelle, is a victim with fight left in her: in fact, her character has a very strong arc, from someone who always runs away, to someone who learns how to fight for survival. John Gallgher Jr does well as Emmett, a rather thankless role of the third point on the triangle, necessary only for character dynamics between Michelle and Howard.Not a great deal happens, but it happens very suspensefully. And we learn that not all monsters have tentacles.",8,0,3,23 March 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Traditional western with some modern touches
","This is a decent western, very much in the traditional modern, with put-upon rancher Christian Bale among the small party escorting ruthless but charming outlaw Russell Crowe to his appointment with the train taking him to prison.In the modern way, it features crisp photography with saturated colours - it is a rich looking movie.The story is always interesting, with several sub-plots threaded through it - the battle against Bale's neighbouring rancher, and the fractured relationship between father and son both working well with the main plot.All the cast are very good although Bale and Crowe are the two headliners, all the secondary players are convincing too.An enjoyable western notwithstanding the vastly unlikely ending.",8,0,0,16 May 2010
The Equalizer," Pleasing and entertaining
","Robert McCall leads a solitary life. Apparently subject to OCD, and certainly subject to insomnia, he spends his days working at a hardware store and the early hours reading classics in his local diner, where he exchanges friendly but inconsequential banter with a young hooker. When she is hospitalised by her brutal pimp, McCall decides that he can't sit and do nothing, at which point it becomes clear that there is some juicy detail in his backstory which we are not privy to. And neither are the Russian mafia, into whose territory he has strayed.This 2014 film revisitation of a TV series starring Edward Woodward is, perhaps, somewhat overdue, as the premise – a lonely vigilante fighting on behalf of the underdog – is always a favourite. And, like Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills in Taken, Robert McCall is that most satisfying of movie characters, someone fighting on the side of good who is both willing to, and very good at, using the non-gentlemanly tactics that the baddies use.McCall is a character full of contradictions and illogicalities, but he is so well drawn and well played by Washington, that all the illogicalities make sense by the end of the film. Washington is aided by very good performances from the rest of the case. Chloe Moretz' underage hooker adds another worthwhile entry to her CV, and it is particularly good to see Marton Czokas, after years of first class but unremarkable support playing, getting to play a truly memorable primary character in the part of mob enforcer 'Teddy.' This film doesn't have much depth, but it is a solidly entertaining and well-made crowd-pleaser.",8,3,10,2 October 2014
The Expendables 2," Utter rubbish, but good fun
","The all-star action hero fest that was The Expendables returns for another go on the merry-go-round. No Micky Rourke this time, but Chuck Norris turns up, Jean-Claude Van Damme serves nicely as the baddie, and there is decent second fiddle support from Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu.The plot is barely worth mentioning - some nonsense about plutonium in a disused mine being stolen for sale to terrorists - because this is all about muscles, fighting, explosions, and vast amounts of ammunition being expended (and, of course, it is all magic ammunition: the goodies' ammo all strikes baddies with splashes of very obviously CGI blood, and none of the baddies' ammo goes anywhere near a goodie).It is interesting to note that, thanks to Chuck Norris I believe, the unnecessary foul language which littered the first movie is conspicuous by its absence: this film is the better for that.The action is done well, and some of the interplay is fun: Willis and Schwarzenegger get more to do this time, and clearly enjoy doing it (and Schwarzenegger's final comment is telling).It's tosh, of course - when the opening action sequence finds the heroes ziplining from a shell-ravaged town into the jungle, well....",7,1,12,17 August 2012
Source Code," Very good science fiction thriller
","Military helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself on a train, talking to Christina (Michelle Monaghan), who thinks he is someone else. After some minutes of confusing conversation, the train is involved in an explosion and crash, and Stevens wakes up in a capsule in conversation over a video link with Captain Goodwin (Vera Farmiga). It turns out that Stevens is involved in the Source Code project which enables him to be sent back into target Sean Fentress to relive 8 minutes leading up to the terrorist explosion, in order to find out who the terrorist is in order to prevent a second atrocity.To thumbnail review this film, let me simply say that it is a superior science fiction suspense thriller. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I recommend it.I am now entering serious spoiler territory.It doesn't take much to work out - as he does about halfway through - that Stevens is actually, to all intents and purposes, dead. It is made clear that his 8-minute trips back don't actually change anything - the atrocity has already taken place - but real time is slipping by, and the time left to apprehend the terrorist is limited. However, Stevens badly wants to save Chistina's life despite the fact that she is already dead.This film has two endings. There is an ending which uses what is essentially a bullet time freeze frame tracking shot, and this is the ideal place at which to have ended the film: it is fair and faithful to what came before. And then a further end is tacked on. It's OK, I suppose, but the only way it works in the context of the science fiction explored in the earlier part of the movie is if it takes place in a parallel time line/reality. This has been mentioned, but not really put forward as part of the basis on which the plot stands and is therefore, I felt, slightly unfair. However, it is a happy ending for the masses, so I suppose one can't complain.Even so, this is a pretty good movie - engaging, thoughtful and it has heart. All the principals are good.",9,3,4,7 April 2011
Skyfall," Stunning
","And so Bond 23 arrives, in which our hero tries to retrieve a missing record of compromised agents in order to save M's political skin.That's it as far as synopsis is concerned. The trailer gives you an idea, but there is so much more in this film than you expect, and I don't want to spoil the finding out of it, particularly the last third, for which I was completely unprepared (including the significance of the film's title).So let me talk in terms not specific to the story, other than to say that the story is firmly rooted in the real world, with no Spectre/Smersh-type goings on. We have an up-to-date story of espionage and revenge which is utterly credible.And we have some terrific action pieces, spread throughout the film, some of which are unlike anything ever seen in a Bond film.And we have excellent performances from the whole cast, with Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and Javier Bardem turning in the three best performances ever in Bond films.And I came out of the cinema aware that, for the first time in a Bond film, what I had seen on the screen was art. This was not simply action sequences and travelogues: this was a conscious effort to put together eye-catching, beautifully composed, images, with every element of shape, colour, light and shade considered for maximum visual impact and narrative complementation.This may not be the best Bond ever (although, if not, it comes damn close) but it is without question the best Film in the Bond series.",9,3,25,2 November 2012
Catch Me If You Can," Engaging
","In some ways a rather slight film, Catch Me If You Can takes on considerable weight by virtue of the quality of the contributions made to it by its actors, writers, and director.Tom Hanks and Leonardo di Caprio are always credible as the young fraudster and his dogged FBI pursuer and deliver performances of solid commitment, only to be outshone by Christopher Walken. The relationship between Walken (father) and di Caprio (son) is at the heart of this movie. The other cast members are all very good, too.Which is not to say that the events covered aren't attention grabbing too. One watches open-mouthed at the effrontery, nerve, ingenuity, and sheer gall exhibited by someone who realises at a very young age that, if you're going to lie, lie big.The 60s period detail feels authentic throughout.This film was engaging, both in the everyday sense of being entertaining, but also in the sense that it fully engaged me throughout its 135 minutes running time. It wasn't a film I was in a hurry to see, but I now wish I hadn't waited so long! Recommended.",8,1,2,23 January 2009
The Hangover," Daft and funny
","The Hangover is currently number 1 at the US box office, and it's doing well here in the UK, too.This isn't surprising - it's a funny movie. On the eve of Doug's wedding he and his two best friends and his fiancée's brother take a stag trip to Las Vegas. All is well until the next morning when the friends wake up in their hotel suite with no memory of the previous night's events, a gap where a tooth used to be, a chicken, a tiger, a baby - oh, and no Doug. The rest of the movie tells of the increasingly desperate attempts by the friends to reconstruct what happened last night so that they can, hopefully, retrieve Doug in time to get him to his wedding.I never believed the events of this movie for a second, but that didn't really matter: there was sufficient suspension of disbelief for the improbable narrative to work, and it was always fun to be in the company of these well fleshed out, if caricature-ish, characters.There aren't too many belly laughs, but the humour is constant and organic - I found myself chuckling all the way through.Special mention must go to Ken Jeong who is a deliriously effete Chinese crime tsar, and who has the most memorable on-screen entrance of any character in any movie I can remember.",8,8,14,18 June 2009
Ghost," Original, and hugely entertaining
","Sam and Molly are young, in love, and covered in clay, so Molly is understandably miffed when Sam is killed. It turns out that Sam is equally miffed, because his spirit is still hanging around, aware that Molly is in danger, but physically unable to do anything about it. Until, at least, he discovers that he can enter the body of Oda Mae, a fake psychic (at least she thought she was fake), through whom he can try to put things right.Ghost is essentially a suspense thriller with strong supernatural and romance elements, and a dash of humour. It is unusual in that all the disparate elements work, and the whole thing holds together. This is partly because it is quite original, well written and directed, but also because it is very well played by Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg.If you haven't seen it, you really should.",8,1,1,7 November 2013
Iron Man 3," Hugely enjoyable
","Tony Stark has anxiety issues following the New York incident and the development of his relationship with Pepper Potts: this coincides with terrorist The Mandarin escalating his sequence of atrocities. And perhaps it all dates back to an incident long ago in Tony's past...Iron Man Three (note: not Iron Man 3) delivers everything shown in the trailer, and quite a lot which was not what I expected. I did not expect this film to be so funny, for a start, but I laughed quite a lot, and by no means always at Stark's snarky put-downs. In fact, so much in this film was not what I expected that it becomes difficult to say much without spoilering, and I wouldn't want to do that.So I'll stick with saying that I enjoyed it a great deal: far more than IM2, and I think probably more than the first one.",9,4,23,26 April 2013
Child 44," Grim and depressing
","In 1950s Russia, a serial killer is killing children. However, as Stalin has declared murder to be a 'capitalist disease', these killings are explained away as accidents. War hero secret police officer Leo finds himself drawn in to the killings but, in a culture of paranoia and people informing on each other, he is not without his own problems.This suspense thriller very effectively conjures up a grim, grey society where everyone is looking over his shoulder, and with good reason – life is very cheap if you happen to come up against the wrong person. The principal players - Tom Hardy as Leo, Noomi Rapace as his wife Raisa, Gary Oldman as General Nesterov, and Joel Kinnaman as Vasili – are all very good.Unfortunately, that's not enough. The film is very long – two and a quarter hours – and the murder investigation gets somewhat overlooked as the film concentrates on the political implications of work carried out in Leo's department, and the consequences of in-fighting and crossing the wrong person. The film is slow-moving and somewhat depressing.It's not a bad film, but it's not one I shall be eagerly seeking to watch a second time.",7,12,30,23 April 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Devil's advocate
","Indiana Jones, Professor of Archaeology but with an adventurous bent, finds himself involved with trying to track down the hiding place of the Ark Of The Covenant. Unfortunately, so are a batch of Nazis.Spielberg's homage to the pulp serials of the 40s was an enormous success, and deservedly so - it is non-stop action, adventure and spectacle from start to finish, laced with humour, character and what were, for the time, state of the art miniature and photographic special effects which still stand up well in the digital age.Here is where I am prepared to go against the conventional wisdom. What it was not was high art. The material it homages was cheap, disposable, ephemeral (and was intended to be) and the homage is accurate: the fact that, in this case, the material is delivered with thought and care and high production values does not mean that the pulp origins of the source material have suddenly moved from sow's ear to silk purse.Don't let that spoil your enjoyment, though!",9,1,2,23 March 2012
Spartacus," Epic in every sense
","I was 8 when Spartacus was released in 1960. I cannot understand how I managed to get to 2009 without having seen more than snippets - I even have it on my DVD shelves, for heaven's sake! But I'm glad that my first full viewing was of the restored print at my local multiplex: this is one of those movies which demands to be seen on a really big screen. The advent of CGI means that we have got used to computer generated hordes fighting epic battles, but Spartacus features thousands upon thousands of real people ranged across real landscapes in the days when films like this were a real event.For all its epic sprawl, the heart of Spartacus derives from the love between Spartacus and Varinia, and I was surprised to see this movie from Kubrick - demonstrably such a cold fish in so many of his films - have such a moving centre. Even the key Roman figures are noticeably less clinical than is customary with Kubrick.The main performances are, for the most part, very good (although the less said the better about John Dall's dreadful, dreadful turn as Glabrus), and I was particularly surprised at Olivier. I have found most of his movie work to be mannered, almost self-conscious acting (bordering on thesping if you follow what I mean) - here he gives a naturalistic performance which is by far the best performance I have ever seen from him on film. Jean Simmons is luminous and lovely. Ustinov gives us a comic quasi-villain with a heart of gold with a schtick which collared an Oscar for him on this occasion, despite the fact that we have seen it from him on a number of occasions.But these are quibbles. This is a film which deserves its epic status, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",9,1,4,10 June 2009
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Serviceable, but no surprises
","If you've never seen a Resident Evil movie then this film might hold some surprises for you. If you have, then you may go into it expecting to see Milla Jovovich's Alice doing lots of killing of unpleasant infected zombie-like individuals and maybe some uninfected ones, too, in the company of a group of people whose job it is to keep you guessing who will survive and who won't. But it may surprise you to learn that this is not what you'll get.I'm just messing with you. Of course it's what you'll get. But you'll get it in 3D, which is often quite effective.Milla Jovovich is as efficient as ever, Kim Coates plays his usual slimy creep, there are some bits to make you jump, some preposterous action, some gross effects, some guns which fire nine million rounds without reloading, all the usual elements, in fact. Oh, and a set up to take us into the next one...",7,8,18,15 September 2010
United 93," Compulsive and should be compulsory
","This first rate film is terribly difficult to comment on, but it is even more difficult to watch. As a reconstruction of real-life events, the viewer is constantly aware that much of what he is seeing must be very close to how it actually was and, with that in mind, it is terrifying.Those who died on United 93 deserve respect and this film gives it to them. They also deserve the respect of my not making further unnecessary comments for the sake of it (other than to comply with IMDb's minimum number of lines requirement), so I will say simply that the film is excellent, if harrowing, and should be compulsory viewing.",10,3,6,10 September 2010
It," Hooray! A good King adaptation.
","In 1989 something evil in the town of Derry, adopting the appearance of a clown, is killing children. 7 misfit friends are the only ones who realise what's going on, and unwillingly take on this malevolent entity.Previously filmed as a 2-part miniseries for TV, this film adapts half of Stephen King's eponymous novel. The other half, which has the same characters facing up to the reappearance of It (aka Pennywise the Dancing Clown) 27 years later, has yet to be filmed: green lighting the follow-up depends on the success of this movie, and it looks hopeful. Box office seems promising, and deservedly so.If you've never seen a horror film then you'll find this scary. If you have, then I doubt if you'll be scared, but you will certainly find the mood of hidden malevolence effective, especially given the youth of the protagonists. The atmosphere of this film is very well delivered, and captures the feel of the novel extremely well. And it does fairly well at avoiding the temptation to go all Made You Jump noises.The cast of kids are all pretty good although I felt that Finn Wolfhard, playing motormouth Richie Tozier, not only gabbled (completely in line with the character), but did so in a way which made it very difficult to understand what he was saying - I couldn't follow him at all.Sophia Lillis as Bev, 14 years old during filming, is right in the middle of transitioning from child to adult, a fact which is used strongly in her character's arc. You can see the sexuality which is waiting to settle in to a young person who is already striking: she will be a beautiful young woman, and it won't be long until she gets there. Also, she can act.And I suppose I should mention Bill Skarsgard (Stellan's son) as Pennywise. I always thought Tim Curry was deeply scary 27 years ago (there's that number again!): well, Skarsgard is scarier.This is a good film, one of the best adaptations of King's work, and it makes up for the desperately disappointing Dark Tower movie of several weeks ago.",8,1,2,8 May 2018
Hereditary," Disturbing rather than horrifying
","Annie, who lives with husband Steve, dope smoking son Pete and weird 13-year old daughter Charlie, finds her life goes to pieces after her secretive mother dies. But in amongst the rel-life tragedy, how much is grief, how much is mental problems, and how much is something else entirely.This horror film isn't really very horrifying at all. However, some horrible things happen in, and it is genuinely disturbing which, in my book, makes it rather better than loud sound cues to make you jump.All the cast are good, with Toni Collette outstanding. Alex Wolff (Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle) does well with the troubled Pete, and Mille Shapiro as Charlie adds to the sense of unease by having a look about her of being not quite right. Only Gabriel Byrne draws the short straw in the necessary but rather thankless role of Steve.Giving any further information would spoiler the crawling sense of something indefinable being wrong. This is a good contribution to the genre, and worth your time if you have a taste for the macabre and unsettling.",8,2,4,18 June 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A complete hoot
","As a Brit, my knowledge of Abraham Lincoln is limited to stovepipe hat and beard, the Civil War, abolition of slavery, and assassination at the theatre by John Wilkes Booth. I had absolutely no idea that he had enjoyed a career (prior to his entry into politics) as a vampire slayer, nor that there had been a large contingent of vampires within the Confederate army. Thank heavens Lincoln left behind his notebook, or we'd never have known.Benjamin Walker, an actor I have never heard of, but who looks very much like a young Liam Neeson, plays young Lincoln (and, with old makeup and a sticky-on beard, old Lincoln) in a batch of preposterous nonsense in which our hero become expert at whirling around a silver-bladed axe, surviving horrific physical trauma, decapitating vampires, chatting up Mary Elizabeth Winstead, starting the Civil War, and melting down everyone's silver into musket balls in order to defeat the 1st Confederate Vampire Infantry Regiment. In this he is assisted by a decent roster of support including Dominic Cooper, Rupert Sewell, the afore-mentioned Miss Winstead, Anthony Machie and Jimmi Speed.All those involved play this nonsense with an absolutely straight face - indeed, it would not work if they played it tongue in cheek - but, notwithstanding the seriousness with which the characters are portrayed, and the slow motion decapitations and vampiric (black) blood sprays, this film is a romp. Like director Timur Bekmambetov's earlier Wanted, it is an unexpected and exuberant batch of utter twaddle, made with an almost palpable glee. And, also like Wanted, it features some beautifully choreographed and eye-boggling action.This movie is hugely enjoyable and absolutely daft. And the 3D is often very effective.",8,70,114,22 June 2012
If I Stay," Not bad, but nothing special
","Teenage Mia is a cello prodigy. She lives with her lovable younger brother and her impossibly awesome parents. She is a bit socially awkward which is why, at first, she doesn't respond easily to the interest shown in her by up and coming singer/guitarist Adam. But he is genuine, and their blooming relationship is marred only by conflict over their possible separation if her application to go to Juilliard is successful. Which is why she did't tell him she'd applied. Which is why he is upset with her. Who'd be a teenager in love, right? Things get a lot simpler when her family has a horrific car crash and she is lying in hospital at death's door faced with the choice of living or dying.This teen weepie involves Chloe Moretz doing an awful lot of running around hospital corridors barefoot, shouting things at people who can't hear her because she is in limbo, hovering between life and death. It could usefully have done with some special effects rather than people conveniently holding doors open just as she wants to run through. Yes I know, money.Moretz is as good as always in a film which, to me, was no better than OK. It concentrated rather too much on peevish teenagerness, and not enough on the fairly big issues which were implicit in its basic premise.The performances were good, though, especially Stacy Keach, better than I've ever seen him.",7,3,6,14 September 2014
Detroit," Harrowing
","Race tensions are running high in 1967 Detroit with the National Guard joining city and state police in trying to quell riots and looting. The sound of shots result in the police bursting into the Algiers Motel, killing one man, and subjecting a group of others (including two white girls) to an ordeal including constant imminent fear of death. Most are beaten, one of the girls is stripped, and two more men are killed. In the aftermath, three police (and an innocent black security guard) are tried for murder.Katherine Bigelow has made a dense, gripping and eye-opening drama from a an incident which actually happened, but where the details are dependent on trial transcripts and recollections. What we see on screen is representational rather than literal. This dilutes the dramatic impact a little, since you can't be confident that this is actually what happened. It does seem likely, though. It is harrowing stuff thanks to Bigelow's direction, a fine script (Mark Boal), and superb performances from all concerned, but especially young British actor Will Poulter as out-of-control cop Krauss. This young man has got better and better in everything I've seen him in, and this film must surely see him nominated for an Oscar.This is neither a short (143 minutes) nor an easy watch, but it is a film I'm glad I saw.",8,1,2,8 May 2018
In Bruges," First rate, but not for everyone
","In Bruges is very strong meat indeed. To be receptive to it, you must be ready for graphic violence, constant extreme bad language, drug abuse, moral ambiguity, and massive political incorrectness.If you can accept that, you are in for a treat. You get an unusual story with threads which tie together unexpectedly, strong characterisation, much splendid black and tasteless humour, sharp dialogue, brilliant acting and, despite the fact that the main characters are unsavoury in many respects, a fundamental underlying sense of humanity.This film is shocking, gripping, touching, uncomfortable, and eye-wateringly funny.I was very, very impressed.",10,2,4,27 August 2009
John Wick," Dumb but stylish
","John Wick, ruthless and frighteningly efficient assassin, retires to live in peace with his wife, a good woman: she dies 4 years later but, as her last act, has a puppy delivered to him so that he has company to grieve with. He is attacked in his own home by thugs, led by the son of his old boss (but who don't know who Wick is), who steal his car and kill the puppy. Wick comes out of retirement in order to exact retribution.This Keanu Reeves vehicle is devastatingly simple, not to mention being as dumb as a box of rocks (there are at least 3 points where ruthless killers, having been non-stop ruthlessly killing for some little while, fail to ruthlessly kill the very person who they should immediately ruthlessly kill in order to prevent the subsequent bloodbath resulting from the not-ruthlessly killed person resuming their own ruthless killing. And don't get me started on the incredibly accurate shooting except at the person where it is dramatically important that they don't get shot).But as well as being simple and dumb, it is also extremely stylish, often beautifully photographed, full of well choreographed action sequences, and quite good fun, not to mention being a very good vehicle for Reeves' minimalist, understated style of performance. If you're undemanding as regard illogicalities, plot holes and the like, you may well enjoy it as a straightforward violent action romp.",8,1,7,17 April 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Pletty good, Glasshopper
","Let's get one thing straight. I have always regarded Jack Black as a tolerable supporting player who, for some reason I can't quite fathom (although it seems to have something to do with some people finding him quite a bit funnier than I do), has achieved leading man status. That overall opinion hasn't changed, but that doesn't stop me recognising his voice work here as very, very good. The same goes for Dustin Hoffman, with a special mention for James Hong. The other voice artists are also good, but the parts they play don't really demand the names which play them - Jackie Chan has, what? five lines? Something like that.This film looks gorgeous. The backgrounds are simply breathtaking, the characters are well realised, and the effects are excellent. There are lots of gags, most of them quite funny, and lots of action too.I have two criticisms. One is that much of the action was too fast for me to follow. The other is that the movie seemed a bit - well, inconsequential. Maybe I'm getting used to the better scripted CGI animated movies regaling me with various universal truths, but I didn't detect much of that here. Just a relatively engaging story, well told.And that's perfectly fine, of course.",8,1,2,9 July 2008
Rocketman," A lot better than I expected
","Reg Dwight combats some childhood issues and destructive addictions on his way to stardom and beyond.Taron Egerton makes a good pass at Elton Hercules John in this fanciful (and, perhaps, rather selective) trawl through Elt's history.I'll come clean - I'm not an Elton John fan, although I'm au fait with his best-known material and much of his public history. But I don't like his vocal mannerisms, and I don't much care for the public personae he has displayed over the years. But, hey, this is a movie and, even when it's supposed to be fact, it's fiction.And it's good. It tells its story well, the performances are all good (dear heavens, that was Bryce Dallas Howard? I thought I recognised her, but blimey!), and the musical sequences are well-chosen and well-realised.Was I emotional. Well, no. At least, not until the reaffirmation of a singularly important relationship towards the end of the movie. Yes, that got me.All we need now is The George Michael Story and we'll have a boxset!",8,4,8,26 May 2019
A Star Is Born," A Star moves into movies
","Jackson Maine, a rock star on a gradual downward spiral, helped by prodigious amounts of alcohol abuse, encounters Ally, an enormously talented singer and songwriter trapped in a dead-end job. By inviting her on stage with him, her star starts ascending while his decline continues. They fall in love, but there are four individuals in the relationship, the other two being alcohol and her manager.I have seen none of the previous films with this title, but the rags-to-riches vs riches-to-rags story is hardly new territory. So how does it stand up on this particular occasion?Pretty well. Bradley Cooper does well on his first outing as director: some scenes are perhaps dragged out a little longer than they need to be, but both Cooper and Lady Gaga act well. I wouldn't go so fas as to say she's a revelation, but she is pretty solid and has some moving moments.The music is well recorded and presented, with superb sound design. I can't say I cared for every song, but one or two are standouts. And both Cooper and Gaga sing well. Incidentally, Stefanie, couldn't you start using your real name now?For me, though, the best moment was a 5-second shot of Sam Elliott's face as he reversed a truck out of Jackson's driveway. I've always tended to denigrate Elliott for mumbling through his moustache, but this was 5 seconds of the best facial acting I've seen in ages.",8,16,34,6 October 2018
Gravity," Stunningly realised non-stop space suspense
","A cloud of debris brings a space shuttle mission to an abrupt halt, leaving two survivors whose slim chance of survival begins with them having to make their way to the nearby International Space Station. But oxygen and fuel for suit jets are running low, and the debris takes 90 minutes to make a full orbit, so it won't be long until it returns...The expression 'high concept' tends to mean a simple idea which no-one has thought of before. Well, this idea has been around for a while, but the technology has only recently been sufficiently advanced to enable Alfonso Cuaron to commit his concept to celluloid (or the digital equivalent).Space has never been so realistically depicted, and the the meaning of the title - or, specifically, its absence - is conveyed in a stunning unbroken 13-minute opening shot in which the camera joins George Clooney's Kowalski in roaming, unfettered, in three dimensions as the scenario is set up and the first disaster occurs. Saving only a couple of moments where I wasn't sure that Newton's laws meant that things would move exactly like that, the visuals are flawless, and it is mind-boggling to consider the thinking process involved in visualising such a sequence.Even taking for granted the visual perfection where one cannot tell what is digital and what is physical, one then has to factor in a simple story where the pace and intensity never lets up, and an astonishing performance, both emotional and physical, from Sandra Bullock as the initially not-very-likable Dr Stone.This film is must-see stuff, a visceral experience which benefits enormously from 3D.",9,3,5,15 November 2013
Lone Survivor," Simple, strong, effective
","4 Navy Seals, deep in Afghanistan on a mission to assassinate two senior Taliban men, are compromised when they encounter 3 shepherds (one old, one teen, and a boy). Faced with a choice to kill them as a matter of self-preservation or let them go, they release them. And all hell breaks loose.The title of this film rather does away with any suspense which you might have if you don't already know the resolution of this adaptation of Marcus Lutrell's autobiographical book. What you are left with is an opening section which sets up the members of the unit and the beginning of the mission, a central section where they are trying to escape, and a final section where Marcus is given sanctuary in an Afghan village. This final section, which would have benefited from a little more attention being paid to telling us about the aftermath, gives one some hope that not everything about Afghanistan identifies it as a hell-hole which should be wiped from the face of the earth.But this is not a deep, complicated film, and its raison d'etre is is the lengthy central section, which is extremely well done. It has the visceral intensity of the D-Day Landings sequence from Saving Private Ryan - you are actually with the 4 comrades in arms as they try everything they can, initially to arrange extraction and, finally, just to stay alive. And, as an extended action sequence, it is a masterclass in putting such a sequence on screen in terms of geography of pursuit, what to include and what to exclude, and pacing: it is a long sequence and never gets repetitive because you (the viewer) are always so involved.The constant bad language is entirely appropriate in this rather good film.",8,1,4,7 February 2014
The Death of Stalin," Very funny
","Following the death of Soviet Chairman (and effective dictator) Josef Stalin in 1953, there is a frenzied jockeying for position among the surviving senior party members.This film, which I had never heard of until a week or two ago, was not high on my list of must-see movies. I'm not particularly interested in the Russian revolution and its aftermath, and the title alone is enough to put me off - serious, drab, dreary and boring. I only went to see it because of the phenomenal cast.And I'm so glad I did. Adapted from a French comic (!), and directed and co-scripted by British satirist Armando Ianucci, this film seems to follow the main beats of what actually happened, but is very, very funny. The characterisations are brilliant - even the murderous individuals are drawn in widely comic terms - and the actors playing them have great fun. Jason Isaacs plays the head of the Russian army in a medal-heavy tunic, and with a broad and foul-mouthed Yorkshire accent - 'Who locked the soldiers up?' Michael Palin and Jeffrey Tambor play Molotov and Malenkov as hardline party members who sway like reeds in the wind to stay within perceived safe guidelines. Steve Buscemi plays Krushchev as endlessly frustrated at being outmanoeuvred by the Machiavellian Beria.This is nothing like the film I expected it to be, and I enjoyed it enormously.",9,1,2,8 May 2018
Mulan," Very good, but...
","Mulan tells the story of a Chinese girl who joins the army in the guise of a man, in order to save her infirm father from the death which would otherwise await him.Disney's 36th animated features is memorable for tackling an interesting and unusual subject (including consideration of feminism and sexism issues), for doing it with sensitivity and a beautiful sense of style, and for treating us to some first class animation and production design.The voice cast includes a number of oriental performers, for obvious reasons: they are all Chinese Americans, and sound as American as everyone else, so there is a big chunk of 'I can't see the point' at work (which is not to denigrate the voice performances, which are uniformly good. Except...).Then we come to Eddie Murphy's turn as small dragon Mushu. This is essentially exactly the same performance as he delivered a couple of years later in Shrek: but while it worked perfectly with Donkey, it seems completely out of place here: it is a style of humour from somewhere else bolted on where it doesn't belong. Murphy is good, but totally out of place, and it jars.The film is very good: it could have been first rate.",8,0,0,29 April 2012
Se7en," Very, very dark
","An enthusiastic young detective, keen to set the world to rights, is partnered up with a cynical old cop nearing retirement. They are put on a case in which a serial killer is committing a series of murders themed after the seven deadly sins.This police suspense thriller is so dark that it borders on horror. It is well written, brilliantly performed by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as the two cops and Kevin Spacey as the killer (one of his breakout performances at around this time, the other being The Usual Suspects), and has a truly shocking ending. You're not going to go home with a happy feeling, though - it simply isn't that sort of movie.I recommend it but be warned: it is not an easy watch.",8,1,2,17 February 2014
Wayne's World," Myers at his freshest
","Wayne's World marks the first cinematic outing for Mike Myers' trademark knowing mugging to the camera (see also Austin Powers and The Love Guru). On this occasion it is fresh (not that fresh, as Wayne's World had already been tried and tested on TV) and funny, perhaps because it is fresh.Wayne's World also has the benefit of a good script, a fresh premise, well realised characters, and some very funny moments. It has Tia Carrere at her most decorative, Rob Lowe at his most dastardly, and Lara Flynn Boyle at her very best. And it has Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody on the soundtrack in a seminal moment, much imitated, and responsible for Queen's huge surge in popularity in the States in the early 90s.Of, course, it also has Dana Carvey's mannered and desperately unfunny Garth, but you can't have everything.",7,0,0,13 April 2011
Star Trek," As good as it gets for fans of the original series
","Star Trek ticked ALL my boxes, and ticked them big time. Let me list the things it got wrong: 1.Now let me list the things it got right: 1. A good solid story; 2. A story cleverly constructed to make sure that this film was both consistent with the established continuity of the on-screen Star Trek universe yet also sufficiently legitimately outside that continuity to permit variations. Not a bad trick!: 3. Excellent casting. These performances are not slavish impressions of the original cast, but they do much to capture the essence of the well-loved characters from the original series. In particular, Pine captures the swagger and braggadocio of the young Kirk perfectly; 4. Spock and Spock. Quinto looks uncannily like the young Nimoy, but to have Nimoy himself playing the aged Spock, and to see the difference between the young and the old and to understand how it happened - magical; 5. Eye candy - this movie looks amazing!; 6. Backstory - we always knew these characters existed before and after what we saw on TV and then the movies - these early moments fit perfectly into what we already knew; 7. Alexander Courage's theme and the 'Space, the Final Frontier' voice-over, and Majel Barret's voice; I would have enjoyed this film a great deal even had I not been a fan of the original TV series: however, being familiar with the series adds huge emotional resonance almost all the way through. I really, really, really enjoyed this movie.",10,2,18,7 May 2009
Fury," Brutal war drama
","Fury is a tank operated by Sgt Brad Pitt and his crew in Germany in the closing days of World War II, against increasingly desperate German forces. This film tells of events from the arrival of inexperienced replacement Norman (Logan Lerman) to a battle to hold back forces at a strategic crossroads.If I had a criticism, it would be that there was no sense of an overriding narrative purpose to tie together the episodes which the Fury crew go through. In particular, there is a lengthy sequence in an apartment with two German girls which seems to have little to do with what comes before or after and, in showing strange and unpredictable behaviour from all the crew members, doesn't provide too much clarification on the effects of war on them, either. It is a good sequence, but it leaves you uncertain as to what it was intended to achieve.But, for the most part, this is a very good film. It conveys the brutality and violence of war in the visceral Saving Private Ryan fashion, and you get a strong sense of what it must have been like to have been there. It is brilliantly staged, and the performances are mostly very good (although I thought Logan Lerman, despite having some very good moments, mostly had his face stuck in one unchanging expression).",7,1,6,25 October 2014
Fight Club," I don't get it. Or maybe I do.
","The (unnamed) narrator encounters this bloke called Tyler Durden, and they take to knocking seven bells out of each other. As you do. If fact, it's so much fun that they recruit others into their Fight Club, and other Fight Clubs start up. And then there is a revelation, welcome to a shock disclosure, which makes everything which has gone before a bit difficult to credit. Then there's a bit more, then it's the end.This is pretentious stuff. But because it is so down, dirty and gritty, it has acquired a reputation as being Significant and Important. It isn't. It is definitely moderately entertaining (if seedy and unpleasant), has some good performances and dialogue, and the twist/reveal is effective, but I am somewhat bemused at finding it occupying 10th best film ever as of today's date.It's OK, but overrated.",7,0,2,17 February 2014
Darkest Hour," Performances are better than the film
","Winston Churchill becomes Prime Minister because he is the only candidate who will be accepted by the opposition at a time when the country desperately needs war leadership. The country is facing military disaster and there is great pressure for a negotiated peace with Hitler's fascist regime.This revisitation of the short period between Churchill's appointment and seizing triumph from near tragedy at Dunkirk is fairly well travelled ground but is, for the most part, well presented here. I wasn't too sure about Churchill consulting a cross section of the general public (including a fairly unrepresentative for 1940, but politically correct for 2018, coloured gentleman) on a single stop on the District Line which lasted about 5 times longer than it should have done), but it was an attractive conceit. The period feel overall was good.And the cast was excellent. Lily James came across well as a young secretary, and I greatly liked Ben Mendelsohn as George VI. Most convinced visually when they needed to, and it was clear that much care had been taken to make Gary Oldman look like Churchill.There tend to be two approaches to the visual side of actors playing well-known historical figures. The first is 'It's all about the performance' ie. if there is truth in the performance then it doesn't matter about the resemblance. The second is when effort is taken to ensure a high degree of resemblance in a performance which is a close impersonation. Oldman here does both. He looks like Churchill and he captures most of the key speech mannerisms (his voice is, perhaps, not as gruff as Churchill's). He also delivers a convincing- and entertaining - performance.This film is, perhaps, not as good as it's being made out to be, but it's not at all bad, and has some excellent performances in it.",7,1,5,1 May 2018
The Maze Runner," So many questions unanswered
","Thomas regains consciousness in an industrial elevator which dumps him unceremoniously in The Glade, where he joins a group of other young lads, none of whom remembers anything except their name. Every month another member joins them: this has been going on for 3 years. The Glade is surrounded by vast walls in which a gate opens in the morning and closes at night: this leads into the Maze which surrounds the Glade. Some of the boys are Maze Runners, mapping the Maze, If they don't get back into the Glade by the time the doors close, they are killed by things called Grievers. Thomas proves to be a catalyst for change among the group, but this is not without its own difficulties.Not another young adult dystopia movie, I hear you ask? Or, more accurately, the first offering in a franchise? Well yes, but don't despair because this is not without its merits. It hits the ground running and never lets up, the youngsters involved are all pretty good (with Will Poulter outstanding), and the effects – the Maze and the Grievers – are very well realised.On the less positive side, I was quite happy with the film starting off as an action mystery, but I was less happy with the resolution – there are a LOT of unanswered questions at the end of this film, and the obvious set up for the next episode doesn't fully excuse the film for not answering some of them rather better than it does.But overall it remains an entertaining and eye-catching romp.",7,5,8,17 October 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Interesting....
","I long ago stopped believing Tarantino's publicity, and I approached IB (if I may refer to it as such) with trepidation. And I must say that whatever his faults - and they become clearer with each subsequent film - Tarantino never fails to present a piece of work which is startlingly individual.IB is a case in point. The story is an interesting, unusual war story. It starts with Gestapo Col Hans Landa (a fabulous performance by Christoph Waltz) killing a Jewish family but allowing daughter Shosanna to escape. Then we meet the Basterds, a group of eight Jewish American soldiers lead by half-Apache Brad Pitt, whose brief is to go behind enemy lines and slaughter Nazis. We jump ahead in time to a point where Shosanna now owns and runs a cinema in Paris. When the cinema unexpectedly becomes the venue for a movie to be watched by all the German high command, she determines to set fire to the place with them all trapped inside. Unknown to her, both British intelligence and the Basterds are involved in a similar scheme....There are some excellent elements to this movie. Christoph Waltz, as noted above, is one - both amusing and chilling. Diane Kruger, as German actress Briget von Hammersmark is another. The sequence in the bar is brilliant. And the proper languages are used, subtitled (with several cast members showing themselves to be fluently multilingual), with over two thirds of the film taking part in French and/or German.Now let's examine what is not so good.Shosanna's escape shows elements of a set-up for something which never materialises. A number of aspects of the ending don't really play fair with the audience (characters who die, and those who survive, contrary to audience preferences, plus the actual ending itself). There are some downright bizarre music choices. Brad Pitt is awful, playing a character directed (but not written) so broadly that he may as well have been playing panto - he seems to be trying to channel a comedy version of Marlon Brando in The Godfather, and his gurning is painful to watch. I found the whole interplay between violence and humour difficult to deal with - one sequence with someone being beaten to death with a baseball bat had the audience laughing.And the film is far too long - it could usefully be cut by an hour (the opening sequence takes 20 minutes and needs only 5).But I had no trouble with rewriting the end of the war - the 'Once upon a time' at the start makes it clear that this is a fairy tale.",7,3,11,19 August 2009
Coraline," Technically good, missing some heart
","Coraline 3D - I was expecting to like this a good deal more than I did. Which is not to say I didn't like it - that wouldn't be true - but my enthusiasm was noticeably more muted than anticipated, and I'm not sure why.I like the source material - Neil Gaiman's story strikes me as Alice Through The Looking Glass only with spiders crawling all over it - and the movie adaptation remained suitably creepy. The look of the film is great, and the standard of animation is phenomenal. The voice cast is exemplary, so what went wrong for me? I think maybe it has something to do with the fact that I found the film self-consciously clever at times. The old ladies/trapeze sequence, and the flamboyant garden sequences (for instance) felt to me like the film-makers were showing off, and were almost irrelevances to the story. For that reason the movie never really engaged me - I should have been on the edge of my seat rooting for Coraline, but I almost didn't care what happened to her.Even the 3D wasn't as effective as I had hoped - there were a few moments where I was impressed (oddly, these were moments like wide shots of a relatively flat and boring kitchen shot, but with incredible depth visible out of the windows) but much of the 3D had little impact.This story would possibly have been better served by a live-action movie. For now, probably best to stick to P Craig Russell's comic adaption.",7,2,3,14 May 2009

","Jay Baruchel visits his friend Seth Rogen in Los Angeles, and Rogen drags him along to a celebrity party at James Franco's house even though Baruchel doesn't really want to go. While they are there, the apocalypse starts.This comedy, co-written and co-directed by Rogen, features the usual suspects (Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride) doing the usual foul-mouthed drug-riddled schtick, the wrinkle here being that they are playing fictional versions of themselves, in some cases drawn closely from the perceived persona of the individual, in others - notably Michael Cera - showing a diametric opposite.It is tasteless, it is crude, it is crass and it is sometimes amusing (Emma Watson is a good joke), and it often shows evidence of not knowing what is funny, what isn't, and when enough is enough (Danny McBride in particular is given far too much rope). The carte blanch given to the cast to ad lib shows: this film often displays self-indulgence rather than a disciplined script. The apocalyptic effects are good.If you like Rogen's work then you will probably like this. If you don't, then you definitely won't. If, like me, you are sometimes surprised that you enjoyed something of Rogen's which you expected not to, this film isn't one of those. I was hoping it would be funnier, but saying f*** 5 times doesn't make it 5 times funnier than saying it once.",7,4,10,5 July 2013
Iron Man 2," Good sequel
","I think I enjoyed Iron Man 2 marginally more than the first movie, albeit with some reservations.My main reason for liking it was that there was more story to it which was not simply origin. While one accepts that the first movie had to have origin in it, it was good for that not to need to be addressed here.Mickey Rourke was an excellent villain, Sam Jackson had a little more room to play with Nick Fury, Scarlet Johanson finally got to kick some butt after demure décolletage and a couple of good moments through most of the film, and Downey and Paltrow reprised their characters pleasingly enough. Cheadle was fine as Rhodes, and Garry Shandling played an oily senator in what, to me, was one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie - a Congressional Hearing towards the start which is held with the intention of forcing Stark Industries to hand over the Iron Man tech to the US government.Oh, and THAT shield (not S.H.I.E.L.D.) makes another appearance.The only wrong note performance-wise was Sam Rockwell - his Justin Hammer never for a second convinced me that he could be CEO of any major company despite the fact that it was a highly entertaining performance.On the action side, I have three comments. One, I wasn't sure what effect they employed during the Scarlet Johanson combat sequences, but it made them appear very jerky. Two, I felt the flying sequences were really difficult to follow (in contrast with the first movie, where I thought they were excellent). And, three, in common with the first movie, I thought the ending to the climactic action sequence was rather perfunctory.But there was enough going on to keep me entertained without the action sequences being critical.",8,1,4,5 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Curate's egg
","This fourth entry in the increasingly inaccurately titled Alien Trilogy (to quote Douglas Adams, Spike Milligan, or both) is a real curate's egg - when the curate's egg was good, you may recall, it was very very good, and when it was bad it was a stinker.And so it goes with Alien: Resurrection. The good includes: The return of Sigourney Weaver as a Ripley with a new spin; A decent premise for a fourth entry; Brad Dourif, creepy as ever; A quirky, unusual, and effective supporting cast; A horrifying sequence where Riply discovers her genesis; Excellent production design; Some solid set pieces.The bad includes: A script which doesn't live up to expectations; Some dodgy CGI on the aliens; A distinct feeling of knocking cast members off by numbers; An appallingly badly realised hybrid.On balance, a worthwhile entry in the series but, if you are watching them through in sequence for the first time, be prepared for some bits which will make you wince.",7,1,1,28 February 2011
World War Z," Thoroughly enjoyable action romp
","Gerry Lane, having retired as a UN investigator to spend more time with his family, is caught up in the world-wide outbreak of a plague which transforms anyone bitten into a ravening (and incredibly fast) creature with chewing the unaffected as their top priority. Transferred with his family to an aircraft carrier, the price of their continued safety is that he heads up a mission to take epidemic doctor Guppy from Casualty in search of the source of the outbreak, a journey which takes him to Korea, Jerusalem, and -take a deep breath - Cardiff.I'm not a big fan of zombie movies, but I do love post-apocalypse stories, and this was a good one - I really enjoyed it a lot. After minimal set-up, it jumps straight into the action and never stops. There are those who have said that it is low on gore - it is - and that the structure is unbalanced, with the set pieces early on and the ending rather low key, and there is some truth to this, but neither was a deal breaker for me. I was engaged throughout, on the edge of my seat for much of it, and emotionally invested too.Brad Pitt, at centre stage, does satisfactorily although I find his haircut distracting. The rest of the case, mostly unknown, is also fine, but they are there just to serve a purpose. There are elements which leave you puzzled - David Morse's toothless gun-runner serves little purpose, the Israeli girl soldier is an odd character to bring in for such an extended period, and the zombie pyramid at the Jerusalem wall makes no sense given the number of helicopter gunships circling the area - surely they would at least have raised the alarm? The absence of bad language was very welcome, and the 3D was fine.",8,4,13,28 June 2013
Passengers," Not bad, but a bit glib
","The trailer for this film tells us that a man and a woman have been woken from suspended animation 30 years into a 120-year journey to a colony planet. With no prospect of returning to deep sleep, they appear to be doomed to spend the rest of their lives together (apart from a robot bartender). But maybe they will fall in love. And maybe they were woken for a reason... ...and the trailer is perfectly fair as far as it goes. But this film does something I love: it introduces something in its early stages which isn't in the trailer, and I can't say what because that really would be a spoiler. Suffice it to say that it is a major unforeseen - though not unforeseeable - influence on the dramatic dynamics of the story, and I loved it, even though I felt that it wasn't fully developed within the confines of the movie.It is fair to say that the hints in the trailer all develop during the movie, some as expected, some not, and they do so satisfyingly. Lawrence and Pratt are both very good, as are the underused Laurence Fishburne and Michael Sheen in a prize of a part as robot barman Arthur, programmed with a small amount of artificial intelligence, a slick line in bartender smalltalk, and a lamentable absence of discretion. I can imagine him jumping for joy when the script arrived.The special effects are excellent and the 'hardware' side of the movie is good, with the spaceship itself well designed, both outside and - especially - within: the sets are hugely impressive. Science purists will be a little irritated to discover that the ship has a 'Gravity on/off' switch, but this does result in one of the film's most effective action set pieces.But this is essentially a dramatic two-hander, and works very well as such for the most part, although I did find the ending to be a bit of an easy option in order to provide the audience with a happy ending which I didn't believe for a second, for a variety of reasons.Should I mention that Jennifer Lawrence in a swimming costume adds what was, for me, a further reason for seeing the film? I think I should.",7,1,2,16 May 2018
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," No laughs but a good film
","I am very puzzled by this film and my reaction to it.It's a comedy. Look, it says so on the DVD box. Lots of people say it's funny. And it's true that there was a bit I laughed at.But generally speaking, a large part of the movie is devoted to telling the story of a man who is experiencing a great deal of difficulty in dealing with the destructive feelings he is suffering following the breakup of a relationship. Much of the way this is dealt with is actually very truthful and was not, to me, very funny.But I did enjoy it quite a lot as a drama with humour. The four individuals forming the two couples are all well drawn characters: each has a ring of truth, with strengths and weaknesses, likable traits as well as negative elements. On that basis I recommend it.But a comedy it ain't. Not in my book at any rate.",7,2,5,16 March 2010
The Hunger Games," First rate
","Once a year, 12 districts each have to supply a boy and a girl aged between 12 and 18 to take part in the Hunger Games, a televised trial where the 24 young people have to kill each other so that just one survives. 17 year old Katniss Everdine volunteers for District 12 after her 12 year old (and woefully un-survival oriented) sister is picked. Katniss is a successful hunter/archer and at least stands a chance. The first part of the film details Katniss' background, the selection and preparations, and the second part deals with the Games themselves.This adaptation of the first book in a trilogy (which I haven't read) is a film which I expected to be good: it was better. It portrays a world similar to the familiar, but different enough that the changes keep you interested. There is no explanation, but you pick up background information as the story unfolds. The science fiction aspect is good, the action is good and, best of all, there is a lot of brain food in the film. It is not just eye candy and action: it makes you think.If I have a criticism, it is that I thought it could have done with the killings when the games start being rather bloodier than they were: I thought this would have pointed up the brutal nature of the Games, whereas I felt the deaths actually felt rather gentle. However, given the 'young adult' demographic which the books (and film) are aimed at, I can understand dialling back the violence.Jennifer Lawrence was terrific again.This film ticked all my boxes and I recommend it highly.",10,8,29,22 March 2012
Zootopia," Excellent
","Judy Hopps, rookie cop and keen as mustard, is disappointed when she is put on traffic duty. She manages to find herself investigating a spate of disappearances, although if she is unsuccessful within a time limit, she will lose her job, which is why she enlists the help of smart petty crook Nick Wilde. Oh, and they are all animals – Judy is a rabbit and Nick is a fox.This CGI animated feature is a delight. It has a strong story with twists and turns, the action never stops (except in the vehicle licensing office), the city and the characters are all beautifully realised (the characters are especially well designed) and, even though it is a kids' film, there is plenty to see and listen to for adults: it does that wonderful thing of providing an additional, more sophisticated layer for adults to enjoy.Ginnifer Goodwin is terrific as Judy, and Jason Bateman's easy charm suits the laid back Nick well. For me, the only let down on the voices was Idris Elba as Chief Bogo: I didn't think it was a very good characterisation.On the whole, though, this is a first rate film, entertaining for all.",9,4,9,1 April 2016
The Impossible," Good, but not always easy to watch
","A couple and their three young sons are on holiday on the Thai coast when the 2004 tsunami hits. Although they survive, they are separated, and the mother is badly injured.This film is based on the true survival story of a Spanish family. It starts with a sequence which puts you right with the mother and oldest son, swept along in the wave itself (truly terrifying, and brilliantly realised), and then switches back and forth.Much of this film is pretty harrowing stuff. I was aware of frequent sniffling in the cinema, because there is some solidly emotional stuff on offer here. Standout is Tom Holland (then 14 but playing younger) as oldest son Lucas, but all the kids give great naturalistic performances and make me wonder why the Harry Potter kids weren't better. Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor as Mum and Dad also have some very moving moments.I can't say that this is an enjoyable film - it is more an experience, and a worthwhile one - but it is well worth watching, and a terrific directing job by Juan Antonio Bayona.",8,0,1,10 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Excellent, but without the element of surprise
","The unexpected success of POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl (aka Pirates 1) was such that a sequel was inevitable. Or, to be more precise, the first half of a sequel running over two movies.Pirates 2 picks up shortly after Pirates 1 ends, and reunites the cast and creative team behind the first movie, and adds some other characters, Bill Nighy's squid-faced Davy Jones being the main one. In fact, Jones' supernatural crew of half human, half fish cutthroats are one of the high points of Pirates 2, together with an amusing script, a convoluted story, and some fun (and funny) set pieces.Had Pirates 1 not come first, this would be rated higher, I am sure - the fact that Pirates 1 had set the bar so high (and so unexpectedly) meant that any sequel had a huge amount to live up to: Pirates 2 just about managed it.",8,0,1,22 June 2011
Argo," A fine film
","Following the overthrow of the Shah, Iranian students invaded the US Embassy in Teheran and held the staff hostage. 6 people escaped and took refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's residence, and the CIA mounted a covert rescue operation whereby the fugitives would be flown out in plain view, but in the guise of a unit carrying out pre-production work on potential Iranian locations for a Star Wars rip-off movie.This film dramatises a true event and, if a little bit of research is to be believed, makes more of it than was actually the case. I don't mind that at all, because this is a fine film. The story is terrific, full of tension throughout, and the fact that these events of 30 years ago still reflect the current tensions in the Middle east mean that we can accept the oppressiveness, the peril, and the fear, as absolutely believable. This is one of the reasons why the film is so successful, the other is that everything is assembled perfectly. Ben Affleck as director has done a terrific job in making this film, and does just as well heading the cast. The rest of the cast are also excellent, and the images with the end titles show how well they captured the look of their real-life counterparts.There is humour, as the trailer makes clear, but this is a tense drama even though you know the outcome from the start (and this is probably the film's greatest weakness: there are no surprises. This is far from being a deal breaker, though).Highly recommended.",9,3,5,16 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Lightning in a bottle
","The trailer looked like fun, and we'd been on the ride, so we decided to go and see this pirate movie.The eerie opening was effective, and this was followed by some mild intrigue and romance as Orlando Bloom's apprentice swordsmith clearly wished to romance Keira Knightly's governor's daughter. And then Captain Jack Sparrow arrived, in one of the best movie entrances anywhere, any time, and the film took off.It had a strong story, lots of eye candy, humour, action, knockabout slapstick, excitement, swashbuckling adventure, a dramatic and memorable score, an eclectic cast on top form, terrific special effects, lots of nods to the theme park ride, a cracking script, and a fabulous central performance from Johnny Depp.Completely unexpectedly, it turned out to be one of the best and most entertaining family films of recent years.Superb.",10,0,1,22 June 2011
Star Trek Into Darkness," As good as its predecessor (which was excellent)
","Starfleet discovers that its newest starship captain is disinclined to follow rules just as renegade John Harrison kicks off a campaign of terror.I loved JJ Abrams reboot of Star Trek - I was completely won over by the clever way it was both within the original continuity and outside it at the same time, and how it was both a stand-alone movie for those who had never seen The Original Series and the movies which followed, but also full of referential moments for those who had.Well, Into Darkness, while being its own story which is inhabited by an Enterprise crew which now knows each other and works well together, pulls off the same trick and, if anything, pulls it off better than the first movie did. The action is great, there are surprises, humour, a wonderful performance of depth and menace from mysterious villain Benedict Cumberbatch, and some great riffs on elements from the original continuity.And when you factor in Mickey from Doctor Who and Alice Eve in her skimpies, what more can you ask for?",10,14,34,10 May 2013
Beauty and the Beast," Another triumph
","After the success of The Little Mermaid, and the accompanying renaissance of their animation section, Disney Studios made another trip to the stockpile of classic fairy stories, and plucked Beauty And The Beast from the shelves. Importantly, they matched it up with their secret weapons from Mermaid - Howard Ashman (so much more than a mere lyricist) and Alan Mencken. This is not to dismiss the contributions of its creative team, for this movie was the first ever animated film to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, a nomination which was well deserved.Howard Ashman's fingerprints are all over this film. His awareness of story, his ability to provide exposition, to humanise, and to convey emotion through the medium of song lyrics are strengths brought as strongly to Beauty as to Mermaid: if anything, it is an even more accessible story, with wonderful words (the lyrics of Gaston are extraordinarily funny, yet still provide us with character and plot-relevant information).This film is excellent, but forever tinged with the sadness that Ashman never lived to see it, dying at the appallingly early age of 40, 8 months before its release.The 3D conversion is good, but there are occasional weird moments when neighbouring image elements don't have their comparative depths quite right: this is particularly the case with Beast's face sometimes.",Null,0,1,15 October 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Succeeds in every way, with a wonderful performance from Carell
","Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) goes into shock when his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) tells him she wants a divorce (she has been having a low-key affair with work colleague Dave (Kevin Bacon). Cal reacts by spending evenings at a bar drunkenly telling anyone who will listen (and many who won't) about his problems: pick-up artist Jacob (Ryan Gosling) decides to take on Cal as a project and remodel him for his new circumstances. Factor in Gosling's interest in lawyer Hannah (Emma Stone), Cal's son's yearning for babysitter Jessica (who is herself infatuated with Cal), and some additional wrinkles...It is fair, I think, to call this film a romantic comedy - it features at least six romantic relationships and is, at times, very funny indeed. But it is also deadly serious at times, and contains some deep truths about people and their relationships, romantic or otherwise.While the eventual resolution is no surprise, there are a number of surprises on the way, and these are very welcome (one, in particular, leads to a very funny physical sequence on Cal's lawn). There are a number of places when you are laughing one moment and all choked up the next.. And there are some terrific payoffs, in particular the storyline between Cal's son and babysitter Jessica.Let me say that this is a wonderful part for Steve Carell, and he picks up the ball and runs with it. His performance here is mesmerising at times, particularly in the early stages where you see a decent man who wants nothing more than to do the right thing, hurt, bewildered, angry, shocked, and completely unable to process what has happened to him, and all conveyed in a performance of quiet and stillness.Pleasingly, the bad language is kept to a minimum.I rate this film very highly, and recommend it thoroughly.",Null,0,1,30 September 2011
The Rocker," Funny, happy, and fairly clean too!
","Robert 'Fish' Fishman is the drummer for heavy metal band Vesuvius. They are offered a lucrative record deal, but only on condition that they dump Fish and replace him with the record label head's nephew. Pete Best cameos, to make sure that we don't miss the point. 20 years later, Vesuvius has gone from strength to strength while Fish has drifted through a series of dead end jobs, filled with bitterness, and ending up sleeping on an inflatable mattress in his sister's loft. Then his nephew Matt, keyboard player in high school band ADD, asks him to substitute for their drummer, so he gets behind a kit for the first time in 20 years. Various mishaps lead to the band having to rehearse over an internet link. Fish, by this time, is reduced to living in an overheated basement, and the resulting video of the nude drummer becomes immensely popular on Youtube, leading to a record contract and tour, which culminates when ADD is invited to open at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on the occasion of Vesuvius' induction.The joke here is that the young band members are all vastly more adult than Fish, who remains resolutely adolescent in his approach to everything.I liked this film a lot. It would have been easy for it to have embraced the current tendency for humour to lean towards smut, scatology, drugs and bad language: it is greatly to the movie's credit that it remains pretty much (though not totally) smut-free, devoid of bad language, yet still very funny. Rainn Wilson, as Fish, deserves kudos here for delivering a performance which embraces childish idiocy, slapstick, heart and sentiment, all wrapped up in a genuine likability.Having said that, none of the characters here are fundamentally unpleasant - the worst they (the Vesuvius members and record company people) can be accused of is shallowness and disloyalty. The young band members are fleshed out beyond ciphers and all play well, and Christina Applegate as the mother of one of the members (and looking as good as she's ever looked) teaches Fish the valuable lesson that you can embrace adult responsibility without ever letting go of your inner rocker. Even the secondary characters (Fish's rock-star wannabe brother-in-law) have their moments.This movie isn't a great work of art, but it is a solid, entertaining, and fairly heart-warming comedy.",8,1,3,23 October 2008
Public Enemies," Very good, if leisurely
","Public Enemies tells the story of the pursuit of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale).The narrative is straightforward, the dialogue and setting all ring authentically of the era in which the events took place, and the cast are all first rate.I have several relatively minor reservations.One: the movie takes things at a very relaxed pace, and my attention wandered slightly in the final third. I felt it could have been tightened up usefully by about half an hour.Two: sound balance was very poor in the first 10 minutes. Music and effects were fine, but dialogue was muffled.Three: you end up liking the murderous thief Dillinger, and not caring for law enforcer Purvis. Quite possibly this reflects the characters of the two men, but it doesn't seem quite right to finish the film thinking 'That John Dillinger - what a nice man! What a pity he got killed.' Four: hand held camera! There's a dialogue scene between Dillinger and his girlfriend at the racetrack, shot from about four different camera angles and, because they are all hand held when they could have been shot from tripods, the constant wobble is very distracting. It doesn't all have to be hand-held, really it doesn't! But a decent job from Michael Mann. Not a classic, but a good movie nevertheless.",8,3,7,1 July 2009
The Babadook," Not what it was made out to be
","Amelia has a small boy who is an utter nightmare - hyperactive, somewhere on the autism scale, full of obsessive compulsive behaviour - plus she is exhausted and hasn't really processed her husband's death. A bedtime story book called The Babadook turns out, it appears, to summon a genuine nightmarish entity. Or does it? I missed this when it first came out - a genuinely scary horror film, it said, one of the best horrors for years.Sorry, but it falls short, possibly on the basis of false advertising. It is nicely creepy, with a sense of enveloping dread, and the cast are all very good, especially young Noah Wiseman as a truly annoying little boy (but then, he's supposed to be). Had it been staged (and advertised) as a psychological thriller, then it would have been utterly successful. However, it is sold as, and turns out to be, a horror movie, in which endeavour it is considerably less successful. In particular, it promises much and delivers little, and it has a dumb resolution. Still, at least it didn't have one of those unconvincing shock endings which turns everything on its tail.And it was so nearly really good.",7,3,5,3 July 2016
Us," Huh? And huh? again
","When Adelaide is a child, she meets a duplicate of herself in a hall of mirrors at the Santa Cruz beach fairground. The trauma of this manifests itself when her husband forces the family to holiday at Santa Cruz beach years later against her will. So, when a family of duplicates appears on their first night, she - and we - are not too surprised. Horrified, maybe, but surprised - naah.Certain filmmakers believe their own publicity and early critical success leads them fatally down the path of self-indulgence. Yes, Tarantino, I'm looking at you. Don't snigger, Shyamalan, you're not off the hook. And as for you, Aranovsky... Snyder, come back here! All of you, you need someone to edit you, reign you in, curb your excesses, think things through when you don't do so.I do hope Jordan Peele doesn't join them although, on the basis of this second movie, he is in danger of doing so. Much of this film is very good, particularly the performances from Lupita Nyong'o. And then we get to the explanation and the shock/twist ending/s. Well, we certainly needed an explanation (I'm still waiting for an explanation of Michael Myers), but this explanation makes No. Sense. At. All. And then the twist means that it makes no sense at all, twice.This bit needed thinking through much, much more. I'm not going to list all the many, many things where the explanation simply raised more questions, I'll just say that an otherwise enjoyable paranoia horror with some splatter and some black humour left me frowning afterwards.There is a very good film trying, and failing, to escape from a film which isn't quite there.And the husband? What an annoying idiot. She'd have been better off with the one in the red jumpsuit.",7,3,7,1 April 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Wow
","I have always had very mixed feelings about the South Park TV series. On one hand, it is infantile, coarse, graceless, outrageous for the sake of it, and - let's be fair - one of the least sophisticated animated series ever. On the other hand, it has often had some very good points to make, some sharp satire, and it is frequently very funny.So what of the movie? How do you manage to sustain the triviality of the typical half hour episode for feature length. Well, you start by writing a really good script, which wraps a number of excellent points (not least the free speech issue, with particular reference to bad language ie. South Park itself) in a narrative which effortlessly embraces them all, notwithstanding how daft it is, pepper it with some very catchy songs (and these songs are genuine ear candy, albeit peppered with profanity), crank up the production values (musically and animation effects: the basic animation remains clumsy cut-outs), and you have a film which maintains the appeal of this series, has an underlying seriousness, and is very, very funny.This is a work of demented genius.",8,0,0,11 December 2011
The Danish Girl," Food for thought - what actually matters?
","In 1920s Copenhagen, young married artists Gerda and Einar indulge in sex games where Einar adopts the identity of Lili. Things rapidly turn more serious as it transpires that Einar feels, deep inside, that Lili is his real identity, trapped in Einar's body. Gerda, as confused as Lili is, supports her as she makes her way towards her true persona in times which were not really ready to deal with that sort of issue.Eddie Redmayne, as Einar/Lili, and Alicia Vikander as Gerda, are garnering praise for their performances here, and it is richly deserved: they are both deeply affecting in this adaptation of a novel which is based on real people. Redmayne adopts an androgynous physicality which makes Lili credible, and Vikander has a quality of fragile beauty intermixed with plainness which is quite unique (her English accent is also exemplary), which means that they are both physically appropriate for their roles, but the real strength of this film is in the emotional stakes.I have no experience and little interest in gender confusion – or, at least, I didn't. But this film raises questions about the nature of gender and its interaction with love. There is a sequence where Ben Wishaw attempts to kiss Lili – a gay actor playing a man whose sexual orientation is unclear, attempting to kiss a straight actor playing a man masquerading as a woman whose sexual orientation, at that point, is apparently straight, and it left me enormously confused on a level I'm not familiar with. I came away with the conclusion – glib, perhaps – that people are people and, while sexual orientation is important on an individual level, maybe it's not that important in terms of absolute love.There is a lot of food for thought in this film.",7,0,2,15 January 2016
The Girl Next Door," Hypocritical but enjoyable
","This movie is a romantic comedy about a porn star falling for a lad in high school. Ignoring the fact that this is usually regarded as borderline paedophilia, and ignoring the massive improbability of the central premise, this film tries to have it sweet cake and eat it despite its unsavouriness.There is a hypocritical double standard at work here. The porn element, central to the plot, isn't actually present in the film at all ie. the film doesn't have the courage of the conviction which forms part of its foundation. And if the film doesn't believe in it enough to include sufficient of it to persuade the audience, why should the audience accept its credibility as part of its central conceit? Do be specific, Elisha Cuthbert is always attractive, always cute, always sexy, but never convinces as someone who has been a participant in the porn industry: she is entirely too wholesome.And this is a shame, because it undermines a movie which features characters whose company is quite pleasing, and a script with some good moments in it.",6,0,0,16 April 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Not bad, but not special
","You can see what they were after - that Pirates Of The Caribbean vibe. Unfortunately, they didn't get a script that sparkled, nor did they get anything like Johnny Depp's out of left field performance.Instead they got a workmanlike and likable hero in Jake Gyllenhaal's Prince Dastan, a feisty (is there any other sort?) and sometimes rather too shrill princess in Gemma Arterton, a selection of royal relatives led by Ben Kingsley who kept you wondering briefly whether they were friends or foes, a comedy sheik in Alfred Molina, a colour palette consisting of different shades of sand, some OK CGI, a story which kept going enough to hold your interest (with chunks borrowed from CS Lewis' Narnia book A Horse And His Boy), shedloads of action, and early sections comprising a definite tip of the hat to Disney's animated Aladdin.There were also things you didn't get. You didn't get (as soon as you understood that the maguffin was a mechanism to enable you to go back in time) much dramatic tension - if you know that time can be wound backwards then you never really feel that your characters are in any real jeopardy: the time reversal needs to be hidden in order for there to be anything at stake, but here it was displayed in the title. You also didn't get a classic score - you got functional underscoring with middle eastern influences. And you didn't get much flesh - OK, so it was Disney, but Miss Arterton was a very heavily covered up princess. It would have been welcome if there had been navel sightings from time to time, or if a bit more bosom had heaved into view.So I was entertained, but it didn't give me any more than I expected.",8,4,10,26 May 2010
Balls of Fury," Undemanding fun
","A cross between Enter The Dragon, the Karate Kid movies, and the Bruce Lee story, only with ping pong as the central martial art.The main character is Dan Fogler - not someone I was familiar and, as a dumpy fellow with a humorous but unattractive haircut, not the likeliest of protagonists - and he plays a loser with hidden strengths very well. The supporting cast is fabulous, starting with Christopher Walken having an absolute ball, and carrying on with James Hong, Maggie Q, George Lopez, Jason Scott Lee and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa.The movie is completely daft, amusing throughout (though not particularly hilarious) and passes an amiable hour and a half. It is never going to win any prizes, but I enjoyed it and didn't feel I had wasted my time.",6,0,1,11 January 2010
Ted," Essentially a straightforward rom-com, but with an original central joke
","When he is 8, John is given a teddy bear for Christmas. He wishes for it to come to life so that they could be friends forever, and his wish comes true. Skip forward 27 years and, after a brief brush with celebrity, Ted is now a dope-smoking foul-mouthed slacker and, still living with John, constantly lures him into this aimless unfocused lifestyle - after all, they are best buddies for ever, right? Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, has other ideas, however.This film's one original idea is that one of the central trio of characters is a teddy bear, and to see a teddy bear effing and blinding and smoking a bong is funny. Strip away that element (and cast, say, Seth Rogen) and you have a fairly routine rom-com where a long-suffering girl is trying to extract her boyfriend from the clutches of his bad influence best friend.However, the joke is quite a good one and sustains a moderate amount of the length of the film. Ted (voiced by Seth Macfarlane, who also wrote, directed, and performed Temotion capture), for all his slackerhood, remains a fairly endearing character, as do Mark Wahlberg as the adult John and Mila Kunis as Lori. There is sufficient going on to keep the interest going - silly subplots featuring Sam Jones' Flash Gordon movie, and Giovanni Ribisi as an unhinged father and would-be toy kidnapper augment the central plot.The realisation of Ted is superb.I could have done without quite so much drug use, and a bit less bad language. Conversely, I loved the fight between John and Ted - vicious, in the way that fights between people who love each other very much yet who are hurting each other a great deal can be, but also very funny, and I also loved Patrick Stewart's fairy story narration bookends: absolutely faithful to how such narration is delivered, yet knowingly, wickedly, hilariously subversive.",8,1,6,10 August 2012
Knives Out," As good as it gets
","85 year old Harlan Thrombey, a hugely successful novelist. Has brought the family together in order to deliver bad news about his will. He is found the next morning with his throat cut and it appears to be suicide. But with so much motive around, who knows. There is also the mystery of who hired private investigator Benoit Blanc and why. And is Harlan's weet carer Marta all she seems? Might she not have a secret?This darkly funny who-dun-what is brilliantly cast and acted. But the writing and direction is stellar, too, so the fantastic cast just puts the cream on top. The plot appears simple, but is very well conceived - you think you should know what's going on, but you never quite do.And I must give all credit to Rian Johnson, a man I was perfectly willing to hate for the rest of my life for the way he wilfully scorned his audience in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. But his writing and direction here have redeemed him in my eyes. If there is a flaw in this film, it is Daniel Craig's excessively fruity southern accent. In all other respects this film is nearly perfect.",10,9,22,16 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," Best of the three
","Spider-Man 2 beats both its predecessor and its successor, for a number of reasons: One, it doesn't have to deal with origin and set up - Spidey is Spidey right from the start; Two, all the continuity elements work in positive directions. In particular, Peter's relationship with Mary Jane goes from fractured to complete.Three, Alfred Molina's Otto Octavius is the best of the villains featured in the three Sam Raimi movies.So this movie is pretty good. Even so it isn't perfect. Spidey is a little too given towards taking his mask off. One understands that Tobey Maguire needs screen time but, by the time the movie is over, half of New York knows what Spidey's face looks like. And, as in all three films, Spidey doesn't wisecrack. I want Spidey to wisecrack! Please take note, reboot!",Null,0,2,14 August 2011
Point Break," Visually amazing, nothing for the brain to chew on, though
","Johnny Utah, filled with guilt when a friend dies needlessly in an extreme action stunt gone wrong, joins the FBI. As you do. He realises that a small gang pulling off weird Robin-Hood-type crimes, is actually doing so by following an extreme sports philosophy. He infiltrates the gang, but possibly finds himself in over his head.This iteration of Point Break isn't really a remake. It uses some of the same names, and there is some surfing and skydiving in it, but most of the plot dynamics are different. Luke Bracy, as Utah, looks incredibly like Heath Ledger. Edgar Ramirez plays gang leader Bodhi and oozes charisma. Ray Winstone collects a pay cheque. Delroy Lindo as an FBI medium-wig (not as high up as a big-wig). Teresa Palmer fills a bikini. There are some other people in it, heaven knows who they are.The plot here makes little sense but that doesn't matter. What matters are the spectacular visuals of surfing, snowboarding, rock climbing, wing-suiting etc. Some of this is undoubtedly CGI'd, but even then the background plates are stunning. And 3D really enhances these sequences – the movie is worth catching in 3D for the visuals in the action sequences.The rest of it is pretty empty stuff, however, with little emotional connection to any of the characters despite determined efforts to create a philosophical bromance between Utah and Bodhi.",7,2,4,12 February 2016
The Fifth Element," So near and yet so far
","Die Hard meets Star Wars sounds like a promising idea, and so it is.There is nothing much wrong with The Fifth Element except for the bits which are, and there are only two of those of any consequence.One is the gaping holes in exposition which leave you not knowing who, what or why about the impending destruction of the earth. There's some vague wiffling about Evil Ones, but this hardly papers over the gaps.The second, and far more serious negative, is Chris Rock's Ruby Rhod character. The Fifth Element is a sci-fi romp, but Ruby Rhod, also referred to as The Single Most Annoying Character In The Entire History Of Motion Pictures Ever, seems to have been imported from some entirely different movie. It is impossible to describe quite how annoying this character is to anyone who hasn't seen the film: the only way to understand is to experience it, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Suffice it to say that the experience of hearing fingernails scraped down a blackboard is euphonious beyond imagining by comparison with Chris Rock's vocal characterisation, and the character's visual aspect is on all fours with the aural. Ruby Rhod is responsible, single-handedly, for halving the vote I award.",4,3,7,21 November 2009
Black Book," Gripping
","When a film has had a lot of comment, I'm reluctant to spend time simply repeating others' comments: on the other hand, there is a 10-line minimum! Put me down as one of those who thought this was a good film. It is a gripping war drama, wholly credible in both concept and execution. Although it has the gloss, drive, and production values which we have come to expect from modern films, it never loses sight of the humanity which lay behind the real-world events which are fictionalised in this film.And it has a splendid cast, mostly unknown outside Holland, headed by the wonderful Carice van Houten who simply lights up the screen whenever she is on it. Her performance is a standout.",8,3,6,23 February 2008
127 Hours," A bit boring, quite frankly.
","Aron Ralston tumbles into a narrow canyon during a weekend spent adventure sports-ing, and a falling boulder traps his arm. After several days his water runs out, and he is left with only one option. Which involves a blunt penknife.I understand that the whole point of this film is in the title - the true story of Ralston's 127 hours of being trapped requires us to understand that he spent a long time on his own, struggling with various issues before coming to the immensely courageous decision he made. And James Franco's performance is very good.But did anyone else find it a bit boring? Am I out of order for wishing he'd done the deed after about 48 hours? I liked the scenery very much, I liked the pretty girls he went swimming with (and had flashbacks over), but I personally spent rather longer in his head than I wished to.Maybe it's just me.",7,8,16,20 January 2011
Pirate Radio," An enjoyable slice of nostalgia
","This is a big slice of 60s nostalgia. It tells a mildly fictionalised story of the goings on aboard one of the ships which broadcast to the UK from just outside territorial waters in the days when commercial radio was illegal and legitimate radio avoided pop music. The powers that be were consumed with a need to shut these pirate radio stations down, hard though it seems to believe at this distance in time.This short slice of pirate radio life is seen through the eyes of 18 year old Karl. The film is funny, though somewhat episodic (inevitably, perhaps), and shows both everyday life aboard the vessel (and the sense of camaraderie which builds between those on board) and also a series of events, some unlikely, some less so. This is intercut with the machinations of Government (Kenneth Branagh and Jack Davenport, as pantomime villains) in their attempts to shut the pirates down.Most of the movie is enjoyable, though some elements are underdeveloped - what was the point of the Christmas dinner at Kenneth Branagh's? - or simply risible - the arrival of the flotilla at the end, for instance. Plus I felt there were far too many atmosphere shots of people clustered round their transistor radios, boogeying happily away. Yes, we did listen to the pirates, but no, I don't think we did it in groups of awe-inspired teenagers. Well, not that much, at any rate.The DJs are mostly recognisable as types rather than specific caricatures (with the exception of Philip Seymour Hoffman's The Count, an American DJ who is clearly based on Emperor Rosko). The performances are mostly fun: I would draw attention to Nick Frost, who I thought was woefully miscast, and Bill Nighy, who was screamingly funny.As is far too frequently the case, the film is loaded to overflowing with bad language. With one exception - the sequence where The Count is teasingly threatening to use the F word on air - the language is gratuitous and adds nothing, and I deplore it as being unnecessary.This film may not appeal too much in the US - viewers may be stupefied at the hidebound attitudes of the 1960s British establishment towards pop music, but the vast quantity of excellent 1960s pop music will certainly help, I suspect - there is one point where the Small Faces' Lazy Sunday leaps into stereo across the cinema auditorium that nearly brought tears to my eyes! The film is long - well over two hours - and essentially fairly trivial, to the extent that the length belies its importance, but I was entertained throughout.",8,3,8,9 April 2009
Batman Returns," Hindsight reveals its flaws
","At a time when we were starved of superhero movies, Tim Burton's Batman Returns followed his Batman and was a second oasis in the middle of the desert. And, as with the first (and as is the case with all Burton's movies), production design was a great strength - this film looks terrific.A critical retrospective examination reveals flaws, however. Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman is still a terrific portrayal, flawed only by Keaton's diminutive stature. Danny DeVito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman are both interesting interpretations, and visually fascinating, although I'm not sure this version of the Penguin works for me.Christopher Walken, always good value as a baddie, is one villain too many, however, and my main criticism of the first film - an over-emphasis on the villains at the expense of the titular character - is even more justified by reference to this sequel.It must also be said that the tone - mixing very dark with the camp silliness of the TV series - doesn't quite work here. In particular, the March of the Penguins sequence is so ludicrous that it fritters away much of the liking I had for what had gone before.",7,0,1,22 June 2011
Finding Nemo," Wonderful film for everyone
","Clownfish Marlon is over-protective of son Nemo. Devastated when Nemo is caught by a fisherman, Marlon goes on a journey to rescue him, in the company of forgetful Dory.Finding Nemo is one of those Pixar films which was a revelation in terms of groundbreaking visuals coupled with real heart - Marlon's journey is not just a physical one, and all the characters have personal development arcs to match the very best of those enjoyed by real-life actors in live action movies. The underwater visuals are simply stunning, the script is packed with humour, action, excitement and emotion, and the voice work is great (with Ellen DeGeneres' delightfully loopy Dory stealing the honours). This film is as good now as it was on release.Sadly, I have to add that, yet again, Pixar's 3D retooling adds very little. I was expecting great things - the possibilities offered by those grand underwater vistas suggested very effective 3D, but much of the time the 3D reworking was barely noticeable.Still a great film, though.",9,0,1,5 April 2013
Superbad," Quite effing funny apart from effing Seth
","I'm cross with this film. It has the makings of a really good teen comedy. But there are two things which completely spoil it.One is the incessant foul language. It is completely unnecessary, adds nothing, and after a while it got on my nerves. The sex references are part of the story and didn't bother me at all, but the F word is simply used as a meaningless punctuation sound interjected into nearly every sentence uttered by nearly every character.The other was the character of Seth. I liked every character in the film - even the two idiot cops - except for odious, mouthy, obnoxious, self-centred, offensive, single-mindedly stupid Seth.I'm not sure how much of this movie was scripted and how much was improvised, but the character of Seth drops this film by two grades and the bad language by a further one. So if you don't mind non-stop pointless bad language, and you're happy for your central character to annoy you from the very first frame to the last, then I would grade this a 9 for you!",6,1,3,25 January 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Enjoyable superhero origin
","The negative feedback I have been picking up about this movie worried me. I was starting to be convinced that I wouldn't enjoy it at all.I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was not without flaws, but I thought it was great fun.Of necessity episodic, it provided a decent origin story, some new mutants, retooled villains in Victor Creed and Stryker, and plenty of opportunity for Jackman to show both the feral and the touchy-feely sides of Logan.It was also pretty solidly action-packed, and most of the action moved the plot along (with the possible exception of some of the Logan/Creed fighting).I was delighted to see Patrick Stewart's cameo at the end.Jackman, as usual, gave a committed Wolverine, and Liev Schreiber delivered a highly entertaining Creed. Danny Huston isn't my favourite actor, and I preferred Brian Cox's Stryker.Yes, there was some howling - Logan as a boy howled on the first appearance of the claws, there was an adult howling not long afterwards, then there was the howling at the death of Kayla and, finally, the howling following the adamantium bonding. Possibly a howl too far, but I was minded to excuse it.I got somewhat confused at family relationships at the start (I'm still no wiser) but it didn't spoil things.And, while I know I am easily pleased at the movies, my 25 year old son and 82 year old mother both left the cinema having thoroughly enjoyed it.",8,3,6,5 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Fun on several levels
","Nick Angel is transferred to a sleepy country town because he is too effective, and shows up his fellow city cops. It turns out that there is scope for a supercop in the country...Writer/star Simon Pegg and writer/director Edgar Wright pair up again after Shaun Of the Dead together with co-star Nick Frost and many other cast members for this action comedy.It's pretty good. The cast is full of well-known faces (some of them are blink and you'll miss 'em), the story is daft but it works, the action sequences work well, it is loaded up with jokes, references (both self-referential and external), and an engaging and straight-faced performance from Pegg which nicely anchors the surrounding lunacy.It's a bit strong, but well worth watching if you don't mind some strong language and a bit of graphic violence.",8,0,0,21 May 2014
The Mummy," First rate romp
","To remake The Mummy in the style of Indiana Jones but with a humorous edge was a stroke of genius, and it is executed very well in this movie.Brendan Fraser nominally heads a cast who all perform very well, but Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep hits the number one spot as far as I'm concerned (although I have a distinct soft spot, if that's the right expression, for Patricia Velasquez' gold painted costume as Anck Su Namun.The action practically never lets up, especially in the last 40 minutes or so, and his helped along by equal quantities of wisecracks and special effects. Although the standard of integrated CGI has been improved on subsequently, the effects here were near cutting edge at the time and always work well in service of the story.And, above everything else, The Mummy is vastly entertaining.",9,6,6,19 December 2010
Constantine," Grrr
","I'm bemused and irritated by my own reaction to this movie.On the one hand I'm a big fan of the source material, and John Constantine is a ratty little blonde scouser, not a tall dark American. On the other hand, this movie (which draws heavily on the Bad Habits arc from the comics) is actually a great deal of fun.The story is good, the effects are good and the cast are good (notwithstanding that I don't care much for Rachel Weisz). My only real criticism is that any smoker can tell that Keanu Reeves isn't a smoker and, given that his character's smoking is such an important part of the storyline, it irritates.For all that, it's well worth a watch.",7,0,3,13 December 2009
Rise of the Guardians," Recommended
","Pitch Black, the Bogeyman, is using nightmares to destroy kids' belief in the essentials of childhood, so North (aka Father Christmas) gathers together the guardians of those essentials - the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman and a newly appointed Jack Frost- to protect them.This CGI movie is aimed at children, but has a lot in it to please adults. The story is essentially a straightforward good-vs-evil affair, but the script is good and has heart. The characters are all well conceived and designed, and the voice talent is solid (Hugh Jackman's aggressively Australian Easter Bunny is the most obvious attention-getter, but all the characters are done well.The animation and look of the film is terrific, and the 3D is superb - seeing this in 3D is recommended.This is an excellent family film.",9,0,1,14 December 2012
Troy," A fair effort
","Assorted thoughts, in no particular order: 1. The main music motif sounds as if it is lifted from the Stargate movie.2. Brad Pitt is so buff I nearly found myself fancying him (but not quite).3. Pitt showed me, for the first time, that he is an actor who can actually act: his Achilles is very 3 dimensional.4. Peter O'Toole is outstanding.5. The Achilles/Hector fight is one of the best fights of its kind ever put on film.6. The film overall is a bit overlong.7. Achilles' first kill is jaw-droppingly unexpected.8. Orlando Bloom's Paris is a pain in the neck throughout.9. Takes some liberties with the story as enshrined in legend (I thought Troy was supposed to be under siege for 10 years? They're there for about a month in this).10. Where did the Greeks get provisions for their huge numbers? 11. Overall, a superior swords and sandals epic.",8,1,2,31 January 2009
Just Go with It," Undemanding and enjoyable entertainment for older youngsters upwards
","Danny (Adam Sandler)'s reaction to youthful rejection because of his big nose is a) rhinoplasty, b) a career in plastic surgery, and c) chronic promiscuity based on projecting a false impression of being abused by his (non-existent) wife. Then he meets hot teacher Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) and is ready to enter commitment: the only thing is that she wants to meet his wife. So Danny press gang's his practice assistant single mother Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) into pretending to be his wife, and then things start to get complicated.I was ready to dislike this film - I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, and Jennifer Aniston annoys me because she tends to take the easy road by playing essentially the same character in every movie. And there is an elephant in the room in this particular movie in that does Danny really expect to go through the rest of his life with a fictional ex-family? And yet I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. I saw it with a moderately sized audience including some youngsters (it is a certificate 12 in the UK - children can watch if accompanied by adults), and there was a great deal of laughter from all ages. There is no bad language and relatively little by way of sexual innuendo. Despite the fundamental improbability, the plot steamrollers on well enough, and with a number of mildly unexpected changes of direction (Nicole Kidman's arrival, to name but one). The humour is varied, with many of Sandler's one liners being amusing, and some effective slapstick. Bailee Madison (as Aniston's daughter) delivers a worse English accent than Dick van Dyke's infamous cockerney in Mary Poppins, and to better effect. All the characters are inherently likable - not always the case in Sandler's movies - and the denouement is satisfactory, if predictable.Oh, and I have no complaint whatsoever about the wardrobe dept's choice of bikinis for the Ms's Kidman, Aniston and Becker.",8,8,14,25 February 2011
Ed Wood," Hmmm....
","I'm not sure how come I missed seeing this until now - I've been intrigued by Ed Wood since the Medveds' books were first published, I like Johnny Depp, and I usually like Tim Burton's movies (on first viewings, at any rate). Anyway, I've seen it now.It's a relatively straightforward recounting of the events in the 5 years or so from the point where Wood met Bela Lugosi to the point where Lugosi died. Of course, it just so happens that all Wood's highest profile movies had Lugosi in them, so they are all included.The reconstructions are pretty accurate, and the casting is spot on. Martin Landau, in his Oscar-winning performance as Lugosi is excellent - old, frail, sensitive and cranky, and clearly the most talented individual in Wood's entire set-up.In fact, the only performance I can criticise is Depp's - his relentless cheerfulness and confidence in the face of setback after setback becomes a little one-note after a while, which makes it slightly more difficult to care than it should be. Did this man really never comprehend how truly bad his films were? Conversely, the filmmakers clearly convey the respect in which they hold Ed Wood - he undoubtedly had a passion for film and, despite having no discernible talent as a filmmaker, he managed to get a number of feature films onto the silver screen, and the fact that none of them was very good does not diminish that achievement one bit.",7,2,3,7 November 2009
Orphan," Excellent, but harrowing
","The Coleman family have had problems (Mom's alcoholism, the near death of deaf daughter Max, stillbirth of baby Jessica) and, as a move to overcome these family wounds, they adopt Russian orphan Esther. She's very bright and intelligent, but there's something about her, as Mom Kate gradually comes to realise. Dad John can't see it, though.You're never quite certain what genre this film occupies, but it doesn't matter. It gets most of the clichés - jarring music, people suddenly appearing in mirrors, sudden loud noises etc. - out of the way early on and, for the last half or more, it's simply nerve-shreddingly tense and quite brutal on the audience. I wouldn't want to say more - this is not a film to give away too much to others about.The cast is excellent, but the three main youngsters are awesome - stunningly good.If you like movies which put you through the ringer, then this is one for you.",8,2,4,12 August 2009
Home Alone," Above everything else, very very funny
","Home Alone is a simple concept, but one of genius. A small boy (Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin, accidentally left behind by his family as they depart on Christmas vacation, finds himself in the family home which is about to be burgled by a pair of crooks. However, the little lad is full of innovative ideas for fighting off their depredations, and the crooks themselves are woefully inept.This idea comes out, in practice, as a chunk of set-up and a slushily sentimental coda which bracket the centrepiece - the assault and defence on the McAllister house, which is played as a live action Tom And Jerry cartoon.Sentimentality is appropriate for a Christmas movie (and in any event it is good to see Catherine O'Hara, often in overstated comedic roles, playing with a softer edge). Besides, a dose of saccharine is a small price to pay for the wildly funny slapstick violence inflicted by Kevin on the hopelessly outclassed Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern). Both actors play with a broadness which is not only just right, but also absolutely necessary. And young Macaulay Culkin's Kevin is an engaging combination of resourcefulness, malice, and vulnerability.A hugely enjoyable family movie.",9,1,3,10 January 2011
About Time," Heartwarming and quirky
","On his 21st birthday, Tim's Dad lets him in on a secret - the male members of his family can travel back in time. Tim uses this ability over the years to try to undo bad things, sometimes making things worse in the process.Richard Curtis writes and directs a romantic comedy which hangs from a sci-fi hook, although to call it a sci-fi movie (or even a time travel movie) would be grossly overstating the case. It is charming, constantly funny (though not necessarily belly-laugh funny), always interesting, it doesn't always go in the direction you expect (although it does mostly), and it is populated by characters who you are happy to spend time with.Tim is played by Domhnall Gleeson as a nerd who arcs gracefully into a good but ordinary (except for his ability) man, Rachel McAdams (who I don't normally like) does well as love interest Mary, Bill Nighy steals the film as usual, and the rest of the support are all very good (Tom Hollander's acidic Harry is particularly good fun.The story is solid but not exceptional, either as a romance, slice of life, or time travel. The script is, as one might expect from Curtis, frothy but with some meat on the bones, with real emotion and heart.I liked this a lot.",9,7,13,27 September 2013
Spotlight," A horrifying story, very well told
","The new editor of the Boston Globe sets the 4-strong investigative team from the paper's Spotlight feature investigating the molestation of young children by Roman Catholic priests, and the extent to which the hierarchy of the church was aware of it. The investigation is not popular with the Church which, in Catholic Boston, is a powerful organisation. But if a story is there to be uncovered...Let me start by saying that what the team discovers – including even the way the press was happy to leave things hidden – is both astonishing and disturbing. Having said that, let's move on and consider how the film conveys this story.Clearly presented as a drama, there is almost a documentary feel to how the movie lays out the relevant key points as the story of the investigation (this doesn't always work: the investigation is interrupted by 9/11, yet this has no impact on it of any great significance, and could have been easily written around if the film had been presented as pure drama: as it is, it presents an irrelevant 10-minute detour).The performances are all low key, and all excellent. The script is quietly efficient with little in the way of verbal pyrotechnics. There is always narrative movement onwards, but not much action in the sense one understands it in movies. And the film is completely gripping from start to finish, both in the mounting horror of what gets discovered, and the relentless way we share the feelings of the reporting team.This is a worthy contender for the Best Film Oscar.",9,1,3,24 February 2016
Terminator Salvation," Enjoyable blood and thunder, but no classic
","Now that we have four of them, it is interesting to look at the Terminator series of movies.Number one is high concept - the simple idea of an unstoppable machine pursuing a helpless victim, it is a chase movie, pure and simple, albeit with an interesting - and necessary - role reversal where Sarah and Kyle switch who is protector and who is helpless victim. Supercharged by Scharzenegger's signature performance, it is almost an exercise in simplicity.Number two did much more than just offer more of the same. Rather than repeat, it echoed and developed. The first one cost peanuts, the second cost a great deal more, but it was all up on the screen. Plus it had cutting edge special effects, albeit the effects where wholly in service to the story rather than vice versa.Number three, made without James Cameron's involvement, was more of a romp than the first two. While it developed the story further it didn't carry the weight of its predecessors and, although it did have the courage to offer a resolutely downbeat ending, it was quite different in feel to the first two which, despite the disparity in production values between them, were very a pair.And so we come to number four. Terminator:Salvation is the first of the movies to be set wholly in the post-Armageddon world which we have glimpsed briefly in the previous three movies and, as such, has a completely different feel to it, almost to the extent that it isn't entirely fair to make comparisons with any of the others. This is an out-and-out sci-fi action thriller, loaded up with physical and visual effects, building on the story elements laid out in the earlier movies but, without losing sight of those elements, building its own story.I was pleased to find out that John Connor is almost a secondary character, and that the story rests on the shoulders of Marcus Wright. Along the way we meet Connor (Christian Bale), of course, together with Kate (a wasted Bryce Dallas Howard), and we are introduced to the young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). But the story arc of Marcus Wright drives the story, and it is a good arc, both in its own right and also in the way it ties into the main Terminator elements. In particular, I enjoyed the symmetry in the character's first and final sequences in the movie.The movie is not without flaws - there is no real substance to it, to be fair. But it is always eye catching and involving, and is an undemanding popcorn movie.But my favourite moment came from a fellow audience member, who let out several involuntary whoops of delight when something particularly unexpected happened about 10 minutes from the end!",7,4,7,4 June 2009
My Neighbor Totoro," Fantasy meets reality
","When 4 year old Mei moves to a house in the country, in order to be closer to hospitalised Mum, with Dad and older sister Satsuki, she discovers Totoro in the vicinity - creatures like obese rabbits of various sizes.This charming tale from Studio Ghibli is reminiscent of the British stories of Rupert Bear, where everday life rubs shoulders with high fantasy in a world where both are unremarkable. Couple this with an ability to see the world through a child's eyes, and an easy and undemanding narrative leads us through a series of events of extraordinary ordinariness. It looks lovely, and leaves you with a smile on your face.",8,1,1,14 August 2018
500 Days of Summer," Excellent romcom which isn't always rom or com
","Lapsed architect Tom writes slogans for greetings cards. He finds himself unexpectedly smitten by new clerical assistant Summer, and it seems she likes him too, although she does deliver a warning to him that she's not looking for anything permanent.And therein lies a factor which is instrumental in raising this romcom a cut above the norm. Yes, it's romantic and yes, it is often funny, but underlying this is the knowledge, right from the start, that Summer is The One as far as Tom is concerned, yet not only is this not reciprocated, but the relationship is doomed to failure.The script is not especially laugh-out-loud funny, but it is constantly amusing. More importantly, it is sharp, the characters are well rounded and believable, and the thorny issues raised by a relationship breaking down (and worse) are addressed and not avoided.Joseph Gordon Levitt is a likable and vulnerable Tom, and Zooey Deschanel makes amends for her appalling performance in The Happening by giving us an attractive and free-thinking Summer.For one appalling minute I thought the movie was going to give us the conventional Hollywood happy ending, which would have betrayed the integrity of the characters and the movie. Happily, that didn't happen. Then I thought we were going to get the 'second best' substitute happy ending. And I suppose we did, but with such a satisfactory payoff that I didn't care.There is a fabulous song and dance sequence about half way through which deserves mention - broad smile time! And, most of all, this film is beautifully and carefully constructed - it has been assembled with real care.Highly recommended,",9,0,1,9 September 2009
Juno," Pleasing, if lightweight
","One for comic fans - Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), J Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons) and Electra (Jennifer Garner) all in the same movie! Juno is a smart-mouthed 16-year old. Not so smart, though, that it isn't a bit of a surprise when she finds herself pregnant. By the time she tells Dad and step-Mom she's pregnant, she has already a) discounted having an abortion and b) set up a childless yuppie couple to adopt the baby once it arrives.I watched this movie in an auditorium where the rest of the audience was teen-aged girls. As a man moving rapidly out of middle age in the wrong direction, this caused some weird moments when they laughed and I didn't, and vice versa. But it's that sort of movie. There are places where the humour is very much the sort of humour which will appeal to other smart-mouthed teenage girls: conversely, there are moments which brought back strong memories of my wife's pregnancies and the births of my kids.Let me say that there isn't actually very much which happens in Juno. That doesn't matter, though - my attention was held all the way through. And, if the resolution of it all seems somewhat glib, and if there is some question as to the morality in the story - well, I don't have a problem with that, either. Like it or not, teenage pregnancies do occur, and it's better for parents to react constructively rather than recriminatively. It's also unarguable that a child being born in those circumstances is almost certainly better off being adopted than being left to the mercies of a 16-year old couple.I found the characters in Juno to be engaging and real. There were laugh-out-loud moments, and the film as a whole was sweet and touching. All the cast performed well, but the two standouts were Jennifer Garner as a vulnerable wannabe mother, damaged by her childlessness, and Ellen Page, showing once again how effectively she can command the screen. I enjoyed this movie a great deal.",8,1,4,14 May 2008
The Jungle Book," Heresy!
","I'm not a big fan of Disney's The Jungle Book.There. I've said it.I know it was the last movie to reach the screen which had been developed under Walt's personal supervision, but there is quite a lot of it I don't like. I suppose I had better be specific.I never liked the 'scratchy' character and animation design which came in with 101 Dalmations.Jungle Book was the first movie which featured big name voice talent and, more than subsequent films, the voice talent threatened to become more important than the characters they were portraying.Mowgli - horrible. Sorry.The dreadful not-quite-Liverpool accents of the vultures. Did you learn nothing from Mairy Poppuns? I can see what you're going for, but get people who can do an authentic Liverpool accent! Backgrounds - sketchy. Could have done with more detail, greater depth, greater use of multi-plane (in fact the design generally is horrible in this film).Story - inconsequential.Elephants - awful. No plot relevance, mawkish, not funny.The songs - now, I'll give you the songs! In fact, the songs are so good they almost make up or the rest of it.But not quite.",Null,1,5,23 September 2011
The Day After Tomorrow," Visually stunning, otherwise daft
","Don't expect this movie to make sense - it is posited on a concept which is there solely as a hook to hang the eye candy on.And the eye candy is pretty solid - there are some great effects here, some really convincing disaster sequences, and some fabulous shots set in flooded New York.The cast, too, play it straight-faced for all it's worth, with complete commitments to their part and the material. I think, on balance, this is good.The story is spurious at best. The 'message' is hokey and less than credible, 'cause of the month' material. Although it does generate and sustain some suspense, to be fair. However, this is more than balanced by the 'Why did they do that?', and 'How on earth did they survive that?' moments.Ian Holm did this movie for the money, I think.But the effects - my word, they are special.",6,0,1,2 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Who would have thought the Black Pearl could jump a shark?
","...and so the two part Pirates 2/3 story (made to look like a 3 part by cunningly fashioning part 2 to fit to the original) comes to a conclusion and, in so doing, blows away a lot of the goodwill generated by 1 and maintained by 2.This is a mess, and it is difficult to conceive that it was developed at the same time as the far-more-coherent part 2. There is nothing inherently wrong with the cast (although Keira Knightley is starting to get a bit tiresome in this one), performances or effects. It's all down to the script.The problem is that there are too many factions and each one has its own agenda. You have Jack, Elizabeth, Will, Davy Jones, Barbossa, Norrington, Beckett, Calypso, the pirate council, and they all have different ships and ever-changing alliances and maguffins (especially Davy Jones' heart) switching backwards and forwards between them. It becomes very like a bedroom farce, only with pirate ships instead of bedroom doors, and with locked boxes, maps, and magic compasses instead of trousers which won't stay up.This was not a complete disaster, but it was a definite disappointment after what had come before.",7,0,1,22 June 2011
Don Jon," Well done, Joseph G-L!
","Jersey boy Jon is a jack-the-lad who, despite regular sexual success with woman he picks up, still prefers to get sexual satisfaction care of on-line porn. When he enters a serious, adult, monogamous relationship with Barbara, he discovers that she regards his continuing relationship with porn as a breach of trust.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who writes and directs as well as stars, shows that he is a film maker of considerable ability and maturity. This story is consistently entertaining, it balances humour with serious consideration of the issues involved (the reasons behind Jon's preference for porn are called into question, as are Barbara's motives), and it is well structured (particularly in its use of repetition) and well directed. Both Gordon-Levitt and Scarlet Johansen do well, Tony Danza is most enjoyable as Jon's Dad, and Julianne Moore - not an actress I care for - gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as the apparently free-spirited Esther. I hope it is recognised at awards time.I enjoyed this quirky indie movie quite a lot, but it is not for those who object to sex and bad language in movies.",8,9,15,22 November 2013
X-Men," Water temperature correct - toe safe!
","X-Men tested the water for big budget super-heroics, and met with huge success.Bryan Singer's ensemble movie does so many things right: 1. It starts off as a mystery, to hook the audience in; 2. It uses its large ensemble cast extremely well; 3. It makes a star of Hugh Jackman; 4. It delivers the brilliant stroke of casting heavyweights Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as partners/adversaries Xavier and Lensherr, giving the 3-cornered conflict immense gravitas; 5. It doesn't betray the expectations of any but the fussiest fans of the source material; 6. And it does all this on a broad canvas which rolls out the race prejudice subtext of Lee/Kirby's original comic.Oh, and it gets some highly varied special effects absolutely perfect, and has a pretty good script, too.I wouldn't say that all the casting is spot on, but it's close enough that I have no major quibbles.This very successful film is the biggest of Big Fun.",9,0,1,23 March 2011
Spider-Man 3," Some ball dropping involved
","Spider-Man 3 wasn't a work of art or anything, just an enjoyable couple of hours of eye candy.There were too many coincidences in this muddled and over-stuffed film - why did it matter that Eddie Brock had been going out with Gwen Stacy, for instance? He had enough to be p*ssed off at Peter about with just the photography: the Eddie/Gwen relationship was a complete irrelevance as far as I could see, and therefore an unnecessary coincidence. Coincidences help stories lose credibility, and this had more than its fair share.The soapiness irritated me, and I wanted to smack both Peter and Mary Jane for their emotional obtuseness (Peter has been failing to communicate with Mary Jane for 3 films now - is he ever going to learn? And clearly it's rubbing off on her).The song and dance sequences were truly awful. Really, really badly misconceived.There was no payoff to the Sandman arc.Still enjoyed it, though!",7,4,5,28 November 2010
Yes Man," Fun, but doesn't stretch Carrey
","Jim Carrey's latest vehicle resembles a re-tread of Liar Liar - Carl Allen is an overwhelmingly negative man in a small scale job in a small scale bank: prevailed upon to attend a self-help seminar which induces him into entering a covenant to only say 'Yes' when asked, he finds his life transformed when the 'Yes' answers produce good, if unexpected, results, while 'No' responses produce negatives.The whole thing falls to pieces, of course, when one considers that running one's life in this way means that one can't say no to things which really demand a No answer (and the lesson Carrey's character ultimately learns is that 'Yes' actually means 'Yes when 'yes' makes sense'), but this is of course where much of the humour comes from. While much of this is predictable, there are time when the story runs off in unexpected directions, and there are a number of moments when earlier apparently inconsequential plot points pleasingly pay off later on.There are no surprises in terms of Carrey's performance - he has been here before, and often. There is relatively little gurning, which is something to be grateful for. Zooey Deschanel reminds us of how cute she is in a performance which goes some way towards making amends for the dreadful turn she delivered in The Happening. Terence Stamp is funny as a surprisingly curmudgeonly self-help guru. And most of the supporting parts are well delivered, especially Rhys Darby as Carrey's aggressively and incompetently social boss.There is some unnecessary bad language and an oral sex scene which, while quite funny, adds nothing of importance - the film could easily have been trimmed for this and given wider appeal. If you're a Carrey fan you will probably enjoy it - I was amused throughout.",7,0,0,1 January 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," Desert zombie fighting
","Not everyone who watches Resident Evil movies has played the games - myself, for one. This means I can watch the films without measuring them against the computer games from which their inspiration is drawn, and consider them simply as films on their own merits.So, as episode 3 opens, the Umbrella Corporation's virus has successfully turned the majority of the world's population into ravening mindless zombies except for small pockets of nomadic normal people, an alleged normal community in Alaska, the remnants of the Corporation itself in its underground base, and Alice (it has also turned the world into desert for reasons which don't appear totally clear). Alice (Milla Jovovich, from the first 2 movies) is a lean mean fighting machine - sudden death for zombies. Also, she is in some respects specially developed by the Umbrella Corporation, whose resident mad scientist keeps trying to develop a cure from her blood.After a weak start - very much as if a particularly feeble video game was throwing random obstacles in the way - Alice falls in with a group of nomads and suddenly there is something at stake. The strength here is that the members of the group are particularly well defined individuals, unusually for this sort of movie, so that you do actually care about what happens to them.To be frank, there is nothing of any great consequence here to condemn or praise - it is a satisfactory zombie-killing movie, and provides an adequate conduit from episode 3 to episode 4.",7,1,2,11 April 2011
Midnight in Paris," Self-consciously clever, but also entertaining
","Writer Gil loves Paris, his fiancée not so much. So when Gil finds a time warp which drops him into Paris of the 1920s and, in particular, in among the artistic intelligentsia he so admires, he finds himself torn, especially when he begins to fall in love with Picasso's mistress. But the present-day beckons: he has commitments, but he may also find a way into the heart of the woman he is coming to love.Woody Allen often annoys me, but the self-aware intellectualism which often spoils his films for me is here turned to entertaining use as the 1920s artists and intellectuals become vibrant scene-dressing and, in some cases, essential plot elements. The script is fun, and the lack of any explanation for the movement between eras matters not at all.We know what's going to happen, of course - the mismatch between Gil and fiancée is gaping - but getting there is good fun. It is interesting to see Owen Wilson playing Woody Allen instead of himself, and the rest of the cast do fine.And Paris looks lovely, filmed in oversaturated colours.",8,0,0,5 November 2016
The Last Song," If you have a formula, why not stick to it?
","Ronnie and her younger brother Noah are sent to spend summer with their Dad. Trouble is that Ronnie is still furious at him over the parental split, and is the archetypical disaffected teen. Factor in bad influence local teens, local beach volleyball hunk with rich parents, neglected piano scholarship, and you have all the elements of a tried and tested young romance formula. When you factor in turtle babies, deadly illness, and stained glass windows (yes, there was a reason for that church fire at the start), and you have a formulaic teen romance with some weird stuff in it.Miley Cyrus does sulky bad-tempered teen, then executes a 180 degree turn and does smiley happy teen in a movie which saw the start of the off-screen romance with Liam Hemsworth, here executing the teen hunk boyfriend role. Greg Kinnear is likeable as Dad.This film is nowhere near as bad as some of the revews on IMDB make out, but it contains no surprises whatsoever. Apart from turtles.",6,0,0,7 May 2018
Zodiac," Leisurely but gripping
","This movie, which revisits the events of San Francisco's Zodiac killings (as fictionalised in Clint Eastwood's first Dirty Harry movie) and the subsequent long-drawn out pursuit of their perpetrator, is not a particularly fast moving affair. But it is a constantly moving affair - its 2 hours and 40 minutes are never spent standing still.Although the killings are (shockingly) included as part of the narrative, the film is more concerned by the effect the seemingly endless efforts to identify the Zodiac killer have on those engaged in the search. These include Mark Ruffalo's detective, Robert Downey Jr's loose cannon reporter, and Jake Gyllenhaal's obsessed cartoonist.The performances are uniformly excellent and the story, told in chronological sequence right up to its apparent end, is never less than gripping.An absorbing 160 minutes' viewing.",8,2,3,6 March 2009
The Prestige," Unusual
","The Prestige is an interesting and unusual movie, with a strong period feel and solid performances from the lead players.However, there are several elements which flaw the movie. One is Tesla's creation for Angier. Having as a Maguffin a machine which does something impossible not only negates the use of stage magic (based on deceptive illusions) as the centre around which the protagonists' rivalry is wound, it also takes the audience out of the movie and fatally weakens the first part of the denouement. Another flaw is Cutter's failure to act to rescue Borden from sentence of death once he discovers that Angier is not dead. Finally, and less importantly, David Bowie's accent as Tesla is a tad unconvincing.To compensate for this, Scarlett Johansson's mild estuary accent, complete with glottal stops, is excellent, pitched at a level where it falls short of blonde Essex girl.If The Prestige is ultimately less than 100% successful, it remains a worthwhile and entertaining movie nonetheless.",8,3,5,15 July 2008
The Terminator," Simple but genius
","Sometimes the simple ideas are the best. In the future, a computer system was taken over the world and seeks to eliminate humanity. However, the human resistance, under the leadership of John Conner, is turning the tide. The computers send back a cyborg (a robot covered with flesh) back in time to kill John Conner's mother Sarah, so that John Conner never gets born. Conner, in turn, sends one of his lieutenants, Kyle Reese, back to protect his mother.This film has science fiction trimmings, but it is essentially a chase movie - the cyborg Terminator is virtually unstoppable as it pursues Sarah and Kyle with a complete lack of emotion and total relentlessness. The simplicity of the concept leaves plenty of room for the plot developments, which are few but important.This was a cheap film - James Cameron was not a big name director at this point - but, given its low budget, it is well staged with the exception of some of the effects which betray the lack of bucks behind them.But as well as the strength of its simplicity, it has the additional strengths of immensely strong performances from Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner (transforming from cliché screaming bimbo to the flint-hard woman she needs to be to bring her son up to meet his destiny), and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. In truth, he doesn't need to do much more than keep a straight face and lend his remarkable physical presence to the implacable robot. And, in so doing, he planted his feet in the foundations of a film career which saw him become cinema's top box office draw for a decade.",Null,1,2,1 October 2011
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Fun all the way
","I liked this a lot. It's nowhere near as Gothic as the comics, and if anything, it's lighter and funnier than the first one. But although I like the comics, I think I actually prefer to see something lighter in a movie.Del Toro's visual imagination (as well as his preoccupation with intricate machinery) are both served well here - there are some great critters / monsters on screen.Perlman's Hellboy is simply terrific. Selma Blair is somewhat underused, as is Jeffrey Tambor - both got a substantially better deal in the original movie - but this is very much Doug Jones' Abe Sapien's movie. This man has to be the best mover in movies - Abe is so expressive despite his only moving facial feature being his mouth.The story is serviceable without being stunning, and Luke Goss does a satisfactory job as villain.But it's fun, and never takes itself seriously for a moment.",8,0,2,20 August 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Kind of nearly but not quite
","I am so terribly vexed by films like this. Washington Irving wrote a perfectly good story - look, you can see it lurking just on the other side of the doorway into Tim Burton's film. Burton has taken the location - perfectly realised - the notion of a headless horseman, the name of the character Ichabod Crane, and then refashioned everything to suit his own purposes. One now recognises that this is Burton's long standing modus filmandi - take what you want and mould it to fit your own vision.In the case of Sleepy Hollow, what results is good. Johnny Depp delivers a reliable characterisation, as usual, production design is great, the eclectic and starry supporting cast are all excellent, special effects are terrific (and frequently quite gory), and the story gallops along as speedily as Christopher Walken's eerie and genuinely creepy (usually) headless horseman.But I suspect that Washington Irving might have been a bit upset.",7,0,0,2 March 2011
Silent Hill," Eerie and effective
","Silent Hill is a seemingly fog-bound and deserted town to which mother Rose travels in search of her missing daughter. And, when she gets there, she finds it is not as deserted as she thought.Based on a video game (of which I have no experience), Silent Hill has rather more going for it than the straightforward linear series of obstacles to be overcome which is the usual format of such adaptations. There is some quite strong story material here, an atmosphere of creepiness throughout (there is something very wrong in Silent Hill, that is clear from the start), some genuinely scary moments, decent effects, and performances of commitment from an excellent cast, with Radha Mitchell's Rose particularly effective as the protagonist.Silent Hill turns out to be a good horror film.",7,1,1,26 December 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Good but not great
","I came to Tinker Tailor cold - I had not seen the BBC series or read the book. I had read a couple of reviews, mind you, so I knew what a terrific movie it was, they had told me so. And it did have the cream of British acting in it, after all. I'm not convinced. Let me say, to start off with, that I'm not going to attempt a synopsis other than to say that there is a mole in the British Secret Service and it falls to George Smiley to find out who it is. There is more plot here than in half a dozen other films and, frankly, I found Inception easier to follow by a wide margin. Nobody can be trusted, anything anyone says might be a lie, and you can't even rely on people being dead (or, when you can, you think you can't because it might not be immediately clear that what you are watching might be a flashback). It is, to say the least, a challenging experience, and I am still not 100% sure that I understood who was on who's side or why..It is beautifully photographed, in shades of middle class, middle aged, non-swinging 60s urban European winter.I once did some amateur dramatic acting under the guiding eye of an actor with a long and successful career in character work (which included a Star Wars and a couple of Indiana Jones movies), and he said that actors learn to make the most of their pauses. That is certainly the case here: this is some of the most pause-laden acting ever to grace a mainstream feature. I don't say that this is necessarily a bad thing, but the very... measured... delivery is quite noticeable. There is little sense of urgency.As for Gary Oldman? I love Gary Oldman's work: he is always a class act, fully committed, even in those of his films which have been least credible (koff Lost In Space, Fifth Element koff). Yet, oddly, in Tinker Tailor - despite the critical plaudits which have landed on him - I never felt that his accent sounded natural. He fully inhabited George Smiley in all other respects, but the accent never rang true for me.This is, indeed, a good film, but I didn't feel it was as very good as advance word had led me to expect.",Null,2,4,22 September 2011
Catch-22," A valiant effort
","Joseph Heller's angry novel - pointing up the futility of war by cranking absurdity up to a comic level - becomes a large scale Hollywood movie which works hard at capturing the essence of the book but, perhaps, sinks somewhat under its own weight.It is well worth watching nonetheless - spectacular, and featuring a vast and starry cast, yet still intelligent and relatively small scale in terms of the intimate story of Yossarian's nightmarish war experience, it is held together by a passionate and committed performance by Alan Arkin as Yossarian, a victim (as are many of the characters) turned attempted protagonist.But I think I would recommend the book over the film.",7,0,1,10 December 2011
Molly's Game," Food for the brain
","Overachiever Molly Bloom's promising skiing career is cut short by injury. Reacting against her domineering father, she ends up running dodgy poker games, initially for someone else, then on her own account. But she falls foul of the authorities who are after the organised crime people who play in them, and Molly seems like an easy target to enable them to get valuable inside information.Based on true events, I have no idea whether Molly Bloom is as innocent or as principled as this film makes out. It doesn't matter - this is a strong and gripping story. And as well being a good story, I found myself thinking as the film ended that a good script makes an incredible difference. And the script here, by Aaron Sorkin (who also directs for the first time) is first rate. It isn't full of memorable, clever, unrealistic dialogue, but it is needle-sharp throughout the 140 minute running length.The cast are excellent. Michael Cera plays strongly against type and, in a quiet performance, oozes an understated reptilian malice. Chris O'Dowd shows that he is not simply an Irish funny man, and Kevin Costner gives a beautifully nuanced portrayal of a man whose own hang-ups make him far more unpleasant than he needs to be. Idris Elba's American accent is more convincing than his native one. And Jessica Chastain, looking hot, holds things together as Molly, but doesn't come across as a particularly warm or likeable person, which may be how the character was intended to appear.This was a good meaty watch - intelligent without being pretentious, and thoroughly engaging.",9,1,4,1 May 2018
Dear John," OK romantic drama
","Green Beret John Tyree (Channing Tatum), home on two week/s' leave, falls for student Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) and vice versa. When he goes back to his unit and she goes on to university they console themselves with the fact that they will only be apart for a year until John's discharge and, during that time, they can bridge the gap between them with letters. Then 9/11 happens and John signs up for another tour. And it isn't long before John gets a 'Dear John' letter (OK, so they all are, but you know what I mean).Much of this is amiable enough, mildly emotional if essentially somewhat inconsequential, and enlivened by some rather unexpected plot developments towards the end.An interesting wrinkle is added by John's father's borderline autism, sensitively portrayed by Richard Jenkins, who is head and shoulders the best thing in this movie. Jenkins is one of those actors who has been in loads of things, is always first rate, you always recognise him, and you can't remember his name. He is excellent here, although the character's condition begs the question of how he managed as a single father to bring up a son on his own: indeed, how he managed to have paternity attributed and custody awarded.I didn't care for the ending or how it was arrived at.",6,1,2,5 May 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Enjoyable all ages adventure
","The unusually named intrepid boy reporter Tin Tin buys a model sailing ship at a street market: this proves to unlock a mystery involving murder, adventure, and treasure.Herge's Tin Tin comics stand alone: Herge's beautiful clean draughtsmanship perfectly complements stories which blend adventure, action, mystery, and comedy. In many respects it is surprising that they have not been adapted for the big screen before now (there is a decent series of drawn animation adaptations going back several decades). I imagine that the main problem with a big screen adaptation was how to go about it.I guess that there may have been two main problems with a live action adaptation. One is the fact that the set pieces would not have been easy to achieve with live action. The other would be that people are often unhappy with the casting choices because they may not resemble their hand drawn equivalents.CGI would appear to offer the ideal solution to these problems, and Tin Tin is Spielberg's first animated feature. It looks splendidly realistic with the sole exception of the characters. Many of the featured characters look facially like CGI modelled cartoon characters (which, of course, they are), while others look realistic, and this divergence is somewhat disconcerting. Tin Tin, apart from his trademark quiff, looks oddly realistic rasher than like his cartoon self and this, too, is a little disconcerting. However, many members of the audience are not going to be familiar with the originals, so I suspect that the decision to model like this is a good one.Because apart from that, everything else here works well. The story powers along wonderfully - if anything, a little too well, because there is scarcely time to draw breath. The animation is excellent, sometimes breathtaking, and the 3D works well. John Williams' score is first rate, the motion capture performances are all fine, and the voice work is good (although I felt Daniel Craig's voice, though unmistakable, did not suit his character). There is a point of view that Tin Tin himself is somewhat devoid of character. While there is some justification to this, a) Jamie Bell's voice characterisation is excellent, b) Tin Tin has always been something of a blank slate because c) he is the tabula rasa on which a young audience writes their own character identification.This movie is, above everything else, great fun.",Null,4,9,28 October 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A classic film
","Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid falls uneasily into the gap between the old-style traditional westerns and the more modern ultra-violent deconstructionist westerns. And, in so doing, it more or less creates a sub-genre of which it is the only member.It purports to tell the story of a couple of relatively small-time crooks whose specialities are small town bank hold-ups and train hijackings. They, and a lady friend, Etta Place (whose relationship with them is somewhat ambiguous) reach the point where dogged Pinkerton agents are set upon them, so they attempt to escape by running to Bolivia, where fate awaits them.The gaps in the sketchy knowledge of the real-life characters on which this is based are filled in most entertainingly by screenwriter William Goldman, performed with huge and obvious enjoyment by stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford (in Redford's case, this was a star-making performance) and directed with innovatory panache by George Roy Hill, and peppered with unexpected musical cues by Burt Bacharach.It is a treat. Make sure you see it if you have managed to miss it so far over the last 40-odd years.",Null,0,0,13 November 2011
Moana," Solid
","The sea has called to Moana since she was small but Chief Tui, her father, has banned the tribe from venturing beyond the reef. When the coconuts rot and the fish disappear, Moana follows her destiny by going to sea in search of trickster demi-god Maui. She seeks to make him rectify a misguided act many years ago, which led to the current problems.This film dazzled me from start to finish, starting with Moana. Enchanting as a child, and engaging as a curious, wilful, and downright feisty teen, the character features great visual design and wonderful voice work from Hawai'ian teen Auli'i Cravalho. Demi-god Maui is also a visual treat, especially the tattoos which offer their own commentary on his actions. And it is a delight to hear Dwayne Johnson taking such pleasure in voicing a character which pays homage to his own Polynesian heritage.The story, while not holding any great surprises, has an unusual setting and is a satisfying tale - the set-up in Act 1 is interesting, the action in Act 2 works well, and the pay-off in Act 3 is both gripping and emotional.The overall design and animation are simply breathtaking. The land locations are vibrant and detailed, the oceanic locations are epic, and the animation, particularly of hair, water and lava, had me open-mouthed with wonder at how beautiful the film is (the 3D has some great moments but shouldn't be considered essential). And there are a handful of points in the movie when story, emotion, and visual delivery come together and grip your throat and bring tears to your eyes.It's not perfect. The comedy pig thankfully doesn't go on the voyage with Moana but, regrettably, the comedy rooster does. Neither is essential, and the film would have been better without them. But it's Disney so, hey, comedy animals.And the songs are not necessary either. They are pretty enough, but the melodies are a little shapeless so there is no immediate show-stopper. But they are well staged and I suspect they will grow on me with repeat viewings. And there will be many of those, because I loved this film!",9,0,2,16 May 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Well worth seeing, says old white bloke from rural England
","In 1979 Colorado Springs, cop Ron Stallworth infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan. On the phone, because he's black. However, since he needs to attend meetings and the like, Jewish colleague Flip Zimmerman is recruited for the physical side of things. Their undercover operation proceeds in the face of some resistance within the establishment, and Ron's increasing involvement with Black Power activist Patrice.Spike Lee films an adaptation of Stallworth's autobiographical book. It is a strange mix of fact, comedy, period detail, action, drama, and social commentary and, oddly, this chaotic mishmash works quite well, helped by a winning performance form heavily afro'ed John David Washington as Stallworth.This is unusual in that it is a worthy film - it has something worthwhile to say - yet it is easy entertainment throught its running time. Despite its entertainment value, you are never in any doubt about the weight of the issues underlying it.And it is bookended by, at the start, a powerful cameo from Alex Baldwin as the Klan's Beauregard, spouting vile poison and, at the end, Donald Trump being Donald Trump.",8,16,36,9 September 2018

","I liked - and still like much of Return of the Jedi a great deal, to the extent that it is probably my favourite of all of the Star Wars films.True, I think the Ewoks should have been culled, and it's a shame that Lucas couldn't come up with a more original plot than re-running the first movie.But the speeder chase in the forest is thrilling, and the face off between Luke, Vader and the Emperor is first rate (and, for perhaps the only time, there is some depth of characterisation involved in Luke facing his fears and beating them - and maybe this will also take on more resonance by reference to the prequels and Annakin's failure in this regard until now).It's a pity Lucas' tinkering screwed up the closing music in the original version.",9,0,1,14 February 2011
Fast & Furious 6," Ridiculous, but very entertaining
","Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his fast car crew scored enough from a heist in Brazil in episode 5 to retire (but outside the USA, where they are all wanted). Then Interpol supercop Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) talks them into helping him catch someone who has a fast car crew who may be even better than Dom's, in order to prevent a maguffin which is worth billions to terrorists from falling into the wrong hands. The hook here is that Dom's missus Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who died in an earlier episode, appears not to be dead after all.Once upon a time there was a movie about the street car racing sub-culture in Los Angeles - notwithstanding the appeal of fast cars (which don't really appeal to me), one would have expected this to be something with limited appeal. Yet here we are with the 6th in the series.And, while no-one expects it to rank high in the Oscar nomination stakes, it is still an entertaining movie. It has no pretensions to be anything other than a spectacular, action-adventure romp.This is why it can get away with several high-speed car chases on London streets which are, in places, strangely devoid of traffic, not to mention a lengthy sequence involving a cargo plane trying to take off on a runway which is at least 5 miles long (do the maths). Oh, and - best of all - the most preposterous and exhilarating rescue since Arnie hauled Jamie Lee Curtis out of a limo in True Lies. I nearly cheered.Roll on episode 7!",8,2,4,24 May 2013
The Expendables," Tsk tsk, Trading Standards will have something to say
","The advertising for this film has been a little misleading, so let's get it straight right from the off: The Expendables stars Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham. Supporting them are Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren,, Mickey Rourke, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, and Eric Roberts at his most reptilian. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenneger, despite the publicity, cameo for 5 minutes (during which Willis unnecessarily lets off the 'F' bomb half a dozen times, the only point at which it features in the film). So what we have here is the Stallone and Statham show.Stallone leads a group of (we are led to assume) mercenaries called (we are also led to assume) The Expendables - there is no exposition, although we do see them at the end of a previous mission before the movie proper starts. The main story concerns a mission to a Latin American island where the local corrupt military leader is in cahoots with an American drug lord. Having carried out a reconnoitre with the aid of the military bloke's daughter (and killed 41 soldiers and destroyed a vast amount of military kit), they turn the gig down, but go back (for free!) to rescue the girl, who is now being tortured by the bad American.There are no surprises in this vague riff on The Magnificent Seven other than the inconsistent approach to violence - sometimes the approach is almost coy, sometimes it is very graphic, if brief. And, of course, the film is full of guns which fire hundreds of rounds before reloading, goodies who hit the target every time, baddies who couldn't hit a barn with a bazooka from five feet away and, frankly, the legendary blowing sh*t up. There is a brief attempt at giving Mickey Rourke some depth, but hang in there, because it's back to mayhem before you know it.This movie is fun, if you like violent action thrillers. The characters are enjoyable, the script is light and amusing - I saw it in a full cinema with a predominantly young audience and there was frequent laughter in the right places - the action is well choreographed and frequent, and the denouement is satisfying. Stallone is wearing his age well and Statham is a suitably gritty action lead.There isn't much heart to the movie, but it passes a couple of hours entertainingly enough.",7,4,10,19 August 2010
MASH," Unique
","In those long ago, pre-video days, the only way I could get enough of this movie was multiple visits to the cinema.The long running TV series was good but, inevitably, diluted considerably in order to be piped into living rooms. But you had to make a choice to go and see the movie, and it is savage. Frank Burns and Margaret Houlihan, in particular, are drawn very differently here than the rather amiable buffoons portrayed in the TV series.The characters are somewhere they don't want to be, having to do things they don't want to do, and this gives rise to a laxity in behaviour none of them would consider in civilian life. The movie is necessarily episodic as the characters seek activities to keep their morale sufficiently high to make life bearable until they can finally return home.Everything about this film is brilliant, from the script and direction to all the performances. Sutherland and Gould were the headliners, of course, but everyone in this was excellent, and it's a shame that some of the careers which this film promised (Bud Cort, Jo Ann Pflug) never really materialised.Oh, and I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but it's very funny.",9,0,1,29 April 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Excellent, but not for children
","My wife and I have been married for getting on for 28 years. I've always been a movie fan and, in broad terms, she hasn't. I've always tended towards fantasy in my tastes, while she is very rooted in the real world. This tends to make joint movie watching something of a painful experience - on the rare occasions when I can persuade her to watch something with a fantasy element, I spend most of the film fending off variations on 'Who's that?' 'Why is he doing that?' 'Where did they go?' and so on.I've wanted to watch Pan's Labyrinth for some time. I put it in the DVD player at about 11pm, expecting my other half to watch for about 10 minutes and then go off to bed (11pm is already late by her body clock).She was still there at the 10 minute mark. She winced and looked away at some of the violence (she's very squeamish), but said absolutely nothing throughout the film. At the end, she said 'What a beautiful film,' and I almost sighed with relief, for that is exactly what I felt. Yes, it's violent: the violence reflects the reality of the time and place. The fantasy and real life exactly balance each other and, for her, the film was totally rooted in real life, which is why she related to it so strongly.No other comments to make about the film itself - they have all been made by others.I've just been reading the negative comments here with interest. I have no quarrel with anyone whose tastes differ from mine, and much of one's appreciation (or not) is down to a matter of personal taste. The only criticism which holds any water, I think, concerns violence. But here in the UK this film is a certificate 15 and, if the fact that a fantasy film is certified for 15 year olds doesn't give you a hint that it might have some disturbing content, well....It is NOT a kid's film, and anyone showing it to a child is pretty irresponsible.",9,1,4,13 July 2007
The Way Back," Impressive
","In 1941, seven assorted inmates of a Siberian prison camp escape, pick up a teenage girl on the way, and walk 4,000 miles to freedom in India (well, some of them).This true life story is a straightforward piece of work, and stands primarily on the drama inherent in the journey and the hardships suffered by the escapees. As well as its strength this is also its weakness, because it never really draws all members of the fellowship as strongly as they deserve to be drawn.One is left with memories of Ed Harris as the pessimistic American and Saoirse Ronan as orphan Irena as the dominant personalities. Colin Farrell is Colin Farrell, and Mark Strong makes a short appearance. As for the others - by the time you have sorted out who is who, and they have individually started to make impressions, the movie is over.But it is a gripping movie where you are constantly amazed at how inhospitable this planet can be, and how resilient people can be in challenging the worst life can throw at them.And this film, too, contains one of those magic moments to treasure - a masterclass in dialogue-free acting from Harris, lasting no more than a few seconds, after Ronan has washed his damaged foot.",8,2,6,6 January 2011
Knocked Up," Good and not so good
","Concentrating on the positive, this movie contains a lot of humour, some worthwhile observations on relationships, a very funny and truthful labour/birth sequence, and a collection of people who, despite their flaws (and they are all flawed), are all fundamentally nice, decent people.Concentrating on the negative, there is rather too much concentration on the drug culture being a Good Thing, and vast quantities of foul language which add nothing to the movie, but serve to take away from it.Katherine Heigl is gorgeous but apparently doesn't remove her bra during sex.I still can't bring myself to like Seth Rogen, but he competently delivers a sympathetic loser slob who realises he has to shape up or else lose something very worthwhile which has arrived in his life completely by accident.",7,1,1,11 February 2009
Begin Again," Delightful and charming
","In the years since A&R man and record producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) co-founded his indie record company, he has lost his way: he is estranged from his wife and daughter, he has had no musical success for some while, and he drinks far too much. After a day when all his lows get even lower, is in a bar on open mike night and hears something special in a song played by Gretta (Keira Knightley). She is an English girl, alone in New York after her boyfriend and writing partner unexpectedly hits it big after his music is used in a hit film, only for fame to go to his head. Dan persuades Gretta to let him produce an album for her, recorded live in outdoor locations around New York.That synopsis is conveyed by the trailer and, sure enough, that is pretty much what the film delivers. It gives advance notice of being an amiable sort of affair, albeit without falling obviously into an identifiable category (and rightly so - it is best described as a light drama with elements of comedy, romance, and music). And it starts out being exactly what you expect.And then something happens. It's not that it springs any great surprises on you plot-wise (although you are not entirely sure how it will end: thankfully, it avoids travelling in one of several directions which would have been very very wrong), it's more that it assaults you with charm in a very gentle way and, well before it reaches halfway, you realise that you are actually enjoying this (somewhat improbable) tale a great deal.Why is this? Well, part of the reason is that both Ruffalo and Knightley deliver engaging performances: these two rather lost characters enable each other to find themselves, albeit through unlikely means. And they are given sterling support by James Corden (as Gretta's fellow ex-pat pal), Catherine Keener and Hailey Steinfeld (as Dan's wife and daughter) and Adam Levine (as the not entirely unsympathetic boyfriend Dave.The music is pleasant enough without being exceptional (with one or two very enjoyable musical sequences), and Keira Knightley turns out to have a pleasing, if delicate, singing voice.My sole criticism is that there is a fair amount of bad language in it and virtually all of it serves no dramatic or narrative purpose, and is accordingly completely unnecessary.I recommend this.",9,3,7,18 July 2014
Megamind," Spectacular fun
","Megamind is one of those movies which occupies the uncomfortable position of second out of the box. In this case Despicable Me was the first CGI feature about a lovable, and ultimately redeemable villain and, when the first one is good (as Despicable Me was), the second effort often suffers criticism by comparison.Personally, I liked Megamind more, for two reasons.One, it doesn't have the air of sentimentality which pervaded Despicable Me. And, two, it has some terrific super-hero stuff, and I'm a sucker for my super-heroing. In a beautifully realised city, some serious mayhem is wreaked, with heat vision being particularly well portrayed.Will Ferrell's Megamind starts off sounding like a cross between Roddie McDowell and the Chief Blue Meanie before finding his own voice. Tina Fay's Roxanne is so closely modelled on Lois Lane that I'm surprised DC haven't sued. Brad Pitt's Metro Man is suitably heroic (and unaware of how crass he's being) and Jonah Hill does good voice work on Titan/Tighten, albeit the character looks disconcertingly like Seth Rogen.This movie was good fun, and the 3D worked very well. Oh, and there are lots of little touches for old school super-hero comic fans to watch out for.",8,2,4,9 December 2010
Alien," Flawed
","Alien is a good film with a number of major flaws, some of which should never have been allowed into the final released print. I saw it in the cinema on its original release, and was throughly looking forward to it being both a sci-fi and horror fan.1. So I was bemused to spend the first 5 minutes wandering over every square inch of the Nostromo. It was almost as if I was being told 'We've spent 5 million bucks on these sets, and you're going to see every square inch before we even start the film.' 2. An hour of inconsequential fluff before anything happened. An hour!! 3. Face hugger - good, from the alien spaceship to its final demise in the sickbay. This was more like it.4. Chestburster - absolutely horrific. Until that is, it looked round like a curious cartoon mole popping up out of a mole-hole, and skittered off to hide and grow. Everyone in the cinema laughed. Everyone. The entire impact of the chest bursting - thrown away. I can't believe that they wouldn't have been aware of this before putting the film into release.5. Rewiring Ash. Sigourney Weaver is wiring up a dummy head prior to Ian Holm's head, protruding through a false floor, answering her questions. So how do they bridge the transition from false head to real head? By using a cutaway to Ripley concentrating on the task in hand. No, they don't bridge it at all - instead, there is the most jarring jump-cut in the history of cinema. Even people who aren't versed in the grammar of cinema know that something cronky has happened, even if they can't put their fingers on what it is. This is Basic Film-making, first term, first lesson. Just plain awful.6. From here to the end, apart from the illogicalities and unanswered questions, the rest of the film is pretty good.Is that enough to make up for those glaring glitches? Not in my book.",7,0,8,3 January 2008
The Book Thief," Held together by a 12 year old
","13-year old Liesel, having lost her family, is placed with foster parents (stern, forbidding Rosa (Emily Watson) and kind, sensitive Hans (Geoffrey Rush)) in a small rural German town during World War II. The film tells the story of her learning to read, her friendship with neighbour boy Rudi, the sanctuary Hans and Rosa offer to Jewish fugitive Max, and the consequences of these and other things.This film is based on a book I have not read, and I should start by saying that in many respects it strikes me as being somewhat derivative - there appear to be elements sourced from The Diary of Anne Frank in particular, The Pianist, Fahrenheit 451, Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics (the use of Death as a major character - here he is the narrator), and more. But Harry Potter had multiple sources, and look how that turned out. The fact that you can see the antecedents of a particular piece does not necessarily mean that the creator of that secondary piece has not fashioned something which stands on its own two feet.And that is the case here. For over two hours, Liesel's story keeps us enthralled, moving adeptly between the concerns of a 13-year old and the horrific reality of living in wartime Germany. Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush (and Roger Allam as the voice-over Death) are the only Names in the cast, and they (and everyone else) are all first rate.But this film hinges on the ability of French-Canadian Sophie Nélisse, aged 12 while this film was being made, to hold things together - a major 2 hour movie with a great deal of thematic depth, emotional nuance, and intense drama. And she is, quite simply, superb. Her omission from this year's Oscar nominations is regrettable, although I am sure her time will come - already, one can see strong indications of the adult actress she will become. I think she will transition from child performer very well indeed.Having been thoroughly engaged throughout, the two sequences which make up the ending ripped my heart to pieces and put it together again. I recommend this film highly.Postscript: Repeated watchings do not diminish this film: it remains superb.I have subsequently read the book which is, quite simply, one of the most dazzling pieces of writing I have ever encountered. Watch this film, and read this book!",8,7,10,27 February 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Very good, but....
","Tim Burton's take on Stephen Sondheim's Broadway show, probably the most explicitly gory grand guignol musical ever made, has a lot going for it: great songs, excellent performances, very good singing (unexpectedly so from Depp), and Burton's strong visual sense at work.I confess to being irritated, as more than once before, by Burton insisting that he knows better than the source material. Having said that, he makes a fair fist of this particular project.It is extremely grisly, and that may matter to you: I found that the blood was fairly comic book-ish, and easy to not take seriously.More critical is the fact that the protagonists are essentially unsympathetic. While one sympathises with why Todd becomes this character, and while one is saddened by the tragedy of what happens, the absence of any redemption (or hope thereof), unleavened by an actual resolution for Johanna, means that there is little satisfaction for an audience to hang onto at the end (even Toby settles matters by dropping to the same level of those he has learnt he despises).Does this outweigh the good things along the way? For me, it was a close thing, but my enjoyment just about outweighed my disappointment at the absence of humanity at the end.",7,1,1,27 November 2010
Blades of Glory," Daft. Funny. I liked it.
","This endearingly daft film is based on the simple but original idea of a pair of male figure skaters.The story includes rivalry, villainy, romance, and Rocky-like training from a position of disadvantage. It also includes a number of characters who are (very) broad caricatures - the caricatures are funny, however. But above everything else there is this sight gag of two men ice-dancing routines at least part of which would be better suited to women skaters.Ferrell and Heder work very well together as both rivals and partners.This movie is profoundly daft, but highly enjoyable.",8,0,2,29 March 2010
Horrible Bosses," Chucklesome adult fare
","Three friends: Nick (Jason Bateman) is cheated out of a promotion by his duplicitous boss Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey), newly-engaged dental technician Dale (Charlie Day) is sexually harassed by Julia (Jennifer Aniston), the dental surgeon he works for, and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) thoroughly enjoys his work until his wonderful boss has a sudden heart attack and is replaced by his worthless coke addict son Bobby (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell). Each would find life easier without his current boss, so they consult murder consultant Jamie Foxx (I won't tell you his name: it is almost worth the price of admission on its own), following which it seems sensible for each of them to kill the boss of one of the others.In the modern manner, this comedy is festooned with bad language and people with minimal morals - our sympathetic protagonists are planning murder, for heaven's sake, albeit one can understand why. There is explicit sexual language, drug use and mild scatological material. This is not a tasteful film.But it is funny - I chuckled most of the way through with an occasional guffaw. The performances are all excellent, albeit Charlie Day's constant shrillness wears a bit thin after a while. But Bateman does his slightly put-upon everyman well, and Sudeikis comes across as more likable and normal than usual.But the bosses themselves are best. Farrell goes broader than one would have believed possible, Spacey plays the reptilian malice of Dave Harken absolutely straight, and Aniston is a revelation as, for once, she steps outside her comfort zone. The spectacle of Aniston, wide-eyed with innocence, wearing only knickers under an open white surgical coat, and talking dirty, is not one I ever thought I would enjoy - and enjoy is the word. She is raunchy and very funny. More, please, Jennifer.",Null,0,0,24 July 2011
Black Mass," Cast impresses, film bores
","Mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger' is pressed into service by childhood friend and FBI man John Connolly to be an FBI-sponsored informant in order to shut down the Boston mafia. Having done so, Bulger then uses his immunity to build his own criminal empire up.This true crime drama features impressive performances from Johnny Depp as Bulger, Joel Edgerton as Connolly, Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's senator brother Mickey and, in fact, pretty much everyone in a fairly starry cast. It is grim, gritty, and very violent and, yet, not without some moments of genuine emotion. Depp's Bulger is a monster, yet there are times when we feel real sympathy for him.Unfortunately, Black Mass (why is it called Black Mass? This is never made clear during the film) wants to be Goodfellas, but it isn't. Despite the great performances, it suffers from an air of inconsequential rambling – there is little sense of urgency and, quite frankly, I got bored. Had it been 45 minutes shorter its events would have held my attention a lot better (there were a lot of shots of Rory Cochrane looking moody and troubled, all of which could have been trimmed to half their length, for instance).There seems to be a consensus that it is good to see Depp doing decent dramatic work after so long hiding behind funny teeth, hair and costumes, and I can understand this. It's just a shame it's not in a better film.",7,0,0,27 November 2015
The Town," Very good, but with a touch of moral awkwardness
","The Town as a character-based crime thriller starring and directed by Ben Affleck.Doug's gang take a hostage during a Boston bank robbery. Although they release her, Doug's psycho fellow gang member Jem (whose family took Doug in as a boy when his father went to prison) wants to find her and kill her. Doug locates her, falls for her (and her for him), and the inevitable complications follow.The story is simple, but there is a lot of it and it is engaging throughout. There are a number of very effective action-based heist set pieces. But it is the continually developing relationships between the principals which drives this film. Affleck again shows himself to be a keen judge of projects and a first rate director.The cast are all excellent, with Jeremy Renner standing out as a scarily believable loose cannon.My only reservation concerns Affleck's character and the ending. Doug is a violent bank robber who, at one point, has no problem in cold bloodedly executing someone. Yet he is painted as a sympathetic character throughout, the guy the audience is intended to root for. I suppose there is an argument to suggest that the promise of redemption is a praiseworthy basis on which to end a movie, but I felt that the way the film ended was at odds with what had come before.But for all that, this is a worthwhile way to spend a couple of hours.",8,7,14,30 September 2010
Underworld Awakening," Another instalment - not bad, not great
","In this 4th instalment of the ongoing war between vampires and lycans (aka werewolves), the conflict spreads to the extent that humans step in and attempt to wipe out both groups. The survivors go underground, and hot vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) gets caught, waking up 12 years later in a laboratory. The key new plot element here is that she now turns out to have given birth to a daughter ( a vampire/lycan hybrid like her father Michael), which means that scientists are looking to harvest her and, well, it's tosh, isn't it? But it's quite entertaining tosh, and it goes in enough of a new direction to keep you interested. Once again, Kate Beckinsale looks sexy and slinky in tight oiled black leather, and moves well in the action sequences of which there are a lot, albeit not so many that they undermine story. Stephen Rea plays a creepy scientist, Charles Dance is underused as a vampire coven leader, and India Eisley was quite effective as hybrid daughter Eve.The black and blue colour palette is used once more to its fullest extent, there is a moderate amount of gore, the script is functional, and if you enjoyed the others then it is likely that you will enjoy this one.

Suicide Squad," Nowhere near as bad as made out
","In a world devastated by the death of Superman, and still getting used to the threats posed by metahumans, scheming Amanda Waller brings together a group of criminals with 'gifts' to be used on deniable operations: force them into working as a covert task force, and throw them under the bus if things go wrong.Suicide Squad continues the expansion of DC's cinematic universe into the darkness established by Man Of Steel and Batman v Superman: arguably the Squad is a more appropriate vehicle for this direction than DC's flagship Big Blue Boyscout (SPOILER: he's dead now, anyway, his funeral featuring briefly in the opening minutes of SS). Paradoxically, SS is somewhat lighter than Snyder's two Superman movies, although I emphasise that 'somewhat' actually means 'not much.'This film has been critically mauled, but it's nowhere near as bad as has been made out. Dark, certainly, but this is a group of murderous criminals, so you shouldn't expect a super-powered version of the A-Team - these aren't nice people. Having said that, Will Smith's Deadshot is a murdering hitman with a young daughter he dotes on, thus making him a morally compromised bloke you can identify with. And Margot Robbie, the sexiest thing on screen this year so far, IS Harley Quinn. They gave us (blink and you'll miss it) Alex Ross' Mad Love cover - thank you!Unfortunately, the rest of the Squad don't do so well. They all get origins and moments in the spotlight during combat, but there is precious little for them in terms of character and backstory. Consequently it is difficult to care much about them, and the film lacks heart as a result.But there's bags of action, a decent threat, and one really good scene where they take a timeout in a deserted bar, and we get some idea of what the inter-relationships and dynamics of the group might have been had the script spent more time on character and less on expending ordnance aka blowing crap up. DC still hasn't figured out why the Marvel cinematic movies are so successful: we care about the characters. Here - not so much.Overall, though, I enjoyed this. I have recently been reading John Ostrander's original run writing the Suicide Squad comic in the 80s, and this film is at least as good as that.Don't bother with a 3D viewing - it adds nothing.",7,1,2,23 May 2018
Shutter Island," Scorsese goes mainstream
","I haven't seen every Scorsese film by any means - probably about two thirds of them - so I don't come to Shutter Island as a fan, particularly. I admire Scorsese's skill and talent, but I don't necessarily like his films that much. However, I do recognise that he is a movie maker whose work is strongly individualistic.Which make Shutter Island unusual, because it is very much an accessible, mainstream kind of movie.Two cops - Di Caprio and Ruffalo - travel to an isolated island, home to a psychiatric prison hospital, to investigate a missing patient. Information/clues start from the very start. Some of them are misleading, some are valid but possibly not in the way you expected, and some are fair clues. As a result, you are kept guessing nearly all the way through.I suppose if you guess what's going on early on then you may be disappointed: I didn't, and wasn't.The cast is uniformly excellent: DiCaprio is particularly impressive, although I wish he would avoid facial stubble.If I had a criticism, it would be that the film is a touch overlong.",9,0,2,24 March 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Exciting action thriller superheroics continue to expand the on-screen Marvel universe
","Steve 'Captain America' Rogers has found his place in the present day carrying out missions for SHIELD. But then it appears that SHIELD's security has been compromised, and he finds himself on the run.This is not so much a sequel to Cap's 2011 initial appearance in the Marvel cinematic universe as a follow up, in which he is merely the central character in a wider story concerning the changing circumstances of the organisation SHIELD. As such, I preferred it to the origin movie, because I am getting great enjoyment from the way Marvel Studios is rolling out Phase 2 of developing its properties. Like all fanboys, I loved the teasers peppered throughout the end credits of the Phase 1 films, and was overjoyed when everything came together in The Avengers. Well, Cap 2 is not simply about Steve Rogers.The story is solid, the performances are all fun, there are many returning faces, the effects are great, and Chris Evans again does a good job of nailing Steve Rogers' heroism and integrity. Nick Fury and the Black Widow both get a lot to do this time round, too. Plus this movie sets up a LOT of threads to be picked up in subsequent movies.Do I have a criticism? Perhaps some of the combat sequences could have been communicated a little better, but that's a minor quibble.The 3D is non-essential (very effective in the aerial sequences, though). There are mid- and end-credits teasers.",8,3,8,27 March 2014
Life of Pi," Visually astonishing
","Young Indian lad Pi (telling his story in flashback) finds himself stranded in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger in the middle of the Pacific.The book simply didn't appeal to me. The trailers did, however, so off I went to take in Ang Lee's latest offering, a strange affair telling a story which falls midway between mythology, Baron Munchausen, and a Reader's Digest True-Life Adventure.To be honest, the story, such as it is, is almost inconsequential, albeit quite enough to hold the interest throughout, and certainly sufficient to hang the stunning visuals on. I think the author may well have been aiming to stimulate some sort of spiritual or philosophical musings in his audience. This film never achieved that with me - I am simply too shallow and rooted in material reality - but I was blown away by how visually stunning this film is, and I recommend it heartily on that basis alone. There came a point when I - quite literally - suddenly became aware that my mouth was hanging open.Also, see this in 3D. It is one of a handful of films where 3D is an essential part of the experience of appreciating the movie.",8,5,9,28 December 2012
Tangled," One of Disney's best
","Tangled is advertised as Disney's 50th animated movie. In many respects, it is also the first - the first movie to tell one of the traditional fairy stories (in the way that the classic animated tales, starting with Snow White, did) using the classic type of Disney character design, but to do so using CGI and 3D.I thought this film was great. It looked like a classic Disney movie, but with the CGI lushness which today's audiences have come to expect. The slender story of Rapunzel is fleshed out nicely with additional story elements, none of which betray an audience expecting a traditional fairy story, and it races along, full of excitement, action, humour, suspense and emotion. And yet there is sufficient in the way of modern sensibilities that a 21st century audience will not feel adrift.The characters are extremely well realised. All the supporting characters are fun (particular the animal sidekicks and the den of thieves), and the three main characters are exceptionally well done. Villain Mother Gothel is splendidly duplicitous, often funny, great looking, and wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. Flynn Rider is a lovable rogue straight out of the textbook, but with sufficient character not to be simply a cardboard cut-out. And Rapunzel herself is beautiful, and heart-achingly human in facing the dilemma of doing what she is driven to do while facing the fact that this is a betrayal of her mother's wishes (essentially the same dilemma Ariel faced in The Little Mermaid, but realised far better - and I thought Mermaid was a nearly perfect film!).The songs are satisfactory, but Glen Slater is no Howard Ashman - the lyrics are good, but they don't sparkle.And did I mention that this film looks fabulous? Every aspect of the visuals is perfectly realised, and looks simply stunning. The 3D is ever present but not intrusive. It enhances - sometimes significantly, but not to the extent that the film is poorer for its absence.If I may get a bit spoilery, there is an element towards the end which reminded me of both Beauty And The Beast and Shrek - one of the characters displays an unexpected element of self-sacrifice and, in so doing, cuts off an escape route, following which something wonderful happens and all ends well. In each of these cases I was aware of being emotionally manipulated. But, by gum, it works! My 9-year old companion was wiping tears away, and so was I, even though I was expecting the miraculous turn-around which followed.I loved this film.",10,7,10,4 February 2011
Interstellar," Far too long and self-important
","Weather stuff is messing up crops on Earth, and we're all going to suffocate from too much nitrogen. Secret NASA is exploring potentially habitable worlds via a wormhole provided by 5 dimensional aliens, and ace pilot Cooper goes on one such exploratory mission despite the pleas of his daughter for him not to. The mission does not go according to plan.This film, directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother, is going to make Nolan fans cream their jeans They are, after all, a vociferous bunch, and they tend to think of him as a cinematic deity. Me – not so much. I have enjoyed his films, but I also think they are very flawed, and Interstellar is no exception.It is a very derivative film, with so much borrowed from 2001 and 2010 that you are constantly expecting robot TARS to turn against the crew members. The main story is OK (if somewhat familiar) but the resolution, even though decked out with pseudo-science gobbledegook, still reeks of plot expediency rather than scientific verisimilitude. And it is far, far too long – there is an entire sequence featuring an unexpected well-known face which could have been replaced with a 30-second alternative, and nothing of any narrative significance would have been lost. This is not a well-paced film although, on a single viewing, it does hold the interest. However, at nearly 3 hours, it could usefully lose an hour of running time.It contains good performances, visuals which are interesting if somewhat less spectacular than I would have hoped for, silence in space (hooray!), a character played by child and adult performers who actually look like each other and – surprisingly for Nolan – some genuine emotion.This isn't a bad film, but it has far too high an opinion of itself.",7,4,8,14 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Strong, dark and funny
","Mildred Hayes' daughter was murdered in the small town of Ebbing and, seven months later, her killer is no closer to being found. So Mildred rents 3 large drive-by billboards on which she posts provocative messages directed at police chief Willoughby. And they do, indeed, stir things up.Martin McDonagh writes and directs. His first feature, In Bruges, was a dark and savage black comedy. His next was the forgettable Seven Psychopaths, but he is back on form again with Three Billboards. Everything you expect from the trailer is here, but there is a great deal more. In particular, there is one crucial plot development which, thankfully, isn't even hinted at in the trailer.The story is original, and the dialogue (which includes some very strong language) is fabulous. For such a dark story, a lot of it is laugh-out-loud funny. It is also very human: there is one flashback scene which finishes with something so brutally heartbreaking I nearly cried out loud with pain in the cinema.I'm not a big fan of Frances McDormand but, by heavens, she is good in this. Best actress Oscar good (as we now know). Woody Harrelson isn't far behind, and Sam Rockwell is solid, too, suffering only from a character whose development arc doesn't completely convince. And the conclusion is bold and, again, nowhere near expectations.This is a remarkable and original movie, and highly recommended if you don't mind something on the strong side.",10,1,6,1 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A satisfying conclusion
","An old villain resurfaces and Rey, who has been continuing Jedi training under Leia, following Luke's departure into The Force, finds herself facing an even greater threat than before.I don't want to put overt spoilers in an IMDB post, so I'll remain vague in my synopsis. Suffice it to say that the ninth - and final? - episode of the Skywalker saga wraps up most loose ends tidily and satsfactorily.It is clear in the storyline how much Carrie Fisher's unexpected death resulted in necessary retooling, but the plot still works well enough. It was good to have assorted cameos from old friends, even if many of them were blink-and-you'll-miss-'em voice cameos.The visuals, to me, weren't as good as usual - there was a lot of excess darkness where it was difficult to make things out, and also shaky camera work, both of which have become fashionable - contrast the climax of ROTJ, also dark and full of action, but an object lesson in clarity.Most of the criticisms I've read didn't matter too much to me. I did feel that The Force turned out to have areas which were somewhat unexpected (again!), and the sudden revelation of Force Dyads matched midichlorians as conveniently expedient plot devices. They weren't deal breakers for me, though.I enjoyed it hugely, and it repaired a lot of the samage Episode VIII had caused for me.",8,9,30,14 May 2020
Pacific Rim," Monsters vs Robots - what's not to like?
","Giant monsters are rising from below the sea, and huge robots driven by pairs of human pilots are constructed in order to fight them. This film - a straightforward blend of Godzilla, Cloverfield, Transformers and Independence Day, with a cheerful disregard for anything approximating the laws of physics - contained a number of elements which made me wrinkle my brow quizzically, and much which I liked a lot. It didn't have anything I outright disliked.So what made me grimace? One, I thought Idris Elba's character was very badly conceived: an individual in that situation would never blow so hot and cold. Two, the caucasian young men heroes were interchangeable: I couldn't tell one from another. They looked the same and acted the same. Three, in this digital age, I didn't find the vast mechanical linkages in the Jaegers credible - surely there would be some digital body suit? Four, the comedy relief scientists were incredibly annoying.On the other hand, I very much liked the way this film started as if it were the second in a series, with a recap of the origin movie given as a brief voice-over at the start. I liked Rinko Kikuchi's quiet intensity as Mako, and I loved her flashback sequence with the phenomenal young Mana Ashida as young Mako. And, as successor to the Japanese Godzilla movies of the 50s and 60s wherein men in rubber costumes had slo-mo punch-ups in model cities, the movie has spectacular visual effects in which the giant action is completely credible. The whole thing is done with incredible slickness and modest likability. So get out the popcorn, put on the 3D specs, and enjoy 2 hours of giant monsters and robots beating the bejeebers out of each other. And you don't need to get your brain involved in the slightest!",9,4,10,19 July 2013
Empire of the Sun," An achievement
","Empire Of The Sun brings together (among others) three elements: the semi-autobiographical novel by JG Ballard (not the easiest of authors) telling his loss of innocence story as a privileged English child stranded in occupied Shanghai during World War II, Stephen Spielberg making a film which is an emotional artistic epic as effortlessly as he makes movies which are broad popular entertainment, and Christian Bale as a lad whose voice hasn't even broken yet, kick-starting his career with every bit as much intensity as he has shown in his work since.The film tells a small story on a big canvas. It visits childhood, as Spielberg so often does, but in a way which is less gentle than ever before. It shows the futility of war without preaching. It features a large and talented supporting cast all selflessly contributing part of the texture a film like this needs. It features memorable images - oh boy, does it ever! Spielberg fills the screen like a painter fills his canvas.This is a classy movie.",Null,2,8,17 July 2011
American Sniper," Good war movie
","Chris Kyle, Navy Seal, is a first rate sniper and tactician, but finds it difficult to return to real life after four tours of duty in the middle east.Bradley Cooper plays Kyle in Clint Eastwood's biographical movie of Kyle's life, mixing action sequences in Iraq with rather more soapy stuff back in the States. That's not to downplay the domestic element: Sienna Miller is excellent as Kyle's wife, developing from bachelorette to mother and distressed wife, concerned at the husband whose personality hasn't fully returned from Iraq. And Kyle's recognition of his problem and eventual preparedness to address it are well shown, too, and contain some of the strongest elements of Cooper's performance.But the combat sequences are probably what will live in the memory. They are extremely well staged, exciting, visceral, suspenseful, and full of jeopardy.This is a very good film with an excellent central performance from Cooper who is maturing well as an actor. Eastwood's direction is good, especially in the combat sequences, albeit possibly a shade too leisurely overall.",8,16,37,23 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Flawed, but fun
","Tiresome kiddie Annakin becomes tiresome young teen Annakin.Palpatine's machinations start to become more obvious, and there is some fun to be had with the sequences on the oceanic clone manufacturing planet, in the asteroid belt, and in the gladiatorial arena on the insect-y planet (although the Force doesn't seem to be a great deal of help to these young Jedi).The tedious but necessary romance is more than outweighed by Yoda vs Dooku - Best. Entrance. Ever.Jar-Jar is minimalised but, sadly, not exterminated.And, like all middle parts, this suffers by virtue of not actually going anywhere.Lucas has said that he is pitching his movies at younger viewers: if so, they aren't going to find it easy separating goodies from baddies in this opening trilogy.",7,6,10,14 February 2011
Lion," Good, but should have been better
","From a poor rural Indian family, 5-year old Saroo ends up in Calcutta, over 1,000 miles from home. Unable to explain where he comes from, he is ultimately adopted by an Australian family. Still troubled by the memories of his first family, the invention of GoogleEarth enables him to look for the childhood home he lostThis is a great, great story, and I really wanted to like this film rather more than I did.There is a lot which is good about it. Dev Patel as adult Saroo is excellent, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham are both good as his adoptive Australian parents - I had to put to one side my feeling that they are the 'go to' Australians for these sort of parts in recognition of box-office clout - and Sunny Pawar as young Saroo is also very good. So the performances work.
The location work, both in India and Australia is also good although, again I had to put a lid on a strong feeling that I had only recently seen Indian youngsters suffering hard times in slums in Slumdog Millionaire.But two things meant that this film was not the success for me which I had hoped it would be. One was the fact that I think it would have worked much better as a dramatisation than an adaptation - if the narrative had not featured Saroo's fellow adoptee, his troubled 'brother' Mantosh, or his American girlfriend Lucy, both of whom were major obstructions to the narrative flow without having any dramatic purpose (other than that they actually existed), the film wouldn't have felt quite so bumpy.And the other thing is that much of it took far too long to make its point or, having made it, lingered far too long before moving on. I understood the purpose of showing us the enormity of 5-year old Saroo vs Calcutta - how huge, how daunting, how terrifying for a small child. But I think the audience - or this member of it, at any rate - got the point a good 10 minutes before it stopped being shown. Ditto the train journey to Calcutta. Ditto Saroo moping around Melbourne.The film is 2 hours long, and would have been a much more involving experience at half an hour less.I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it - the final sequence is worth seeing on its own - but, for me, it was a worthy effort which didn't quite succeed.",7,0,0,15 May 2018
Forrest Gump," Overrated melodrama
","Most opinions have already seen the light of day here, so I'll be brief.As a middle-aged Brit who has had a relatively positive life, I positively loathed the premise on which this film was based - if you are good-hearted then you will triumph against adversity no matter what obstacles life throws into your path (with the subtext 'In America'). Sorry, it just ain't true, even in America. I'm afraid to say that I loathed the way that America took this message to its heart even more than I loathed the message.And I have always disliked the way the Academy often favours 'disease of the week' performances (I always rated Ernie Hudson's performance as a similarly afflicted character in 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' - why did that get overlooked?).But let me be fair. There is a short sequence where Gump tries to ask Jenny if his son is normal - maybe 20 seconds in total. Hanks' performance in this sequence is nothing short of phenomenal and, on its own, justifies his Oscar in this film, even if the rest of it is nothing special.",4,4,9,28 June 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Food for thought
","Gone Baby Gone caught me by surprise.I was expecting it to be a good film. Everything I had read said so, but I was late coming to it: its exposure in the UK was limited and compromised by comparison with the Maddie McCann child abduction case. So I knew little about it other than that it was about a child abduction, directed by Ben Affleck and starring his brother Casey.Well, yes, it is indeed good. It is a gripping drama which keeps you guessing all the way through (I hadn't known, but wasn't surprised, to see that it was based on a book by Dennis Lehane, who wrote Shutter Island). And, on the level of a rather dispiriting, rather seedy crime drama, it succeeded admirably.Then the last fifteen minutes or so arrived, and everything changed. Suddenly this detective story, with its unexpected twists and turns, became something very much deeper, addressing the fundamental issue of whether morality is, or should be, black or white. And it is this element of the movie which will stay with me well beyond the usual afterlife of a movie.In passing, I should mention that the cast are all excellent (particularly Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan and Amy Madigan), and Ben Affleck does a remarkable job on his first movie as director.",9,0,0,16 June 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," Excellent Pixar kids' movie
","In the city of Monsteropolis, friends Sully and Mike work as scarers - they pop out of kids' closets at night and scare them into screaming, because Monsteropolis runs on scream energy. Trouble is, champion scarer Sully fails to scare little Boo, who then accompanies him back into Mosteropolis where, it seems, children are toxic.If you simply restate the plot (which continues at length after the brief synopsis above), the whole thing sounds completely loopy. Yet it works perfectly. The inhabitants of Monsteropolis are a varied and pleasing bunch, Boo is delightful, the story is involved but easy to follow, and full of action, suspense and excitement. The voice talent is, as always, exemplary, with John Goodman and Billy Crystal perfectly cast as Sully and Mike. And it's very funny.I have to say that I was disappointed with the 3D conversion. The chase in the door warehouse was, as expected, very effective, but otherwise I felt that they needn't have bothered: the 3D is barely noticeable.",9,0,1,1 February 2013
Ant-Man," Another winner from Marvel Studios
","Scott Lang, decent bloke but failed crook and newly released jailbird, finds himself embroiled with scientist Hank Pym who has invented the ability to shrink people but is now seeking to sabotage the work of his dangerous protégé who is following in his footsteps.The latest episode in the Marvel cinematic universe introduces new character Ant-Man in a fun-packed heist-based action adventure. Paul Rudd's likability serves Scott Lang well, there are some terrific character dynamics between various characters (the Lang and Pym family relationships in particular give the film heart, a quality which is sometimes in short supply in Marvel films). There is a lot of humour – no doubt a legacy of Edgar Wright's and Joe Cornish's input – there are fairly obvious fingerprints throughout the movie. The effects are absolutely fine, with the way the action narrative copes with showing things from both the macro and micro points of view being particularly well achieved.I have seen 3 criticisms – one, that the ants aren't particularly well individualised. Come on, they're ants. And, two, that Evangeline Lilly's Hope Van Dyne should have been a stranger female. Well, one, she was, two that was part of the plot and, three, hold on for Ant-Man 2! And, three, that the Falcon was shoehorned in artificially just to create an Avengers link. Well, it worked for me.I LOVED the brief quote from the Avengers theme.This is a very enjoyable addition to the Marvel cinematic universe.",9,3,13,24 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Good, but with reservations
","Incompetent cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are assigned to a special squad where youthful looking officers are placed undercover in schools to investigate juvenile criminality: in their case, a new drug. In a curious reversal of when they were at school together, dozy jock Jenko is no longer cool, while dumpy nerd Schmidt is.Being British, and therefore unexposed to the TV series to which this film purports to be a reworking, I can ignore the former and concentrate on the latter.This is very much a comedy in the modern style: vast amounts of bad language and a fair amount of drug use (but very little sex: US cinema likes to talk about it, but not show it). I tend not to like films which rely on this for their humour: fortunately, 21 Jump Street has at its heart a) an effective situation, and b) a relationship between two fundamentally decent men. I'm not a big Jonah Hill fan, but he continues to surprise me by not playing the same character in every film. And Channing Tatum shows that the comedy flair he demonstrated in The Dilemma was no fluke.This film is quite funny - I chuckled often, though I didn't find it anywhere near as uproariously funny as the squinting, shrieking, sheepdog-fringed queen of UK TV film reviews (or her smug, sofa-sharing sidekick) seemed to. And I was somewhat uneasy at the way the climax tried to marry humour and violence. But overall, if you are OK with the language, drugs and violence, this may be worth a visit.",7,2,5,20 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Very enjoyable
","This summer of 2011 has certainly been a summer for super-hero movies, with the one I have been least looking forward to coming last. And, if not the best, it is as good as the best. In fact, my only real reservation derives from the fact that Captain America has never been a character which does very much for me (and, even after the movie, which I enjoyed immensely, he still doesn't).The story is familiar to comic fans - weedy Steve Rogers is transformed by a super serum into enhanced Captain America, who pursues super-Nazi the Red Skull.I very much liked the period setting, which gave this film a feel which is quite different to the other super-hero movies (even the 60s-based X-Men: First Class felt fairly contemporary), and all the principals gave excellent performances.. The action and effects all worked well (particularly the transformation of Chris Evans into the scrawny pre-serum Steve Rogers), and I suspect that there were lots of nice touches which meant a lot to those more familiar with the comics mythology of Cap than I am (I got a flavour from time to time that others might know who so-and-so was, but I didn't).As well as the big picture, there were lots of small touches I liked - the early incarnations of the shield, the use of the first comics costume, the establishment of Steve Rogers as a bona fide hero even when he was a skinny weed, for instance. But the thing I liked most about this film (and, to some extent, it contrasts with many other super-hero movies) is the fact that much of what happened in this film really mattered, both on a big scale and also on a more intimate level. Joe Johnston did a very good job in making every element of this film work together.I am looking forward to seeing the The Avengers next year, and I hope Joss Whedon does as good a job as Johnston.",Null,39,66,5 August 2011
American Hustle," Some excellent performances
","Irving (Christian Bale) is a small-time 1970s hustler, cheating people out of 'fixer' fees for arranging loans which never materialise. He meets Sydney (Amy Adams) whose sights are higher, but they fall foul of ambitious FBI agent Richie who, having caught them dead to rights, blackmails them into going after bigger prey. Before long they find themselves in deep waters, way out of their depth.Based on true events, this is a crime drama - relatively light in tone, albeit with a genuine sense of jeopardy in places. Though complex, it is easy enough to follow, and boasts some terrific performances. Amy Adams, whose every ensemble advertises the absence of a bra, is quite excellent (and far, far sexier than she usually is) although, for me, Jennifer Lawrence's performance has the edge. As Irving's wife, she bears his infidelity unhappily, and believes herself to be brainier than she actually is. It is not a big part, nor an essential one, but it is funny, and it carries a solid emotional truth at its heart. Then there is Robert De Niro in a small and uncredited cameo as a mafia enforcer, who gives what is probably his best performance for 15 years: the reptilian evil he exudes is almost tangible.There are criticisms: it is, perhaps, overlong, and the most sympathetic character, Mayor Polito (Jeremy Renner) is the one who suffers a punishment which he doesn't really deserve, while the other characters, all morally compromised (at best) don't get a comeuppance of equivalent unfairness.But this remains an entertaining and intriguing ensemble piece, with enough bad language to sink a ship, an intriguing ongoing drama, and Amy Adam's ever-present cleavage.",8,4,8,3 January 2014
Predator," Happy birthday Arnie!
","Schwarzenegger must have thought it was his birthday when the script for Predator landed on his doormat. Having already enjoyed the benefits deriving from the simple but brutally effective Terminator showcasing his simple but brutally effective talents, here came another high-concept property which played directly to his strengths and to audience response.And there is a great deal to be enjoyed here, from the gradual realisation that the mission they are on isn't the mission they thought they were on at all, to the relentless suspense and action, to the brilliant establishment of the characters of all the men (and hence an emotional investment in their individual fates), to the excellent special effects and costuming for the Predator itself, to the revelation of a highly convincing and extremely alien Predator face.... the list goes on.There are flaws, but they are few and minimal. This is one of the very best science fiction action adventure movies, and one of the very best Schwarzenegger movies too.",9,2,2,24 April 2010
Nightcrawler," Very uncomfortable, but very good
","Louis Bloom, on encountering a late-night car crash, gets himself a video camera, police scanner, and an assistant, and sets himself up as a video news gatherer, specialising in gory, sensational footage. As time passes, it becomes clear that Louis' agenda is somewhat wonky...This is a strange film, and somewhat difficult to classify (not that it needs it). The story – man with no goals acquires goals and pursues them relentlessly and with questionable morals – is straightforward enough, but the strength of this film lies not in its story, but in Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Louis Bloom. Bloom is completely believable, and impossible to identify with. Everything he says comes from on-line seminars, tuition blocs, reference items and so on: he runs his life according to what he has taught himself from the internet, which does not include empathy or morality. Accordingly, he may be outwardly charming – he smiles a lot, but his smile contains no human warmth whatsoever, it is an imitation of a smile – but his judgement of people is based on management seminars rather than emotion: he is incapable of understanding the feelings which drive people. He is one of the most disturbing characters I have encountered in a film in recent years.This is a good film – disconcerting, but well worth catching.",8,0,3,7 November 2014
The Aviator," It takes more than film-making skill
","I start this by saying that, while I admire Scorsese's skill as a film maker, I am not a fan as such: this is a sentiment I repeat with reference to DiCaprio as an actor.Scorsese's biopic of Howard Hughes' life is a mighty achievement. At nearly three hours, it encompasses most aspects of his life, but most notably (of course) his aviation achievements, his involvement in the film industry. his relationships, and his mental instability.The period reconstruction is excellent, the artistic direction (particularly the use of colour) is spectacular, and DiCaprio is very good, although I find his voice too light for a heavy role.But this film is boring and emotionless. It has no heart, and it goes on for ever. I lost interest. It may be a worthy movie, but it isn't all that entertaining.It didn't make me a Scorsese fan.",7,0,0,6 March 2012
Oblivion," What an eyeful!
","An alien invasion destroyed the moon which, in turn, rendered the Earth more or less uninhabitable. So giant engines are converting the seas to energy for the colony on Titan, and Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are a maintenance team, keeping in service droids which protect the engines in case of repeat attacks. But Jack keeps getting memory flashes which he can't explain.I'm not going to tell you any more than the trailer does, because the movie itself contained some surprises. Adapted from a comic, I'm not sure it makes as much sense as it thinks it does, and I definitely came out of the cinema with questions left unanswered (why did Victoria have huge pupils and minimal irises, for instance). Having said that, it is an exciting, eye-catching, action-packed romp, and great fun to watch.More than anything else, it is brilliantly realised visually. Iceland's bleak wastes serve very well as the ruined Earth, especially when enhanced with CGI and actual constructs of all-too-familiar landmarks (Does 1968's Planet Of The Apes know what it started?).Cruise is his usual reliably physical protagonist, Andrea Riseborough's layered Victoria is a pleasure to watch, and Olga Kurylenko's rather thankless role carries a great deal more sympathy than might have been the case.Overall, then, this is flawed, but still very enjoyable.",Null,4,10,12 April 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Moving
","Farokh Bulsara joins pop group Smile. They change their name to Queen, he changes his name to Freddie Mercury, and off we go.This biopic of Queen and, especially, its flamboyant frontman ends with a recreation of their (full) triumphant performance at Live Aid, and that's fitting - the story doesn't need to go part that point: it is a satisfactory climax.There is a lot of music, and the credits show it to be Queen rather than soundalikes. The visual performances matched with the music are uncannily faithful, from all four actors. The resemblances are satisfactory rather than accurate - even Rami Malek, notwithstanding some fabulous prosthetic teeth, doesn't actually look that much like Freddie.But, by havens, he captures him. His speaking voice is particularly good: the accent and vocal inflections are spot on. And the performance, showing both the flamboyance and the human frailties, is very moving. He is channelling Freddie.The other performances are good, too, especially Freddie's family and Lucy Boynton as Freddie's ever faithful friend and one-time fiancée Mary Austin, the Love Of His Life.I'm not in any way a massive Queen fan, but I liked their music and I watched Live Aid as it was transmitted. Music has the ability to create amazingly strong emotional responses, and this film had me in tears.",10,8,12,26 October 2018
Bird Box," Sorry, but too much left unanswered for me
","Something arrives out of nowhere which causes people to kill themselves. A small group board themselves up in a house and try to figure out how to survive. It isn't easy.Sandra Bullock heads a decent cast on this scifi horror which tells much of the story in flashback, by virtue of which we know that, 5 years later, Bullock and two small children are trying to escape, blindfold, in a boat. Our concern for the other survivors is therefore limited to the order in which they die.While there is nothing fundamentally wrong with this idea - which we have seen before under various guises - your enjoyment will depend on how much you need to have spelled out. In A Silent Place, the nearest recent close relative, we did at least see the fiendish thingies. Here we don't. Nor do we understand how or why their malign influence works. And these are just the biggest of the unanswered questions. We also don't know why the bad business only works outside - can't these things get inside?I'm sorry, I don't like things being quite so open ended. This good idea wasn't thought through at all, on the grounds that it didn't need to be. Some of the dialogue was good, but the story/script was horrible.",6,4,9,27 December 2018
American Pie," Smutty teen sex comedy with heart
","American Pie tells a story of four lads, about to leave High School, wanting to enjoy their last summer together, not to mention getting laid. That's about it in terms of plot - nothing terribly sophisticated or original.But the four lads and their girls are all well drawn characters, there are some very funny (if rude) set pieces, and the movie has a great deal of heart - yes, it may be smutty, but the genuine relationships between the characters carry a great deal of meaning above and beyond what might otherwise simply be tacky.It is worth singling out Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad for the funniest performance, and Alyson Hannigan for the single funniest (and most unexpected) line.And here is where I go against the flow a little. Seann William Scott delivers a brilliant performance as Stifler - obnoxious, crass, loud, overbearing, uncouth, gross. I dislike the character, as I dislike such characters which seem to have become the mainstay of American teen comedies, often being the hub around which everything rotates. By all means have such a character, but when they become the centre of attention (and, worse, become portrayed as lovable and laudable), I no longer want to hang out in their company. This is the direction the series started to follow.",8,1,1,17 April 2012
Burn After Reading," Another Coen private joke
","I have had mixed feelings about the Coen brothers for some time. For me, their movies fall into two distinct categories. There are those which I have enjoyed - Fargo, Lebowski. And there are those where I have felt that a good idea has become inaccessible to the audience (ie. me) because it is excessively dressed up in the brothers' private sense of humour (Hudsucker, O Brother).Burn After Reading joins the latter group.The idea - assorted misadventures concerning a revealing autobiography written by a disgruntled ex-CIA operative - is great, and would work as either a screwball black comedy or a thriller. Burn After Reading is clearly intended to be a comedy, but the comedy (as is so often the case with the Coens) remains somewhat inscrutable. It's like the couple of kids in your class at school who would laugh uproariously at some private joke which completely passed by everybody else.It's a shame this is so, because at least two of the performances are screamingly funny - JK Simmonds as a befuddled CIA executive and, especially, Brad Pitt as a terminally dim personal trainer. Richard Jenkins delivers a touching portrayal of a man who desperately loves Frances McDormand's character but is completely at a loss as to what to do about it, and Tilda Swinton gives us an ice queen. These performances belong in two other films - both are excellent, but neither is even slightly funny. Nor, for that matter, are the two savage on-screen killings, although I distinctly got the feeling that both are meant to be hilarious. Malkovich chews the scenery and looks like a cartoon.Which brings us to Frances McDormand. She is the central character, playing a shallow woman with tunnel vision as far as raising the money for cosmetic surgery is concerned. I like Frances McDormand, and I think she is an excellent actress, but I strongly feel that she was miscast in this movie. A fading bimbo is what was needed, and Miss McDormand is not a fading bimbo. Her marriage to Joel Coen may have had a bearing on her casting.I wish I shared the Coens' sense of humour - I would have enjoyed this more.",6,13,21,30 October 2008
The Last Legion," Decent action costume drama
","The Last Legion pleased me. It tied in to a number of things I have read or watched over the last year or so - the early life of Attila the Hun and the fall of Rome, the films about the 9th Legion which came out in 2010, Clive Owen's King Arthur movie - they all have a bearing on what takes place in this story of a small group of Roman soldiers who take the 12 year old Emperor Romulus to Britannia once Rome has fallen.This low profile film has high production values and an excellent cast - Colin Firth is the officer of the soldiers, Ben Kingsley is a druid/mentor, Aishwarya Rai is an exotic warrior maiden, and the excellent Thomas Sangster plays young Romulus, old before his time.There is a lot of action, well choreographed, and beautiful locations as well as some acceptable process photography.And, although there are a lot of battles, there is nothing very graphic and no bad language, so this is an exciting film for families to watch.",8,3,5,5 November 2010
Watchmen," Very faithful to the original
","I have loved the comic series since I first read it nearly 20 years ago in book form. I have been looking forward to this film since I saw how faithfully the first trailer reproduced some of the iconic images from the book.Was I disappointed? No, I wasn't. I really, really enjoyed the movie. It wasn't perfect - if I had to gripe, it would be with Matthew Goode who, to my eyes, never really captured the golden boy self-assurance I had always associated with Adrian Veidt - I had expected a gold and purple colour palette to be used for Ozymandias, and greys and silvers didn't quite fit. There was, perhaps, a little over-reliance on slow motion, and I didn't always feel that the music selections fitted. On the plus side, the action sequences were fine if a little violent, Jackie Early Haley was outstanding as Rorschach, the Dr Manhattan effects were perfect, and Malin Akerman was totally hot as Silk Spectre.Taking a step back, though, I'm part of the group that would be expected to enjoy this movie - fanboys who are already in love with the source material. And if I'm objective, I think I probably enjoyed the opening sequence best because it showed me something I didn't expect to see. And how will the movie appeal to those who aren't familiar with the source? People I was with said that they enjoyed it, they think, but it was really long and rather involved. Which, I suspect is fair comment.But for an ageing fanboy, it was pretty good.",9,0,5,6 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Excellent spy thriller
","The strength of The Bourne Identity is that the audience is in exactly the same position as Matt Damon's Jason Bourne throughout the movie - in complete ignorance as to exactly who Bourne is, but quietly desperate to find out. We, however, are given more information than he is, because we are given occasional glimpses into the operations of the shadowy organisation for which Bourne works, in the persons of Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Styles.This film powers along, delivering exposition, paranoia, action and excitement for its entire running length. Matt Damn is an excellent lead: he has a powerful physical presence in the action sequences, but he also conveys the low key distress of someone who is disturbed at discovering what he is capable of. Franka Potente is a believable companion, sucked into circumstances beyond her comprehension.The script is good, making a simple story into something highly textured, and the film as a whole is two hours of gripping fast-paced entertainment, a cut above the usual standard for this type of movie.",8,2,2,21 August 2010
The Italian Job," Entertaining not-a-remake
","This isn't The Italian Job (1966). That was a great film and stands on its own, no question.But this also isn't a remake. Sure, it uses some of the same elements -some characters with the same names, 3 minis, a carefully planned heist, a robbery/chase where they drive through all sorts of unexpected places, traffic chaos arising from overriding the official system etc. But all those elements are used in a completely different story to the original with completely different character dynamics.I liked it. Importantly, there was so much that was different in the story that I never felt the need to compare it to the original.Mark Wahlberg, low-rent action protagonist, was marginally less inexpressive than usual, and the rest of the cast gave reliable performances. A special mention must go to Seth Green, occupying the Benny Hill slot as official bollixer of traffic lights - a quite different character (no big ladies for a start off!) but still a very funny performance.The original is still out there, folks, and it's still great, but this version has a lot going for it - don't discount it.",7,1,1,19 May 2009
Baby Driver," Stylish
","'Baby' is a getaway driver for teams put together by crime boss Doc. He plays music on his iPod constantly in order to drown out the tinnitus which resulted from the car accident in which his parents died. He lives with his elderly, infirm, deaf foster father, and is only doing the driving until he has paid off a debt to Doc. Certain members of the crime crews have extremely negative reactions to his constant wearing headphones. When Baby falls for waitress Debora and vice versa, he decides he wants to get out of the game and run away with her. But Doc has other ideas, and hostile Bats is a complete wild card.In some respects, Baby Driver is a completely routine crime thriller, but Edgar Wright as writer and director brings a sense of style to it which we don't see very often. Given Wright's involvement with the Simon Pegg Cornetto trilogy movies, one might expect comedy here. Well, it's not nihilistically dark, but neither is it packed with laughs. But it is always involving.Baby speaks little and is ostensibly rather bland, and Ansel Elgort portrays this well. Towards the start there is an extended moving camera shot as Baby takes coffee to a planning meeting, and the movement and sound editing tell you as much about Baby's character as you need to know thus far. There is a LOT of music in this movie, and all of it well chosen. Lily James as Debora is gorgeous - I wanted to run away with her too. Kevin Spacey plays Doc as an odd mixture of mincing and paternal: it works, but it's odd. And Jamie Foxx as Bats is vile. I was very please when what happened to him happened to him.The developments towards the end aren't always what you expect, and the ending certainly isn't. But It's fair, and I liked it, and all the loose ends are nicely tied up.I enjoyed this, and it promises great things in the future from Edgar Wright.",9,1,3,9 May 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Majestic
","As a teenager in the 60s I loved Lord Of The Rings. As years went by I still had a strong affection for it, but I saw more clearly what, to me, were flaws. For instance, the set-piece battle with the Balrog ran to two pages, the Tom Bombadil episode, during which practically nothing nothing of any consequence happened, ran to more than 20! I was always one for story more than texture, as a result of which I began to feel that Tolkien had been in desperate need of an editor who would have helped him strip a flabby 1,100 page book down to a pacey, punchy 500 or so (I'm not keen on reading poems in Elvish, but I appreciate that this is my point of view, not necessarily others').So I went to see part 1 of Jackson's epic adaptation with enthusiasm and trepidation in equal measure.I heartily endorse every editorial decision made by Jackson. Tom Bombadil - gone! As a result, despite 3 hours of running time, part 1 never flags. The story moves constantly with plenty (but not too much) of character set up, back story, and narrative drive.Part 1 deals with the history of the Ring and the beginning of Frodo's journey, to Rivendell in the company of his follow Hobbit and then Aragorn, then through the mines of Moria with the Fellowship, and finally from Lothlorien up to the point where the Fellowship is split apart by an orc attack and Boromir dies.The casting is just absolutely right - every part is perfectly cast. New Zealand, as assisted by CGI tweaks, is Middle Earth. And the pace of the film is also perfect, alternating between excitement, humour, edge of your seat suspense, and interest-filled exposition.Brilliant.",10,0,0,28 April 2010
The Matrix Revolutions," I don't quite understand - or do I?
","To misquote Churchill, never was so much eye candy created by so many in pursuit of so little.The final episode of the Matric trilogy has endless sequences of octopoid sentinels whizzing around in their tens of millions being barely kept at bay by powered suits firing tens of millions of rounds of ammunition, while our chum Neo swans around being pasted by the humanised version of the Smith program, while Morpheus and Will Smith's missus try to get back to Zion.I've never seen so much overkill in one movie.Which would be fine as long as I cared, but I have by now become so distanced from these characters that I really don't care what happens to them.But there are two strong positives - one, no preposterous pretentious speech from the Architect on the scale of Matrix 2 and, two, a fabulous final confrontation between Smith and Neo.",7,0,1,4 January 2011
Man of Steel," Flawed reinterpretation
","Infant Kal-El is sent to Earth by his scientist father Jor-El as their home planet Krypton is destroyed. Found and brought up by decent farming couple Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark (as they name him) feels increasingly alienated as he begins to manifest strange abilities throughout his childhood and youth. When other surviving Kryptonians, led by zealot General Zod, seek him out, he is forced to embrace his alien heritage and fight them for the future of his adopted planet.Let's get this straight: I discovered Superman at the turn of the 1960s, my DVD shelves are creaking with Superman-related movies and TV series, and there are literally thousands of Superman comics in my house. I do not need convincing, I already belong to this particular club. It also means that I am well aware of the fact that a character who has been in serial fiction for 75 years is subject to, and can withstand, multiple reinterpretations, which are necessary as the real world changes. And let me state at the outset that I thoroughly enjoyed Zack Snyder's Man Of Steel. There was much in it which I really liked, Also there was a fair amount which I didn't so much like as was prepared to tolerate. And there were several plate-sized chunks which I didn't like at all. Not one bit.Starting with what I liked, I felt the origin sequences were well done, I liked the fact that Clark became Superman because he was forced into it (reactive rather than active), I liked the fact - spoiler! - that Lois knew who he was right from the start (even though that goes so strongly against canon, it seemed organic and natural). I thought Krypton was well realised, and I enjoyed finally seeing what happens when two people with God-like powers have at it. I liked most of the casting, and I loved Michael Shannon's Zod: impassioned and single-minded, and so much better than Terence Stamp's spaced-out hippie in PVC fetish clothing.I was OK with Superman's trunks-less onesie (although see comments later), and I was OK with the story being essentially the origin followed by the Superman II showdown updated to present day with modern effects.Now to things which I didn't like.1. Much as I like Amy Adams, her Lois Lane did little for me, and had no chemistry with Henry Cavill's Kal/Clark/Superman.2. I didn't like the camera-work. Most of the action was filmed with hand-held close-ups, and it was often difficult to register what was going on. I understand the use of hand-held camera-work to establish immediacy, but I found myself crying out for tripod-based medium and long shots so that I could actually see what was going on during the incredibly noisy action sequences. I wanted to see, and couldn't. Snyder can deliver visuals, and has done so much better than he did here.3. I am a 3D fan, and the 3D was completely useless.4. I thought Cavill was good, but there are elements of Superman - humanity, humility, nobility - which weren't really captured, but I suspect that was more the script than Cavill. This goes as deep as the fact that the film eagerly embraced something which (with the exception of John Byrne's misconceived pocket universe episode) the comics have eschewed apart from the very early days: Superman and Batman do not kill. Ever. They Find Another Way.5. More than anything, I deplore the Nolanisation of Superman. I know it is difficult to argue with the box office success of the Dark Knight trilogy, but Superman is not the same as Batman. Where Batman is night, Superman should be day, where Batman is dark, Superman should be light, where Batman reflects hopelessness, Superman should reflect hope (as specifically acknowledged in this movie). Batman can successfully take on a grim and gritty reality-based presentation: grim and gritty reality simply does not suit the man of steel. Snyder is quoted as saying that they tried to use the red trunks but couldn't make them work, yet they worked perfectly well in all the earlier films. But the rooting of the thing in reality meant that the trunks - a small element of iconography - had to go. And that aspect of this interpretation lies behind so much of what displeased me.This film, for me, held no 'Yes!' moments on a par with previous iterations (compare this with The Avengers, which was full of them). It had no heart and no joy (compare this with The Avengers, which was full of both). I repeat: I enjoyed it and will happily see it again - many times, I suspect - and I look forward to the sequel. But, ultimately, I confess to being disappointed.",7,7,13,19 June 2013
Grease," Good but flawed
","Australian nice girl Sandy has a summer holiday romance with Danny, and ends up going to the same high school, to their mutual surprise, only to find that peer pressure leads Danny to be a crass sexist rather than the nice lad she had encountered. The scool year features many irrelevant digressions - car remodelling, a televised dance contest, a pregnancy scare, a hotrod race - before Sandy disovers that the way to her man's heart is to dress like a slut and start smoking.Grease tops tge cgarts for a l9t of people. I undestand why - it has some great musical numbers, well staged, and some winning from performanes from, especially, John, Travolta, Stockard Channing, and Eve Arden. But i find it flawed.One, this high school teenagers are all, obviously, at least a decade older than the characters they are playing. Two, Oliver, Newton and John is both lovely and sexy, sings prettily and dances competently, but doesn't command the screen in the same way her co-star does. Three, the film delivers a mixed message. It shows us both wholesome purity and slutty promiscuity, and seems to endorse and deplore both. Colour me confused, ditto any teen trying to use this film as a route map to negotiate a way through those difficult years of sexual uncertaintty. Four, the episodic digressions which comprise the centre of tye film are barely, if at all, linked to the central Danny/Sandy plot.The mus8c remains great fun, though.",8,1,3,14 February 2019
28 Weeks Later," This is 'Either' or it's 'Or'
","I assume you're in the market for zombie flicks generally - probably already checked out 28 Days Later and liked it - so I don't have to sell you on the general principle.Fine. Then this one stands or falls on the extent to which you are able to ignore the massive - and I do mean massive - number of illogicalities and plot holes. These all exist in order to set up 'moments', and the really irritating thing is that they are almost all unnecessary. A little bit of intelligent re-writing would, in all cases, have dealt with these plot holes.Personally, I didn't mind that much - I kind of re-wrote in my head as I went along.Rose Byrne and Jeremy Renner were fine. Carlyle was fine until he turned, but I don't suppose zombie acting requires much subtlety. The boy really should have had a haircut, I thought he was a girl pretty nearly the whole way through.",6,0,1,28 March 2010
Cast Away," Survival
","This is a film about survival. Having survived a plane crash, the plane sinking, and being cast adrift in towering stormy seas, the next stage of Chuck Noland's survival is the basic Robinson Crusoe problem of keeping the 'body' part of body and soul together - solving the problems of not starving or dying of thirst, and of being sheltered from inhospitable elements.This film shows us those trials and tribulations, but also makes it clear that Noland had difficulties just as great with the 'soul' part of body and soul. He survived this (barely - suicide was not only considered but rehearsed) with the help of three psychological crutches. One was his companion Wilson, the volleyball which he turned into his constant companion and confidante. The second was the preservation of one unopened FedEx package - as long as that package remained there to be delivered, Noland held on to a reason for surviving. And the third was the thought of returning to Kelly Frears, the fiancée who was waiting for his return.In the event, of course, his engagement to Kelly didn't survive. But even the demise of that engagement was something else for him to survive.This film struck a good balance between true life adventure, action spectacle, and human drama. Hanks is always good, and Cast Away was substantially better than the sentimental drivel of Forrest Gump, his previous collaboration with Zemeckis.I watched it with my wife and 24-year old son (who, unusually, sat in the same room with us to watch TV), and all three of us thoroughly enjoyed this film",8,0,0,17 April 2008
The Thing," Excellent update
","John Carpenter takes Howard Hawks seminal science fiction tale about the remote polar research station beset by an alien invasion (by which I mean invasion by an alien) and updates it from the 50s to the 80s - in colour, some genuinely low temperatures, and some state of the art mechanical effects rather than James Arness in a rubber carrot costume.It's pretty good. The sense of claustrophobia and paranoia is well generated and maintained, the performances are all good (and Kurt Russell is an excellent lead), and the effects are imaginative, shocking, and extremely well executed.Remakes often fall short of the originals: this one surpasses its predecessor by a clear margin.",8,2,5,21 April 2011
Lilo & Stitch," Odd but good
","This odd story of a potentially dangerous (but cute) alien being adopted by a small Hawaiian girl is possibly the least Disney-like of all that studio's traditionally animated features. It was also miles away from the cutesy preconceptions I had from the promotional artwork.Which isn't to say that it doesn't have its cutesy elements, of course. But there is a distinctly dark leaning in the arcs of its two main character - the girl Lilo, dealing with the deaths of her parents and possibly being wrenched away from her sister's guardianship, and the alien Stitch, bred to be destructive, learning the value of family, and constantly trying to evade the forces trying to recapture him.I was delighted to view a Disney animated feature which was so far away from what I expected, and which was still entertaining, amusing, and full of heart.A good family film. I really enjoyed it.",8,2,2,21 March 2010
Armageddon," Get out that popcorn
","One of two more or less simultaneous movies about saving the earth from disaster by meteor strike by means of heroic space shuttle crews blasting the thing to bits (there's another one of those amazing Hollywood coincidences), Armageddon adopts the space option as opposed to Deep Impact's emphasis on domestic drama. Having said that, Armageddon also factors in a rather limp love sub-plot between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.This thing has a great cast, vast amounts of eye candy (in terms of decent effects), non-stop action powering the thing along, Bruce Willis doing what Bruce Willis does best, a complete disregard for many of the laws of physics, and a desperate need for its audience to park their brains in neutral, break out the popcorn, and enjoy the ride.I enjoyed the ride!",7,0,3,9 January 2013
The Village," Oh, spoilery spoilery spoiler
","I'm spoilering right from the start here, so get over it.There's this village, see, and you're supposed to think it's late 19th century - they all talk old fashioned and don't have any technology. Oh, and they are apparently isolated by Things We Don't Talk About which live in the woods, with whom they have an uneasy truce. Taciturn Lucius wants to visit the towns for medicines. He gets engaged to blind Ivy, only to be stabbed by nutjob Noah. Ivy is deputed to set off through the woods to get medicine.The big shock moment - this is M Night Shyamalan, remember - is when Ivy nearly gets run down by a truck: this is actually present day, and the isolation is because the Elders decided to keep their loved ones safe by creating this remote community. And the menacey things are to scare everyone into staying put.On the plus side, this is moderately atmospheric, has a mild sense of menace, the shock moment works fairly well the first time you see it, and there are some very good performances (notably Adrien Brody as mad idiot Noah).On the negative side, it takes an age to get moving, the shock moment doesn't stand up to repeat viewings, and one wonders too often about things like where they get the oil for lamps from.I find myself wondering if I would have made the same comments following a first viewing, and if I hadn't been exposed to the diminishing returns from Shyamalan's movies in the meantime.",6,1,2,30 June 2012
The Revenant," Brilliant but flawed
","Trapper and guide, Hugh Glass, while guiding the survivors of a party decimated in an Indian attack, is mauled by a bear and left for dead while his son is killed. Glass struggles to survive in an incredibly hostile environment, so that he can return to exact retribution on Fitzgerald, who killed his son.I have mixed feelings about this visceral but beautiful movie. Directed by Alejando Inarritu, it shows, if anything, even more directorial flamboyance than his Oscar-winning Birdland, and is undoubtedly less likely to divide opinion quite as markedly. The opening sequence of the Indian attack is staggeringly well filmed, in lengthy unbroken shots where the camera makes movements which seem impossible. The movie is a feast for the eyes - the scenery is spectacular, the action is brilliantly choreographed and photographed, the special effects are astonishing (you can't see where they finish and reality ends) – and, all the time, the camera is endlessly prowling around and through the action. Every second on screen shows what a challenging shoot this was.But there are flaws. At over two and a half hours, it is at least half an hour too long – Glass' wilderness wandering could usefully have been trimmed down. And demanding shoot or not, DiCaprio's almost dialogue-less performance is more grimacing than acting. Tom Hardy sounds authentic but largely incomprehensible as Fitzgerald. Inarritu is far too fond of shots of the sky up through pine trees – the first one was gorgeous, the 21st smacked of 'Get on with it.' The payback on the kidnapped Indian girl is muddled from a story point of view. Frankly, I didn't believe Glass would have survived: not just the bear attack, but the repeated soakings for extended periods in freezing water. And the film is very dark and desaturated, a trend which I have lost patience with.It is definitely worth seeing, but I don't think I'm that keen on seeing it again soon.",8,3,7,15 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Solid in all departments
","It is 1957, and commercial lawyer James Donovan is required to defend spy Rudolf Abel, which he does (unsuccessfully). When US spy pilot Gary Powers is shot down by the Russians, Donovan is called upon to negotiate an exchange, into which he factors US student Frederic Pryor in a 2-for-1 exchange. But Powers is held by the Russians and Pror is held by the East Germans, and they don't have the same agendas.Steven Spielberg picks up the hidden parts of a story which had disappeared under the headline value of Gary Powers Shot Down, and it turns out to be quite a small story, but displayed on a big canvas (the painting metaphor is apt, as Abel's painting forms part of the film's narrative). The film conjures up its era very well – the comfort of 1950s USA vs the grim drabness of Berlin, the USA paranoia over the red menace, the communist paranoia over everything. And, among the efficient and effective telling of the story (aided by a script touch-up from the Coen brothers), there are the usual Spielbergian directorial flourishes, primarily some wonderful moving camera shots. This is not an attractive film – post-war Berlin was not an attractive city – but it is never less than rewarding to watch.Tom Hanks does a sterling job as the deceptively mild but steely Donovan, and Mark Rylance's Abel is similar to his Thomas Cromwell: a watcher and a listener, with quiet depths.This is not a film full of bluster and bombast, but it is an impressive and gripping movie.",8,2,5,27 November 2015
Pitch Black," Them Aussies have got something!
","'I know! How about doing a science fiction horror movie in Australia with a leading man who has only ever done bit parts, and a supporting cast of mostly unknowns?' 'What a great idea! When do we start?' If the concept was less than promising, the execution more than made up for it. An accident crashes a spaceship on an apparently barren planet, leaving less than a dozen survivors. One of these is convicted mass murderer Riddick who is being transported to pay for his crimes. It turns out that the planet is just about to enter a period of sustained and total night, which is when thousands of pterodactyl-like blind predators emerge. Fortunately - perhaps - Riddick's eyes have been modified to allow him to stay in the dark.Of course, this is yet another take on the 'last man standing' theme, but with some nice wrinkles. The scenario is original, there are some interesting characters, and the uncertainty over exactly where Riddick stands adds its own tension to the considerable tension generated by the survivors' plight. There are some powerful performances, particularly from Radha Mitchell, and Vin Diesel in his first leading role, oozes charisma, not to mention silky menace. The critters are memorable and the effects overall are excellent.Only one thing mars the movie slightly - what do the critters eat on the desert planet when they can't get stranded spacefarers?",8,4,6,27 April 2010
Split," Shyamalamadingdong regains some credibility
","Odd-girl-out Claire and two classmates are kidnapped by Kevin, host to multiple personalities. Can they escape, or enlist the help of one or more of McAvoy's personalities, before The Beast arrives. Does The Beast even exist?This claustrophobic suspense thriller clatters along very satisfactorily in its own right - the girls, held prisoner by someone who is clearly very wrong in the head, have to overcome tearful hysteria and try to find a way out of their predicament before the much-heralded Beast arrives, a story which has its own self-contained clock ticking away. The girls are pleasingly hysterical - Claire, who has her own secrets, less so - but turn their attentions to problem-solving, and you root for them to find a way out of the trap they are in. Shyamalan's writing here works well after a number of clunkers.Then we have to factor in James McAvoy's performance/s as 8 or so of the two dozen multiple personalities. If I am ruthlessly critical, a couple of those are a bit on the obvious side. However, given that these are by far the most entertaining personalities - the audience was laughing out loud at Hedwig's dancing - and that they contrast so well with their far more sinister confederates, I think this can be forgiven.This is McAvoy's film. He holds the screen effortlessly whenever he is in front of the camera, and much of the film's effectiveness comes from not knowing who he is going to be next.Which is not to dismiss the girls. All are excellent, but I continue to be excited by Anya Taylor-Joy: after The Witch and Morgan, this role is a departure which, again, suits the off-kilter intensity she projects so well.And the final throwaway scene was an utter delight.",8,1,2,15 May 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Dark, low on story - and excellent
","While I don't intend to spoiler plot, I daresay I may spoiler a number of bits and pieces. So beware.The final HP book becomes a two-part movie, the first part of which is notable for the fact that not a single bit of it takes part at Hogwarts. The overall tone is full of foreboding, and rightly so - Voldemort is winning, well and truly, and Harry, the only hope for the forces of good, is forced on the run. This sense of foreboding is cemented right at the start by a short scene where Hermione wipes every trace of her own existence from her parents' life for their protection - a moment of such desperate sadness that it tells you how high the stakes are before anything else happens (just in case you had forgotten Dumbledore's death at the end of Half-Blood Prince).There is a lot of action in this film, but not much story actually happens, and it doesn't have much of a plot of its own. This was one of the joys of the earlier books/films - each had a solid story and it wasn't until several volumes in that you came to appreciate that you were seeing episodes in a much larger story. Well, that larger story is approaching its climax, but rather slowly.Having said that, the film always holds your attention, perhaps because there is some long overdue depth offered to the developing relationships between the three principals. Given that the three are thrown together for an extended sequence simply staying out of sight of Voldemort's faction, this perhaps inevitable. This sequence, which dragged quite badly in the novel, actually works well on screen, and Radcliffe, Watson and Grint all acquit themselves well. Again, one can hardly take one's eyes off Watson, and it is good to see Grint given a bit more to do than his usual comedy double takes while looking gormless.In among the general darkness there are some genuinely creepy and upsetting moments, as well as a couple of moments which make you realise that these kids are now young adults.Almost all previous surviving character cast members (with the notable exception of Maggie Smith) put in appearances, and I was struck by how perfectly cast these movies have been.For a film which has, probably, less story than any of its predecessors, I enjoyed it more than most of them.",8,2,4,24 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Good, but didn't really grab me
","I went into this without enthusiasm. I quite liked its predecessor but it left no lasting impression - this may be because Jack Black simply doesn't do anything for me (although I do prefer him when I can't see him).I found 2 rather better. Firstly, Po is now a bona fide hero and doesn't have to go through the tiresome passage of personal growth which defined the first movie. This time the personal growth element concerns searching for his roots (turns out Mr Ping isn't Po's natural father - who knew?). Plus we have a villain with a nefarious plot, so there is a fair amount of drama and action as well as some heartwarming moments.This is a pretty good film which the kids will love.I found that, in common with so many movies these days, the action went so fast that it was difficult to follow. And I had great hopes for the 3D - so often better in CGI features than live action - but it mostly made no difference.",7,0,1,7 July 2011
Little Miss Sunshine," A quirk of genius
","The Hoover family is having problems, and the word 'dysfunctional' is woefully inadequate. Mom Sheryl is trying to hold it together, but her brother has just been released into her care following a depression- suicide attempt, son Dwayne hasn't spoken to anyone for a year as part of some teenage nonsense, Grandpa Edwin is an irascible old devil who is a poor example to his grandchildren, and Dad Richard delivers poorly-attended self-improvement seminars (which he then also inflicts on his family) for a company which is just about to fire him. And youngest daughter Olive has, unlikely as it may seem (because she is not especially talented or beautiful), obtained a place in the final of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. So, obviously, a road trip is on the cards. What could possibly go wrong? The set-up hardly seems ripe for comedy development, yet this character-driven drama is often very funny. It is also frequently very moving (sometimes to the extent that you're in tears) and delivers a very clear message - just because you're dysfunctional doesn't mean you don't love one another.The first-rate cast are all excellent in this well-written, well-acted ensemble piece. It frequently goes in unexpected directions, and is perhaps a little swearier than it needs to be but, ultimately, it leaves you uplifted and with a sense of hope.",10,1,1,31 October 2016
Knowing," Thoughtful disaster movie (and then some)
","Physicist Nicolas Cage's son brings home a page covered in numbers from his school's time capsule 50 years earlier. Cage works out that the numbers give details of dates, locations and numbers of dead for disasters over the last 50 years ie. they are predictions. And there are three left which haven't happened yet....That is pretty much what you get from the trailer, and I wouldn't want to say too much more, because what follows is not entirely what I expected. What I will see is that the movie always keeps your interest up, that there are some developments which aren't entirely what you might expect, and that the conclusion is satisfying.There are some interesting metaphysical and philosophical issues raised early on, but never fully addressed.There are some unanswered questions (what is the point of the black stones? Does the son's partial deafness have any significance beyond being a justification for the sign language near the end?), but any minor irritation caused by them is more than made up for by the plane crash at about the halfway mark. This isn't a surprise if you've seen the trailers, but it is stunningly well done - completely convincing and absolutely terrifying.This is a well-made, entertaining and engaging film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8,2,5,26 March 2009
Coriolanus," Excellent contemporary reading
","Shakespeare's play concerns a victorious Roman general, betrayed and banished from Rome, who joins the Volscians, his former opponents, until he is prevailed upon (by his mother and wife) to make peace between the two sides, following which he is killed by the Volscians.Ralph Fiennes directs and stars as Coriolanus in this film of the play, where Shakespeare's dialogue is delivered in a modern setting wherein the Roman/Volscian war has been transposed to the Balkans. A bleak piece, and less well known than Shakespeare's other darker plays, the modern setting suits it: if anything, it makes the archaisms in the dialogue more accessible.Fiennes' direction is gritty, and all the performances are excellent, though Fiennes himself and Vanessa Redgrave stand out.This film works well as both a contemporary action drama, and also culture!",8,9,14,27 January 2012
Hugo," A game of two halves
","Let me divide my comments into two sections - Content and Execution - and start with the latter.This is one of the most superbly executed films I have ever seen. Production design is amazing - it evokes its own self-contained universe of time and space unlike any other film I have seen. Scorsese's Gangs Of New York did a similar thing, but Hugo has an air of otherworldliness all of its own. Scorsese's use of the camera is stunning, and his use of 3D is even better - here is the only director other than Cameron (so far) who understands that 3D can be both a tool for storytelling and also an artistic addition to the director's toolbox. The 3D work here truly adds a dimension to what is on screen. It goes without saying that performances are excellent, but the two youngsters who carry the film are top notch. Scorsese's mastery over what appears on screen is total.Now we come to content, and here is where the film falters. The story of an orphaned boy, surviving in a Paris railway station post WWI by keeping the clocks running (in the face of a hostile security Inspector and also a toy shop proprietor from whom he thieves mechanical parts) so that he can mend an automaton which he hopes will give him a clue about his father, is a promising one. It has the virtue of not heading in any of the anticipated directions. Unfortunately, the direction it does head in - a love letter to the birth of the cinema - doesn't easily sit with the story up to that point. And, while it looks good, it doesn't engage the viewer in the same way - I never really felt there was anything very much at stake.So Hugo is definitely worth seeing - and I recommend seeing it in 3D - but it falls some way short of being the totally satisfying experience it starts out as.",7,1,3,4 December 2011

","This third entry in the Terminator series finishes off Arnold Schwarzenegger's involvement, and also brings the Skynet/Judgement Day story full circle. It turns out that the destruction of the Terminator chip at the end of Terminator 2 did not put Skynet off trying to terminate John Connor: nor did it stop Judgement Day, it simply delayed it. Back comes another Terminator (this model emulates an attractive young woman, Kristanna Loken), and back comes another Schwarzenegger Terminator to act as protector again. John Conner (played here by Nick Stahl) is living a hobo-type existence off the radar. Sarah is dead from cancer, and vet Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) gets caught up in the running and trying to escape (it turns out that her involvement is very much not the accident it appears to be.This film is much more of a romp than 1 and 2, with some elements definitely played for laughs (the reappearance of Earl Boen's psychiatrist Dr Silberman, for instance). The action is excellent, with some terrific set pieces, and all the principals please although I could have done with vet Kate being a little bit less shrieky and hysterical, not that I blame her.This film is undoubtedly good, solid, action fun. But it doesn't have the 'Wow' factor which its predecessors had.",Null,1,2,2 October 2011
The Shining," Equivocation
","This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.If I do my absolute best to put the book out of my mind, I suppose that the film must be acknowledged as a tolerable horror, with two major flaws - one, it's overlong, and what should be a slow burn loaded with increasing dread becomes simply boring, and two, Jack Nicholson's established screen persona means that there is absolutely no suspense in his development from decent though flawed father/husband to scenery-chewing maniac - the final madness is there from the first frame he appears in.If you've never read the book and you're a horror fan, then you'll probably enjoy it - no huge surprises, but it ticks most of the boxes. And it looks very good.But what a missed opportunity! Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film about a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel. Stephen King's The Shining is a novel about an evil entity which inhabits a hotel, and which wants to consume a boy's psychic power: the boy is strong enough to resist it, so it works on the weakest link, the father, and gradually erodes everything which made him a good, decent man. Jack's transition from the decent though weak man he starts out as, to the point where the Overlook is in control of his every action, is absolutely central to Stephen King's The Shining, and it could only have worked on screen if Jack was portrayed by an actor who was initially credible as a decent, gentle man. Not Nicholson - I love him, but he was (in my view) a spectacular piece of miscasting for this movie. Picture Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, or someone similar, and how dramatic and shocking their descent to axe-wielding maniachood would have been.The contrast is essential to Stephen King's story: with Nicholson, there was no contrast.It is also worth commenting that King's The Shining is about a man who loves his family: Kubrick's The Shining is stated, by the screenwriter in one of the DVD documentaries, to be about a man who hates his family. A fairly fundamental difference, yes?Ah well. 'What if's never got us anywhere. Go and see Stanley Kubrick's The Shining anyway, and enjoy Jack Nicholson chewing scenery. The scenery's pretty good eye candy and, besides, he does it so well.",5,3,8,14 January 2008
"I, Robot"," Very successful
","This film delivered more than I expected.I was expecting to enjoy it - I like Will Smith, I like CGI sci-fi extravaganzas, and I enjoyed the Asimov stories (although I expected them to be cordially sidelined).I was pleasantly surprised by a number of elements I wasn't expecting.I wasn't expecting the Laws of Robotics to be such a large plot element, nor for them to be respected in the way they were.I wasn't expecting Smith to deliver a character of such depth, nor for that character (and the reasons for it) to impact on the plot to the extent it did.I wasn't expecting a character so well realised - conception, design, execution, voice performance - as Sunny was.And I wasn't expecting such a solid detective story.This was a very meaty, pleasing movie.",9,1,2,2 May 2010
The Alamo," Nicely detailed
","A small number of Texans defend the Alamo against invading Mexicans, buying time for Sam Houston's army.This retelling of the Alamo makes efforts to be historically accurate (John Wayne's 1960 version, by contrast, was more interested in the myth). It is dark and dirty, and the three key characters among the defenders - Travis, Bowie and Crocket - are far more conflicted and flawed than their earlier equivalents. And in many ways that is a good thing, because the nobility they display in their doomed defence is all the more striking by virtue of its contrast.It's also worth saying that the action sequences are well staged, and the performances are all very good. The negative reviews on IMDb aren't wholly deserved.",8,1,1,31 January 2016
Wanted," Dumb fun
","Based on comics by Mark Millar and JG Jones which I had never heard of, Wanted tells of a put-upon wimp (James McAvoy) who discovers that he is the son of a member of a league of assassins called The Fraternity who can do such amazing things as shooting bullets round corners. In very short order he is trained up by fellow assassin Angelina Jolie, on the instructions of Fraternity head Morgan Freeman, to pursue and kill the man who killed his father. This involves various savage beatings for reasons which are never wholly clear, and some trainee junior level assassinations based on targets identified from binary characters coded into fabric woven by an automatic loom which has been functioning for 1,000 years since The Fraternity was a Guild of Weavers. I think - that bit didn't make a vast amount of sense.Let's be honest, the whole thing didn't make a whole lot of sense. But maybe it wasn't meant to. Maybe it was meant to be a vehicle for the several eye-popping Matrix-style action set pieces. Put brain on hold and accept the improbable elements as they come along, and you'll like it just fine.Morgan Freeman does his elder statesman bit, Angelina Jolie does a variation on Lara Croft, Terence Stamp pops in momentarily as zoned out as usual, and James McAvoy proves that he can hold centre stage in an action movie as convincingly as everything else he does.The action is great, and there are some laughs too. It's not a classic - it's far too dumb for that - but it's a perfectly satisfactory popcorn movie.",7,7,16,25 June 2008
Warrior," The drama is good, don't know so much about this MMA stuff
","Warrior is set in the world of MMA - that stands for Mixed Martial Arts, apparently. Heaven only knows what the rules are, other than that there don't seem to be any. It ends up with a knockout tournament for a $5 million prize.However, it turns out that this is no more than a hook on which to hang a tale of two brothers (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton), estranged in their teens by virtue of an abusive alcoholic father (Nick Nolte), and his attempts to re-connect with them. In some respects, this is all a bit soap opera, yet these three people come across as real people, with credible problems and behaviour, and you care about them. The film is at its best when dealing with the family drama.Having said that, the action is well presented, and visceral, and the performances are all good. I find Nolte's croaky delivery increasingly difficult to understand, but he is unquestionably very good here, as are Hardy and Edgerton. In fact, the film fails only at the end when the result of the final bout of the tournament is used as the end, leaving too many plot threads unresolved.",Null,1,5,22 September 2011
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Solid fun for the youngsters
","You don't need to have seen Madagascar 1, which is just as well, because I haven't. There is a recap at the start which also adds in some essential information about Alex the Lion, which pays off much earlier in the film than expected.This movie is big, loud, colourful fun. There is little of substance, but a lot of quite good (though superficial) laughs. The character design is great, the film often looks quite beautiful, the voice cast all perform well (Alec Baldwin, in particular, sounds as if he's having a ball as the villain of the piece), and there is quite enough plot to carry things along.There's no message of any great significance (unless inter-species romance carries some sort of subliminal subtext which I missed), which is actually something of a relief.Incidentally, if they make any more of these, then the titles are going to become increasingly misleading: only the very start of this one is set on Madagascar! The six year old next to me laughed raucously quite often, and so did I. So that's a recommendation from both of us!",7,1,3,11 December 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," An observation
","With nearly 650 reviews at this point, I haven't read them all so I may be repeating something which has been said elsewhere (although I haven't spotted it among the pages I've sampled).I liked the way Cameron didn't so much repeat the first film as echo it - there were many places where something from the original showed up again, but in a different context, making a different point, driving the plot forward.I liked the way that the gradual role reversal from the first film (Reese strong and supportive, Sarah weak and helpless at the start, exactly reversed by the end) was echoed in the relationship between Sarah and John.Which is why I was particularly surprised at the garage scene with the learning chip being cut from the release print - not only does it illuminate several points which follow it and which don't make sense otherwise, it is also the pivotal moment when John assumes the dominant role in his relationship with his mother which, in turn, echoes the moment in the first film when Sarah starts protecting Kyle rather than vice versa.And another vote in favour of the groundbreaking effects, particularly the way they served the story rather than becoming the reason for it.",10,4,5,4 October 2007
Salt," Hokum
","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a CIA agent. We find out early on that she may be a double agent, when she is identified as such by Russian agent Orlov. But might she be a triple agent? It seems her immediate boss Winter (Liev Schreiber) is on her side, but the Internal Affairs-type bloke Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has it in for her, so she is fighting pursuit from her own people as she goes on the run.This espionage nonsense has a plot which is not so much incoherent as improbable, and is a bit too frantic for its own good - the large part of its running length is devoted to chases. The story has a couple of beats which weren't quite what I expected - welcome enough,but they didn't make it any more believable. Though the action sequences are mostly fun, there was stuff which was, frankly, ludicrous (the lift shaft descent springs to mind), and the whole thing came over as rather dour.This film passed the time adequately, but did no more than that.",6,2,6,25 August 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Good parody
","I find myself enjoying Judd Apatow movies despite myself, and this one is no exception.It is an affectionate trawl through the rock'n'roll years, touching base with all the high profile points which following a Johnny Cash-type character. Most of the spoofing is spot on, the gags are funny, the running gags all work, and...The songs are all good and, when they are pastiches, the pastiching is accurate and affectionate.Oh, and John C Reilly is a revelation in a brilliant singing and acting performance.Very enjoyable.",7,0,0,30 March 2010
We're the Millers," Unsavoury but funny
","Small-time drug dealer Dave is forced to smuggle a large quantity of drugs into the USA from Mexico. In order to provide a convincing false identity by masquerading as a normal holidaying family in a camper van, he recruits stripper Rose as his wife, and homeless teen Casey and idiot neighbour Kenny as his children. The problem is that none of the four is ideally suited to playing the part of a normal family member and, when they get involved with another holidaying family whose Dad is a Drug Enforcement Agency operative, things get a little tricky.This film - which features a lot of bad language which may, or may not, have a bearing on your enjoyment, is morally questionable but quite likable nevertheless. There is some enjoyable dialogue, a good plot, nice character development arcs, and good playing by the principals, Will Poulter especially.I enjoyed this.",7,0,1,26 January 2016
Disturbia," Decent re-imagining of Rear Window
","This isn't a bad movie.It's not a quick movie to get your juices flowing - the first half to two-thirds deals with the set-up at a fairly leisurely pace - but the climax sets a high level of tension of the 'killer in the house' variety.Shia LeBoeuf as the youngster under house arrest does very well in portraying the decent lad adversely affected by his father's death: he does less well in giving us the kid who is paranoid about the next door neighbour - we never really feel the conflict between his genuine concerns and the appearance of paranoia to others.David Morse is able to portray downright evil as easily as he plays sympathetic second-string leads, and he does so here.Sarah Roemer makes a confident and attractive young lead in only her third film.And the house arrest scenario is a good updating alternative to the original Rear Window.",7,1,3,27 February 2009
The Patriot," Not everyone has background knowledge
","Me, I'm not bothered - a piece of colourful escapist nonsense. A popcorn movie, as the producers say. As a Brit in his 50s, the substantial liberties taken with history don't keep me awake at night, because I realise they are simply dramatic licence.Then I find myself in 'discussion' on a website - to do with popular music, nothing to do with film - with a young American gentleman, and a jocular remark suddenly sends him off on a tirade, the gist of which is that he hates the British because of the atrocities we committed during the War of Independence, and he knows this to be the case because he saw it for himself when he watched The Patriot.OK, so the lad is clearly a bit lacking in the Education Department, and has been even more substantially short-changed in the Common Sense Department, but that doesn't change the fact that he - and, presumably, a not inconsiderable number of others like him - have taken this pile of poo on board as fact.I don't know what the answer is. Better education? More responsible film-making? Cull the dimwits? (I'm allowed to make this suggestion, after all, I'm a Brit and you know the sort of evil murderous thugs we are - just watch The Patriot!)Answers on a postcard.",4,12,22,4 March 2008
Edward Scissorhands," Demented but touching
","I have very mixed feelings about Tim Burton. Having seen nearly all his films, I am starting to come to the conclusion that, very often, there is a great deal less to them than meets the eye. Admittedly there is usually a lot to meet the eye, but I suspect that this may lure the easily influenced (and I count myself among them) into mistaking eye candy for substance.Edward Scissorhands, like most of Burton's films, has an extremely distinctive look to it, and one must give credit to the production design, from the dark Gothic tone of Edward's origin and big house on the hill, to the stylised bright pastels of the estate below, Edward's own unique visual aspect, the film never looks anything less than striking.The story is a demented little fable. It doesn't stand up to critical scrutiny, but it wasn't really intended to. It illustrates a broad (and obvious) moral but is otherwise simply there to provide a vehicle for a number of cinematic 'moments'. Some of these are simply fun - the discovery of Edward's tonsorial talents, puncturing the water bed etc. - but a couple of them are real Moments, destined to feature on my personal list of cinema's Top 50 Greatest Moments. One of these is Vincent Price's brilliant performance in his final film, full of gentle power and compassion. And the other is, of course, the final reveal in Winona Ryder's closing bookend, where Danny Elfman's best ever musical cue hikes the emotional stakes up to unbearability level.Not the classic it might appear to be at first sight, but with more than enough plus points to make it well worth catching.",7,0,1,4 June 2010
Silver Linings Playbook," I loved it
","Pat (Bradley Cooper) comes home to find his teacher wife having a shower with another teacher, who Pat promptly beats to a pulp. Eight months later, Pat is discharged from mental hospital - complete with restraining order - into the care of his mother, having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the meantime. All is clearly not well with him, however: there is clear evidence that his grip on reality and reason is not always all that it could be, because he remains tightly focused on being reunited with the wife who has the restraining order on him (we also see that Pat's OCD father (Robert De Niro) may well be the source of some of Pat's problems). Into his life comes Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman recently widowed and with obvious issues of her own in terms of dealing with the depression caused by her grief. A quid pro quo develops: Tiffany will act as a mailbox for letters between Pat and wife, and Pat will be a dancing partner for Tiffany for a contest she has entered as therapy.This film does not tidily fit into a category: it is essentially a drama, though with romantic and comedic elements. And it has a couple of fairly severe flaws. The bet which fuels the third act is pretty obviously no more than a dramatic device to raise the stakes in the dance contest and has a distinct whiff of improbability about it, and the ending appears inconsistent with the attitudes of the protagonists. These are both fairly serious criticisms to level at a film which takes itself seriously, nowithstanding its comedic elements.And I didn't care. I liked this film very much indeed. It plays fair with the mental problems suffered by Pat and Tiffany: while drawing humour from them, they are never the butt of insensitive jokes. Bradley Cooper makes Pat believable, and Jennifer Lawrence is heart-achingly poignant as Tiffany (she is also sizzlingly sexy, particularly in the final dance, but that's merely a bonus). You always want these two damaged people to find, in each other, the means to achieve a measure of happiness, and you are never 100% sure whether the film will take you there by the end or not.And if the film leaves you pondering the relative merits of consistency versus satisfaction, well so what?",9,4,8,30 November 2012
Van Helsing," Fun, geddit?
","Of all the different genres in the world of movies, fantasy is the one which should never take itself too seriously. When it does it becomes incredibly po-faced, and the old enjoyability quotient reduces exponentially.Van Helsing remembers, throughout every second of its running time, that it is supposed to be fun. From the opening sequence, which joyously and wittily, references the Universal horrors of the 30s and 40s, through to the final riding into the sunset, the movie is simply an adventurous romp.It makes great use of CGI and has enjoyable performances from all the principals (though Richard Roxburgh is perhaps miscast as Dracula). David Wenham's droll monk is a particular delight, and Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's monster delivers the same dignity and gravitas as Karloff did all those years ago.This movie is great fun and should not be taken too seriously.",8,1,2,4 August 2009
Divergent," OK, but nicked wholesale from elsewhere
","In post-apocalyptic Chicago, the Sorting Hat puts Katniss Everdeen in Slytherin, not Griffindor.This film, which appeared in the UK with no pre-publicity at all, no trailers, nothing, is apparently based on the first of a trilogy of Young Adult novels, which is curious for what is clearly - given cast and production values - a Major Motion Picture.The good news is that it is quite nicely realised - a good budget, solid production values on screen (some nice eye candy), good and well-delivered action, a strong cast, and a pleasing central performance from Shailene Woodley as Katniss. Sorry, 'Triss'.The bad news is that is so busy trying to emulate the Hunger Games and Harry Potter transposed into a cookie-cutter post-apocalyptic dystopian scenario that it often forgets to be its own thing. I know my synopsis above was somewhat sarcastic, but I honestly sat there thinking 'This bit's from Hunger Games. This bit's from Harry Potter. Oh, Hunger Games again.' This is a very derivative piece which hasn't worked hard enough to forge its own identity (or hide its sources, if the two are not the same). Which may explain the lack of publicity.Oh, and the fictional status quo of the five factions-based society (this film's version of The Hunger Games' Panem) makes little sense when examined closely, and raises more questions than it answers. Someone didn't think things through.So my verdict is that it is somewhat dumb, overfamiliar with its sources, but not unenjoyable.",7,6,10,11 April 2014
Ender's Game," Well realised, and enjoyable
","Following a war with insect-like aliens called Formics, won only narrowly, a training programme is instituted whereby young people are hothoused for military command in order to bring on tactical abilities at an age when minds are most agile. Ender Wiggin is a promising trainee, and the film follows him from boot camp into battle school.I have not read the book, but this hard sci-fi movie was very well made and enjoyable to watch, and provided some food for thought. Much of the story appears inspired by Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers - a war against insect-like aliens and following a recruit through training are common - but the course of Ender's training and the philosophical issues are quite different.The performances are all good - Asa Butterfield continues to impress, with a performance of depth and emotion. Harrison Ford, having phoned in performances for a considerable number of years, shows some commitment here. And Moises Arias as venomous fellow trainee Bonzo Madrid is excellent (in fact, all the young actors are good). The effects, both physical and CGI, are excellent.I thoroughly enjoyed this - it is my sort of science fiction.",9,7,15,1 November 2013
Monsters vs. Aliens," Big daft fun
","Susan is about to get married when she is hit by a meteor which makes her grow 50 feet tall. So, of course, the US military captures her, renames her Ginormica, and confines her in the company of several other socially unacceptable individuals: the amphibious Missing Link, mad scientist Dr Cockroach, so named because he has accidentally merged himself, Fly-style, with a cockroach, the screechy, skyscraper-sized Insectasaurus, and B.O.B., an amorphous blob of blue jelly which has become self-aware but, with no brain, is terminally stupid. These lonely misfits come into their own when it becomes necessary to fight off an alien invasion. In 3D, no less.I loved everything about this film. I can't possibly cover everything I liked, but here is a partial list:1. The sci-fi premise appealed to the sci-fi buff in me, but was also engagingly daft, which appealed to my sense of humour; 2. The film looked great and the 3D was fabulous; 3. The voice talent was, without exception, excellent, though I would single out Seth Rogen and Kiefer Sutherland; 4. The movie was packed with stuff to appeal to kids, but also to their parents (and grand parents - one of the very first references is to the bat and ball on elastic as used by the barker in the Vincent Price 3D House of Wax in the 50s); 5. Loads of humour, not only straightforward gags (verbal and visual), but character based humour too.I could go on (and on!) with specifics, but you get the point. Highly recommended, especially in the 3D version, but with much to enjoy flat, too.",10,1,4,9 April 2009
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Ridiculous romp with squashed heads
","Hansel and Gretel, abandoned in the woods as children by their father, were able to triumph over the witch who trapped them in her house made of candy. Now grown, they make their living hunting and exterminating witches, and they are summoned to a town where a number of children have gone missing.Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton have fun playing witch hunters who, quite frankly, are complete rubbish, constantly getting their *rses handed to them by a succession of witches throughout the film. It is only when they unleash a host of preposterous weapons of mass destruction (I do love me a mediaeval machine gun, not to mention a taser which doubles as a defibrillator!) that the tide finally turns.This film tries to go for the straight-faced romp vibe of Van Helsing, but doesn't quite make it, and I'm not sure why. It might be because it is very strong – there is some extremely graphic violence here (heads exploding, people being ripped apart etc.) together with some very ripe language, making this (in my view) an unnecessarily extreme experience, thus reducing the size of its audience. Example: there comes a point when one of the siblings says, 'You've got to be f***ing kidding me!' in circumstances which make the line funny: several minutes later the other sibling says exactly the same thing, and the repeat is doubly funny. But the line would have been just as funny, both times, without the profanity – I felt a lot of the extremeness was put there because the filmmakers felt it ought to be there, rather than because it added anything.The production values are high, but something was missing and I'm not sure what it was.There were time when things came at you, but the 3D was mostly forgettable.",7,1,3,1 March 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good adult entertainment
","I had not read any of the books or seen any of the Swedish movies, so I knew relatively little about this. The first hour sees us alternating between two unrelated stories. In one, journalist Mikael Blomquist (Daniel Craig), having been disgraced in court over a libellous story, finds himself engaged to investigate, under the guise of writing a family history, the disappearance many years ago of the then-teenage granddaughter of industrialist Hennk Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Vanger's family turns out to be massively dysfunctional - they live in houses within walking distance of each other, but haven't spoken in years. The other story concerns Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), the dragon tattoo girl of the title (not to mention various other tattoos, piercings, odd haircut, and various other signposts which shout 'Attitude!' Lisbeth is a ward of the state, answerable to a nasty piece of work who demands sexual favours in return for letting her have access to her own money. After an hour, Blomquist finds himself on the trail of a serial killer and engages Salander as a research assistant.The story is dense and involving, the characters are all strong, Lisbeth Salander is one of the most fascinating fictional characters I have encountered for years, and a number of things happen which I didn't expect. There was a lot here which I really enjoyed - the resolution of Lisbeth's rape, the final follow up to Blomquist's libel defeat, Rooney Mara's performance, the way the story was told.I couldn't always understand the dialogue (there is a mixture of native Swedish speakers and English speakers, some of whom affect a Swedish accent, some of whom don't). I would have liked to see a more saturated colour palette at times But overall, this unexpectedly long movie (nearly two and a half hours) is an entertaining experience throughout, and I recommend it.",8,2,7,12 January 2012
Face_Off," Drivel, but entertaining drivel
","I mean, come on, but even those of you who enjoyed it (and I count myself among them) must have recognised what unmitigated b*ll*cks this film was, surely? It had a good basic concept, admittedly, albeit scientifically implausible, and fairly poorly executed within the movie (ie. not very believable to start off with, completely unbelievable by the time the film finished with it).But I struggled on and did my best to suspend my substantial disbelief (not an easy task) and watched a film which would have worked better with a touch of knowing humour running through it played absolutely straight, by Cage especially.My wife kept howling with laughter as each event more ludicrous than the last hove into view. She particularly found the much-vaunted action sequences hilarious, as millions of rounds of ammunition were expended in loving slow motion, destroying vast quantities of fixtures, fittings and decor, motor vehicles, and anything else which was capable of having at least 20 squibs planted in it, but with no one capable of hitting the people they were aiming at, other than the Castor Troy character (whoever happened to be playing him at the time). Oh, and the Archer character (as played by Cage) being able to wound the good guys with pinpoint accuracy, so as to remain a good guy himself.The vomit-inducing appearance of the ironic replacement son at the end was - well, vomit-inducing, and nearly as funny as the incredibly obvious set up when Gina Gershon was killed.Joan Allen had the single most unflattering hairdo ever committed to celluloid.And for all that, it was fairly entertaining, with Travolta looking as if he was having fun.But don't ever get taken in by those reviews which count this one of the all-time great action thrillers. It's not. It's drivel. Seriously, it's major drivel - fun, perhaps, but complete tosh from start to finish.",6,1,1,5 April 2008
The Men Who Stare at Goats," It pleased at least one audience
","The press reviews of this movie have been somewhat indifferent but the trailer appealed, so I went to see it in a fairly full theatre. I think the audience was very much in the mood for this particular movie, for there was a lot of laughing out loud. And this is fair enough, because there is a lot of humour in it - dialogue, character, situation and slapstick.The plot - purportedly true-ish - concerns efforts to set up a US army section trained in psychic arts. This is referred to frequently as Jedi training, and I could have done without the burst of conversation the first time this arose as a large sprinkling of blokes in the audience explained to their girlfriends the irony of George Clooney explaining to Ewan Obi-Wan Kenobi what a Jedi is. What might appear to be a fairly limited idea is developed well, with real time and flashback proceeding side by side, and a final act which goes in an unanticipated direction.Clooney, McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey all play this somewhat daft material for all it's worth. My vote - quite good fun, albeit not a movie of major significance. A great title, though!",7,2,6,11 November 2009
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Hugely enjoyable brainless action
","Just when the Impossible Mission Force might be making progress towards locating the mysterious Syndicate, the government shuts them down. This leaves Ethan Hunt going rogue, assisted – or possibly obstructed – by the mysterious and beautiful Ilsa Faust.There is not a great deal in MI5 by way of surprise – the plot is very straightforward, albeit with some uncertainty as to exactly whose side – if any – Ilsa Faust is on – but it is, as usual, full of outrageous action, and hugely improbable security measures to be overcome. The IMF now seems to comprise Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner – any female members are conspicuous by their absence, and poor old Tom Wilkinson got bombed to oblivion in MI4. Pegg continues to be amusing and gives the films a much-needed lighter side. Renner gets a rough deal in here with not much to do (but he does it very well).The supporting cast does well, with Sean Harris' odious nasal whisperer a loathsome standout.So there is no huge substance here, but I never looked at my watch during its 130 minutes.",8,0,1,7 August 2015
She's the Man," Silly but funny
","When Viola is prevented from playing soccer at school, she devises a plot to save the day by impersonating her brother. This leads to multiple cross-dressing complications and romantic confusions.This teen comedy is not believable in any way whatsoever, but it is a great deal of fun nevertheless. Inspired by Twelfth Night, it transplants much of Shakespeare's original (including character names) to an American high school setting, and does so fairly effectively. The cast all give terrific performances, but credit must go to Channing Tatum in an early comedic hunk role (presaging things to come) and, especially, Amanda Bynes.My knowledge of Bynes comes from the single performance of hers which I had seen in Easy A - good, but not a very sympathetic character - and her very public burn-out during 2012/13. In this film she gets to play a girl who is variously tomboyish, feminine, and impersonating a boy. The impersonation fools nobody (except every other character in the film, of course) but the entertainment value is in the impersonation, not its accuracy. Bynes is blessed with a face which is both pretty and cartoony. This enables her to play every facet of Viola very effectively: she can be sexy, funny, broad, pretty and, indeed, all of these at the same time. This film confirms her as a real talent and, if she has indeed retired from acting, I hope that she has found her way to a place where her life will bring her peace.",8,0,0,28 September 2014

It also has the distinction of being quite a good super-hero film (origin films are often so tied up with telling the origin story that they forget to give the audience a fair helping of what they went to the movie for - the super-hero of the hour actually doing his super-heroic thing).A well-cast Tobey Maguire goes through sufficient dollops of (rather mature) teenage angst before suffering the bite of a radioactive spider, contributing to his much-loved uncle's murder through inaction, designing and making an extremely snazzy costume, falling foul of his best friend's loopy millionaire Dad, and finally making headway with the girl of his dreams (headway, in this case, being an extremely wet upside down kiss).And the audience is favoured with some decent Spidery goings-on, with a particularly effective climax on some bridge in new York (probably the Brooklyn Bridge, but don't quote me - I'm from the Isle of Wight).The performances are all good: as noted, Maguire is a little old for high school age peter parker. And the other slightly wrong note is the absence of wisecracking from Spidey in costume. Otherwise all is very well (with Rosemary Harris and JK Simmons spot on, visually and performance-wise, as Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson).The CGI is a little wobbly early on, but is mostly very near to what the comic suggests Spider-Man's movements must be.And the emotional journeys of the characters all work well in this satisfying movie.",9,0,1,30 November 2010
Jarhead," A bit snoozy, I'm afraid
","Jarhead is well acted and striking to look at and, if you're a Marine looking to remember what it was like to be out in Saudi during Desert Storm, I'm sure it does the job more than adequately.Unfortunately, for the rest of us who weren't there (and with all due respect for those who were), Jarhead is a bit of a snoozefest. As if to make up for the fact that nothing much happens (even when they finally get out on patrol things are pretty uneventful much of the time), they seem to take turns going stir crazy.You can't blame them, and one understands that this is character-based drama rather than an action movie, but I'm afraid I was bored a lot of the time, no matter how many hundreds of f-words are dropped in (which, I accept, accurately represents the mode of speech).",7,0,0,29 December 2010
Shrek Forever After," Had its moments
","I enjoyed this 4th trip to the well, particularly the 3D (which was very effective), but there were things to point out which were less than positive.Rumpelstiltskin didn't really seem to work. I could see what they were up to but, to me, something wasn't quite right. Maybe it was the voice performance (Wally Dohrn, whoever he is), maybe the trade-off between superficially charming but inwardly villainous was slightly off, but on some level it didn't work.Puss was woefully underused. Limited to a series of fat gags, most of which had been used in the trailers, he may as well not have been there.The ogre babies, potentially great characters, were also underused.The story, though good, was essentially a retread of the first movie, albeit complicated by alternate realities causes and effects which may have been over-confusing for younger children.Far fewer gags than in previous efforts.But I did enjoy it.",7,0,1,7 July 2010
Dunkirk," Good but far from great
","Christopher Nolan's dramatisation of the British rescue of servicemen, stranded on the north European coast, is a good film. It shows us the scope of the mission by focusing in on three elements. One is the land-based situation and, in particular, the efforts of a single young man to get off that beach and onto a boat to England by any means available. Another is what happens to just one of the small boats which took part in the rescue as it leaves Weymouth on its way to the besieged beaches. And the last concerns a Spitfire pilot, doing his best to protect British forces in the Channel.We therefore have the spectacle and scale of Dunkirk, together with 3 stories which are small and intimate enough for us to identify on an individual level. There are sequences which, if not so graphic, are nearly as harrowing as the D-Day landings in Saving Private Ryan and, by crosscutting between the segments, the tension is kept at maximum level throughout.And that is one of my criticisms - I'm not one of those who thinks Christopher Nolan can do no wrong, by the way, The editing is sometimes a bit too fussy for its own good - it's not always clear where you are, whether you've switched narrative strand, or whose viewpoint you're supposed to be following. And this is exacerbated by the fact that weather conditions and time of day switch. One realises that filming a sea sequence means you can't always wait for the sun to come out, but do we have an understandable continuity glitch, or do we have a deliberate editing mismatch?My other major criticism is of the music. I understand the music choice - insistent, discordant, all-pervasive, featuring a clock ticking throughout most of its running time to crank up tension and to create a dramatic effect when it stops - but dear heavens, it was like being assaulted. I don't think there is a moment in this film without music, and it's loud and overpowering and, with a couple of exceptions - when they factor in a taste of Elgar at particularly uplifting moments - it's not much fun to listen to. I hated it.But there are those moments - the arrival of the small boats and the final fate of the Spitfire, for instance, which genuinely choke you up. Well, me at any rate. My Grandad was in the navy on one of the ships at Dunkirk, and one of the people rescued by his ship was a soldier who went on to marry my Mum's cousin - we found this out much, much later when they moved to be near my Mum in old age. So there is a personal resonance for me as, I imagine, a lot of Brits.This is a good film. It is (in my view) too flawed to be a great film, but you can say that of much of Nolan's work.",7,0,2,9 May 2018
Ratatouille," Daft but deft
","I wonder what goes on in Brad Bird's head? How on earth do you come up with the notion of a rat who wants to be a chef and achieves his goal by just happening to find a young kitchen worker who can be physically controlled by judicious hair-pulling? As always with Pixar's films, it isn't the plot details which matter, nor is it the sumptuous visuals (a gloriously realised Paris, mostly seen from a rat's-eye point of view), it's the emotional journeys taken by the characters: Remy the rat flying in the face of expectations, Linguini the callow kitchen boy, acquiring maturity and self-confidence, Colette the woman in a man's world, softening as she warms to Linguinini's gentleness, Ego the critic, learning that there are more important things than that which he thought was so important.Every major character learns, develops, grows, and moves forwards, and they do so in a wonderfully visual way - and not only that, it's funny! No matter what my reservations about Brad Bird's brain, his mental weirdness makes good movies!",9,1,3,19 February 2009
Bad Teacher," Fun, but...
","You know exactly what you're getting with Bad Teacher - you're getting Cameron Diaz as a bad teacher Elizabeth. In her private life she is looking to hook a rich husband for his money: she smokes, drinks, takes drugs, swears a vast amount and sleeps around. As a teacher she does all that stuff, too: she is also a slacker, can't be bothered to remember her students' names, steals, abuses the kids... The list goes on and on. There is a plot of sorts, which involves Elizabeth trying to get money through fair means or foul (mostly foul) for a boob job in order to hook rich substitute teacher Justin Timberlake, and the efforts of by-the-book but irritating teacher Amy (Lucy Punch) to foil her, but the title pretty much says it all.I must confess to enjoying it. A lot of it is pretty funny, Cameron Diaz clearly has a ball and is both funny and sexy (the car wash sequence is both at the same time), and Lucy Punch also does well with a character who spirals into mania as she fails to be able to do something about what she, and she alone, sees happening (I particularly liked the references to an unexplained incident in her past). So I was entertained throughout.Now to reservations. One is the fact that the central character is sociopathic - her every action is driven by 'What's in it for me?' It's not so much that she gets away with it - that happens in real life all the time, and it's not exactly unknown in movies either. It's more that the final sequences promises some sort of redemption, and that simply doesn't happen in real life. Oh well, perhaps I'm just reading too much into it. It is a comedy, after all.And two is that, with the exception of Jason Segel's gym teacher, not a single one of the adult characters behaves remotely believably at any point in the movie, which makes suspension of disbelief a difficult trick to pull off.",7,11,20,24 June 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Enjoyment - meet Disappointment
","Peter Parker, on the trail of what happened to his disappeared parents, gets bitten by a spider, which lets him stick to walls: not as bad as what happens to Dr Curt Connors when he strays down the same scientific path, though. Peter has to negotiate a number of tricky obstacles in this movie - the disappearance of his parents, the death of his uncle, some fancy needlework, his new girlfriend (and her father, who wants to arrest him), school bullying, and a honking great lizard.I should have loved this movie. Andrew Garfield is much closer to the teen Peter Parker as originally shown in Steve Ditko's pencils than Tobey Maguire was, the high school background is savoured here rather than zipped through, an intriguing mystery is placed at the centre of the movie right from the start, Curt Conners' Lizard is both sympathetic and scary, the teen romance between Peter and Gwen works, the performances are all first rate (even Sally Field, totally miscast from a physical viewpoint, is good), the action is terrific, Spidey cracks wise, and much of the CGI is superb (although I wasn't always convinced by the Lizard).So why did I merely like this and not love it? I don't think it's because it's too soon after the first trilogy, although I think the reboot element was unnecessary: it consumes time and screws up the pacing. Much as I liked Martin Sheen, I think this story could have been told better with Uncle Ben already in the ground. Pacing is definitely part of it - there were points where the movie spent time telling me things I neither wanted or needed to know when it would have been better to have got on with the story. Talking of which, having started with a mystery - which I would have been quite happy to see pursued - this was effectively dropped pretty early on (to pop up again in a sequel, no doubt), which irritated me. In fact, this movie was clearly set up as an opener and that, too, irritated me - the Lizard plot line was resolved, but everything else wasn't (OK, so it's like the comics!).And, while I liked the action sequences, I didn't care for the wristcam point of view, and there were places where I felt web-swinging sequences went on for far too long with no particular purposes - yes, it would take him a long time to swing from A to B, but you don't need to show every second of it.On the other hand, it was good to see my old friend C (or C Thomas Howell as he is referred to in the credits) back in action in something other than a direct-to-video piece of Sy-Fy Channel tripe.So, while I enjoyed it, I was also disappointed.PS I love 3D, but a lot of the time in this film you can't tell it's in 3D even though it was filmed in 3D and isn't converted in post production.",7,1,4,5 July 2012
The Lego Movie," Fun, if a little over-busy at times
","First of all, they are not Legos, they are Lego bricks. The word Lego never has an s after it. OK, onwards and upwards.Lego construction worker Emmett is a forgettable everyman: surprisingly, he turns out to be The Special, fated to lead a resistance movement to save the Lego world against the evil plan of Lord Business by using the Piece of resistance to prevent the use of the Kragle to destroy everything.Let me say at the start, that this film is fun. It references pretty nearly everything I enjoy, takes potshots at all sorts, and works well as a bright, colourful kids' fantasy but with enough nods, winks and knowing gags to satisfy your average adult (just look at some of the voice credits - Anthony Daniels delivers one line as a Lego C3PO, for instance). The voice talent in general is great, and I particularly enjoyed Liam Neeson's willingness to send himself up.Having been positive overall, it seems a little ill-natured to be critical, but I must mention two things which didn't sit that well with me. One was that, for a film which needed to be simple, it got awfully complicated at times, and the other was that the animation style and the sheer quantity of what was happening meant that, at times, I really couldn't follow what was going on in front of me.But I repeat - this film is fun, and worth watching on that basis alone.",Null,1,4,21 February 2014
Aliens," Brilliant
","The Alien franchise passes to James Cameron, and gets done properly. This film is everything the first film should have been but wasn't.Where the first movie spent over half its length on setting things up (and even dealt with that at great and tedious length), Cameron's film smartly sets to and makes exposition part of the story. And, once the Marines are back at the planet where Ripley first encountered the xenomorph, the action never stops.The ensemble cast are well defined, there is sufficient audience identification and sympathy for the audience to by fully engaged throughout, the set pieces are well done, and there is at least one brilliantly quotable line (if you don't believe me, see 'Paul').Sigourney Weaver cements her place as probably the baddest-ass leading lady ever.The only real criticism is that there is some grainy back projection work towards the end which is a bit unconvincing.",9,3,5,28 February 2011
Dallas Buyers Club," A good film with a great performance
","Ron Woodroof, hard drinker, recreational drug user, partaker of casual sex, and all round hard-livin' man's man, is diagnosed with HIV and given 30 days to live. After initially railing against the situation, he knuckles down to research, discovers that the US medical establishment is so restrictive that helpful medications are not available. Time is pressing, so he sources supplies from Mexico and, from there, it is a small step to sourcing supplies for others. The medical establishment is not happy...Based on a true story (though with one or two significant fictitious amendments), this film is always fascinating. It has two sides and, although you are always in Ron's camp (notwithstanding that he does not appear to be a nice person in any accepted sense), there is justification in the argument that, without proper scientific trials, you don't know whether a particular treatment is truly effective. This, of course, is no consolation if it is being withheld despite the fact that it is the only possibility of staving off certain imminent death).Jared Leto as flamboyantly transsexual Rayon is terrific, and the developing relationship between him and the homophobic Ron is enormously moving, and forms the heart of the film. But the film overall belongs to Matthew McConnaughey. His commitment shows in the physical transformation he took upon himself - looking gaunt throughout, his wasted skeletal presence in the final courtroom scenes is heartbreaking - but his performance throughout is a big part of making this film as powerful as it is.",8,1,1,27 February 2014
Now You See Me," Huge fun!
","Arrogant illusionist J Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), escapologist Henley (Isla Fisher), down on his luck hypnotist and mentalist Merritt (Woody Harrelson) and street magician and pickpocket Jack (Dave Franco) are mysteriously brought together and, some time later, under the auspices of wealthy mentor Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) perform a trick in Las Vegas in which they transport an audience member instantaneously to a bank vault in Paris, steal the contents of the vault, and shower it upon the Vegas audience. Or appear to... At any rate, the money has disappeared, so the FBI and Interpol are interested. And this is only the first of 3 performances! The trailer tells you this much and, as a lover of stage magic/illusions, I was intrigued especially as the answer was teased with the possibility of something supernatural, or fictional technology. I'm going to say nothing specific, but I will say that this is the very start, the movie keeps you guessing throughout, and also that it plays fair with the audience: it doesn't make any promises it can't keep.The story is very good, the script is better (oh how often I wish I could praise the script but can't!), and the characters are very well written and performed.I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film so much while I was watching it, and I was aware that the rest of the audience was enjoying it, too. If you like stage magic you should love this and, even if you don't, you'll probably have a good time, because the ride is great fun.",9,0,4,5 July 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Loved it
","In the future, Sentinels - giant robots which were introduced to eliminate mutants - have destroyed civilisation. The few surviving X-Men, in desperation, send Wolverine's mind back to his 1973 body in order to persuade Professor X and Magneto to prevent the incident which led to the creation of the Sentinels. Unfortunately, 1973 Professor X is a drunk depressive.This film brings together the casts of the original X-Men trilogy and the First Class prequel in a loose adaptation of one of the classic story arcs from the comics. Placing fan favourite Wolverine front and centre, it tells a fairly dense story which centres mainly on the younger cast from the prequel. It deals with some of the continuity issues which arose due to the prequel (Xavier's paralysis) but not all of them (the different Emma Frosts in First Class and Wolverine: Origin are more or less forgotten), and creates some of its own (the teaser at the end of The Wolverine makes little sense as Xavier and Lensherr would not desperately need Wolverine's help at that point).Who cares? The super-hero action is phenomenal, we see more mutants than ever before (some are blink or you'll miss 'em), and there is some heart and emotion - the key relationships between Xavier, Raven and Lensherr are addressed - and the story is perfectly satisfactory. Jennifer Lawrence is hot, deadly, blue, and sometimes quite moving, and all the principals give good performances. Worries about young P. Maximoff Esq prove groundless - he looks fine, his characterisation is terrific (if different to the comics), and he features n one of the stand-out set pieces.I thoroughly enjoyed this, and it is a worthy addition to the X-Men collection.",10,1,4,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel don't miss a step
","The Avengers continue to fight to right wrongs, but devastation follows in their wake: New York, Washington, Sokovia, and now Lagos. The powers that be seek to put the Avengers under external control. Tony Stark, feeling guilty following the Ultron fiasco agrees, but Captain America doesn't, and the group splits. Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes, still under conditioning, is being manipulated, and Cap seeks to protect his old friend, another factor leading to the group being fractured. Where will it all lead?Captain America's 3rd 'solo' outing is an Avengers movie in all but name. There is a comic cover trope which has almost become a cliché, which shows two opposing groups of characters facing off towards each other from left and right of the cover: the Marvel Cinematic Universe has now brought us sufficient characters for that image to be given to us in the course of a film, as a dozen heroes face each other in two opposing groups.The action is great, with three or four spectacular set pieces, but this film is about much more than action. Some of the best sequences are emotional and thoughtful - Cap's reaction at a death, Tony Stark's difficulties in dealing with assorted issues and, most of all, the discussions between the characters on right and wrong, responsibilities, and the conflicted morality of doing the right thing in the wrong circumstances. There is real meat on the bones in this one.Factor in the introduction of a couple of new characters, both of whom get substantially more than cameos, and this film rises to the top 3 of my list of favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. I loved it.",10,12,25,5 May 2016
Spirited Away," Unsettling but brilliant
","As an English viewer, I can't bring any oriental appreciations to a viewing of Spirited Away: my lifetime of English experiences make Spirited Away an even more alien experience than it is for a native Japanese audience.But I think it is supposed to be disorienting. This odd story of little Chihiro, uprooted from her familiar neighbourhood by her parents moving, and then finding herself in a bathhouse populated by spirits, creatures, ghosts and so on following her parents turning into pigs... well, it's a long way from Disney (even if one of the characters in the US adaptation is voiced by Susan Egan, Megara in Disney's Hercules).This superb movie is imaginative, unsettling, visually entrancing, involving and, ultimately, moving.Any animation fan should make an effort to catch it.",9,0,0,23 April 2011
Pearl Harbor," Lesson learned, but not very well
","James Cameron's brainwave when filming Titanic, in order to avoid the charge that he was making light of a real life tragedy, was to provide a romance between a fictional couple for audience identification purposes, and then dress it up in the genuine events. In so doing, the identification with the fictional characters drives home to the audience just how harrowing the sinking must have been.Pearl Harbour attempts to do the same and, to be fair, the Japanese raid, the centrepiece of the movie, is very well staged (albeit marred by moments like Tom Sizemore emerging and popping off a shotgun at Zeroes overhead without even aiming it).But the fictional characters inserted for audience identification purposes and their plot line - oh dear. Despite having a liking for all three of the actors involved in the romantic triangle, a) this is seriously drippy stuff, and b) there is oh so much of it. I got to the point where I was hoping that the Pearly Harbour raid would polish them all off so that I wouldn't have to endure any more drippiness.My recommendation is that you should try to catch the hour in the middle.",6,2,3,10 October 2010
The Conjuring 2," Quite good
","Supernatural sleuths Ed and Lorraine Warren take on another case, this time helping a single-parent Mum in Enfield whose daughter appears to be subjected to nastiness from someone who died in the house.'Based On True Events.' Well, OK. This is not a statement I have much faith in at the best of times and I have even less in the case of supernatural films, much as I might enjoy the movie.There was a reasonably well documented 'Enfield Poltergeist'. This film fictionalises, augments, and treats the thing as a genuine supernatural manifestation. It should be noted that the movie, while using some real names, locations and alleged events, is otherwise entirely fictional.Which doesn't mean it's not a good horror film, because it is. It has a stealthy growth of dread, and some genuinely scary moments of which only a couple are accompanied by abrupt blaring orchestral hits. The house interiors are grim (but Dad left, and Mum has no money, so that's OK), and the exteriors are battered by too much torrential rain (and rain which rather too obviously comes from overhead rain gantries, and is there really that much water in Enfield basements?), but the down-at-heel suburbia setting is effectively atmospheric nonetheless.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise the Warrens from The Conjuring, but this film belongs to Madison Wolfe, 13 when this was filmed. I was going to sing the praises of a young British actress, but she is a Louisiana native delivering a perfect suburban London accent as part of a terrific performance of a terrified, haunted, and possibly possessed, child.As horror films go, this one is quite good.",7,1,2,23 May 2018
No Strings Attached," Enjoyable if predictable
","Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman) agree to meet at mutually convenient times in order to have recreational sex without the inconvenience of an actual relationship confusing things. The only thing is that he was much in love with her when the arrangement started, whereas she has assorted hangups which make her phobic towards any sort of commitment. However, being as this story is situated firmly in rom-com land (albeit the modern version, which is rife with explicit language and raunch), we know from the start that it is only a matter of time.And so, with little surprise, it pans out. But that doesn't really matter. Nearly all the characters here are good company, and even those who aren't that pleasant (Adam's initial girlfriend Vanessa (Ophelia Lovibond), for instance) are at least amusing.There are few big laughs (although a sequence involving flatmates whose menstrual cycles coincide did draw laughter from women in the audience), but the movie is gently amusing throughout. Kutcher and Portman have a pleasing chemistry, and several of the supporting characters have some solid moments (Kevin Kline's has-been TV star Dad is particularly good fun).There are no surprises anywhere to be seen, but I liked this movie nonetheless.",8,1,3,11 March 2011
Tropic Thunder," A hoot
","I went to see this with some trepidation - I had enjoyed the trailer, but the critics had not been kind.Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. During the first week of its UK run, the cinema was well populated with young people - couples and groups, both male and female - and there was laughter all the way through.The jokes in this comedy are applied with a scattergun approach - they range from fart gags to gross-out gags, from lampooning figures to Hollywood in-jokes, from character-based humour to sight gags. They aren't all funny, but enough of them are to make the movie constantly entertaining.I got a silly amount of pleasure from seeing Universal, New Line and Fox Searchlight all cheerfully lending their logos to decorate the 'trailers' which precede the movie proper.The three principals - and the other members of the platoon - are all excellent. Even Jack Black, who I normally cordially dislike, delivers a credible and sympathetic portrayal of an essentially unpleasant character. Nick Nolte is - shock, horror - funny, and Cruise is simply magnificent (although I think he should have varied his voice - hearing the normal Cruise tones emerge from the Weinstein clone does spoil the illusion somewhat).As usual there is a fair amount of bad language, but as it is mostly in service of the plot, it didn't spoil things excessively.Steve Coogan is wasted.Well worth catching.",8,0,2,25 September 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Unique
","Scott Pilgrim is a 22-year old bass player in a band which has some mild potential. Currently going out with oriental schoolgirl Knives Chau, he encounters the mysterious Ramona Flowers and she agrees to go out with him, only for him to discover that this means he must fight and defeat her seven evil exes.I loved this weird and wonderful movie, directed by Shaun Of The Dead's Edgar Wright, and starring Michael Cera (playing Scott as his stock character, albeit less of a loser than usual) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona (and a couple of honorary mentions for Ellen Wong as Knives and Kieran Culkin as flatmate Wallace - both very funny). It doesn't conveniently fit any category. It's not a comedy, although it's very funny. It's not a teen romance, although there's a strong element of that. It's not a superhero movie or a computer game movie, although both of those aspects are well represented (without any explanation, which was another thing I loved about it). And it's not a comics movie, although it is sourced from a comic (sorry, graphic novel) and, again this is clearly a major influence on how it is delivered.In short, it is that rarity - entirely its own thing, and an absolute delight.PS I'm 58, so you don't have to be that young to appreciate it, thank you very much all you young ageist whippersnappers!",9,3,12,25 August 2010
Enchanted," How true
","The title says 'Enchanted', and I was.The joy of this movie is how cleverly it blends together pastiche and tribute. It is utterly faithful to the films it gently ribs while it is ribbing them. It has its cake and eats it like few other movies do. Even the songs are ever-so-gently over the top.The performances are all fantastic, with Adam's charming fish-out-of-water princess never losing her belief in fairy tale happy endings taking the honours by a short head. Marsden's happily clueless and asinine prince is not far behind, though.Every aspect of the script works, from story to dialogue (and there is such fun to be had in trying to spot references to previous Disney movies).Excellent.",9,1,1,26 February 2010
The Usual Suspects," Talking about conmen....
","The Usual Suspects' main character is a conman. Not coincidentally - and here comes a massive spoiler, so stop reading if you've never seen the film - the movie is itself a con. A pretty big one, actually. In fact, a con which comprises the whole film.This is not a bad thing. In fact, it is the conceit on which the entire film is, very cleverly, based.The strength of The Usual Suspects is its script. It is a script which appears to offer us a densely plotted story which turns out to be no story at all - a non-story which, paradoxically, is constructed with exquisite care. The revelation - an absolute last-minute revelation - is devastating in its impact, and perfectly concealed.The cast are all excellent. In fact, direction, photography, editing, music - the film is superb in all technical aspects.Ah, but that script...",10,0,0,14 June 2010
Inside Out," Someone give Pete Docter an Oscar, please
","We meet Riley when she is born. We also meet Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger, personifications of her emotions who live inside her head and contribute towards her memories – colour-coded globes which build into a library and a series of interconnected city-like structures which embody the key aspects of Riley's emotional growth. Her life is mostly happy until the family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and everything familiar which she loved is gone. The loss of what she loved leads to a crisis in Headquarters which leaves Joy, the sole positive emotion, fighting a losing battle to protect the fragile structures built up over Riley's 11 years.This film is cleverly conceived and executed, carrying what is effectively two parallel and interlinked stories: Riley's struggle to cope with her drastically changed circumstances, and Joy's struggle to protect Riley's emotional history. The visual representation of this struggle is reminiscent of the sequences in Vanellope's race world in Wreck-It Ralph in terms of psychedelically coloured surrealism, but this is both imaginative and calculated to appeal to younger audience members. The Riley story will appeal to their parents.In truth, this is a very ambitious film in terms of putting together an exciting, eye-catching action adventure which works on a fairly superficial level for the less sophisticated viewer, and some fairly high-concept stuff for the older viewer. It largely succeeds, and its conclusion – life is made up of both positive and negative, and we need both to be a fully realised individual – is gracefully presented.Another winner from Pixar, and confirmation that Pete Docter is a genius.",9,2,21,7 August 2015
Die Hard 2," A decent story for the sequel
","New York cop John McClane, meeting his wife off the plane for a snowy Christmas, finds the airport beset by terrorists, and is uniquely placed to challenge their threat.A sequel followed two years after the unexpected success of John McClane's first outing, and seeks to revisit much of the same territory, albeit one has to give it credit for dressing the action up in drastically different clothes. The airport setting, the snowy winter environment, the nature of the threat, and the twists in the story are all highly enjoyable and, once again, Bruce Willis plays the dirty-vested everyman with commitment and credibility.Episode 2 isn't as good as episode 1, but it is still a pretty good film.",8,0,2,16 November 2013
Yesterday," A delight
","Jack Malik is an enthusiastic but unsuccessful singer/songwriter from Lowestoft, supported endlessly by his biggest, and often only, fan and would-be manager (and old school friend and wistful unrequited lover) Elle. Then, one night, strange events result in Jack being the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. And The Beatles' songs prove to be just as memorable when Jack delivers them as they were in some other reality. But is Jack doing the right thing, achieving success on the back of someone else's talent, even if those people never showed that talent in this reality?There are three narrative strands running through this movie. One, Jack's rags to riches success story. Two, the morality of trading on stolen songwriting. And, three, the underlying love story. All three work, and Richard Curtis' script is as gentle but sharp as one might expect it to be. The emotional heart of the film is the love story, but the dramatic heart is Jack's ever-increasing guilt, and the elements which factor into the resolution of this are enormously satisfying. And they brought tears to this old Beatles fan's eyes.All the cast are good. Himesh Patel delivers the songs pleasingly, but all the supporting cast excel in, yes, giving support, especially an uncredited (and unrecognisable) Robert Carlyle.I found this film enormously satisfying.",9,0,2,19 July 2019
Resident Evil," Creates and follows a template at the same time
","Although it doesn't exactly blaze a trail of originality, Resident Evil was one of the first films to create a movie feature from a video game.Which is one of the few things you need to know about it. Let me list everything: 1. It is based on a video game.2. It is the first in an ongoing movie franchise.3. It (and its sequels) stars Milla Jovovich.4. It is about a virus getting loose in a subterranean research establishment which turns people into, yes, you got it, flesh easting zombies.5. There is lots of weapons being fired at zombies and running away.6. There is a fair amount of fairly graphic violence.7. Blahdy blahdy blah. It is moderately entertaining within its genre, but utterly generic.",7,1,2,1 January 2011
Quantum of Solace," Less touchy feely, more bangy bangy
","If you bump into a stranger who says, 'I've never seen a Bond film, but I hear such good things about the Daniel Craig reboot that I've decided to make Quantum Of Solace my first Bond movie,' then talk them out of it, as a matter of urgency. This is not because QoS is a bad film, it's because it has the wrong title.Don't get me wrong, I like the title Quantum Of Solace. It's a Fleming original, it's miles better than the Die Today, Never Tomorrow titles of the Brosnan era, Quantum is a decent name for the shadowy organisation which now fills SPECTRE's shoes, and the three words very aptly refer to the small comfort which Bond derives from the events of this film.But it's still the wrong title. The film should have been called Casino Royale Part 2.It's widely known that QoS picks up within a few moments of Bond shooting Mr White at the end of Casino Royale, and I think that's absolutely fine. But this is the first Bond which doesn't stand alone. My hypothetical stranger is going to be saying 'Hang on - who's Vesper? Perhaps they'll explain later on who she is.' And later on, that same stranger will be saying, 'Who is this Mathis bloke? Why is he angry at Bond for having him tortured? Perhaps they'll explain later on.' But there is never an explanation. For that part of the audience which has seen Casino Royale - and let's be fair, that's going to be a sizeable percentage - this poses no problem. But for those who come to this movie cold, there will be a lot of questions which will remain unanswered.There is more action here than there was in Casino Royale, and I had a problem with a lot of it. Moviewatchers don't always realise that action sequences need a strong sense of geography. If A is running to intercept B at an angle of 50 degrees then, if A finally arrives at a different angle, or from the other side, the audience is disoriented (without always understanding why). The lessons of the Bourne franchise have clearly been taken on board (there is one sequence which is a virtual rerun of the Tangier chase in the third Bourne film), but the excessive closeup work and hyperkinetic, frenetic editing and choreography mean that it is often difficult to keep track of who is doing what to whom and where. Contrast the wonderfully laid out free running sequence from Casino Royale.The story steers away from the small scale intimacy of Casino Royale back towards worldwide power games: thankfully, we are still a million miles away from kidnapping space capsules, satellite dishes disguised as lakes, invisible cars etc.The bit players are all fine. Olga Kurylenko, in particular, looks good and acquits herself well.Craig puts in another sterling performance as Bond. Having let his guard down in Casino Royale, Bond is now closely protecting the open wound left by Vesper's betrayal. QoS shows how he deals with this and, perhaps, how he begins to heal. Again, Craig brings more depth to Bond than any actor before him.By far the best thing in this film is Judi Dench's M. Given more to do than in any previous film, M shows how she got to the position she holds. Politically acute, on top of her job even when things are going badly wrong, and always giving deep thought to exactly where Bond stands, Miss Dench's M delivers, both as head of MI6 and as a human being.The ending - the entire closing sequence - is simply great, with an element of class I never thought I would see in a Bond film.This is a worthy successor to Casino Royale - not quite as good, but still very good - and I enjoyed it greatly.Edit following second viewing:QoS rewards rewatching - it doesn't drag anywhere. I have no reason to change what I said above, but I'll add a few comments. One concerns the location captions (Siena, London, Port au Prince Haiti etc.). These are introduced with individual fonts which are designed to be appropriate to the specific location, and are often seemingly integrated into the establishing location shot (ie. 'London' appears to be a nameplate set into a road). I can understand the artistic/design concept behind this, and it's definitely a different way of approaching it, but I found it really distracting. Personally, I like a constant simple font occupying the same place on the screen, so that you realise what you're seeing each time.Bond makes quips, but they're not funny and they're not meant to be. I liked them a lot.I was irritated by the pageant in Siena. Its only purpose was to introduce a further obstacle in the chase sequence, and the constant intercutting between the chase in the sewers and the pageant above only served to further obscure a sequence which was already difficult to follow.The interplay between Bond and Mathis is excellent.I couldn't believe that the CIA section chief could rise to section chief and still be such a complete ar$e.I was also puzzled about the hotel in the climactic sequence. Who on earth would build an enormous, state-of-the-art, hotel in the middle of the Bolivian desert? A hotel, incidentally, which plays host to meetings of dictators, corrupt police chiefs, purveyors of international chicanery, and their respective entourages - but which has no other clientèle whatsoever? And is serviced by a staff comprising precisely one chambermaid? And how come a structure which appears to be constructed entirely out of concrete burns like cardboard doused in gasoline? But, hey, it's a Bond film - blowing stuff up is part of the genre! Stop being so picky!",8,3,5,6 November 2008
Independence Day," Grrrr
","I don't think there has ever been a film which made me as angry as this one did. But then, I don't think there has ever been a film which has assumed I am completely stupid as comprehensively as this one did.The insults to my intelligence came thick and fast. Jeff Goldblum is the only man in the world who has the vaguest idea of what the alien ships are up to. Good job his estranged wife is the President's personal assistant and not a checkout girl at Safeway, eh? They have had an alien ship in Area 52 for 50 years and no-one can figure out how to get it operational - Goldblum figures it out in 10 minutes, in between writing a virus for the alien operating system. Clearly he is the most important man on the planet since no-one else seems to have the vaguest idea what to do about this threat, so we'd better keep him safe in case our counter measures fail, hadn't we? Naaah, let's send him up to the alien mother ship and near certain death! Now, let's see, in a world crisis, when the world is (apparently) looking to the USA for a lead as to what to do, how best should we use the President? I know, let's send him up in a fighter plane against one of those ships which keeps destroying the planes we send up against it! And how about this idea of outrunning the fires of Hell as they lick at your tail (twice, or was it three times?) and your dog... that particular card was played multiple times. Then there was Will Smith finding his girlfriend in the ruins of a burnt out city. At night. From a helicopter. Not to mention how fortunate that the aliens were using Windows and didn't have a firewall installed. Not to mention......And don't get me started on Bill Pullman's vomit-inducing 4th July speech.See, I love sci-fi, and I love CGI/eye candy, but I felt really insulted that Emmerich and Devlin could believe that cinema audiences were so completely stupid as to swallow the lazy, lazy scriptwriting which was thrown at them. None of these criticisms was anything which couldn't have been corrected by a little bit of rewriting, but taken together they indicated contempt for an audience which, clearly, was assumed to be so devoid of intelligence that none of these things would matter to them.I guess the box office proved them right on that one! Plus there are a lot of positive comments here, so maybe their assessment of the overall audience intelligence was right after all...How depressing.3 out of 10 for fun visuals. Script... minus 10.",3,5,8,28 June 2007
Gone with the Wind," A true epic
","The thing which really astonishes me about GWTW is how artistically successful it is, given the time it was made. Sound was only 10 years old and full colour in a full length feature less than a year, yet GWTW - with three directors - uses both with a maturity that most movies still can't manage over 80 years later.Rather than compliment the cast and production crew - there are plenty of comments here which say the same thing I would say - I want to sing the praises of the remastered DVD. The original 3 strip Technicolor had the 3 elements combined in an optical printer whenever a projection print was produced, and the mechanical process of doing this sometimes - often, if the DVD documentary is to be believed - produced far from perfect registration of the 3 elements. For the remastered DVD, new software has been written which enables the 3 elements to be registered digitally absolutely perfectly. As a result, the remastered DVD has the sharpest image most people will ever have seen, and I can confirm that this excellent film does indeed look better than I have ever seen it.",10,1,3,12 September 2010
The Butterfly Effect," Good, with some flaws
","The Butterfly Effect is the sort of story I love - a romp through alternate realities, seeing the effect that minor changes have on the course of events. Evan uses an ability to revisit the past in order to try to make right all the things which go horribly wrong, and this story holds your attention throughout: the film tells the story well.I have two reservations. One concerns colour saturations which, at times, seemed to lend a garish air to the movie. I don't know if this was a deliberate production design decision, but I found it distracting. My second reservation concerns Ashton Kutcher who, to be frank, I found quite poor in the lead role. He never convinced me, which is a shame because the other cast members were all very good, especially Jesse James (shame on you, Mr and Mrs James!) who played Tommy at age 13 with a feral intensity which was quite unnerving.Kudos for going with an ending which is not what one might hope for. It goes to show that an ending needs to be a satisfying resolution, not necessarily a conventional happy ending.",7,1,4,30 January 2009
No Country for Old Men," Frustrating
","I don't care for the Coens. While they are undoubtedly exceedingly talented, they have a propensity for making films to please themselves on a level which the viewer doesn't always share - this viewer, at any rate.No Country For Old Men is so nearly mainstream that I very much enjoyed it until the end, when it left me feeling frustrated. I'm a great believer in stories having satisfactory resolutions (as opposed to happy endings), and No Country has no resolution whatsoever: worse, it actually goes to some trouble to set up a non-resolution.I don't know whether the lack of a resolution is a feature of Cormack McCarthy's original book or whether it is the work of director/adaptors the Coens, although I strongly suspect the latter. Whoever is responsible, it spoiled the movie for me fairly comprehensively. Understand - I have no problem with an ending where the villain gets away with it, but I do like to have a resolution.And it's such a pity. The script is excellent, the performances are excellent, the look of the film is excellent, the direction is very good (it is a little slow), but there's no darn resolution!",7,1,3,28 June 2009
The Love Guru," Myers can do better
","The Love Guru - or - Mike Myers turns Austin Powers into a cod Indian.How can I describe this movie? There are several defining elements. One is Myers' constant shameless mugging to the camera - the fourth wall is so much rubble, and Myers' winsome coyness becomes - what's the expression? - damn irritating. Another is the fact that, not to put too fine a point on it, the movie is an endless succession of kn*b gags, with a couple of poo gags, a diarrhoea gag and, oh yes, an elephants sh*gging gag sprinkled among them. The third is that Jessica Alba wanders around looking, let's face it, a bit lost.Yet for all that, I smiled a moderate amount and laughed a few times. The Mariska Hargitay gag, though overused, was amusing, and I'm ashamed to say that I laughed out loud at some of the appalling things Verne Troyer allowed himself to be put through, and I was entertained by the mock Bollywood musical numbers.Certainly not Myers' finest hour - far too much staleness and repetition for that - but not as bad as it's made out to be in some quarters.",5,2,5,5 August 2008
District 9," Very good serious science fiction
","You don't get many South African scifi special effects extravaganzas to the pound - in fact I can only think of one, and it's this one.Thanks to Peter Jackson, this story of stranded aliens hits the screen.If the truth be told, there is a lot of familiarity in much of what unfolds, yet I don't recall it being put together this way before.Told in a faux documentary style (marred only by the inclusion of some sequences which could not have come from news/documentary footage), the story has strong echoes of apartheid and the Holocaust, albeit delivered without preaching and with state of the art scifi trimmings. I thought early one that we might be subjected to actors in giant insect suits, but my worries were groundless - the effects (and there are a lot of them) are almost flawless. But then, one wouldn't expect anything else from Weta.There is an excellent central performance from Sharlto Copley, a 35-year old South African with almost no screen acting experience.I wasn't over-keen on the 'Bourne'-isation of much of the visuals (enough now, thanks, can we please get back to using tripods?), I thought the start could have been usefully trimmed by a quarter of an hour or so, and I would have quite liked a stronger resolution. But these are relatively minor quibbles.A decent scifi action thriller with serious points to make. Recommended.",9,3,7,9 September 2009
Mamma Mia!," Utterly joyous
","I like, but don't love, musicals - my DVD shelves contain a selection, but the stuff there is pretty obvious: Singing in the Rain, King and I, Wizard of Oz, Moulin Rouge etc.. I'm not a Meryl Streep fan - I admire her craft, but mostly haven't liked the parts she's played. Conversely, I've always liked Abba's music. So that's my starting point when considering this movie which I have just been to see with my 80-year old mother.The story is a piece of fluff. Sophie, who lives with her mother in a dilapidated hotel on an idyllic Greek island, wants nothing more than for her father to be at her forthcoming wedding. The trouble is her father could be any one of three men with whom her mother dot dot dotted twenty years ago. So Sophie invites all three of them to her wedding and, as expected, complications ensue. The story, such as it is, is quite strong enough to enable the songs to be hooked onto it. And the songs, with one or two obvious exceptions (Money Money Money cued by the rundown state of the hotel) are very cannily worked into the story so that each one is relevant.The film looks great. The Greek locations overflow with sun and primary colours. The script is mostly fairly deft, and there is a sprinkling of decent laughs.But the film ultimately stands or falls - and it stands, believe me! - on two things: the music, and the cast.The music - sitting through this film brings home the strength of the Abba catalogue. There isn't a weak song among the two dozen which feature on the soundtrack. The music, produced by composer Benny Andersson, mostly wisely sticks very close to the original arrangements, and the occasional divergences (Greek bouzouki on I Had A Dream, for instance) are spot on.And the cast - well, they deliver. Brosnan's singing has been criticised, but he is always in tune, and he delivers a satisfactory vocal performance rather than dazzling with a polished singing technique (which he hasn't got). The four leading women are all wonderful. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski as Meryl Streep's two oldest friends are both very funny (Julie Walters has a particularly funny little bit of business in a rubber boat), and Baranski has her own knockout number. Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is simply delightful - she sings well, carries the plot and all the emotion which goes with it, and is very easy on the eye. And Meryl Streep is a revelation.This film is an utterly joyous experience. My old Mum and I came out of the cinema buoyed up by the experience of watching it, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who enjoys musicals and/or Abba's music.",10,278,467,10 July 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Great fun, but forget the book
","Bilbo Baggins and assorted dwarfs continue their journey to Erebor, overcoming various obstacles on the way (including hostile elves) before Bilbo has to try to fulfil his engagement as burglar under the fiery snout of antisocial dragon Smaug.The second Lord Of The Rings movie suffered from Middle Film Syndrome: Hobbit 2, despite occupying the same position in a trilogy, does not suffer to the same extent, and perhaps this is because it is exciting all the way through, yet follows on from a film which was pretty slow throughout its first half.It also contains large chunks which do not come from the novel - I'm pretty sure Legolas wasn't in the book. He is great fun here, as a much angrier soldier in the Elf Army. And new creation Tauriel is hugely enjoyable, resembling nothing so much as Uma Thurman's character from Kill Bill, albeit attractively played with the hint of a smile by Evangeline Lilly.Apart from being a more engaging movie than part 1, pretty much everything I thought about that movie still holds. I still have reservations about the dwarfs - their faces and hair feel obviously prosthetic and wigged, and it's still pretty difficult to tell them apart from each other except for the old one, the one wounded by the orc arrow, Thorin, and James Nesbitt's Irish one. I still have reservations about CGI orc faces - the prosthetic orc faces work noticeably better. I still have reservations about some of the action sequences, where more is not necessarily better (one sequence, in particular had the audience laughing because of the extent to which the Elvish derring-do was over-derring-done). And there are times when Bilbo looks cut out and pasted into a scene. And, once again, the 3D is indifferent.Otherwise, this was great fun. Loads of action, some nice character work, an excellent and nasty spider fight, a well-voiced and visually realised Smaug, and not the slightest yen to look at my watch.And a cliff-hanger. You swine, Jackson.",8,44,70,19 December 2013
Batman Begins," Simply great
","I'm always up for a superhero movie, and I'm often disappointed. Not so with Christopher Nolan's retooling of the Batman legend.The origin is not only faithfully reworked, it is also fitted out with loving detail as to how the Batman we are familiar with was assembled - every element of the familiar character has its own origin, and the incremental addition of each part gives the whole a solid credibility which the otherwise inherent silliness of the character has previously lacked.This is added to by the gravitas offered by a heavyweight cast: Bale's intensity, Freeman's and Oldman's decency, and Caine's sheer heart add an emotional depth to the story which previous efforts (and most other superhero movies) have lacked.In addition, the origin is dovetailed into an organised crime story which gives the opportunity for the fledgling crime-fighter to strut his stuff.Then factor in excellent performances, first rate design and effects, and some stirring musical cues, and you have a movie which takes a comic book hero and makes him into a legend.Great stuff.",9,0,0,22 December 2010
The Fault in Our Stars," Enjoyable
","Teenage terminal cancer sufferer Hazel, attending a support group under protest, meets the sparky, entertaining and attractive Gus, also a cancer sufferer, but in remission. The two of them find much to like in each other, and emotions grow.I haven't read the book on which this film was based. Taken solely on its own merits, it is a rather likable and entertaining take on a very serious subject as it tries to draw a distinction between, one one hand, who people are and, on the other, the handicaps under which they may live. The performances are universally good: the quality comes in little moments, well-written, which give the actors a chance to shine (for me, the best of these was the moment when Gus' supreme self-confidence cracks when Grace is about to see his amputated leg for the first time). Shailene Woodley as Grace gives another great performance, of a quality able to carry the film (albeit she doesn't need to due to very able support by Ansel Elgort as Gus). Woodley has the quality of being both beautiful and ordinary at the same time, which makes her a compelling screen presence, and the fact that she can act doesn't hurt, either.A film about teenagers with terminal cancer is never going to have a conventionally happy ending, but this film does well by a) delivering a positive ending, b) entertaining us throughout, c) giving us some surprises along the way, and d) playing fair with its subject matter. If I had one criticism, it would be that ugly people get cancer, too.I left the cinema dry-eyed, but I suspect that many may not.",9,0,2,27 June 2014
Twilight," Someone should give that dreary girl a good slapping
","Every now and then a movie comes along which demands that I should spoiler it to death. Twilight is one such movie.Bella Swan lives in Arizona with Mom and stepdad, at least until Mom decides to go on the road with stepdad, at which point Bella is packed off to Forks, a hick town in the middle of a cloud-shrouded pine forest, where dad Charlie is chief of police. Despite everybody at her new school being incredibly nice, friendly and welcoming towards her, Bella remains resolutely grumpy and sullen - in fact throughout the film the only person she is cheerful towards is the mother who went off and deserted her at the start.I say everyone is friendly and welcoming: of course, that doesn't include Edward Sullen, sorry, Cullen - Bella is seated next to him in class, at which point he gets up and leaves the room and doesn't come back for a week. After endless we like each other, we don't like each other, you should stay away from me, I can't stay away from you, Bella finally figures out Edward's big secret, which is that he's a vampire. Edward has an even bigger secret, though, which is that Bella gives off the aroma of a particularly appetising meal for vampires, which is a particular problem if you want to be her boyfriend and not simply chow down on her.Anyway, they embark on a relationship of sorts which cheers up the previously taciturn, intense and sombre Edward no end, although it has no discernible effect on Bella, who remains as po-faced as ever. This ever-awkward relationship reaches crisis point when Edward's vampire family (who hunt animal blood not human blood - they're good vampires, y'see) invite her to a vampire baseball game (held during a thunderstorm for reasons which the vampires think are obvious, though I failed to see them at all) which is crashed by the three visiting vampires who have been bumping off assorted locals, and who have been attracted by the aroma of yum yum Bella.Edward's family springs into action by instantly driving Bella from Washington to Phoenix, to no avail because the sniffy hunty member of the visiting clan tracks her down no problem at all. However, that proves to be his downfall when Edward's family dismember him and burn the pieces in what would almost certainly have been the most entertaining part of the movie if only it hadn't happened off-camera.Everybody adjourns back to Forks, Edward takes Bella to the prom, and the surviving female vampire from the we-want-to-scoff-Bella group occupies the last shot of the movie so that a sequel is lined up.Edward is immortal - why on earth does he want to spend eternity with this miserable girl? Edward, incidentally, has the finest pair of eyebrows since Mr Spock (or possibly Noele Gordon on Crossroads), an ace aerodynamic design which are the absolute bee's knees for peering out intently from underneath.This film is enough to give adolescent Gothic teenage romantic drama a bad name. It's badly written and the characters are badly drawn. Even the realistic elements are unrealistic. The effects are fairly minimal and OK. Just about the only bit where I feel justified in being positive is in Robert Pattinson's performance - not my cup of tea, but effective in its own way. Kristen Stewart quite possibly performed Bella as written and directed but, if so, that is her misfortune, because the character was appallingly misconceived from the start.",6,1,4,15 January 2009
Liar Liar," Good vehicle for Carrey gurning
","Fletcher Reede is an ambitious and unscrupulous lawyer. His success, based on a willingness to say what is necessary, irrespective of whether not it's true, has worked its way into his private life. It has destroyed his marriage - his ex-wife is on the brink of starting a new life with someone else - and it is about to destroy his relationship with his young son. Having been let down once too many times, the lad makes a wish for his Dad to have to tell the truth for 24 hours. This proves hugely problematic in court, where Fletcher is representing a deeply unscrupulous young woman in a divorce case.Jim Carrey's career started with bit parts, then he abruptly hit it big with a series of movies which involved much face pulling and physical comedy. Liar Liar is towards the end of that phase. The story is good, and Carrey's physical shenanigans while trying, and failing, to lie, are often very funny. The supporting casr are excellent, particularly Maura Tierney as the frustrated and disillusioned wife, Cary Elwes as the rather wet but fundamentally decent new boyfriend, and Jennifer Tilley as Reede's odious client.Then we found out, in The Trueman Show and The Majestic, that Carrey could actually act.",8,0,1,14 March 2020
Wreck-It Ralph," Enormously entertaining
","In the arcade game Fix-It Felix 2, Ralph's function is to smash things up so that Felix can fix them. Fed up with being his game's villain even once the arcade closes, Ralph takes himself off to see if he can find redemption (or, at least, a medal like the ones Felix earns) elsewhere in the world of arcade games.I'm sure it must help if you have a familiarity with computer games, because there are guest cameos here from loads of games from the very start of the arcade game era, but this is a pretty solidly entertaining movie anyway. The story is relatively straightforward but very well structured, with small touches from earlier earning big payoffs towards the end. The visual element of the film is dazzling and witty, and reflects perfectly the consistent advances in video game visuals over the years. And the characters are great, and brilliantly voiced, with Sarah Silverman standing out. They all have wonderful character development arcs in a story which is exciting and, at times, very emotional.I loved this film.The 3D was immersive without being flamboyant.",10,2,2,22 February 2013
Bridesmaids," First rate
","Bridesmaids is ostensibly a comedy about the mishaps of a group of bridesmaids aiming for a hen party outing to Las Vegas and, as a result, it invites direct comparison with the unexpected hit The Hangover of a couple of years ago. It even features a moderate amount of crude and scatological humour, and an outrageous exaggerated group member, thus making the leaning towards comparison even stronger.In fact, the areas of comparison are fairly superficial. Bridesmaids is a much better film, and I say this as someone who thoroughly enjoyed The Hangover.As a male viewer of mature years, I watched Bridesmaids in a cinema where the audience was predominantly women of an age where they have met a) various of life's disappointments and b) the selfishnesses which men can sometimes demonstrate. This film made them laugh a lot, and I enjoyed the experience of seeing it in the company of such an audience. It made me laugh, too, perhaps not with the outrageous belly laughs of The Hangover, but with knowing laughter almost all the way through. There is a scatological sequence which rivals Dumb and Dumber for funniest diarrhoea sequence ever (I can't believe I just typed that) but, for me, this was outdone by a sequence on a plane which was beautifully judged and hilarious.Bad language is an area I often complain about - there was a moderate amount of swearing here, some of it particularly ripe, but I have no complaints because - take note, screenwriters - it was all dramatically justified and served a purpose: none of it was gratuitously inserted simply because it is trendy to fill a film with bad language.The cast was excellent, with Rose Byrne brilliantly playing - but not overplaying - a character who is far from easy to like. And kudos to Melissa McCarthy for creating a character who is funny and fat, not funny because she is fat. And, notwithstanding the exaggerated nature of her character, she is believable (I am contrasting this with Zack Galifianakis in The Hangover - funny, but I didn't believe he was a real person for a second).That's at the heart of why I liked Bridesmaids so much - it is an honest film. The characters are real, their motivations and feelings are real, and even though the events may be tipped slightly over the edge, I could believe in these people and feel for them.Finally, I must single out Kristen Wiig, playing the central character and co-writing. I'm not familiar with her US TV work, but I've seen her in a number of films (most recently Paul) and quite liked her. Let me say this about her performance in Bridesmaids: if this performance had taken 15 minutes of screen time and had been in a serious movie, she would be looking at a Best Supporting Actress nomination: she is that good here. However, she is on screen all the way through, in a broad and sometimes coarse comedy, so she doesn't stand a chance of a nomination, and it is a great pity. Her performance is subtle, full of light and shade, emotional, real - oh, and very, very funny.",10,4,9,24 June 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Good but far from perfect
","Timid Hobbit Bilbo Baggins is recruited by wizard Gandalf the Grey to accompany a dozen dwarfs on a quest to wrest their home back from a usurping dragon called Smaug.Peter Jackson revisits Middle Earth with some new friends and not a few old ones, in a film which recaptures much of the visual impact of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. So, right from the start, it is possible to say that if you didn't like those films, you are definitely not going to like this one, because it is pitched right at the same target.After a prologue explaining Smaug's arrival and the displacement of the dwarfs, here is Howard Shore's music, with the familiar Shire and Ring themes, taking us through the front door of Bag End just before Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday party, thus linking us right at the start with the previous trilogy. This is all very pleasing and comforting. Bilbo's recollections take us back in time to the arrival of Gandalf and the dwarfs, and after the conference (an amusing sequence which, nevertheless, takes far too long), the expedition is off.I can't say this film is too long, because I enjoyed every minute and it held my attention throughout. What I can say, though, is that the source material is much more slight than LOTR, and that shows through: there is a sense that the material has been extended, inflated, perhaps even bloated, to create a trilogy where one film or, at most, two would have been adequate. In LOTR, a long journey was necessary in order for the debilitating effect of the Ring to be demonstrated: there is no such justification here, and there is a sense of characters being marched through video game sequences.That isn't all that's wrong with it. Some of the humour - welcome after the relatively humourless LOTR - is woefully contemporary in its delivery. Some of the CGI is simply off - just a bit, but it somehow fails to completely convince (the Goblin King, in particular, fails on both these grounds) and there are times when CGI is used where Jackson would have not used it in LOTR - orc and goblin facial articulation in particular - where the physical version would be better than the cybernetic. Sometimes the sizes of characters mismatch, but LOTR was guilty of that, too. The dwarfs all look like men in prosthetic makeup. And sometimes the set pieces don't work in the way they did in LOTR because the stakes don't seem as high - the Balrog sequence in Fellowship was intense, exciting and emotional because we knew the characters and cared for them: here we hardly care at all when 9 million goblins chase a dozen identikit dwarfs through their caverns in an overblown sequence. And the 3D, in the 24fps version, at least, is hardly noticeable much of the time and sequences which should have sung in 3D remain almost dull. For me, a 3D fan of vast enthusiasm, the 3D here was a major disappointment.After those criticisms, it is only fair to report that the film is mostly fairly exciting, Ian McKellen and (especially) Cate Blanchett nail Gandalf and Galadriel again (McKellen's Gandalf is subtly younger and less serious), Martin Freeman's diffident everyman personality is perfect for young Bilbo, and Gollum is superbly realised in the Riddles In The Dark sequence.This isn't the triumph it should have been, but I must reserve my final judgement for the next two years until I see how it fits into the trilogy.",8,9,24,14 December 2012
Non-Stop," Tolerable nonsense
","Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is a sky marshall with problems - he drinks too much, there are family issues, and he doesn't much like flying. So when he starts getting text messages in flight to the effect that someone is going to start killing people aboard the plane every 20 minutes, his day couldn't get much worse. Except it could. And does.This on-board paranoia thriller is not bad - it keeps the tension racked up well throughout its fairly modest running length, and it's not easy to guess the outcome.Then it comes to the climax and it all falls apart somewhat. I won't explain why, but I will say that much of what has taken place in the previous 90 minutes won't stand up to close examination in the cold light of day. It's not as bad as aliens beaming in and being responsible for what has gone on, but it really isn't a great deal more credible than that.And it was all going so well, too. Not for Bill, though.Oh, and Non-Stop is a pretty rubbish title as I believe it applies to most plane journeys.",7,1,2,7 March 2014
Man on the Moon," Carrey - great. Kaufman - ??
","Let me say at the start that Jim Carrey's portrait of Andy Kaufman is quite brilliant.Let us now turn to Kaufman, best known for his amusing portrayal of Latka Gravas in the sitcom Taxi.Kaufman also did other stuff. He called it comedy. My guess is that very, very few other people would call it comedy since it didn't involve laughter, amusement, or any of the other things people associate with comedy. It was equivalent to putting bits of glass, metal, wood and similar on a plate, and saying you're a chef. Kaufman's material was aggressive, in your face, provocative, and not even slightly funny.This deeply unfunny and unpleasant man (if Carrey's portrayal of the rest of him is as accurate as the Taxi part) had nothing worthwhile to say, and one can only speculate as to why he chose to say it in that fashion.The film involves spending a lot of time in the company of someone whose company is not pleasant. So, while granting Carrey the kudos he merits, I have to say that I did not like this film.",6,3,3,19 April 2011
The Princess Bride," Wonderful stuff
","In the course of a story which a grandfather is reading to his sick grandson, we see the adventures of farm boy Westley in pursuit of Princess Buttercup.On one level, The Princess Bride plays absolutely fair with fairy story conventions - heroes are heroes, villains are villains, and weird in-between characters are weird in-between characters. The story plays out in a satisfactorily linear fashion, adhering to standard fantasy story tropes.And then, on another level, The Princess Bride is a subversive deconstruction of the traditional stories it mimics. It is frequently very funny indeed, it boasts some wonderful performances (both Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin play their roles with a precise combination of straight face and tongue in cheek, and Wallace Shawn is simply hysterical), and it has the best sword fight for a long time. And it is endlessly quotable. Funny, exciting and charming, it is a film to treasure.",9,2,4,11 May 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Immersive
","Spielberg turns out a war movie which is both harrowing and gripping, not to mention being an essay on both the futility of war and also the opposing view that sometimes it is right to embrace that futility.I don't want to repeat (excessively) many, many other comments, so I'll just say that the two combat sequences which bookend the main narrative are staggeringly visceral and must be the nearest experience to war combat short of being in it. These sequences are astonishingly well staged.Hanks has never been better, and the rest of the cast is also excellent. But this is Spielberg's film.",9,2,4,3 April 2010
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Excellent
","It is 5 years since Hiccup became friends with dragon Toothless and changed the way the village of Berk lived. And now he happens upon a community of dragons who live hidden away: there is a long-hidden secret and a menace to be faced.The first film was an unexpected gem, and its sequel is just as good (albeit no longer unexpected). The real-time passage of time is interesting, the story works, there is some real emotion, and the visuals are terrific (and, again, the film is worth catching in 3D).The voice work is very good, although Cate Blanchett affects an accent which hovers somewhere unidentifiable. I think she was going for Scots but, if so, she didn't quite make it.But I will cut this film any breaks it needs, because it did something which few films do: it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. There is a moment when a character who has been something of a victim in this film finally turns, and it completely blew me away - I loved it.Highly recommended, and catch its predecessor first if you haven't already done so.",9,5,11,11 July 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Odd and wonderfully funny
","In the 1930s M. Gustave, the concierge of a grand hotel in middle Europe, becomes embroiled in plots relating to the death of an elderly guest with whom he had been having an affair.I had seen two Wes Anderson films prior to this: The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, which I found interesting and quirky although I am not sure whether I was actually entertained by it, and Fantastic Mr Fox, which I disliked. My failure to see any other Anderson films was more due to circumstance rather than intent, although I have always garnered a Coen Brothers vibe in that I get the impression of private jokes to which the audience is not necessarily party. So I approached The Grand Budapest Hotel with trepidation.And I loved it. From the opening framing sequence (which frames another sequence, which frames a third sequence which frames the actual story - the first two are completely unnecessary, albeit quirky and entertaining - I loved the son's intrusion and apology) I was sucked in. There is a huge cast of Names, some providing mere cameos, others taking on meatier roles. There is fantastic production design which ties into the storytelling -- the highly distinctive visuals and the script work together, often to specific purpose - and great direction, plus an engaging deadpan central performance from newcomer Tony Revolori as Zero.But towering over everything is Ralph Fiennes: M. Gustave is urbane, charming, efficient, (almost) always sincerely polite to everyone, and (under the surface) quite weird. He is also very, very funny, and you can see how much fun Fiennes is having with him, displaying a gift for comedy which, while not wholly unexpected, has never been as obvious as it is here.I really, really enjoyed this.",9,3,12,21 March 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," High octane fun
","The fourth instalment in the Mission Impossible movie franchise sees the Kremlin blown up by mysterious operatives, but blamed on Ethan Hunt's IMF organisation. The US President closes IMF down, leaving Hunt's cell of 3 operatives (augmented by a mysterious fourth agent, Brandt) to halt the plan (of which the Kremlin bombing is simply the first stage) and, in the process, prove their innocence. Oh, and stop World War III.The seemingly ageless Tom Cruise puts Ethan Hunt through his athletic paces once more, aided by Simon Pegg's comic relief computer geek Benjy, Paula Patton's very able token female Jane, and Jeremy Renner's Brandt. All four are excellent. The stunts and action sequences are spectacular and almost non-stop, the story (which is less complex than it appears) has sufficient suspense to keep you on the edge of the seat, there are a couple of areas where you expect one thing but the film delivers another, but...The 'but' has to do with MI3. Numbers 1 and 2 were very enjoyable, but essentially action packed romps. Number 3 rose above this by putting, at its heart, the relationship between Ethan Hunt and new wife Julia: the risk to Julia raised the stakes enormously, and gave MI3 a heart which the first two movies were missing. MI4 starts with Hunt's marriage being a thing of the past so, although we are later given more information about what happened, that heart is missing. For that reason alone, I regard MI3 as superior.But make no mistake, this is a blockbuster worthy of the title.",8,3,6,5 January 2012
Foxcatcher," Wonderful performances in a dull overlong film
","Brothers Dave and Mark Schultz both won gold medals for wrestling at the Los Angeles Olympics. Industrialist, philanthropist, and America's richest man John Du Pont prevails upon Mark to join him at his ranch Foxcatcher in order to establish Team Foxcatcher to pursue American wrestling to greater glories.This film dramatises a real-life series of events with a tragic ending, and highlights excellent performances from Mark Ruffalo and (perhaps unexpectedly) Channing Tatum as the brothers, and a stunning piece of work from Steve Carell. Unrecognisable behind prosthetic nose and teeth, Carell manages to give Du Pont a pair of eyes which are barely human: every second he is on screen, you are acutely aware that there is something very, very wrong with him. It is a stunning performance judged by any criteria, but given Carell's comedy background it comes as a huge shock.If only that were all. But it is unfortunate that these performances inhabit a film which has two major flaws. The first is the running time. At 130 minutes, the film drags terribly. Right from the opening sequence of the brothers training, scenes make their point and then drag on and on to increasingly little point. And the other flaw is that, after all that, I'm none the wiser. What caused the deterioration in the relationship between Mark and Du Pont? Was there some sort of homosexual interaction? If so, nothing was spelled out. What led to the final events? Was it simply a reaction to the mother's death? Again, no explanation was offered, and I needed a little bit of resolution in terms of understanding why these things had happened.Director Bennett Miller is nominated for Best Director Oscar this year. He doesn't deserve to win.",7,0,4,16 January 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," Superb
","TE Lawrence is seconded to sound out Arab tribes under Turkish occupation. He oversteps his brief and forges relationships with both assorted prominent individuals and also the desert in which they live. He takes a prominent role in the uprising against the Ottomans, but at what personal cos?David Lean's 1962 3 hour plus desert epic won 7 Oscars including best film and best director. It deserved to. I won't list everything about it which merits mention, but here are some of the main ones.Peter O'Toole, at the start of his career, holds the screen effortlessly as Lawrence. By turn drive, haunted, trivial, it is a mesmerising portrait of a complex man. The rest of the cast is also excellent.The script, by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, never reverts to flamboyance, but instead delivers exposition with such economy that you are never aware of it. This is film writing at its best.Maurice Jarre's iconic there is merely the icing on the cake that is the score.And the look of the film! Putting to one side - as if the can! - the sheer scale of the film, the logistics of getting film crew, cast and extras to locations where those extraordinary vistas could be captured, you are then almost forced to notice the beauty of the jil. Lean's directiom and Freddie Francis' cinematoraphy mean that each frame is a work of art, shocking in its beauty.A true classic whose reputation is entirely justified.",10,1,1,24 April 2020
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Very good but not perfect
","Spielberg's follow-up to Jurassic Park has some very good things to recommend it. In particular, the CGI dinosaurs - used fairly sparingly in the original movie - are everywhere and, almost without exception, are perfectly realised. The raptor hunt in the derelict command centre, and the T Rex in Santa Monica, are both flawlessly executed sequences.There are some areas I have to pick fault with: 1. I can have enough of Jeff Goldblum's mannered delivery quite quickly, and I had enough of it in the first one; 2. I also don't care for Julianne Moore very much;3. The caravans over the cliff sequence, obviously a major set piece, went on too long and strained credulity a bit too much for me.Otherwise, this is a terrific movie.",8,0,1,5 April 2011
It Follows," Some originality in what could be first entry in a franchise
","Jay has backseat sex with odd boyfriend Hugh, at which point he reveals to her that he has passed on a kind of curse: Jay will be pursued by some sort of entity which only she can see, which has in mind killing her brutally (as we have seen in an opening sequence). It only walks, so she can speed away from it in a variety of ways, but it never stops. She can pass on this curse by having sex with someone else: if it kills them then it reverts back to her and so on, back down the line. Her disbelieving friends are, nevertheless, supportive.I have watched quite a lot of horror films over the years, and it is unusual to encounter one which is a little bit different. It Follows is a very simple concept (as someone else has pointed out, it is about a sexually transmitted haunting), and is delivered well. The opening sequence shows that the director is not afraid to present graphically explicit gore on screen: the rest of the film shows that he doesn't feel it necessary to do so. And quite rightly. He has created a 'monster' which generates the same dread as Schwarzenegger's Terminator in the original movie – an unemotional and unstoppable entity, nightmarishly implacable, and intent on nothing at all other than the destruction of our sympathetic protagonist.There are several effective set pieces, set in and around some of Detroit's less salubrious areas (even the residential area where Jay lives is unlikely to feature in Detroit Tourist Board commercials), and the general drabness adds to the pessimistic and downbeat air of the movie, as does the unsettling music, not to mention the three sex scenes which are all equally unlovely and unloving. The unknown cast all do very well.I can see this garnering some criticism for its relatively leisurely pace and for the absence of much in the way of in-your-face horror trimmings: such criticisms are likely to come from the modern generation who demand up-front explicitness, which is not what this film is about at all.I look forward to a sequel which, I hope, will explore the origin of this curse.",8,23,46,5 March 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Terrific - best Apes film so far
","A brief plot synopsis - scientist Will Rodman (James Franco), researching a cure for Alzheimer's (and, as usual for a movie scientist, pumping untried medicines into all and sundry contrary to all established medical protocols) finds himself rearing Caeser, a hyper-intelligent baby chimpanzee. Caeser has to be put into an animal centre after attacking the next-door neighbour while trying to protect Will's Alzheimer's-affected father (John Lithgow), and the ill-treatment Caesar and other apes suffer at the hands of worker Dodge (Tom Felton) seed the start of Caesar's plan to bring the apes together.This film is not perfect, but it is probably the most perfectly satisfying film I have seen this year. After 5 to 10 minutes of exposition, (culminating in an explosive and destructive rampage by prize research chimp Bright Eyes) there is a sequence where a moving camera follows Caesar as he swings through the Rodman house. All the Apes films up to this one have featured humans in ape costumes: here, for the first time, the story is told from an ape's point of view, and this exhilarating sequence, wonderfully realised, makes it clear that being a chimpanzee is very, very different to being a human.This epitomises the strength of this film: despite the humanity which is clear in Caesar (we feel his bewilderment at being put in the company of other apes when his behaviour has been completely determined by the fact that he has only ever had human contact), the viewer is never in any doubt that these are apes, not humans in masks.The performance capture and CGI are excellent. Apart from the occasional dodgy moment, the CGI is flawless, and the lack of dialogue on the apes' part is never a problem - it is always 100% clear what is being communicated. Kudos to Andy Serkis in particular for his captured performance.The human performances are less dazzling, although John Lithgow is sad and touching. Tom Felton plays, essentially, Draco Malfoy with stubble, an American accent and a cattle prod, and Freida Pinto is decorative but unnecessary. Brian Cox's part could have been played by anybody - it didn't need a Name actor - and frankly, so could James Franco's. But it doesn't matter: this is entirely the apes' movie, and it is the best Apes film out of the 7 (so far) committed to celluloid. You know that 'Knocks your socks off' moment in the 1968 original? Well, there are a number of them in this.Highly recommended.",Null,1,4,12 August 2011
Cars," Good, but not great
","As a fan of Pixar's output I must say that, like many others, Cars is probably my least favourite movie of theirs. This tale of anthropomorphic cars, in which conceited racing car Lightning McQueen is taught a useful life lesson about humility by the inhabitants of small town Radiator Springs.As one expects with Pixar, everything is technically flawless - one marvels at the look of this film, and the voice talent is all excellent, The story is well constructed and the moral, a good one, is delivered without being hammered mercilessly home.Yet I don't know what it is, but I just can't warm to it. I can appreciate it, but it doesn't touch me in the way that Pixar's other movies do. Maybe it's just that I'm not a car person, because the mechanical Wall-E touched me deeply.",Null,0,1,31 July 2011
Legend," Hardy is great, but bring your own moral compass because the film doesn't have one
","Lovable club owner Reg wants nothing more than to settle into domestic bliss with the gorgeous Frances: if only it wasn't for the fixes his dozy twin Ron keeps getting them into, especially when he doesn't take his tablets! And then there's that annoying Nipper Of The Yard, constantly being a nuisance...Let's get one thing straight: Tom Hardy does a phenomenal job of creating Ronnie and Reggie Kray as two distinct and distinctive characters, and the special effects used to put the two twins together through much of the film are so good that you are never aware of them. And it is a fact that this film is very entertaining, if overflowing with profanity (and I would not argue that the profanity is out of place).I saw this in a fairly full cinema. A lot of the audience were Women Of A Certain Age who, I suspect, had come along in order to get a double dose of Tom Hardy (it wasn't as uncomfortable as when I was the only man in the audience for magic Mike. I digress). The point is that there was a lot of laughter during the film, and the laughter sometimes came at the most inappropriate moments – Ron makes a quip after blowing the back of George Cornell's head off: call me a reactionary old traditionalist, but I don't think that's very funny, personally.The film does show us some savagery but, when it does so (Reggie killing Jack The Hat, the murder which saw him put away for the rest of his life), it provides a large chunk of mitigation for it. The Krays are made very sympathetic in this film and, while one appreciates that they were something of folk heroes in their local patch, the fact remains that they were ruthless, murderous thugs, and this film does rather obfuscate that by portraying them as a couple of lovable lads living in an offshoot of sitcomland. It's a good film, but with a worrying absence of moral judgement.",7,2,6,18 September 2015
The Little Mermaid," Pure brilliance
","There is (in my view) only one criticism which can be levelled against this film, and that is that it plays fast and loose with Andersen's original in terms of the ending. I first read Andersen's stories as a child, and The Little Mermaid had a fairly typical unhappy ending. Personally, I thought the Mermaid deserved better and, on taking my kids to see this movie when it was first released, I was delighted to see that the people at Disney had given her the ending I always wanted for her.The very first sequence, of Prince Eric's ship looming out of the mist, took my breath away.I can understand Under The Sea getting all the attention - it is, after all, very jolly and colourful. But, to me, it pales into insignificance next to Kiss The Girl (soulful, and with a far better vocal performance), Poor Unfortunate Souls (where sinister turns into nightmare, with a sensational vocal performance from Pat Carroll delivering clever lyrics) and, most of all Part Of Your World.I think this may be the most perfect song sequence ever committed to celluloid - the song itself intertwines several plot elements, teenage angst and the generation gap, and bucketloads of emotion in a complex rhyming scheme loaded with clever wordplay. Jodi Benson's vocal is sublime and so are the visuals - it still brings tears to my eyes after repeated viewings. And the reprise... choreographing the final 'world' to an orchestral crescendo and the crashing of the wave behind Ariel in Copenhagen mode may be corny but, by heaven, it certainly works! Howard Ashman is sadly missed!",10,4,4,4 October 2007
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," More self-indulgence from the most over-rated director in living memory
","Beware spoilers!Rick is a fading star of westerns and action films and TV series in the late 60s. He hangs around with his underused stunt double Cliff, who is also his buddy, driver, and general gofer. Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate have just moved in next door. Rick is experiencing insecurity as his career dwindles, while Cliff gives a cute underdressed teen a lift to the Spahn Ranch where her distinctly unsettling commune lives. 6 months later, Sharon Tate, is pregnant, and Rick returns from Italy with 4 spaghetti westerns under his belt, a new Italian wife, and insufficient resources to keep employing Cliff. They have just returned to Rick's house after a final celebration when 4 members of the Manson family turn up, ready to carry out the celebrated Sharon Tate murders. One of them runs away, the other 3 enter Rick's house where Cliff kills 2 of them, getting injured, Rick kills the other one then goes to have a cup of tea with Sharon Tate as Rick goes off to hospital.Yes, the Sharon Tate murders never happened. Would that it were so.I was not disappointed with this film because I have never subscribed to the view that Tarantino is a masterpiece-making wunderkind. He is undoubtedly hugely talented, but he also has a terrible propensity for self-indulgence which he exercises at the expense of the film he is making: the film is in service to Tarantino rather than vice versa. The labelling of this offering as 'The 9th film by Quentn Tarantino' is arrogant and pretentious in equal measure.This film has many, many flaws. They include:
1. Lengthy shots of people driving around during which nothing happens and which serve no purpose.
2. A huge amount of time during which Tarantino shows us that he can emulate the look and feel of 60s movies. We know, Quentin.
3. Various plot elements introduced which turn out to have little or no plot relevance: the death of Cliff's wife, George Spahn, and Rick's interaction with the girl actor, to name but 3.There are enjoyable elements here - the girl is excellent - but they combine together to add at least an hour to the running time without moving the film an inch further forward. The film is vastly padded because Tarantino loves the sound of his own voice too much. There are those who will say it is his loving homage to Holywood. To which I say ' Watch Hugo, Quentin, and see how Scorsese's love story to cinema is intertwined with a proper story.'I have chosen to spoiler the absence of the Tate murders. This not because I didn't like the would-be murderers getting a comeuppance they avoided in real life - far from it. But the film trades on a real-life tragedy to put rear end on seats, and then plays Tarantino games with it. It is used as a PR trick rather being addressed in the way it deserves.Tarantino's genuine cinematic gift comes out in the scene where Cliff encounters the Family at the Spahn Ranch. The unsettling sense of unease is cleverly built up and used. I wish the rest of the film had used its time as profitably. But Tarantino's self-indulgence overpowers everything.",5,16,25,25 August 2019
Gone Girl," First rate
","Nick (Ben Affleck) comes home to find that wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has disappeared and there are signs of a struggle. Or so he tells police. As events unfold in real time and flashback, we discover that there is more to this than meets the eye, that Nick has been less than Frank, and that it begins to look increasingly as if Amy is no longer alive as Nick's trial by media begins.That synopsis gives you what you get in the trailer (and this movie has been particularly heavily trailed). It is fair to say that the trailer teases but does not spoil, and that is my attitude too, because this film does not deserve to be spoiled. After the first 40 minutes or so it goes in some directions which, for me, were completely unexpected, and I loved being confounded by a film which had appeared superficially to be a routine murder/disappearance movie. It is not, and this film gives us one of the most memorable movie monsters (in a non-horror sense) for many years.The story unwinds at some leisure – the film is two and a half hours long – with a number of intertwined strands (the disappearance, what lies behind it, the police investigation, the role of the media, the relationship between Nick and his sister, to name but several). All the players are excellent, but Affleck is first rate, and Pike shows astonishing range and delectable buttocks. I'm not sure which I liked more.This film is thoroughly recommended.",9,2,15,3 October 2014
Django Unchained," One of Tarantino's better films
","When slave Django is acquired and freed by German dentist King Schultz, all is not quite as it appears - Schultz is actually a bounty hunter, and he and Django (who turns out to have an aptitude for bounty hunting) go into partnership prior to setting off to rescue Django's wife from plantation owner Calvin Candie.I approach Tarantino's films with trepidation. While he is undoubtedly a stylish director and a writer who has an ear for dialogue, he also has a taste for trash and a fatal tendency towards overindulgence - I don't subscribe to the 'Tarantino is a genius and his films are masterpieces' school of thought, because the flaws in them are so manifest. It was in this frame of mind that I approached the near-3 hour, spaghetti western homage that is Django.This, too, is not without its flaws, but its breezy good humour, notwithstanding its subject matter, is infectious, and it is a most enjoyable movie, not to mention often being visually quite beautiful.I could leave it at that, but I think I need to mention the elements which, in my view, didn't work that well. One was the music - Tarantino's tendency towards musical selections which might not be the most obvious choices often works well: for me, here, the music was often unhappily inappropriate. Two is my reservations about Jamie Foxx as Django. I appreciate that, as a slave looking for his enslaved (and probably suffering) wife, and given the part he was playing within the part, there was no reason for him to be happy, but he struck me as rather one-note sullen. Three was the violence which was played for laughs - Tarantino did this in Inglorious Basterds, too, and I'm really not sure I am comfortable with it, particularly when it sits side by side with equally graphic violence which is not meant to be funny (D'Artagnan's death) - boundaries get blurred. Finally, the ridiculous bloodbath in Candie's house was the most self-indulgent sequence in the film. Perhaps he feels it's expected of him, perhaps he just likes doing it. I felt that less would have been more.But all this fades next to the three things I loved. One was the dialogue - at its hysterical best in the sequence where the Regulators are arguing over their hoods. Two was Samuel L Jackson's malevolent Stephen (a character I have a great deal of trouble figuring out: his mixture of Uncle Tom-ism and equal partner status with Calvin, and his fabricated limp, are never explained). And three is Christoph Waltz's gleeful and grandiloquent Schultz - just because you are doing something unsavoury in a repellent time, place and society, doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy yourself, right? I continue to be extremely impressed by Herr Waltz.",8,2,6,25 January 2013
Drive," Overrated
","Ryan Gosling is The Driver, a movie stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver. He becomes interested in a young mother who moves into the neighbouring apartment. When her husband is released from prison and blackmailed into a carrying out a robbery, The Driver offers his help. But things go wrong.For the second time within a month I have gone into a movie with high expectations based on what I have read, only to come out feeling distinctly underwhelmed. Let me start by saying that this is not a bad film. But it certainly isn't as good as it is being made out to be - far from it. And it suffers from one of the same faults that my other recent disappointment (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) suffered from - excessive pausing.I can't see that this Ryan Gosling fellow is the Great White Hope he is being touted as. He was OK (but no better) in Crazy, Stupid, Love., and he is OK (but no better) in this, given that he is required to play his part as borderline autistic. Whenever anyone speaks to him (especially Carey Mulligan's next door neighbour) there is a 10 second wait before he even starts to think about replying. It is incredibly annoying. Coupled with a mass of other unnecessary shots which simply do nothing towards moving the film along, this 100 minute movie, somnolent for much of its length, could lose a good 15 minutes or more in the edit of the first half without it affecting the narrative thrust at all (taking out the pauses, removing unnecessary shots, speeding unnecessary slow motion up to normal speed). In fact, it would tighten the movie up enormously and make it far more urgent (it would also stop Gosling looking as if he is brain-damaged much of the time).The story itself is fine, progressing in directions which aren't always expected. The performances are all good (especially Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks). The driving - of which there is relatively little - is exciting. The action - again, of which there is relatively little - is sudden, and brutally violent. And the visuals are beautifully composed.Two more quibbles, one small, one not so small. One, having arrived at a satisfactory resolution, the film takes a half-step further and delivers a final shot of irritating uncertainty. And two (and far more fundamental) - the character of The Driver. The fact that he is never given a name tells us that we are not supposed to know anything about him, his back story, why and how he came to be who he is, and so on. Fair enough. But I would have liked him to be consistent. Instead, his character is exactly what the plot requires it to be at any particular point in time, even if that contradicts what he was like 10 seconds earlier. Without knowing anything about him, you don't have any reason to rationalise his wildly inconsistent actions.There is a good film in here struggling to get out, but it hasn't succeeded.",Null,4,13,4 October 2011
Insidious," Perfectly competent scary movie
","Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson move into a new house, following which their middle child Dalton falls into an unexplained coma. Then scary things start happening - noises, people seen out of the corner of the eye, bloody handprints on sheets. So they move. And the phenomena continue, So Wilson's mother calls in specialist help: two comedy paranormal investigators and a more serious psychic/mystic-type person.The story is essentially Poltergeist, told with a Paranormal Activity-type vibe, although there is no found footage pretence - this is a straightforward fictional supernatural story.It is maybe a little too leisurely in the set-up, but once it gets going and canters along quite nicely. There are the requisite number of 'Made you jump' moments, and the story is quite good fun and well told. The small cast all do their jobs quite well, and the film delivers.Incidentally, is it unreasonable of me to infer a connection between the fact that the demon is very reminiscent of The Phantom Menace's Darth Sidious, and the film's title Insidious?",8,3,7,1 May 2011
The Theory of Everything," Superb
","No sooner does graduate cosmolgist Stephen Hawking embark on his inspired and inspirational search for the scientific reasoning behind everything than he falls in love, and is diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease which, instead of killing him within the two years predicted, instead removes every element of his physical control over his body.This biographical movie of Hawking's life is based on a book by his first wife, played here by Felicity Jones against Eddie Redmayne's Hawking. This films falls into two categories, both of which I am generally wary of: it is 'worthy' (which often carries with it the unspoken addendum 'and dull'), and it features what Robert Downey Jr's character referred to as 'full retard' in Tropic Thunder ie. a portrayal of some sort of debilitating condition which often supercharges a performance in terms of being Oscar bait.This is a story which is both inspiring and heartbreaking, often at the same time. It is often funny, often happy, just as often sad, and very moving. It doesn't concentrate on Hawking's MND (although this is, of necessity, a major part of his life story) but, instead, treats that as just part of the tale to be told of a man, his accomplishments, and his family.Felicity Jones, a favourite of mine for some little while now, is very good here in a role which doesn't give her a lot more to do than be the straight man to Redmayne's turn as Hawking. This sort of set-up can overshadow the performance by the second fiddle (viz. Tom Cruise in Rain Man), but Jones does well without ever overdoing it.But this is Redmayne's show. You have to acknowledge the physicality of the performance in terms of reproducing the effect of Hawking's MND but, for me, the real strength of his performance is in the shy confidence of the young Hawking, the subtlety and emotional conveyed despite facial contortion and no dialogue, and the joie de vivre which shines out from start to finish.This film frequently brought me to tears. It is wonderful, and I recommend it.",9,1,2,9 January 2015
Bolt," Good but not great
","This CGI animated movie from Disney/Pixar (under John Lasseter's aegis within the new arrangements, but not actually initiated by Pixar) illustrates how far CGI has come. Character design, backgrounds, and animation are all of a standard which would have been drooled over a few short years ago - now they are simply taken for granted.The story concerns the efforts of Bolt (a dog who stars on TV as a superhero, and believes that his TV show is real) to travel across the USA in order to be reunited with Penny, his human. His companions are Mittens, a cat with a jaundiced attitude, and Rhino, a hamster (complete with transparent ball) who has had a great deal of exposure to TV.The movie is good, though it should be noted that there may not be quite as much for adults as there often is in these movies.Of more interest is the 3D. Technically, it is perfect - there is no ghosting across of right eye image to left eye or vice versa - each image is absolutely discretely delivered to its own eye. I'm pleased to report that the film is not filled with things being jabbed into the camera constantly - sure, it happens once or twice, but not enough to distract - instead, the 3D is for the most part simply quite natural. In fact, the thing which impressed me most was Rhino's globe - the distortion of the background through the plastic makes the globe the most believable thing in screen in the entire film.And I suppose, in five years' time, we'll be taking the quality of the 3D for granted, too.",7,1,2,11 February 2009
Frozen," Pleasing, and startlingly beautiful
","When Princess Elsa nearly kills her younger sister Anna by careless use of her magical freezing powers, the King and Queen react by magically erasing Anna's memory, and raising Elsa in isolation. When the sisters meet again at Elsa's coronation, her powers again wreak havoc, and she runs away to live in isolation where she can't hurt anyone. But Anna follows, to try to persuade her to return for she has left her realm in the grip of a never-ending winter.Inspired by, but not based on, Hans Andersen's The Snow Queen, Frozen is an original fairytale delivered in the same manner as Tangled - traditional Disney fare, but with computer animation rather than traditional hand-drawn animation, albeit anyone watching it will not be surprised to see characters which could have sprung from Cinderalla, Sleeping Beauty et al. Many of the better CGI movies reflect strides made in modelling one particular area and, with Frozen that is, not surprisingly, snow and ice. In fact, much of this film is breathtakingly beautiful as regards how full use is made of the possibilities which CGI opens up to the animators. The 3D is also very good. The film is a treat for the eyes.Which is not to short-change the story. Unusually, there is no formal villain as such: what we have is an antagonist who causes harm but does not wish to: a potentially tragic character and, in fact, the opening sequence is a wistful and sad opening to family fare, not that Disney has ever shied away from making hard choices in storytelling. The two sisters are nicely realised, as are the two handsome young men, and also the comedy relief reindeer and snowman. Pleasingly, the voice talent is relatively low profile, but they do very well.The story carries no major surprises (but one or two minor ones), and remains pleasing. I felt it didn't have quite as much heart as Tangled, but there were still moments when it brought a tear to the eye, whether through a story moment or simply because something is jaw-droppingly beautiful to look at.Recommended.",9,5,9,19 December 2013
2012," Big budget balderdash (but fun!)
","Let's be fair, you know what you're going to get with Roland Emmerich. You're going to get two things - vast quantities of death and destruction, and some vague human interest to give you an emotional stake in it. So what we get is kind of a noughties version of Irwin Allen, only with CGI instead of miniatures.This time it's John Cusack's turn to play a cipher of a dad who is trying to rescue his estranged family from the fate awaiting the rest of the world. That's your plot, folks. There isn't even the ecological preaching from The Day After Tomorrow. No, you get some scientific balderdash in the first five minutes, and that's your lot.This is very much a 'put your brain on hold and enjoy the eye candy while you munch your popcorn' movie. It doesn't bear close examination on any level whatsoever (where did the ash from the Yellowstone Park eruption go? Anyone?) but the eye candy is wonderful.As usual, Emmerich overplays the 'narrow escape' card, particularly during the drive out of Los Angeles.There is a particularly irritating character who keeps insisting he can't fly planes despite the fact that a) he can and b) if he doesn't then he and the rest of his group will die within the next 30 seconds.This is big budget trash, but highly entertaining nevertheless.",7,1,2,25 November 2009
Ghost Rider," Tripe, but entertaining tripe
","I came out thinking 'Well, don't expect it to make any sense,' then I realised that I was talking about a film where the main character's head turns into a burning skull, and he rides a motor cycle up and down the sides of skyscrapers. Expecting it to make sense is possibly a case of unreasonable expectations.Amiable nonsense. Popcorn movie. It has a sense of fun about it, much of it looks good, and you don't look at your watch wishing it would be over. There are some places where it will make my wife jump when she watches it on TV (she'll be happy to watch it as a quasi-light horror film rather than a super-hero film - it has a kind of Van Helsing vibe to it).Even from my limited exposure to the comic Ghost Rider, it's clear that Cage is far too old to be playing Johnny Blaze. He's good in the part (albeit I don't think it places huge demands on him), but Johnny's supposed to be a young man, and Cage ain't. Sam Elliott is better than he was in Hulk - still mumbles, still talks through his moustache, still can't understand a word he's saying in the sub-Elvis bass rumblemumble, but at least he doesn't have that lemony squinch plastered all over his face.The story is idiotic, and I don't know why they even mentioned the hallowed ground thing, it didn't appear to have any plot relevance anywhere.I went with my son (comic fan) and a friend (civilian). My friend enjoyed it quite a lot, my son and I rated it higher than Daredevil and the first half of Hulk, lower than the second half of Hulk.I can see why it would annoy someone whose expectations were higher than mine.",6,0,0,3 May 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," Far from a disaster
","Brett Ratner's 3rd (and final) instalment in the (original) X-Men trilogy has come in for a lot of vitriol, and it's my job to say that much of it is undeserved. That's not to say that it isn't without its bad points, but I'll get to those.Within the wider sweep of deepening tensions between the mutant / militant mutant / humankind factions, the love triangle between Jean Grey, Wolverine and Cyclops reaches its tragic conclusion in a plot thread loosely adapted from the dark Phoenix saga, hinted at in the very final moments of X-Men 2. The development of both plots is well handled, and the last half hour or so is both spectacular and emotional.The good points? Kelsey Grammar as Beast is note perfect, and I defy any comic fan not to come over all funny when he says 'Oh my stars and garters.' The final battle, a full-on battle between two groups of super-powered mutants, is strikingly well done. And the resolution of the Dark Phoenix problem, as tragically inevitable as it is, is never overpowered by the spectacular destruction taking place behind it thanks to heart-breakingly passionate and honest performances from Famke Janssen and Hugh Jackman.There are some negatives, though, and the main one - in my book - is the sidelining of Cyclops. Scott Summers, as the long-time leader of the X-Men in the comics, and also the leader in the previous films, deserved better than to be casually killed off screen. His death should have had a major emotional impact (as a major emotional character and also as jean's notional first love), and it had none.Apart from that, I enjoyed this film a lot, and I return to it more often than I do to its predecessors.",7,2,2,24 March 2011
Hellboy," Excellent
","Guillermo del Toro's first pass at Mike Mignola's quirkie indie comic book, about a baby demon brought up to be a kind of a policeman of the supernatural, succeeds on almost every level. The story is good, and redolent of Mignola's work (albeit filtered for a mass audience), the casting is first rate, as are their performances, and the visual realisation of everything in Hellboy's universe is terrific, from the Lovecraftian monsters to Abe Sapien and Hellboy himself (a masterly combination of Ron Perlman's natural architecture and huge prosthetics which do not seem to impede his movement at all).The script, too is good, with strong characterisation (again, reflecting the comic well) and a good dose of very welcome humour. And you care for these characters: they are a lot more than 'mere' comic characters.I would comment that the visuals, while quite excellent, don't attempt to capture the high contrast quirky originality of Mignola's art, but this is clearly a production design choice (and, given Mignola's high degree of involvement with the production, taken with his approval and co-operation).This film is hugely enjoyable.",9,2,2,11 February 2012
Room," Great performances in a powerful film
","Joy was kidnapped 7 years ago: since then she has lived in a single room with her 5-year old son (by her kidnapper) Jack. On finally escaping, both mother and son need to connect to a world which has moved on for Joy, and which Jack has never known.This is a psychological drama on three acts: there is an expository section which shows us the limits of Joy's and Jack's world (and, as it is the only world Jack has ever known, it is perfectly normal to him), then there is the drama and excitement of the escape and, finally, there is a lengthy section in which we see what happens afterwards. This final section was the part I loved because it simply plays with your emotions as you follow the progress of Joy and Jack, and Joy's family, as they meet assorted issues which must be dealt with.Brie Larson as Joy ('Ma') is wonderful, and young Jacob Tremblay as Jack is simply astonishing. Jack is a complex character and far from easy to play, but you never for a second think you are watching a child acting: Tremblay IS Jack.This is an excellent film.",9,1,6,29 January 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," An unexpected delight
","Walter Mitty, photograph curator for Time-Life, fancies new employee Cheryl Melhoff from afar: imagining himself in heroic persona, he does nothing about it. Then Life magazine closes and Mitty appears to have lost the key photograph for the cover courtesy of legendary photographer Sean O'Connell. Mitty has no choice but to track O'Connell down.Let me say that I haven't read Thurber's short story and I haven't seen the Danny Kaye movie. I suspect this version takes little from either other than the idea of a mild everyman with a vivid fantasy life. But that's OK, because this film, directed by and starring Ben Stiller, is very much its own thing, and successfully so, too.Although it has humour, it is not a comedy. Although it has fantasy, it is rooted in real people and relationships. Mitty suits Stiller's established screen persona (or a variation on it), and Kristen Wiig is a genuine pleasure as the object of his affections. Stiller's direction is also very good, with action and effects set pieces well handled, and titles and transitions proving a strong element from a production design point of view.If I had a criticism, it is that the film is a little overlong: I felt that the pursuit of O'Connell could have been trimmed somewhat.But, while I thought I would enjoy this film, it delighted me much more than I expected it to.",8,4,9,3 January 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Yes, but what about the start? And the end?
","The central part of Peter Jackson's 3 part adaptation of Lord of the Rings suffers, inevitably, from the fact that it doesn't have a proper beginning (unless you watch Fellowship of the Ring immediately beforehand) or end (unless you watch Return of the King immediately afterwards).What it does have, however, is Gollum, an extraordinary creation to the joint credit of voice and movement artist Andy Serkis, dressed up on screen by the amazing work of Weta Digital, Jackson's in-house digital effects team. What results is what, at the time, was the most convincing wholly digital on-screen character yet seen. Even more extraordinary, the movie Gollum acquired an element of pathos which his creator seemed unable to give him on the page. Gollum's actions are driven by evil - Gollum himself is tragic: Tolkien said this, but I think he must have disliked Gollum, because I always felt that he was unable to translate the truth of this onto paper. Yet Jackson and his team manage to.This film, ultimately, though, chronicles the trials and tribulations of the separate elements of the Fellowship as they move onwards, introducing the Riders of Rohan on the way, and culminating in the epic siege of Heml's Deep, something of a smokescreen to conceal Frodo, Sam and Gollum creeping quietly ever nearer to Mordor.As with part 1, the casting, performances, pacing and look of the film are flawless.",9,0,3,28 April 2010
Schindler's List," Outstanding
","Schindler's List comes about halfway in Spielberg's cinematic directing career (to date). It isn't his first (or his last) serious movie, but it is his best and, notwithstanding the enormous impact his entire output has had on the movie industry, I would go so far as to say it is the film he was born to make.Spielberg does the impossible, in a number of ways. He takes one of the most appalling periods of how vile man can be to his fellow man and, without losing any of the emotional and visceral impact of that inhumanity, wrings something inspirational and human out of it - we watch fascinated, moved, devastated, and - if we are even halfway human ourselves - improved by the experience of watching the story unfold.This film is brilliant in so many ways, not least of which is the fact that the protagonists - Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern - are no one-dimensional caricatures, created for the single purpose of delivering plot developments. No, they - and all the characters in this wonderful, harrowing film - are real people, neither all good nor all bad.Watch it to see a truly gifted director exercising his art at the very top of his game, not that Spielberg has ever been anywhere else.",10,11,16,7 July 2011
Across the Universe," Insincere shambles with some good bits
","I watched Across The Universe at my friend Steve's house last night. While there were elements I quite liked, there was a lot - an AWFUL lot - which I didn't.Taking the music first, it was interesting to see that what was presented was a mixture of note-for-note remakes and wildly different reinterpretations, and in both cases, some worked and some didn't (I thought Bono sang Walrus well, for instance, but I simply can't take those lyrics in anyone's voice other than John's). I thought all the principals sang well.Turning to the rest of the movie, it was a shambles. There was nothing wrong with the basic story (by which I mean the love story between Jude and Lucy), but it was decked out with characters and thread elements which went nowhere - Prudence, for instance, a character with no narrative value whatsoever other than to enable two non-plot relevant songs, and Jude's Dad, an interesting plot thread which rapidly became a dead end. The end result rambled, of necessity, what with being loaded down with irrelevancies.And the incessant naming of characters from Beatles songs became trite - around the 40 minutes mark I started wondering when we were going to meet Rita and Eleanor and Pam and Bungalow Bill... Not to mention the endless quotes - 'How did she get here?' 'Oh, she came in through the bathroom window.' I would have welcomed, 'Oh, she climbed in off the fire escape.' Above everything, I was irritated at how damn American the whole thing was. Notwithstanding one of the main characters being Liverpudlian, and notwithstanding The Beatles reflecting their times (including the enormous global influence of the USA), they were an English group, and I felt queasy at their music being used to illuminate the USA's internal upheavals over Vietnam, not to mention dysfunctional yuppie family life (Thanksgiving? Not very Beatle-y, if you don't mind my saying). Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais deserve a clip round the ear for the screenplay - try Still Crazy for a noticeably better film from them in the world of rock.",5,0,2,15 December 2009
The Incredibles," First rate
","Bob and Ellen Parr are happily married with 3 children, but Bob is stifled in a demoralising office job. He fondly remembers the time 15 years earlier when he and Ellen were Mr Incredible and Elastigirl, successful super-heroes before too many lawsuits forced all super-heroes to retire. Then an opportunity arises to resume super-heroing and, before you know it, Bob and his entire family are in jeopardy.The Incredibles is an excellent film, with plenty of action, adventure, humour, and superheroics, and a surprising amount of James Bond-iness (including musical references). At its heart is the family relationships between the Parrs, and the threats to this are shown to be just as important as the larger and more physical threats from the villain.The animation is superb, the character design is brilliant, and the set design - particularly the island locations - is just stunning. The film is a visual treat. But the characters themselves are beautifully realised, too. The voice work is fantastic (if I had to single out anyone it would be Jason Lee, delivering a character which is funny and seriously scary at the same time) and the animation acting is always heartfelt and true.If I had one criticism - and I do - it is that the film feels a little flat during the period while depressed Bob is working at the office. But this is a minor quibble about a film which, in all other respects, is a spectacular success.",10,2,3,23 July 2010
The Mist," Not to be mist (sorry!)
","Arriving in the UK a considerable number of months after it appeared in the States, this is the third adaptation by Frank Darabont of a Stephen King story (the previous two being The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile). Darabont clearly has an affinity for King, because his three films are all not only faithful to their source material, they are also excellent films (which contrasts strongly with the many, many very poor adaptations of King's material).The Mist tells of a group of people trapped in a supermarket by a mist which has suddenly arrived from nowhere - or, more precisely, by the savage and bloodthirsty things which lurk, tantalisingly out of sight, within the mist. It is a simple, claustrophobic tale of suspense and uncertainty, one of the main features of which is that among the group of people taking refuge is one who is every bit as big a monster as those things lurking unseen outside (played wonderfully by Marcia Gay Harden).Thomas Jane is the nominal hero (or, perhaps 'everyman' is better in this case), a poster artist who, to my delight, is painting a poster as the film opens showing Clint Eastwood as The Dark Tower's Roland (a quick plug for King's Dark Tower books here!). Just as much a hero is the unlikely Toby Jones in a terrific, but no doubt undersung performance.The monsters here are downright nasty, very well realised, and wholly convincing.King's novella ended on a note of uncertainty. Darabont reaches that point and takes us further forward, leading to one of the bleakest endings I can recall in a mainstream movie.This film works on all levels - horror, suspense thriller, slashfest, character study, social commentary. Well worth a couple of hours of your time if you don't mind gore and scares.",10,2,6,9 July 2008
Stardust," Tolerable translation
","Adapting a much-loved book for the screen is always a risky affair. On the rare occasion when it is done with a slavish regard for accuracy (Harry Potter 1, for example) the result can end up a little on the sterile side. On the other hand, a cavalier approach (Starship Troopers, Kubrick's The Shining) leads to part of the audience wondering how the point of the book could be missed. Even when an adaptation is regarded as successful, there can still be valid reservations (Gimli as light relief in Lord of the Rings, for example).I realise two things - one, it is often the case that changes have to be made because what works on the page doesn't work on screen and, two, the primary motivation of those who put up the not-inconsiderable funding to produce a mainstream feature film is to make profits. That means bums on seats. And that may mean you don't always cater to the sentiments of those who hold the source property particularly dear.I'm a big Neil Gaiman fan. The Charles Vess-illustrated version of Stardust sits proudly on my shelves and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It tells a fairy story in fairly traditional terms, but tells it with adult sensibilities. I'll confess that I haven't read it for a number of years, and I never did memorise it (although I do recollect that it had the single most effective use of profanity on the printed page which I have ever seen), so it follows that much of the detail is vague in my memory. I was therefore able to approach the film without excessive preconceptions.I saw it in a fairly full cinema with a friend and his young son. I don't recall ever being among an audience which contained so many women in their 30s before, which surprised me.This film satisfied that audience. It satisfied my friend and his son, and it satisfied me. I was surprised at the amount of humour - Gaiman recounts the story in the book in fairly straight-faced manner - and the humour all worked, and worked well: it didn't prevent the story being taken seriously, but it did lighten the tone. This was necessary, I think, because there is a need to maximise audiences, and this fairy story (the tale, as opposed to the telling) pitches as well towards children as it does towards adults. So why exclude a big chunk of audience from the cinema and DVD sales demographic? No, it's not a faithful adaptation. But, with the exception of the inclusion of humour - not necessarily a bad thing - it captured the flavour of the book, and was entertaining in its own right.",8,4,5,24 October 2007
The Elephant Man," A wonderful film
","Which to consider first, the story or the film? The story is a true one. John Merrick, horrifically disfigured by a rare medical condition, is rescued from circus freakdom and given a secure place to live by surgeon Frederick Treves, where he enjoys some real friendship before his relatively young death.This sad but moving story features some terrific performances. Anne Bancroft's Mrs Kendal is full of grace, Anthony Hopkins' Treves is dignified and compassionate if somewhat dour, but the ace in the pack is John Hurt's Merrick. Hurt himself more or less disappears beneath the prosthetics of Merrick's disfigurements, which makes his performance of quiet gentleness all the more remarkable.More remarkable still is the fact that this film is made by David Lynch. Known at this point for making films which were - how can I say this - off the wall, out of the mainstream, and difficult, it was a revelation to discover that Lynch had it in him to make a film which told a straightforward story as well as this one does.",9,0,0,19 March 2011
I Am Legend," Entertaining in its own right
","This variation on Richard Matheson's vampire plague story, retooled as a vehicle for Will Smith, has a lot going for it (and one very serious thing going against it).It is well-paced. It is entertaining. It has some stunning visualisations of Smith's post-plague life in a New York populated only by him during daylight hours. And it has Smith's performance: very much the macho protagonist, yet allowing us to see the sad, lonely, mourning man - bereaved not just for his family but for his species - who is clinging on to his sanity, barely, by his fingertips. There are places where I think that this may be Smith's best performance ever.And then there are the CGI zombie/vampires. They, I'm afraid, are awful - I have seen more convincing CGI in a third rate SyFy channel monster movie.And it's a pity, because convincing plague victims would have made this movie first rate.",8,0,0,8 July 2011
A Quiet Place," Excellent horror
","Savagely violent reptilian monsters have decimated the human race in short order. They are blind, and hunt by sound. So survivors the Abbott family (Mum, Dad, daughter Regan and sons Marcus and Beau live in remote woods in near silence. 15-year old Regan is profoundly deaf, so they all sign. Dad tries to build hearing aids for Regan, but does not have a good relationship with her following an incident early in the film. But Mom is pregnant and babies cry...This film, directed, co-written and starring John Krasinski and his real-life wife Emily is a simple idea, used to create 90 minutes of solid tension with a minimum of dialogue. The setting is very photogenic, the sound design is important and effective, and all the small cast are excellent.I should single out Millie Simmonds (deaf in real life), whose troubled Regan is unhappy, angry, and heart-breaking, and Noah Jupe, constantly in fear of the terrifying creatures which inhabit his world. The creatures are used sparingly and rarely glimpsed initially, but they are genuinely scary and nasty. They are never explained, but this doesn't really matter.There are other things which could do with some explanation, though - why is it necessary to go barefoot? How come the creatures can pick small domestic sounds out of the wealth of 'wild' sound in the natural world. These don't really matter, though, in a simple but powerful film with an exceptionally good tiny cast.Well done, John Krasinski.",9,4,6,1 May 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Adequate
","At the end of the third movie in the Jason Bourne trilogy, the whole Treadstone/Blackbriar organisation was crumbling around the ears of those behind it (or so we thought). While this was happening, it turns out that various other programmes were under way. One of these involves an operative called Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who finds himself caught in the knee-jerk reaction to close down all programmes and get rid of those involved in them. He narrowly survives an attempt to kill him, as does one of his doctors, Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) and, together, they go on the run in pursuit of his much needed medication.This movie has come in for some criticism, but I was quite happy with it for the most part. Cross has an inherent weakness compared to Bourne: it was reasonable to take Bourne as someone who had attained his abilities through training and conditioning, whereas Cross takes tablets which give him superpowers. The medication also put him in a Flowers For Algernon position whereby he will regress to musclebound idiot if he doesn't maintain his regime, but this potentially strong plot element isn't really concentrated on.Having said that, the narrative powers along well enough, the action sequences are all well staged, Renner impresses, Weisz snivels adequately, and there are enough unanswered questions left to fuel a sequel.",7,20,35,17 August 2012
22 Jump Street," Sweary bromance comedy
","Hapless cop partners Jenko and Schmidt are sent to college to root out drug suppliers. Shenanigans ensue.I am still not a big fan of Jonah Hill (although I am gradually warming to him as a non-comedic actor), but I am getting to be quite impressed by Channing Tatum. Jump Street 2 confirms that he is very good at comedy. This movie is not going to hold many surprises for anyone who saw the first one. It is quite funny throughout, with a lot of in-jokes, daft dialogue, and movie reference gags sprinkled along the way. It is, of course, quite daft, overflowing with profanity, and it makes the most of the chemistry between Hill and Tatum by turning the bromance between them into one of the plot points. It's not going to win Oscars, but it is an entertaining comedy in the modern tradition.I really liked the closing credits.",7,2,6,13 June 2014
Cars 2," May not be an easy ride for the very youngest
","Cars 2 does three things which Cars didn't.One, it moves the action outside hick town Radiator Springs to a variety of locations around the world.Two, it adds plot - an awful lot of it, and quite dense and textured, too.Three, it puts towtruck Mater at the centre of the action.All three of these changes are sensible, and made Cars 2 for me a more enjoyable movie than its predecessor.Mind you, I am an old git, and I'm not sure that the plotting is entirely a positive thing as far as a young audience is concerned - there is an awful lot of reliance on familiar elements from James Bond movies, for instance, without which the smallest audience members are going to find much of this to be quite difficult to follow. On the other hand, there is more of Mater whose child-like impulsiveness and good-heartedness (and slapstick tomfoolery) works on a very simple level.I enjoyed it, and I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the first one.",Null,1,2,31 July 2011
The Game," Excellent
","The 'paranoia thriller' is a formula-based movie genre - some individual has his or her nice comfortable life overturned by some external agent, usually with a malevolent motivation, which results in the poor victim / protagonist going on the run, with their entire support network (financial, social, residential, identity, everything) in tatters.The good thing about this particular formula is that it hasn't been overused. This means that films falling into this pattern (The Net, Pacific Heights) come across as fresh and pleasing. The Game is another good example. Nicholas (Michael Douglas), a hard-nosed business man, having cut himself off from his entire family through work, suddenly finds himself embroiled in the Game, given to him as a birthday present by his estranged brother Conrad (Sean Penn). As the conspiracy underpinning The Game becomes clearer, it destroys every element of Nicholas's life (and also Conrad's). Nicholas fights as best he can against this unstoppable and faceless conspiracy, but...This thriller is intelligent, fast-paced, exciting, and involving. All the cast are excellent, and Douglas succeeds in making the unlikeable Nicholas someone who we ultimately sympathise with. If you haven't seen it, it is well worth catching.",9,6,9,9 January 2012
Kick-Ass," Great if you're up for it
","This movie is going to upset some people. It is very violent, it is full of profanity, and much of the profanity comes from a pre-adolescent girl, and there is a great deal of moral questionability about it, all of which is tied up in a moderately humorous and fairly improbable tale of real-world teens taking up super-heroing.So if that's not your thing, I really can't recommend it.But if you enjoyed last year's Wanted, also adapted from a comic by Mark Millar, then it's likely that you'll enjoy this. The story is strong, the script is punchy and entertaining (although perhaps a little over-dependent on profanity), there is a lot of very well staged action, the characters are all fun, there are some enjoyable high school romance subplots, a great deal of comic culture texture, and there is a genuine sense of jeopardy driving much of what happens - it is entirely possible that anyone may get damaged for real.I greatly enjoyed it even though there are elements in it which worry me a little.",9,3,13,1 April 2010
Unknown," Please don't ask me to believe it, though...
","Liam Neeson is Dr Martin Harris, arriving in Berlin for some scientific thingie with hot wife January Jones. On returning to the airport to collect his forgotten briefcase, his taxi is in an accident. He wakes in hospital four days later with partial memory loss only to find, when he returns to his hotel, that Mrs Harris doesn't know him and there is another Mr Harris who, it appears, is the real one. The rest of the movie is devoted to him trying to prove who he is (with the assistance of illegal immigrant taxi driver Diane Kruger and ex-Stasi private detective Bruno Ganz), escaping various attempts to murder him, and discovering the truth (and the consequences of that discovery).This paranoia action thriller potters along reasonably well, and the reveal towards the end does explain the puzzles generated in the set-up. The problem is that there are still about a million unanswered questions of the 'Yes, but if that's the case, then why didn't they...?' Variety. The whole thing is vastly improbable, and the improbability is not helped by the fact that the film is incredibly po-faced - it takes itself far too seriously.To some extent this is inevitable given that much of it rests on the broad back of a similar persona to the one Neeson set up in Taken (a much better film), but I can't help feeling that if the film had romped, and revelled in its romping, then it would have been a better film, for the lack of credibility would have mattered less.",7,1,3,11 March 2011

A small group of scientists researching the paranormal (one of whom is, frankly, a charlatan conman) find that their day has come due to an outbreak of ghostly activity in New York, thus allowing them to put their research into practice. For money.This amusing premise is coupled with a razor-sharp script (which encompasses everything from wordplay to silliness, to character- and situation-based comedy), brilliant casting for both principal and secondary parts (in particular giving Bill Murray perhaps his finest hour) and what, for the time, were state of the art special effects.This film is great fun and hugely entertaining. Highly recommended.",Null,3,4,21 August 2011
Gran Torino," A clever combination
","I came out thinking Victor Meldrew meets Dirty Harry in The Shootist, but that's an unfair thought - an attempt to make something glib out of a film which definitely isn't glib.I was greatly surprised at how funny the movie is - the trailer had showed one or two of the snappy one-liners, but gave no idea of how laugh out loud funny much of the first two-thirds of this movie is. A lot of the humour derives from the outright curmudgeonliness and unashamed racism of Walt Kowalski, but far from all of it.And Kowalski isn't simply a two dimensional redneck throwback. He's a real person - unlikeable certainly, unapologetic about his prejudices definitely, and still carrying the mental scars of his part in the Korean War 50 years earlier. But he has a strong sense of right and wrong (in broad strokes), an affinity for those who relate to him in the same strong (manly, if you will) terms with which he journeys through life and, above all, a preparedness to transcend his prejudices and judge individuals on their merits.The humour which runs through the early part of the movie sits very easily with the strong drama which takes the story through to its conclusion - the two are complementary, not contradictory.I think this is one of Eastwood's very best movies and I enjoyed it a great deal.",10,2,7,17 March 2009
Shrek the Third," Diminishing returns
","Following the death of Fiona's father, and his installation as acting King (which he finds objectionable), Shrek heads off in search of a member of the bloodline to be installed as King.With this third instalment, the law of diminishing returns sets in. Yes, it is funny, and eye catching, and the voice talent does well (joined this time by Justin Timberlake as young Artie), but there is a feeling of having seen it all before. Some of the gags are clever (using Live And Let Die at the King's funeral as an oblique reference to Paul McCartney having done the Frog Song, for instance), but things are starting to feel a little stale.I would still say that it is worth seeing rather than not seeing, though.",7,1,2,30 December 2013
The Hurt Locker," Pretty good, but not easy
","I was late getting to The Hurt Locker - I'd wanted to see it at the cinema, but eventually caught up with it on DVD.It's a good film - of course it is, films don't win best film Oscars without being pretty good. I couldn't help comparing it with Jarhead - both films are windows into the war experiences of two individuals and more more character studies rather than action films (although both have action elements). The Hurt Locker was much more successful at engaging me with its characters than Jarhead was.It was interesting to see that the only well-known names played no more than short cameos. Jeremy Renner is going to go on to become a big name because of this, of course - I'm referring to Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse.I won't repeat praise of the performances, direction, sense of being in danger etc., but I will say that it very successfully conveyed two things to me - one, the queasy sense of an occupied country with foreign soldiers everywhere who are on a hair trigger and, two, the way that the experience of being in this situation creates a bond of camaraderie even between people who don't easily get on well together.",8,1,3,8 May 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Great fun, ah har!
","Jack Sparrow, drunk and with a shrunken Black Pearl in a bottle in his pocket, finds himself tasked with helping Will Turner's son Henry find the Trident of Poseidon which will enable him to lift the curse on Will, doomed to captain the Flying Dutchman. Having accidentally acquired the company of young female astronomer Carina, they find their quest dogged by savage anti-pirate undead spirit, Salazar, out for revenge against Sparrow.Johnny Depp's 5th outing as Jack Sparrow - sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow - marks a return to form. The first film was a surprise and delight. But, notwithstanding good moments, I felt each of the following films was more disappointing than the one before. Number 5 is pretty good, though.It has a strong story which is quite complicated, but well put together. And it deals with dangling threads from earlier films and resolves them satisfactorily. For that reason, I think it would be a fitting film with which to end the franchise - go out on a positive note!Depp can play Sparrow in his sleep by now, but Jack isn't really the main character here. There are plenty of funny lines for him, and good opportunities for drunken mincing, but this film is really Harry, Carina and Salazar. Like I said, there is quite a lot of story on board, and Jack Sparrow's share is quite small. Fortunately, Brenton Thwaites (Henry), Kaya Scodelario (Carina) and Xavier Bardem (Salazar) handle the heavy lifting well.The other cast members are, of course, more than reliable, from the familiar (Geoffrey Rush, Sparrow's crew etc.) to the new (David Wenham). The action set pieces are every bit as extravagant as we have become used to: the bank robbery is great fun, and the finale is excellent. The CGI is as good as one would expect - the skeletal sharks are hugely impressive, especially in 3D.And, like so many films this year, there is a strong emphasis on family. And that isn't just Harry Turner's family: a family connection turns up in the most unexpected place, and pays off beautifully.No one expected a theme park ride to provide the inspiration for a series of hit movies, but I have enjoyed all the Pirates films. This is the best since the original, and - for a number of reasons - it would be a fitting end to the series.",8,0,1,9 May 2018
Moulin Rouge!," Unique
","The wife dragged me along to Moulin Rouge when it first hit the cinemas. I didn't want to go. It did not appeal to me in the slightest.And then it started with a little bloke with a baton at the front, giving it some wellie as the 20th Century Fox fanfare played. And I was completely hooked.The introductory sequence featured a creepy take on Nature Boy and some dazzling (and funny visuals), and I was so deeply into it that I am still recovering ten years later.This film tells a melodramatic and tragic story set in the Toulouse Lautrec era Moulin Rouge, and does so by mixing and matching a vast array of theatrical, cinematic, musical, visual and storytelling styles. The music is largely contemporary, often with assorted songs cut up and snippets sewn together, and delivered brilliantly by the cast, especially Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor (although I must award bonus points for Jim Broadbent delivering an eye-boggling, but plot-relevant, version of Like A Virgin).The visuals are imaginative and dazzling. Richard Roxburgh is a terrific funny and scary pantomime villain.I remember people walking out of the cinema during the movie, and I can quite understand them doing so - it is not to everyone's taste. But, in its outrageous fusion of elements which should not work together (but which do), it is a unique film of immense bravery. And, best of all, it is highly entertaining.",10,2,2,14 August 2011
X-Men: Apocalypse," Solidly good
","The latest X-Men movie (excluding Logan) sees the new recruits (and some old friends) playing for high stakes. In the darkest X-men film yet we meet new villain Apocalypse, who is actually the oldest villain of all.In pre-Biblical Egypt, despotic mutant En Sabah Nur (who derives life and powers by parasitically transferring himself into new bodies from time to time) is betrayed during a transfer and buried alive, though dormant, for nearly 6,000 years. Reawoken in 1983, he needs to find powerful mutants to act as his henchmen: this coincides with Charles Xavier starting to use Cerebro to find pupils for his school, Mystique looking to rescue persecuted mutants, and Magneto enjoying family life.I was a little worried before going to see this, because I had heard suggestions that it wasn't that good. I've enjoyed all the previous X-Men films (yes, even the Wolverine origin one), and I've read a fair number of X-Men comics, so I was predisposed towards enjoyment but, still, you worry, don't you?I loved it. It's full of action, the plot is easy enough to follow but dense enough to satisfy, there are sufficient returning cast members to give a sense of continuity, and the new characters (and recast younger versions of characters from the first 3 films) all do well.All is not 100% wonderful, though - it is much darker than previous X-men films, for instance. There are deaths which are emotionally effective (by which I mean upsetting), and there is some imagery which, even in a 12A certificate film, could be regarded as a little disturbing. This is not an exciting family adventure movie (although it is exciting, Xavier's children are a family, and the whole thing is an adventure): it's a bit strong for the young and sensitive. And although the film runs two and a half hours, one wonders if there might be material left on the cutting room floor because, for instance, poor Olivia Munn as Psylocke gets fairly short shrift in what amounts to an underwritten cameo, despite looking exactly like her comics counterpart ie. seriously hot.But there is far more good than bad. Quicksilver's set piece steals the film again, much as it did in X-Men: Days Of Future Past. And there are two points - one of them hinted at in the trailer - which are cause for serious fangasms. Seriously. The unexpected one choked me up: I couldn't believe what I was seeing on screen.Which begs a question as to whether it is possible to enjoy the film if you haven't seen the previous X-Men movies or read any of the comics? Well, I spoke to someone who had just seen it, but hadn't seen any of the previous films, and he said that he thoroughly enjoyed it. So that's two points of view for the price of one.My verdict: as an established X-Men fan, both comics and movies, I would give this a full 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,30 May 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," First rate
","Peter Parker continues to enquire into his parents' disappearance while being pitted against electrical supervillain Electro.My view of this film's predecessor was pretty half-hearted - I wasn't terribly keen on a rebooted origin movie so soon after the previous trilogy, and I didn't think Curt Connors/The Lizard was either that good a villain or particularly well realised. This second episode makes it clear that we are looking at a story arc which runs over all three films, and puts to rest all the misgivings - yes, all of them - which I had after the first movie.Specifically - Electro is a much better villain, there are some terrific action set pieces, I actually liked Sally Field in a film for the first time ever, and there is a lot of emotion here. My one criticism is that the film is continued past its obvious conclusion point. I don't want to say more for fear of spoilering.I really enjoyed this, and I am greatly looking forward to part 3.",9,7,20,17 April 2014
Ex Machina," Intelligent sci-fi suspense thriller
","Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson) is a programmer who is invited by his boss, genius whizzkid Nathan (Oscar Isaac), to his inaccessible remote super-duper hi-tech home/research centre. It turns out that Nathan has created a female robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander), and wants Caleb to test-drive her Artificial Intelligence with a view to establishing whether 'she' is actually self-aware and intelligent, as opposed to merely simulating this due to her programming and AI routines.Written and directed by Alex Garland (who has both pluses and minuses in my book), this film has a lot going for it. An interesting science fiction premise acquires a suspense thriller element to its plot, and the dialogue has an air of intelligence to it rather than being mere sci-fi buzz-phrases. There are a lot of twists and turns in what is essentially a relatively straightforward three-hander set in a single location. It is a good looking film (largely due to the location, but the cinematography is pretty impressive, too), with excellent performances from the three principals and also Sonoya Mizuno as Nathan's mute Japanese maid Kyoko. The special effects with which Ava is realised are impressive: although showy, you disregard them almost immediately as the characterisation is so good.If I have a criticism, it is that the film drags slightly in places.",8,7,23,23 January 2015
Back to the Future Part III," Going Back To The Future shows how good part 3 is
","Like many others, BTTF3 didn't have the immediate impact for me which its two predecessors had, leading to a sense of disappointment. Hindsight gives me some idea why this may be so.I think it is because the three time eras visited in the first movies are all within my frame of reference, but the Wild West is not. Once I put that to one side, I see what a worthy conclusion to the trilogy we have.The plotting is absolutely fantastic - there are so many interlocking elements here, pieced together with the precision of a piece of fine machinery. Choosing such a completely different time era - and one which has been immortalised in hundreds of westerns - provides a whole new playground for gags, visual reference, plot anchors and so on. And the decision to add a love interest for Doc to the story offers a welcome change to Marty's familial complications, as well as giving the movie (and the series) a much needed heart - and Mary Steenburgen fits into the established cast as if she had been there from the start.And the finale, which draws together elements from all three films and provides several payoffs within the space of under five minutes, is perfect. Simply perfect.",9,2,2,15 October 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," You might like it if you're 13 and female
","I freely admit that, despite my having a more than passing acquaintance with vampire and werewolf movies over the years, the fact that I am a 57 year old straight male means that I am probably not part of the target audience for the Twilight Saga. Not to worry, the cinema was full of female pubescent teenies. And me.I also freely admit that, not only have I not read the books, I have no plans to do so. I did, however, see the first movie. Accordingly, I shan't be addressing 'this didn't happen in the book' or 'they left this bit out' - I shall simply be commenting on the movie.As I recall from the first one, 107-year-old Edward is a member of a family of 'good' (ie. they don't feed on humans) vampires. Seated next to new girl and terminal miseryguts Bella at high school, he is so taken with her sullen demeanour that he absconds and treats her very rudely, just to show her how much he instantly loves her. After initially misinterpreting his rudeness as rudeness, she comes to realise that the irritation she thought she felt is also actually love, and thus begins one of the great classic (and highly improbable) romances of our time, Part 2, New Moon (a title which has no significance whatsoever) starts with Edward being beset by guilt. Bella wants him to turn her into a vampire but Edward, not wanting to destroy her immortal soul, dumps her. He goes off to mope around the world while she takes up with the local werewolf. As you do. Meanwhile Edward, under the mistaken impression that Bella has died, seeks permission from the Vampire High Command to end his existence. Bella arrives in time to save his life, the two of them are reconciled, and episode two finishes with a decision to vampirise Bella after she graduates.What can I tell you about this load of old tosh? Well, let me start by saying that the only action undertaken by any of the main characters which I found convincing was Edward's decision to selflessly try to set Bella on a life away from vampires. Otherwise, none of these people behaves even slightly credibly at any time.There are three or four action sequences which, though short, are decently done. The special effects aren't bad.Apart from the action sequences, the film is deadly dull - it's really difficult to stay awake. The material covered could have been told more succinctly (and more interestingly) in 45 minutes less. It's boring.Dakota Fanning has a small part. I didn't recognise her. And she wasn't very good.Graham Greene has a small part. He looks embarrassed throughout, as well he might.Michael Sheen was (as usual) rather good.And, as in the first one, the character Bella is so woefully glum that you wonder why Edward wants anything at all to do with her, let alone be with her for eternity. But I had one of those realisations which strikes you like a thunderbolt. Bella is the audience. Because this stuff is wish fulfilment romantic fantasy for impressionable teen girls, Bella is written for maximum audience identification as a teen who gets the hot guy despite being full to overflowing with angst. This was pointed up when Edward delivered the final line: this was clearly eagerly awaited by the teenies in the audience who whooped, hollered, and burst into spontaneous applause.To me, this was more horrifying than any vampire or werewolf activity in the movie!",4,8,14,25 November 2009
The Illusionist," Thumbs up
","In 19th century Vienna, cabinet maker's son Edward becomes friends with young aristocrat Sophie, but they are separated due to the class difference. Years later they meet as adults when Edward is a stage illusionist and Sophie is on the point of becoming engaged to deeply unpleasant Crown Prince Leopold. They are in love, but can they ever be together? The Illusionist succeeds on nearly every level. The story is solid, and well told through the police Inspector who is involved at every stage, the cast are uniformly excellent, and the whole thing is handsomely mounted - this is a beautiful looking film.I have one reservation (a mild one in the context of the film overall) but it involves spoilering the film, so look away now. Unlike the contemporaneous The Prestige, the magic in this film is supposedly all illusion. I would therefore have liked to know how Edward achieved the illusion of the small boy walking round the theatre apparently exchanging communicative glances with patrons - I can't think how that could be done with current technology!",9,1,1,12 September 2010
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Norrin Radd rules!
","Yes, if you liked 1 you'll like 2 and if you didn't, you won't (and you won't like it if you expect to see the source material faithfully reproduced without tweakage). And I didn't see any Galactus helmet silhouette anywhere apart from a couple of points where I kind of almost persuaded myself a bit that I might have seen something which kind of reminded me a bit of what it might look like if it had been there except maybe I was just imagining it.But what of the film itself? Well, don't expect any deep themes - there's the underlying theme of family, of course, but it's gentle and understated. And don't expect profound subtext - there's Johnny taking on some responsibility when it counts, of course, and the Surfer fighting his 'programming' in order to do the right thing, but these are simply part of the story, and not nailed up as an object lesson.They got the group dynamic right in the first film, and that still holds strongly in this one - no messing with a successful bit of the formula. Doom - well, I simply have to get used to the fact that the Dr Doom in these movies is an entirely different character to the one in the comics. An OK villain, but a lightweight. And he doesn't speak with a Bela Lugosi accent.Galactus - I can cope with the cloud. It works, in this context. The film has a cosmic menace, but it deals with it by reference to its effect on people. You get a glimpse of the cosmicness, but the people are the important thing.The Surfer is nailed perfectly. They have captured the air of injured nobility, of tragic predetermination, in both Doug Jones' physical performance and Laurence Fishburne's voice-over. This is Norrin Radd, in every way. And for those who raised the Chrome Surfer criticism, that's dealt with too - he is indeed silver for much of the film, it's only when he's powered up that he becomes reflective.Don't expect depth, expect fun - 92 minutes of action-packed Fantastic Four comic. This is EXACTLY what I would expect a comic movie to give me. It is much more entertaining than the overly angst-ridden Spidey 3. My parents, who rated FF1 very highly (more so than the Spidey movies, and on a par with the X-Men movies) will love it, my son (23) loved it, and I loved it too.",9,50,85,18 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Very good
","I must be honest, I was ready to dislike this film. Notwithstanding the intriguing premise, the mixed reviews I had read had me expecting a degree of cleverness for its own sake, slowness, and excessive sentimentality.Well, it is clever, particularly technically. It is a long film - much time taken to tell what is essentially a small story, notwithstanding the fact that it spans over 80 years - but the telling is leisurely rather than slow. But it is never sentimental. Emotional, yes, but never sentimental.I was thoroughly engaged throughout, and came out having enjoyed it a great deal more than I had expected to. Among the parts that I enjoyed were Tilda Swinton's unfulfilled Englishwoman (and I especially liked the late, and unexpected, capstone to her story arc) and the engagement with the U-Boat.Pitt and Blanchett are both excellent, as you'd expect, but everyone else is pretty good too. The visuals are also first rate - not so much as regards the ageing effects and makeup (though they are astonishing) more as regards the period and location detail).Nice to note that Twist and Shout was the actual Ed Sullivan live recording - and it sounded really good over the cinema sound system! My one major criticism is the sound in the first half hour or so - I found it really difficult to make out the dialogue, although it improved greatly from there on.And the sadness - which was built into the story from the very start - wasn't about the deaths of the two main characters, it was about how short a time these two people had together and the tragic - but right - decision that Banjamin took when Caroline was small.An excellent film.",8,1,4,19 February 2009
Transformers," Big goofy fun

A performance drawn from the Jack Nicholson School of Subtlety.Shia LaBoeuf - going to be a big star. A lot of screen presence.Effects - mucho eye candy extremely well done.Yup. Put brain on hold, and enjoy.",8,4,6,26 July 2007
Hidden Figures," Entertaining portrayal of an interesting time
","Three brilliant people aim to have great careers at NASA. But this is 1961. And they are women. And black.Our three women - and I use the word 'our' because this film is so effective at helping you to identify with them - are maths whiz Katherine (Taraji P Henson), trailblazing computer programmer Dorothy (Viola Davis), and engineer Mary (Janelle Monae). All three are gifted beyond even their contemporaries at NASA, but all three are held back by the double 'handicaps' of sex and colour. This film tells their stories.There are several stories here - as well as the individual stories of the three women, there is also the story of fighting to get John Glenn into orbit and safely returned to Earth, and a variety of what would be called sub-plots if this were fiction.But it isn't fiction. Dramatised for the screen, yes, but the substance here is true, and it is sobering to realise that the colour bar in the USA was fully operational so recently.For all that we are presented with a dispiriting picture of how things were, we are never lectured to. This film is rich and heartwarming, helped by the portrayal of these three great women whose achievements and real-life pictures are shown with the end credits. These are strong characters, nicely drawn. We like them, and are pleased to see that their abilities and achievements are finally recognised. The performances here are all good - the principals hold the film, of course. but Kevin Costner as the Head of the Mission Control maths department is another sympathetic character, while Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons are effectively less so.The period detail is good. The film is paced well, subject only to a bit too much time given to Katherine's half-mile runs to the toilet. And there is quite a lot of humour. For a two-hour film, the time never drags. And, for a film which addresses a worthy, socially important subject, it never forgets to be entertaining.I enjoyed this rather more than some of the other Best Film contenders for this year's Oscars.",7,1,2,15 May 2018
Coco," Succeeds on all levels
","Music is banned in Miguel's household after his musical great-grandfather abandoned his great-grandmother and her young daughter. On Mexico's Day Of The Dead festival, a convoluted series of events sees Miguel transported to the Land of the Dead, where he discovers that the dead disappear when no-one remembers them. He also discovers that unless he returns to the land of the living by dawn, he will join the dead. And there are problems ahead!The story here is very artificially structured, with all sorts of bits and pieces present s that a predetermined trail of events can be created. But you never notice that, so natural is the narrative flow. This film is highly original, full of truly gorgeous visuals, lovely songs, delightful characters, and touching resolutions to several individual story threads. And yet it appeared in the UK with no publicity, trailers, or warnings whatsoever, and my local multiscreen didn't even get it in 3D despite the fact that it is clear that the 3D would be dazzling.This is as good as any Pixar film over the last several years, and better than most.",10,125,143,1 May 2018
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," A visual delight, with real heart
","I really enjoyed this movie. It is based on a well-loved book, I am told, but as I've never heard of it, I'm just going on the movie.The story is simple but daft. Flint Lockwood lives on a small island which has fallen on hard times since the decimation of the sardine fishing industry. Flint is a brilliant but not very successful amateur scientist whose inventions cause trouble and embarrass Flint's father no end (Dad, who talks exclusively in fishing metaphors, simply wants Flint to join him in the family fishing tackle shop). Novice TV reporter Sam Sparks is sent to report on the opening of Sardine World, and her arrival coincides with an accident in which Flint destroys Sardine World but finally achieves success with an invention which turns water into food. Then things get complicated...The story develops nicely and steadily, with no dead patches. Both Flint and Sam are likable and vulnerable, and the romance between them is believable and pleasing. There are lots of gags, both verbal and visual, including some which payoff much later in the movie from quite small seeds planted earlier. The 3D is excellent, with some sequences quite stunning. And the film bursts with visual imagination - I can't remember a movie which displayed this much imagination for a long time.But most of all, the heart of this movie (to me, at any rate), is the dysfunctional relationship between Flint and his Dad, and the heartwarming resolution of this is one of the most satisfying parts of the movie's conclusion.There is a lot in this film for both adults and children, and I recommend it.",9,3,6,23 September 2009
Lincoln," Earnest, worthy, quite good, with wonderful Day-Lewis
","Just when he should be thinking about slowing down and taking it a bit more easy, middle-aged Abe finds himself tasked with sorting out a long running dispute between two sets of neighbours, while simultaneously trying to stop one of those sets of neighbours from taking advantage of a group of immigrants, and all this in the face of being nagged by his sharp-tongued wife.OK, so I've synopsised Steven Spielberg's Lincoln as if it was an episode of a long running sit-com, which is unfair of me. It's a reaction to the fact that I went to see Lincoln because I thought I ought to, not because I wanted to. After all, as a Brit, what interest could I possibly have in USA history (apart, possibly from that War of Independence bit where the tenants threw out the landlord)?Notwithstanding having seen the trailer a number of times, my preconceptions were wrong. This is not a biography of Lincoln. It is not even a view of the Civil War. Instead, it is a view of the concentrated period leading up to the passing of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution abolishing slavery, detailing the horse-trading needed to get the necessary votes, the pressure to get the Amendment passed before peace negotiations with the South begin in earnest, the unlikely alliances needed to achieve this, and Lincoln's role as a consummate politician within all this.Unfortunately, it does get sidetracked from time to time with additional pressures arising from Lincoln's family (Sally Field, who I normally loathe, is rather good as Mrs Lincoln, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is grossly under-used as son Robert): I felt this could all have been omitted with little significant effect on the film, which otherwise held my attention and entertained me throughout. Yes, it is earnest and, yes, it is worthy, but it is also enjoyable.Tommy Lee Jones steals every scene he is in, and Daniel Day-Lewis stakes his claim to the 2012 Best Actor Oscar. If he wins, it is because he deserves to.",8,3,6,6 February 2013
Rules of Engagement," Very good military courtroom drama
","Samuel L Jackson plays an experienced US Marine officer who is in charge of evacuating the US Embassy in the Yemen. When the crowd opens fire and Marines are killed, Jackson orders retaliation. It subsequently appears as if he has opened fire on unarmed civilians, and it is expedient for the government to hang him out to try. He calls upon Tommy Lee Jones (whose life he saved in Vietnam) to defend him, and the stage is set for a courtroom drama.As courtroom dramas go, this is quite a good one. Jackson and Jones are heavyweights and punch their weight here, aided by Guy Pearce as the prosecution advocate, Ben Kingsley as the Ambassador, and Bruce Greenwood as the duplicitous State Department official who wants a scapegoat in order to safeguard his own position.The story is good, the performances are good and, apart from one unnecessary and improbable punch up, the film is well presented.Recommended.",8,2,5,4 February 2012
Casualties of War," Harrowing but brilliant
","Casualties Of War dramatises a single event from the Vietnam war, where a squad of US soldiers abduct a Vietnamese girl and take her with them on patrol for the purposes of 'recreation,' raping and eventually killing her. Sean Penn is the leader of the squad and Michael J Fox plays the only member who consistently speaks out against their actions and tries to help the girl, eventually becoming the lone voice which tries to get justice for her.It has been some years since I last watched this film, but simply recalling it for the purpose of writing these words chokes me up: the events of the first part of the film are profoundly disturbing and utterly heartbreaking, and credit to Thuy Thu Le, in her only film role, for portraying victim Oanh with such power and dignity.But credit must also go to Penn for his angry sergeant, shaken free from any moral compass he may once have had, and especially to Fox: his principled everyman shows that he was never the lightweight that his succession of light roles may have suggested.And credit, too, to director Brian De Palma - for once not trying to emulate Hitchcock, he has here produced an accomplished and moving drama which poses profound moral issues and leaves you wondering whether you would have had the courage to make a moral stand.",9,4,5,8 November 2012
Event Horizon," Interesting
","Event Horizon is an interesting and unusual movie. It is a straight blend of supernatural horror with hard science fiction (as opposed to, say, Alien, which is a science fiction horror movie ie. the horror derives from the science fiction).The rescue spaceship Lewis & Clark is sent to rescue the Event Horizon which went missing years before, having pioneered a faster-than-light drive. When they board it, there is lots of blood, but no people. And then they start seeing things. Horrible, horrible things...This movie has lots of sci-fi hardware - it is reminiscent of Alien in terms of what the spacecraft interiors look like, and set design and effects (makeup, physical, photographic etc.) are fine.The cast, and performances are also fine - it is an A list cast (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill etc.) so one would expect no less.The text of the film is never specific as to what extent the supernatural crosses over with the scientific into real life - we could be witnessing hallucinations or something real. I think it doesn't matter - what matters is the effect of such manifestations. This is a 'last man standing' film.By its own standards, it works well.",Null,0,0,19 September 2011

What I didn't realise was that it is a super-hero origin story (or, rather, a super-team origin story). And, for me, it had everything – great characters, emotional depth, and terrific action. It had heart – something I always love in a film - genuine jeopardy, and a sense of joy in its super-heroics that last year's drab, depressing Man Of Steel couldn't even sniff at.Oh, and it's very funny, too.And I was delighted to see that a flyover of the animated city of San Fransokyo clearly showed the small beach where I paddled last year on a holiday which took in San Francisco.Highly Recommended.",9,36,52,6 February 2015

Or showbiz success in Hollywood. Or not. For two and a half hours. Until she finds out she's mad and kills herself. Or not.

The man is a master at extracting wonderful performances from an excellent cast in pursuit of a personal vision which is unfathomable to anyone with a brain which functions even vaguely normally.I will try to illustrate how this Lynch film works by way of adopting similar tactics in this review. By which I mean that everything starts relatively accessibly and one can follow what's going on. Then there is an abrupt armchair into medication, and you are left trying to submarine Sausalito carnivorous sandwich clerk, not to mention repetition repetition exquisite lamp-post. You expect it to all come together and toothpaste sense, but beautifully crafted make your own fireplace of it at the end.You might find such a thing an amazing work of art: I do not.",3,2,6,9 November 2013
Dumb and Dumber," Hysterical
","Jim Carrey can be an acquired taste. His style of physical, face-pulling humour does not suit every film in which he has applied it.Dumb And Dumber is not one of those - the humour here is ideally suited to Carrey's style.The revelation, though, is Jeff Daniels. This may well have been the movie Carrey was building up to since the first Ace Ventura movie and, to that extent, is no great surprise on his CV. For Daniels, however, this movie is completely out of left field, and he is absolutely brilliant.It is tempting to go on and explain why this is so, but there is a much better solution - go and watch the movie! If you're prepared to spend time with a couple of intensely stupid, but essentially good hearted, men, neither of whom realises how stupid they are, behaving incredibly stupidly (but very very funnily), then you'll get what I mean far better than if I try to explain it.",9,2,3,26 July 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Excellent
","We already knew that war is not a good thing, that the Holocaust was not a good thing, and that the Nazi death camps were a particularly bad thing. But this film delivers that message in a fresh and engaging way, which makes the bleak ending all the more powerful when it arrives.It isn't possible to duplicate the book's narrative style in which the reader sees depths which the child protagonist cannot, and the film opts for a straightforward dramatic adaptation. Even so, the viewer still clearly witnesses events from young Bruno's viewpoint, and understands why he acts as he does at the end.The cast is uniformly excellent, and shows that Britain can indeed produce child actors of genuine depth (which is not to discount the adult performances).A harrowing movie, but well worth seeing.",Null,1,1,24 January 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Betrayal, and not a Star Wars film
","The New Order has the Republic, now the Rebellion, on the run. General Leia Organa's small resistance force has been discovered. Their only hope is Force-newbie Rey finding hermit-like Luke Skywalker and persuading him to pass on his Jedi knowledge to a new generation.I must start by saying that I hate togive spoilers, but it is difficult to assess this film fairly without doing so to some extent.
The Force Awakens, episode VII, was a huge commercial success, but was - fairly - accused of revisiting the story from A New Hope. Does episode VIII avoid that accusation? Up to a point. You don't have to look too closely to see echoes of The Empire Strikes Back, though.The Force Awakens successfully passed the torch to a new generation, but left many unanswered questions. The Last Jedi opens with a terrific action set-piece - dammit, Poe IS a hotshot flyboy! - but then we want to have some questions answered. Who is Rey and why is she connected to the Force? Why did Kylo Ren turn rogue? Who is Snoke? How did his connection to the Force arise? Why does he have those hideous scars? How did he get his hooks into Ren? What does Finn do next?
This film addresses NONE of these questions except in the most unsatisfactory way.It provides spectacular visuals which, of course, we expect. It gives us a host of cute aliens, robots, and tech generally. It gives us some humour. This is unusual for a Star Wars film. It would be welcome if it were not generally so misplaced. It does not help the film to have the evil General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) portrayed as a slapstick bumbling buffoon.The Last Jedi has two egregious faults. The first is narrative sloppiness. This is especially noticeable in the casino heist/Benicio del Toro sequence which is completely inconsequential and irrelevant. It should never have been part of the film. It goes nowhere, adds nothing and, with minimal rewriting, could have been cut. The film would still have run over two hours, but a good deal less than its bloated 153 minutes. The film is not well-paced.The second flaw is a wilful re-writing of Luke Skywalker's character. Luke has always been a hero, even when he was a callow, inexperienced youth. To revise him into someone who turns his back on doing the Right Thing, notwithstanding the provocation, is a betrayal of the audience. We have invested much in this character, over many years, and this is not playing fair with us.Oh, and while we're at it, John Boyega must be hugely disappointed: Finn was hardly in it.In short, the narrative does not flow well, the story is underwhelming, we don't get the answers we wanted to questions, and characters are inconsistent with earlier versions. And, as a result, The Last Jedi is a disappointment.",5,70,106,2 May 2018
Brave," Very good, but not great
","Pixar's latest feature tells of Merida (voiced by Kelly McDonald), the daughter of mediaeval Scots chieftain Fergus (Billy Connolly) and his wife Elinor (Emma Thompson). Fergus is happy to indulge his firstborn's tomboy inclinations, but Elinor is minded that the girl will need to wed in order to provide a bond between potentially warring clans. The trouble is that Merida has a mind and will of her own and, when she meets the possibility that there might be a magical solution to changing her mother's single-mindedness, well, that's a difficult temptation to resist, isn't it? There is much to enjoy here - it is a visual feast, the characters are all entertaining and well conceived and realised, and the basic idea (much of which recalls the conflict between Ariel and Triton in The Little Mermaid) contains sufficient drama, conflict and suspense to drive the narrative.The trouble is that I think the script may not have been as thoroughly worked as is normally the case with Pixar because, after an engaging opening, there are far too many flat areas, times when I found myself thinking that I got the point, now get on with it (Merida and Elinor escaping from the castle, for one). And I also found myself wishing for a bigger and better payoff. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed it but, knowing what Pixar is capable of, I thought the film's heart was not as strong as it should have been.Merida's hair is, however, absolutely wonderful, and she is the latest in a line of animated heroines with whom I am totally besotted.",8,3,5,17 August 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," This is FUN, d'you hear me? FUN.
","Peter Quill, abducted by intergalactic scavengers as a child, finds himself in possession of a mysterious orb which attracts widespread (and unwelcome) interest. Unwillingly accompanied by a small and ragtag band of oddballs, Quill must reluctantly adopt a role for which has never previously regarded himself as equipped: a hero.Based on one of their less well known comics properties, the latest movie from Marvel Studios is a part of the Marvel cinematic universe, although it is unlikely to be clear immediately (other than to expectant speculating comic fans) to what extent. This does not matter: this is a fine standalone movie, best looked upon as the sort of thing a Star Wars movie would have been if a) it had an entertaining plot, b) George Lucas could write dialogue, and c) it remembered to be fun.The story is fun, the eye candy is fabulous, and the script is crisp and often laugh out loud funny. But the thing which makes this film is the characters. The band of 5 'Guardians', based closely on the comics, work perfectly both in isolation and as a group, starting as warring individuals and growing into a team. Chris Pratt does well as the fundamentally decent but hardly heroic Quill - a likable character, with more to him than simply being a good-looking protagonist. Zoe Saldana's Gamora carries some baggage as does Dave Bautista's Drax. Bautista who, I understand is a wrestler, delivers a particularly well-rounded character: superficially one-note, there are great depths here, conveyed well, in a performance which manages to be both funny and tragic, sometimes at the same time. But the two favourites here are quite definitely Rocket (a genetically modified raccoon with anger management issues, voiced by Bradley Cooper), and a walking tree called Groot (his three-word vocabulary voiced by Vin Diesel). Their interdependent relationship is a joy, and Groot simply owns all the movie's best moments.The 3D is completely unessential and adds little.Did I say this movie was fun? It is.",9,4,10,5 August 2014
Evil Dead," Routine gory horror
","Her brother David, his girlfriend Natalie, and friends Eric and Olivia take Mia to the family cabin in remote woods so that she can go cold turkey with her drug addiction. Unfortunately, we know that the cabin has recently been broken into and used as a venue for exorcising a demonic presence, and those carrying out that ritual have rather thoughtlessly left behind the book containing the ritual needed to summon the demonic thingummy back again. Even more unfortunately, Eric is the sort of idiot who not only finds it necessary to cut off the barbed wire which is used to bind the book - a bit of a hint there, together with the DO NOT READ THIS messages written all over it - but then to read out the ritual. And the demonic wotsit, which decides to take up residence in Mia - who is already having a fairly miserable time even before all this - isn't very nice.Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead more or less singlehandedly created the 'video nasty' genre in the UK. But that was back in 1981, and the film which resulted in cries for blanket bannings was given away free with a newspaper not so very long ago, so I suppose it's not unreasonable to expect a remake 30 years on - produced, it appears, by Raimi himself and also the star of the original Bruce Campbell. And some other bloke.The posters for this movie contain a lot of 'Scariest film ever'-type quotes. Well, if you've never seen a horror film before, maybe that's the case. I will say this - it is very gory, and there are a handful of made-you-jump moments, plus some very loud sounds. But it contains no real surprises (even without seeing the original), nor even much of a sense of menace. It is a serviceable but unexceptional horror in the modern manner.How does it compare with the original? Well, the original had the benefit of being exactly that - original. Despite looking dated in terms of its effects (and not to mention being made on a budget of ninepence) Raimi's movie blazed a new trail which many others have subsequently followed. That is not the case here, although the new version shows clear evidence of more money having been spent on it. Also, hindsight shows Raimi's movie to have had a darkly comedic edge to it (perhaps not obvious in 1981), whereas I suspect it is unlikely that anyone will be discovering humour in the remake in 2043.",7,5,21,19 April 2013
The Imitation Game," First rate
","During World War II, brilliant mathematician Alan Turing is engaged on breaking the German Enigma code which involves pioneering computer work. Unfortunately, Turing is homosexual in an age where homosexuality is illegal, and there are those who seek to bring him down by whatever means possible.This film is very good. The race to get Turing's computer to crack the Enigma code before the project is shut down is inherently exciting, and the behind-the-scenes machinations are also interesting. The period detail is good, as is the script, and the supporting cast are all first rate. The sequences of young Turing at boarding school are well done with Alex Cawther making the teenage Turing sympathetic, and Keira Knightley puts in a good performance as Turing's temporary fiancée.But this is Benedict Cumberbatch's film. He conveys Turing's genius, arrogance, social ineptitude (undoubtedly fixed somewhere in the autism spectrum) and sometime mental anguish perfectly. It is a towering performance and, I hope will be nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. If so, it stands a very good job of winning.This is an excellent film.",9,6,12,21 November 2014

","Newlywed ogres Shrek and Fiona travel (accompanied by Donkey) to visit her parents, the King and Queen of Far Far Away. They fall foul of a Fairy Godmother who wishes her son to marry the Princess and is prepared to use assassin Puss In Boots to achieve her goal.Shrek 2 is very good, but it is not as good as its predecessor. For one thing, the startling originality is now second hand. For another, the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming are unpleasant and have few laughs.On the positive side, Puss in Boots (and Antonio Banderas' silkily menacing vocalisation) is an absolute delight, and Julie Andres and John Cleese are very good as the King and Queen.This is well worth seeing, but don't expect it to be as good as the first one.",8,0,1,30 December 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Ticked a number of wrong boxes
","Much of this film annoyed me. I didn't mind the violence (mostly comic-book style apart from the initial vicious encounter with Vivica Fox). I didn't mind the switching of styles (anime, monochrome, Hong Kong kung fu movie etc.).I did mind, however, that it was all style and no substance. At no point did I care in the slightest what happened to this woman because I knew nothing about her. And that lack of emotional investment fatally marred the movie for me, to the extent that I didn't bother to see Volume 2 when it came out (although I did see it later....) Plus it really annoyed me (really really really) that she should wheel her atrophied legs from her room to the hospital parking lot, spend long enough lying in the back of the truck for there to be a detailed flashback (I think the caption was '12 hours later') and, in those 12 hours, not only did no-one come looking for the missing patient with the 2 dead bodies in her room, but the wheelchair she left outside the truck vanished. Tarantino's strength is supposed to be his writing, and this distracting detail was the result of lazy, lazy scriptwriting.But Volume 2? Aha...",5,3,5,2 April 2008
Saw II," The law of diminishing returns
","After the original Saw movie proved so successful, the producers came to the conclusion that the reason for its success was not the original script and intense, claustrophobic suspense engendered by the awful predicament of the two protagonists. No, it was because of the Jigsaw killers ingenious and gory methods of despatching his chosen victims. And so number two in the series - and all the subsequent numbers - involved assorted victims enmeshed in a series of predicaments which required savage and bloody self-sacrifice in order to stand a chance of survival.Tobin Bell, as Jigsaw, is the main link with the original film, but the movie establishes mild ongoing plot links backwards and forwards. But mostly it eschews the brilliance of its forbear for a formula which then holds for the remainder of the series.One question - the planning and expense must be huge: is it really worth it? And fancy being so Machievellian that you are plotting such traps 6 films ahead! OK, two questions.",7,0,3,6 October 2012
From Dusk Till Dawn," Sewing machine
","There is no reason not to make a film which leaps abruptly from one genre to another. From Dusk Till Dawn leaps from the hard-boiled crime thriller to the gory vampire monster movie at the halfway mark, and does it so blatantly (seamlessly? I think not!!) that you can see the stitch marks.The reason why this genre-switching manoeuvre is not done more often is because, to anybody with any sense, it would appear that the result is not going to satisfy the enthusiasts of either genre and, given that the object of the exercise is bums on seats, maybe this is not the way to maximise the box office take.Of course, closer examination of those cases where genre-jumping has taken place - Moulin Rouge, Back to the Future 3 come to mind - the results have often been critically and commercially pleasing.In this case, I love the outrageous abandon with which the new genre is embraced. I don't care for the Tarantino character, and I don't care for the way the slightly less odious Clooney character shapes up as a kind of hero only by virtue of not being a vampire.But the ride is fun.And, even if it wasn't, the whole thing would be worth sitting through solely for the Santanico Pandemonium sequence - I would sell my children into slavery for the pleasure of sipping a good brandy from her navel (don't condemn me too readily: you haven't met my children!)",Null,5,7,5 October 2007
Here Comes the Boom," Much better than I expected
","Forty-something overweight slacker teacher Scott (Kevin James) is upset to learn that, because of budget cuts, the music programme at his school is to close and music teacher Marty (Henry Winkler) will lose his job just as his wife has become pregnant at 48. So, after a couple of false starts, Scott buckles down to generate the $48,000 necessary to keep the music department going - by cage fighting, where you get paid even if you lose.From the films I have seen Kevin James in, I don't rate him - I have always found him a functional actor: he wears the costume and says the lines, but brings nothing else of any significance to his roles. So I was not expecting anything very much from this movie, especially given the ridiculous plot.And yet I really enjoyed it. Kevin James brings a niceness to Scott - for all the lack of motivation in his work at the start of the film, the determination he shows to help Marty keep his job carries through into his work, and he both finds himself and also connects with his students (not to mention with fellow teacher Salma Hayek, who rejects his constant advances more or less throughout the film). After a dodgy start, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments (not particularly tasteful, admittedly) and a lot of smiling nearly all the way through. Winkler and Hayek have great fun, there is excellent support from Gregg Germann, Charice, and Bas Rutten, and James does a good job of holding the whole thing together.If you fancy a feelgood comedy based on Rocky crossed with The Blackboard Jungle, you could do worse than this.Incidentally, I don't know whether the title means something in the USA, but it means nothing in England.",8,3,5,16 November 2012
Clash of the Titans," Quite good. Ish.
","Ray Harryhausen's brand of fantasy was very much to my taste. Harryhausen was cutting edge at the time, but the cutting edge has moved on and I have long wondered what would be the results if Harryhausen's films were to be revisited using state of the art CGI.Now we have the answer.This film, though quite clearly based on Harryhausen's original, plays fast and loose with some elements of it but, since the original played fast and loose with myth (both versions feature the Kraken, from Norse myth, for instance) I don't suppose one can complain too much.There are things to like and things to regard as less than wonderful. Things to like - the effects, for a starter. They are excellent. Mythological monsters have never looked so real. They have followed Harryhausen's design for Medusa, but improved her by way of her having a beautiful face. I would have welcomed her having some dialogue. Ralph Fiennes is a splendidly villainous Hades, Alexa Davalos works wonders with a dismayingly underwritten Andromeda, and Gemma Arterton effortlessly walks away with every scene she is in. I'm glad the comedy owl from the original puts in an appearance, but I'm even more glad that it is no more than a 10 second cameo.On to the less positive aspects. The 3D adds nothing (as a major 3D fan, it saddens me to say this - see How To Train Your Dragon in 3D, and this one flat). The constantly moving camera during action sequences (Bourne syndrome) is dreadfully distracting. The story is mostly fine, although it loses something by having Perseus' quest driven by anger rather than the need to save Andromeda - a bit of romance would have been welcome. The script is no more than serviceable. Most of the characters are pure cardboard, and Sam Worthington brings no more to Perseus than Harry Hamlin did.Incidentally, I have noted people commenting that Sam Worthington's accent slips from time to time and his natural Aussie shows through, but I don't think he's actually doing an accent - I think he is au naturel throughout.If I am honest, the original Clash Of The Titans was essentially an insubstantial romp with great monsters; this remake is pretty much the same.",7,2,4,5 April 2010
Jurassic World," Great fun
","20 years after the disastrous events at Jurassic Park, the late John Hammond's company finally have this business of breeding dinosaurs and keeping them efficiently contained in a nature theme park environment sorted. Consequently it is a complete surprise when things go horribly wrong at Jurassic World. Well, of course it is, obviously they never watched Westworld. Park boss Claire, who is supposed to be looking after her vacationing nephews, finds herself at odds with velociraptor trainer Owen, while security honcho Hoskins has his own agenda. Not that genetically engineered monster carnivore Indomitus Rex gives much of a monkey's.Spielberg's Jurassic Park was a groundbreaker – believable photorealistic dinosaurs on screen! It is still a good film, albeit maybe a little leisurely in getting under way. Episode 2 was also relaxed in setting up the jeopardy, albeit the dinos were a lot busier, and there were more of them. Episode 3 didn't really catch fire for me.But episode 4 starts off full pelt and never lets up. And it has a number of narrative arcs to follow, and they interweave nicely – it's not as empty as Mad Max: Fury Road, there is actually a plot to follow, not just eye candy. The action is non-stop, very well staged, and always convincing. And the final sequence is thrilling.It is worth catching this in 3D: the 3D is excellent.",8,40,98,12 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Genuinely scary
","What did I learn from Paranormal Activity? I learned: 1. If your girlfriend tells you she's been having demonic experiences since she was 8, dump her quick, no matter how good her boobs are.2. If you buy a high end video camera to videotape her demonic experiences, she's not going to let you tape questionable home movies on it.3. The lower your budget, the more invisible your demonic entities are likely to be.4. If your budget is really low, film the whole thing on video in your own house with a couple of unknowns and don't have any special effects.5. Oh, and make sure you have a really effective viral marketing campaign.I'm being unfair. I can testify to the effectiveness of the campaign: the cinema was full (mainly teenage couples, there was a lot of raucous laughter). But I can also testify that the audience reaction shots in the trailer aren't faked - that's exactly how the audience behaved.Strong echoes of Blair Witch and Cloverfield with this one, in terms of 'found footage' (and, like Cloverfield, this one takes about 20 minutes to set up, which is 10-15 minutes too long). But this is a much, much better film than Blair Witch. There is clear plot progression and, despite the absence of special effects (with the exception of one very brief but terrifying effect), a great deal of genuine scariness is created with sound and a few physical effects.I've seen a lot of horror films over the years and most of them are much of a muchness. This one, to me, merits the hype: it is a scary film and well worth a visit if being scared is your thing.",7,0,2,2 December 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," Very enjoyable
","David Norris (Matt Damon), an up and coming politician, meets dancer Elise (Emily Blunt), and they fall for each other. The path of true love never runs smooth, however, and in this case it is because of a bunch of mysterious hat-wearing bureaucrats who devote considerable resources to ensuring that events move along according to a predetermined Plan (which, it transpires, doesn't include David and Elise getting together).There are three major elements to this movie. One is the romance between the two main characters. The second is the science fiction notion of The Adjustment Bureau itself, continually making minor adjustments to the lives of ordinary people to make sure that The Plan proceeds uninterrupted, and occasionally messing up big time. And the third is an interesting subtext about free will vs predetermination.All three of these elements interweave, and work very well. Forget the Bourne comparisons. Although Damon is in it, and there is a chase (which makes excellent use of the sc-fi concept, special effects, and New York locations, any Bourne comparison is massively wide of the mark. The science fiction side of things is well handled, but never threatens to overwhelm the heart of the movie, which is the touching and believable relationship between David and Elise - yes, I would have fallen for her straight away, too! These likable characters are very well written and performed, and are a big part of what makes this film very successful.",9,3,4,11 March 2011
Black Snake Moan," Hardly salacious as advertised
","In the modern-day Deep South, Rae (Christina Ricci) is a young white woman with a very low sense of self-worth. When her young man Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) goes away to join up, Ronnie throws herself into a non-stop round of indiscriminate sex with anyone who can be bothered to take the time. This leads to her getting thoroughly beaten and left for dead in the road, where she is found by Lazarus (Samuel L Jackson). Lazarus tends her health but, when she throws herself sexually at him, he chains her to a radiator to prevent her leaving, with a view to healing her spiritually as well as physically.I sometimes wonder what the trailer-making industry thinks it is doing. The promotion of this movie portrays it in the most salacious light, yet that is far from what it is about. To be sure, it is necessary to learn how damaged Rae is and the form that damage takes so that we can understand the journey Lazarus takes her (and Ronnie) on. But that journey is convincing, moving, difficult, uplifting, and not salacious in the least.All three main performers are wonderful, and all are playing somewhat against type. This film is not glib, and it isn't easy, but it is real.Thoroughly recommended.",Null,1,2,15 July 2011
The Hangover Part II," Good fun, but lightning didn't strike twice
","With sequels, the question is always whether to do more of the same, or whether to do something completely different. Wisely, perhaps, the producers of Hangover 2 have decided to go for more of the same. They have correctly concluded that what enabled them to catch lightning in a bottle first time round was an engaging mixture of an intriguing premise, well conceived characters, a plot line which held your attention as the mystery of what had happened was gradually unwrapped, excellent ensemble playing, and a very funny script.All the above are present and correct second time round, with the added bonus of some exotic locations - the disastrous bachelor party takes place in Thailand instead of Las Vegas - and, perhaps, a more dangerous set of problems to unravel.While this is all very enjoyable, it remains essentially a re-run of the first film in a more humid climate, so it doesn't have the benefit of unexpectedness from which its predecessor benefited. When the inevitable Hangover 3 appears, I think it needs to investigate going in a different direction.This film does not need the bad language which is in it. Some would have been OK, but there are places where it is distractingly unwelcome.While Zach Galifianakis reprises the idiot from another planet which was his breakthrough role in the first movie, Ken Jeong remains, for me, the jewel in the crown.",8,0,4,27 May 2011
Prisoners," Glum, overlong, and goes off the rails before the end
","Two small girls, the daughters of two families, are abducted while playing outside. An unbalanced man is taken into custody but released for lack of evidence. The detective on the case continues to pursue leads, but one of the fathers takes matters into his own hands, seizes the suspect, and tries to extract the location of the girls from him. But maybe he doesn't have the right person...There are good things about Prisoners, starting with the performances of Hugh Jackman (father Keller Dover), Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), and Paul Dano (suspect Alex Jones). The situation is a good one, the moral issues are interesting, some suspense is generated, and the cinematography and production design is very good at conveying a cold, dark world where cold, dark things happen.There are some not-so-good things about it too. At 153 minutes it is overlong by at least half an hour. The final third goes seriously off the rails story-wise. The moral issues are never really addressed. The female roles are, by and large, underwritten. And, ultimately, it is a somewhat dispiriting movie.I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to.",7,4,6,4 October 2013
Silence," Flabby
","Two young Jesuit priests, Rodrigues and Garrpe. secretly arrive in Japan on the very cold trail of Father Ferreira. Japan has been seeking to abolish Christianity by way of mass executions, but there are still pockets of secret Christians. Father Ferreira, it is rumoured, has denied his faith and turned native Japanese - could this deeply disturbing suggestion be true, or is it just a rumour to serve Japanese political ends?I have never before seen a film with the word 'apostatised' used once, let alone the number of times it is used in this film. But since apostasy is at the heart of the matter, I suppose that is fair enough.Martin Scorsese sets out to dramatise a true(ish) episode towards the end of the Jesuit priesthood's attempted conversion of Japan, at the point where the Japanese establishment is taking a hard line to stamp it out, and the main method they are using is barbaric physical punishment of the native Christian population as pressure to force the priesthood into publicly denying their faith.This is solid drama material, but Scorsese fails to make a satisfying film of it: large sections are boring and repetitive as the two young priests, admirably played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, beat themselves up endlessly about how horrible it all is (and, to be fair, they are right) and how God isn't listening to them. The Almighty does chip in a few words towards the end, but they are not terribly helpful.The dramatisation could have been better. The Japanese character Kichijiro repeatedly denies his faith then seeks confession and forgiveness, to the extent that Rodrigues quietly loses any sympathy for him. I kept waiting for this to have a dramatic payoff, but it never did.In fact, for a film which ran for nearly 3 hours, the dramatic heart could have been condensed into half the running time: as it was, I felt nearly as punished as the two priests.The barbarity of punishment is shown but, thankfully, not dwelled upon. But we really didn't need as much footage of the two priests in a bamboo hut with dirty fingernails, bemoaning their lot, as we got.There is a good film in here somewhere, but it badly needed to shed some weight before it went out in public.",7,2,5,16 May 2018
Logan," Superb and a fitting close to Wolverine's movie life
","Logan's mutant healing factor is finally being poisoned by the adamantium in his system. He is working as a limo driver while tending a frail Charles Xavier, suffering from dementia. He is abruptly put in the position of having to nursemaid a mute 11-year old with retractable claws who is on the run from an organisation which wants to recover its investment. He is not happy. After his breakthrough performance as Wolverine 17 years ago in the first X-men film, Hugh Jackman has played that character in all of them, albeit by way of cameo in First Class and Apocalypse. The intervening period has been such a fertile period for comic-based movies that it is easy to forget that Brian Singer's first movie was a trailblazer for the ensemble super-hero film. But I think it is not unfair to observe that, no matter how good the scripts, how epic the effects, how committed the performances, all these super-hero films have been fairly shallow and superficial. There's nothing wrong with that - what else do we expect from super-powered escapism?Not so with Logan. The joy of the X-Men films is that the internal continuity and, importantly, the passage of real time outside - and, therefore, also within - these films, have brought us to the position which allows this movie, a movie about familiar characters growing old, to take place. Yes, there is Wolverine action, but the heart of the movie is watching this weary and damaged man cope with his relationship with Xavier, father figure, mentor and, as a feeble but dangerous 90 year-old, a damn nuisance, and then also coping with a mute and feral child, a major problem even without Xavier and the hordes of mercenaries after her.This is a film about fathers, sons and daughters, and may strike chords if you have elderly dependents and wilful teens in the family. It is also about earning redemption.Oh, and it's about what the comics refer to as Berserker Rage.The plot is straightforward. The various trailers have shown the set-up fairly comprehensively, but most of this material is drawn from the first half hour. There are some surprises in what follows, but nothing which will be completely unexpected. This lack of surprise does not detract from the performances: both Jackman and Stewart are superb as Logan and Xavier, adding depths and emotional nuances to the characters which we never imagined from the previous films.They aren't the only ones giving us great performances. Newcomer Dafne Keen is astonishing as the mysterious clawed child Laura, both in terms of her physicality and the striking performance she gives without dialogue. And lanky English comedy writer and performer Stephen Merchant is a delightfully sympathetic Caliban. Sadly, the villains disappoint. Boyd Holbrooke's baddie Pierce leaves little real impression, and Richard E. Grant's Dr Rice is underwritten. Never mind: this film belongs to the three principals.I have deliberately been fairly light on the detail, but there are a couple of things I should mention. One is that this movie is NOT kiddie friendly. The first word spoken is 'F*ck', and this is repeated frequently, rather too much in my view: I like language to serve the narrative, and much of the profanity here seems to be present simply because F*ck. The film is also graphically violent. We finally get to see what those claws do, in full and gory detail. So if your kids love the X-Men, treat them to the old TV cartoons, not this one.I'm not going to spoiler the ending other than to say that it is emotional, especially in its closing note, a beautiful and perfectly fitting touch which caught me by surprise.I'm sure there will be other X-Men movies - why not? There are many X-Men who haven't yet featured on film - but I doubt there will be one as good as this one for quite some time.",10,3,5,15 May 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Just short of the first one, but still pretty stellar
","Tony Stark has only a couple of days access to Loki's staff, newly recovered by the Avengers in a sweep of Hydra lairs, before Thor returns it to Asgard. He is keen to incorporate the advanced technology in the staff's power source into his global protection system, Ultron. But something goes very wrong as it turns out that Ultron is both self-aware and malevolent, and assisted by a pair of twins with unusual talents. It's time for the team to regroup.As Marvel adds each new film, it becomes increasingly apparent that, just like the comics on which they are based, one long, ongoing story is being told. In Avengers 2, we see payoffs and further developments from things which were seeded in earlier films (by which I mean the entire Marvel cinematic universe), and which look to payoff in the future.This film doesn't quite have the cocky swagger which its predecessor had, but that is perhaps because we are now very familiar with every member of the team, and how well they function as a team. The film is great fun, nevertheless. It is maybe missing moments like Hulk's rag doll Loki incident, but there are still a number of moments which had me drooling deliriously with delight, and I nearly wet myself during the first 5 minutes.The new characters are great – Ultron is particularly well realised – and there are more returning characters than a Harry Potter film (well, not quite, but you know what I mean). I'm glad I managed to avoid the rumour mill, although I did catch the suggestion that a certain character might die. What can I say? Wars have casualties.This is another very successful movie in the Marvel series – roll on Ant-Man!",9,8,21,24 April 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Adequate
","In order to escape from the constant depredations of hostile villagers (which resulted in the death of his wife), Count Dracula has opened a hotel catering only to assorted supernatural clientele (Frankenstein's monster, werewolves etc.). This is also convenient for protecting his daughter Mavis, despite her wish to explore farther afield now she has come of age (a rather arbitrary 118 - not sure why it should be an extra 100 years for a vampire, but never mind). Into this oasis of calm comes Jonathan, an inadvertent human tourist, and he and Mavis fall for each other.This is a CGI animated movie with a good voice cast, headed up by Adam Sandler doing a creditable job as Dracula. It is essentially a kids' movie and should be judged as such. By that criterion it is effective: the characters are (mostly) sympathetic, there are some decent gags (though, for me, no belly laughs), constant action (though no great surprises), and the film works OK. For all that, though, it leaves no lasting impression - it is fair to regard it as adequate, it would be overstating the case to make it out to be much more than that.I wasn't able to see the 3D version, and so cannot comment on the 3D.",7,3,4,26 October 2012
Big Fish," Yes, um...
","Let me tell you about my experience with Big Fish.I bought the DVD (a cheapo, admittedly). It's a Tim Burton film, and my experience of his films has been that good or bad, there is always something in there which is interesting and worth watching (normally on the visual side, if nothing else).Look at the cast! Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonfire Carter, Robert Guillaume, Marion Cotillard, Missi Pyle, Loudon Wainwright III, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito - wow! And I've read the synopsis, and a number of reviews here and......can't remember a damn thing about it. Tell I lie, I think I remember Billy Crudup swanning about on a landing in the dark, and something about sunflowers at the end.So my verdict, as far as I'm concerned - deeply unmemorable.",Null,0,2,13 October 2011
The Dark Knight," Very very good or excellent? I'm not sure
","So - is it as good as everybody says it is? I'm not sure. It's certainly very, very good, but I'm not 100% convinced it's a solid gold classic. There have been other movies in the genre which have grabbed me more on first viewing, but I'll have to do a bit of thinking before I can nail that thought down with precision.The thing it does do, to an extent which I didn't think would be possible, is to take the idea of a fully established Batman (as opposed to the creation/origin Batman in Begins) as well as Joker and Two-Face, put them into a world which is recognisably the real world (as opposed to the stylised Gotham of the Burton movies), and have them all be credible characters. I except here only the Two-Face makeup - I thought it was great, but I worried about the absence of tear ducts.The film is long, but there is a lot of plot going on. Attention needs to be paid - there are lots of details, and they can escape easily.The main players reprise their roles from last time, and it's good to see Gary Oldman's James Gordon having a much bigger slice of the pie this time. Together with Caine's Alfred and Freeman's Lucius Fox they create a solid foundation of decency for Bale's Batman to operate against.Credit to both Heath Ledger for a genuinely scary Joker, and also to Aaron Eckhart for a performance which makes Harvey Dent's tragedy very clear (and, perhaps, turns it into the heart of this movie). Is Ledger's performance worthy of an Oscar nomination? Well, the Academy likes showy, gimmicky characters, and Ledger's untimely death will undoubtedly have increased the chances even more, so I wouldn't bet against it.The stunts are fine and the effects are fine - nothing so outrageous that disbelief can't remain suspended. The script is good, and some of the music cues are remarkable. However, there were places where I felt that the sound balance favoured music and effects over dialogue - Gordon's words at the very end, for instance.This has been a very good year for films in this genre, and this film is one of the best in this (or any other) year.",9,1,4,24 July 2008
Everest," Spectacular and suspenseful
","Back in 1996, two 'package tour' groups of climbers on Everest hit problems due to inadequate preparation, lack of fitness, and unanticipated bad weather.This film's high-powered cast plays second fiddle to the spectacle on display. We learn just enough about key figures for us to identify with them when things go wrong, and to care about whether they make it back safely or not. The actors all do well, although Emily Watson as the base camp co-ordinator probably comes off best – I also like Keira Knightley's small but emotional performance, and Josh Brolin's character arc.But above everything, this film is utterly spectacular, especially in 3D. Much of it must have been greenscreened, but the greenscreen is, for the most part, flawlessly integrated into background plates and CGI, and it is clear that the cast must have been exposed to at least some physicality above and beyond straightforward studio/location work.Frankly, a lower profile cast would probably have been effective, because the strength of this film lies in its visuals and suspense. It is worth seeing, and preferably in 3D.",7,0,1,9 October 2015
Friends with Benefits," Rude, but good hearted
","Executive Recruitment Consultant Jamie (Mila Kunis) lures designer Dylan (Justin Timberlake) to New York, and they become easy friends. Both have just been dumped and so they decide that it would be a good idea, given that they both miss sex, if they start having sex on a 'no strings' basis. Despite a promising start, it all goes pear-shaped.Boy meets girl, audience can see they are a perfect match, all goes well, something gums up the works, last act solves the problem and resolves the relationship. The rules of the romcom are so fundamental that to breach them would probably result in the earth tipping off its axis or something equally apocalyptic. Fortunately, Friends With Benefits takes no such risks, treading very nearly the exact same course as No Strings Attached from about 6 months ago (Hollywood turning out 2 films about the same thing at nearly the same time - fancy that. Who'd have thought?).So we have an unoriginal romcom. What else do we have? We have a surprisingly small amount of bad language, most of which comes from Emma Stone's short and very funny cameo within the first 5 minutes). We have quite a lot of sexual talk, sexual activity, and nudity although, since this is Hollywood, the talk can be as frank as you like (and it is fairly frank), but the sexual activity and nudity are absolutely non-explicit - lots of underwear, bare bums but no bits, and lots of Hollywood sheets covering up anything interesting.Importantly, though, we have engaging people who we care about (with very good performances from both Timberlake, in his first primary role and Kunis, doing as good a cute-and-sexy as I've ever seen), we have an entertaining and intelligent script (hooray!), we have secondary characters and situations who add to the main story rather than detract, and we have heart.I really enjoyed this.",Null,0,1,16 September 2011
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Darkening but enjoyable
","Things were dark in the HP universe for Harry right from the start: now they are starting to get darker for everyone else, too. Unfortunately the Minstry of Magic has ostrich syndrome and chooses to manifest this by installing the petty-minded bullying bureaucrat Dolores Umbrage in charge at Hogwarts.Imelda Staunton's pitch-perfect portrayal of the odious Umbrage is one of the highlights of this movie (joined by Gary Olman's Sirius and Evanna Lynch's delightfully delirious Luna), although (as usual) all the support cast is excellent.The film works as a coherent narrative telling its own story and carrying on the larger narrative (unlike its successor). And the climactic battle at the Ministry succeeds dramatically, visually and emotionally.This is one of the better films in the series.",8,0,1,19 December 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Late to the party
","Strictly speaking, I should have been in the queue for 2001 when it was first released - aged 16 and a major science fiction fan, I can't understand how come I missed it, and didn't pick it up until a cinema re-release 6 years later, when I saw it 3 times in 3 days.You can take it that I really liked it.The intervening years have cooled me down somewhat. I still like eye candy, but we're spoiled for it these days. I still like spacecraft and sci-fi generally, but ditto.And this leaves me looking at 2001 solely on its own merits.When I saw it in the 70s, I had read Clarke's short story The Sentinel shortly before, and I therefore had a pretty good idea of what the story was. Standing back and looking at the movie and imagining myself in the position of someone coming to it cold, it must have been a nightmare. I guess it would be possible to figure out the link between the monoliths, although possibly not until encountering the one on the moon - fabulous though the jump-cut from bone to orbiting satellite may be, I'm not sure it actually explains anything. The Jupiter mission is straightforward enough, but the final sequence is baffling to anyone not in the know.This was not a friendly film to offer to the general public although, to be fair, there is no reason why it should have been. I read aggressively defensive comments disparaging those who have trouble with the movie because it does not offer a readily comprehensible narrative, and I find myself thinking that, while there is no reason why Kubrick should have done so - his choice, and I respect that - it is perfectly understandable for members of the film-going public to be a little bemused not to find the narrative they expected. People expect things to be explained and, to some extent, it is perverse not to make that explanation available given that it exists.For all that, this is trailblazing stuff from an effects point of view, with a stunning vocal performance from Douglas Rains.By the way, count me among those who think Kubrick took it at rather too leisurely a pace.",8,3,7,23 March 2010
Toy Story," Still first ate
","It was a classic on the day it was released, and it's still a classic 10 years later. The story is great, the characters are great, the voice talent is great, and the animation is great. Only the detail suffers by comparison with current computer animated films, but that is perhaps only to be expected.I was surprised and delighted to note Joss Whedon at the top of the list of those responsible for the screenplay - his name means a lot more to me now than it did 10 years ago.This 3D retooling is interesting. For one thing, it demonstrates that it is a relatively easy exercise for CGI animated features. Having said that, it doesn't add an awful lot to Toy Story. Given that the film wasn't envisaged as a 3D feature, there aren't any sequences specifically designed to showcase 3D. The climactic chase and rocket scene works well, and there are scattered moments which make you go, 'Oh, look!' But nothing which makes you go 'Wow!' In the way the trailer (created specially for this 3D version) did.But watching Toy Story, 2D or 3D, is never a waste of time - it's that good.",10,0,0,7 October 2009
Men in Black," First rate sci-fi comedy
","Men In Black, adapted from a relatively low-profile comic, works perfectly in almost every way.It tells of how gung-ho policeman Will Smith is recruited by cynical, weary Tommy Lee Jones to join the select band of top secret operatives who are tasked with the job of maintaining public order over the large number of aliens who, unbeknownst to the general public, live on earth.These two parts perfectly suit Smith's and Jones' screen personae, but they also enjoy sterling support from Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub and, especially, Vincent D'Onofrio, not normally known for his comedy chops, in a performance which is screamingly funny.But equally impressive are the host of aliens, good, bad or just plain everyday going about their business, who populate this world. And the special effects, both physical and visual, are terrific.The film works well both as comedy and as science fiction.",Null,1,2,15 August 2011
Midsommar," It would have been nice if it had acknowledged the film it echoes
","After a distressing family tragedy, Dani joins her rather indifferent boyfriend and his 3 college friends to attend summer solstice celebrations at the remote Swedish commune where one of them was brought up.When I saw the trailer, I thought 'This reminds me of The Wicker Man.' And I was right. If you are familiar with the original Wicker Man, this movie will not surprise you in the slightest. But is it any good?Well, it is beautifully photographed and there is some excellent sound design. There is a sense of creeping uneasiness, and some general nastiness here and there - it is a horror film, after all. The direction is sometimes very good, and sometimes a bit too much like showing off. And Florence Pugh is jaw-droppingly good.There is nothng by way of made-you-jump moments - not a bad thing, in my view.But there are a number of plot points which are inadequately dealt with which, to me, means they shouldn't have been there to start with - crass college pal Mark, for instance, whose attitude towards Dani has no payoff whatsoever. And this is particularly relevant given that this rather slight tale runs for 140 minutes. This tale unfolds at a pace which is a bit too leisurely. Losing half an hour would have improved the pace, losing an hour would have moved it along whip-fast.An excellent, and VERY disturbing final shot, though.",7,6,8,10 July 2019
The Graduate," A must-see, but not very nice
","I saw The Graduate a lot at the cinema when it first came out: it affected me a lot, but I'm not sure why.It tells the story of newly graduated and emotionally dislocated Benjamin Braddock (30-year old Dustin Hoffman, playing younger) who is sucked into a casual and loveless affair by, and with, Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft), wife of his father's business partner. All proceeds well enough, if unemotionally, until Ben falls for the Robinsons' daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross) and takes it upon himself to pursue her despite having no immediate prospects, Elaine's engagement and forthcoming wedding, and the angry prohibition of Mrs Robinson who threatens to - and duly does - make public their affair.Stated baldly, this is a fairly soapy and sordid business, and two of the three main characters - Benjamin and Mrs Robinson are, for most of the film, quite unlikeable.I suppose we must cut Mrs Robinson some slack - she is clearly trapped in a loveless marriage, and she is equally clearly prepared to fight like a lioness for her daughter. And one of the closing shots of her shows what a tired, unhappy woman she is, and goes a long way towards defusing the anger the audience feels towards her by then.And I suppose we must also acknowledge that Benjamin progresses from a passively nihilistic cipher to someone who is finally prepared to take strong positive action in pursuit of something he actually wants.But what makes this film worthwhile - essential viewing, in fact - are the fantastic performances of Hoffman and Bancroft, the script (Clader Willingham and Buck Henry), and Mike Nichol's direction, not to mention the superbly placed songs by Simon and Garfunkel, especially when they emphasise Benjamin's alienation (The Sound Of Silence over the opening titles is a case in point).This film is sordid and dispiriting in many ways. But it is also uplifting, and often very, very funny.",Null,0,0,20 August 2011
Singin' in the Rain," As nearly perfect as they come
","Add me to the list of those who have nothing negative to say about this film - all the building blocks fitted together to make a whole which is greater than the sum of its parts. Even the songs all fit perfectly, notwithstandinng that a number of them (including the title song) were NOT written for the film.The story neatly fits a number of things together - the passage of a couple of vaudeville hoofers into the movie business, the birth of sound and the problems it brought, and a love story (and the threats posed to it by outside pressures).The musical sequences are all first rate, although pride of place must go to the utter joyousness communicated by the title song's routine.Kelly was never better as a leading man, Donald O'Connor was a perfect second banana, Debbie Reynolds was cuteness personified, and Jean Hagen was absolutely brilliant - funny and malevolent - as the screechy voiced Lina Lamont. But all the supporting players were excellent.The Hollywood musical never bettered this film.",10,0,1,10 June 2010
Puss in Boots," Very good but not purrfect
","Given that Shrek, as a self-contained full-length feature franchise, has not so much reached the end of the line as hit the buffers at full speed, a Puss In Boots spin-off is an excellent idea.Carrying virtually no Shrek continuity (other than being set in a world where familiar fairy tale happenings are regular everyday occurrences) this film tells a tale from Puss's younger days, including his childhood as an orphan, his friendship with the conflicted Humpty Dumpty, and how it all goes horribly wrong. This leads to a present-day(-ish) adventure involving Jack and Jill (who turn out to be not at all what you would have expected), some magic beans, a beanstalk, a goose which lays golden eggs, and a cat burglar called Kitty Softpaws.The film, set firmly in what one might call Zorroland is, as one might expect, technically excellent - set design, character design, voice, talent, animation and 3D are all flawless. There are a lot of good gags too, some laugh out loud stuff.Somehow it doesn't quite all fit together, although I'm hard put to say why. It doesn't quite have the heart that the first Shrek movie did, for instance. But it is still an excellent family film, and merits a sequel. One can also imagine a Donkey spin off...",8,5,6,14 December 2011
Elysium," Flawed spectacle
","In the 22nd century, the affluent few have taken themselves off to live in a luxury space station called Elysium, while everyone else lives in polluted poverty back on Earth. Then Max (Matt Damon) has an industrial accident and, with 5 days to live, his only hope is access to one of the magic heal-all machines on Elysium.This science fiction action suspense movie is, for the most part, very well realised, and bashes along entertainingly (if, often, somewhat gorily). Put your brain in neutral, get your popcorn, and enjoy the eye candy, which is extremely impressive.But, whatever you do, don't take your brain out of neutral, because you will find yourself asking all sorts of questions. Like why on earth can't Earth have the magic healing machines: heaven knows there are plenty on Elysium, we discover. And why do Elysium's defence systems comprise a bloke with a bazooka on Earth? I fear that many more such questions may occur to you: they did to me.The ear-assaulting bombastic Dark Knight music is more unwelcome.",7,2,3,23 August 2013
Taken," Neeson is great
","If you've seen the trailer then there is little to be said about the plot, because you know it - Liam Neeson's 17 year old daughter, in Paris on vacation, is kidnapped by Albanian sex-slave traders. Unfortunately for them, Neeson is a retired US government covert operative of some kind, with skills and resources which enable him to pursue the kidnappers, extract information, and exact retribution.This is a good action thriller, somewhat in the Bourne mould, with a solid and credible performance by Neeson at its heart - the emotional stakes are clear throughout, but Neeson's character's professionalism is completely in charge as long as it is necessary. It is refreshing to see a protagonist doing what he has to do with utter ruthlessness, with no gentlemanly pussyfooting around.There are some plot threads left untied (literally in the case of a thread which he finds at the kidnap scene but then never pursues, as far as I could see), and there is some pretty wild variance in how easily he takes out the kidnappers. But for all that, the action never lets up, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8,8,14,25 September 2008
Alice in Wonderland," All style, no substance, little Carroll
","I've tried to figure out why this movie doesn't quite work, and I think it must be the script. It can't be story, because Carroll's two Alice books aren't exactly over-burdened with plot: they are like nothing so much as Victorian videogames - Alice enters alien environment and traverses a series of obstacles to be overcome/defeated/avoided until she reaches the final objective, to return home. The books are linear and episodic, and so is this movie.So if it's not story it must be something else. The Alice books are characterised by their imagination, wit, charm, and originality. Burton's film is imaginative (most of which derives from the books and Tenniel's illustrations), but it isn't very original, neither does it exhibit much wit or charm. Burton does add his own flavour, but that has never been particularly charming.The story - 'Return to Wonderland' - adds so little of its own, and is so heavily dependent on material from the source novels, that one wonders why it was considered necessary to go for a 'sequel', and why Burton didn't simply film the book/s.And this is a shame, because it always looks good (fantastic, in fact, in every sense of the word, although the 3D isn't always effective or in service to the movie), and has some other elements which are worthwhile, chief among which is the performance of Mia Wasikowska as Alice. Depp's Mad Hatter is enjoyable if somewhat out of alignment with Carroll's vision (the occasional channelling of what appears to be Braveheart's William Wallace is interesting, if distracting), and I felt that much of the remaining talent was miscast - or, perhaps, cast to deliberately go against type - Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman and Barbara Windsor, in particular, failed to convince me that they were Carroll's Cheshire Cat, Caterpillar and Dormouse. And this was ironic considering the degree of discussion there was as to whether Alice was the real Alice or not.Regrettably, there were a number of things which really irritated me, too. Chief among these was the tendency of the script to attribute names - how long has the Caterpillar had a name, for instance? I was irritated by the affectionate diminution of Cheshire Car to 'Chess' - 'Chesh', surely? And I wish someone had actually read Through The Looking Glass and realised that the critter in question is called the Jabberwock, not Jabberwocky (which is the name of the poem in which it appears), although it was good to see it modelled on Tenniel's illustration. Finally, I was less than thrilled with Helena Bonfire Carter's wholesale lift from Miranda Richardson's Queenie (plagiarism, dearie). You don't have to put the missus in ALL your movies, Tim! Oddly, the bit of the film which I felt worked best was the wholly original framing sequence which lent some depth to Alice's character. Otherwise, this was a typical Burton example of style over substance.",7,1,5,11 March 2010
Avatar," Thunderingly good entertainment
","After I saw Terminator 2 at the cinema when it first came out, I had to recover for a day or two. When I started getting my thoughts in order, I realised two things: one, the film had state-of-the-art special effects running all the way through it and, two, those effects were always in service of the story, and never the other way round.Some consideration of Cameron's filmography makes it clear that, while he is a director who is keen to push the envelope - The Abyss and Titanic also come to mind as movies where effects are pushed into new areas (and I include physical effects as well as photographic and CGI), there is always a strong human heart beating in the film, and you never find yourself thinking that here is a filmmaker who has discovered the bundle of tricks which is CGI, now what can I hang them on? (koff koff Roland Emmerich anyone?) So I watched Avatar on two levels - what it looked like, and what it felt like. As it happens, that's not a bad basis on which to review it, notwithstanding that the essence of successful film-making is that the two should be inextricably tied together.So what does it look like? I'm a sucker for eye candy, and the answer has to be 'Absolutely stunning.' Breaking the visuals down into sections: The human locations and hardware are very reminiscent of those in Aliens, and the powered exoskeletons (viz Ripley's fight with the Alien queen in Aliens) make a reappearance, big time; The Pandora vistas are both sufficiently earth-like to enable you to identify, and sufficiently other-worldly to place you on another planet; The Pandora flora and fauna are spectacular, and brilliantly well thought out. I particularly loved an element which hasn't been shown in the trailers, involving the plaits which the Na'vi wear.Do you believe in what is shown to you? Well, for the first few moments you marvel at the eye candy, and then, yes, you accept what you're seeing. In particular, the Na'vi are real people within a few minutes of meeting them. I was disconcerted to find myself quite fancying an 8 foot tall skinny blue woman with cat's eyes.The 3D is also amazingly effective in immersing you in both the gritty human locations and also the alien world of Pandora - do try to see it in 3D if you can.But what of the story? Let's be honest, you're likely to have encountered this tale before. Technology-heavy invaders are determined to acquire a natural resource: unfortunately, this resource lies under a particularly sacred site belonging to an indigenous tribe (think Amazonian rain forest, think buffalo herds), so someone is sent to infiltrate but ends up seeing the beauty of the life pursued by the underdogs, and changes allegiance. Factor in a romance between the infiltrator and the chieftain's daughter who is delegated to train him, and you have a formula story which is likely to be quite familiar.But it's unfair to level that as a criticism. The reason it's a familiar story is that it's a good story. Filled with tension and audience sympathy for the underdog, it works as well here as it has worked in previous incarnations, and the science fiction trimmings add complications and additional story elements. You do genuinely care for the plight of the Na'vi, and you want the romance between Marine Jake Sully and his Na'vi princess to turn out well.I must say that Cameron's films generally - and Avatar is no exception - are not films which are going to rank as great cinematic statements. What they are, without exception, is fantastic big screen entertainment - they engage, transport, and carry you along. They are rattling good yarns, delivered by a master storyteller. And, again, Avatar is no exception.Cameron said that he wanted to make a film where you wouldn't be able to tell where real life ended and CGI began - he has achieved that. And he also said that he was aiming to create CGI faces which the audience could accept as real faces, and which didn't have the deadness behind the eyes which we have seen as recently as Zemeckis' A Christmas Carol. I think he has achieved that, too. If nothing else, this is another of Cameron's films which will stand as a milestone of technical achievement, but it is also a hugely entertaining movie, and one where the story comes first.",Null,7,15,17 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Decent horror with some humour
","Anyone who has ever watched horror movies should know that it's not a good idea to annoy gypsies. Unfortunately for her, this little life lesson appears to have passed Christine Brown by because, in pursuit of a hotly contested promotion at the bank where she is a loan officer, she royally p*sses off an old gypsy woman with the worst upper and lower plates in the history of dentistry. This unpleasant old woman lays a curse on poor Christine (in addition to assaulting her in fairly robust fashion) via a button. This curse is to be applied by a demon called the Lamia, whose modus operandi is to torment the victim for three days before ripping the soul out of them and taking it off to Hell for an eternity of torment. As you do. The rest of the movie is devoted to the aforementioned tormenting, alternating with Christine's increasingly desperate attempts to avoid this fate.Sam Raimi cut his directorial teeth on the Evil Dead movies. Full of energy, not to mention grossness and humour, these movies were made on tiny budgets which was inevitably reflected in production values (for all of which they worked marvels with the limited budgets they had). Since then he has enjoyed both critical and financial success (not always with the same film!), and Drag Me To Hell sees him returning to horror with a much bigger budget.With rare exceptions, it is unfair to judge horror films other than as horror films, and this movie is no exception: it is a straightforward horror, following all the conventions. But it's not a bad one. The story, though familiar, is well told and has some small but pleasing wrinkles (Christine's boyfriend, Justin Long as an intellectual mother's boy) is the standard sceptic, but offers Christine unqualified support despite believing that she's suffering from a kind of post traumatic stress syndrome. There is, as you would expect, an adequate supply of moments to make you jump, The effects are fine, and of a quality which reflects the fact that Raimi is no longer on such a meagre budget as he was 20 years ago. Various subplots maybe aren't made full use of, but this doesn't really matter too much. There is a fair sprinkling of characteristic Raimi (mostly gross-out) humour. The ending won't please everybody, but I thought it was fine. In short, it all works, and perfectly well.Alison Lohman makes a sympathetic protagonist, but the film is stolen by Lorna Raver - as Mrs Ganush she delivers one of the vilest, most malevolent characters seen on screen for ages. I loved her!",8,0,2,4 June 2009
Selma," Valuable if you weren't there
","Having successfully had anti-segregation laws passed, black Americans discover that they are being denied the right to vote in Alabama so, led by Dr Martin Luthor King, a peaceful protest march is planned from Selma to Montgomery. However, the powers that be do not want this march to take place.This reconstruction tells the story of an important but little known (outside the USA, at any rate) incident in the path of the 1960s civil rights movement. I am always wary of films which fall into the category which I mentally call 'worthy' because that often means that they are so referential to the event/s they are depicting that they forget that they also have a need to engage the audience. Selma does not make this mistake – it is engaging throughout.It is also both inspiring and sobering – to learn of the deaths that occurred, solely because people of colour wanted to be able to exercise the rights they had been fighting for over such a long time and to see, so well portrayed, the hatefulness they faced as well as the determinedly peaceful yet implacable way that fight was fought is to have one's (white, English, middle class) eyes opened somewhat.Yes, this is a worthy film, but it works well as a film of general appeal, too.",Null,1,3,13 February 2015
The Artist," Simple but striking
","In 1927, big film star George Valentin has an accidental encounter with Peppy Miller, as a result of which he starts her on a film career. She rises from extra through bit parts to featured parts, supporting parts and, finally, star. The camera and the public love her. On the arrival of sound, Peppy embraces it but George rejects it on artistic grounds. George's self-financed silent film fails and he loses everything in the stock market crash, while Peppy's star continues to rise.What idiot thought that a black and white, 4:3 ratio, dialogue-free film, about (and filmed in the style of) 1920s movies, starring two unknowns, would have a chance of success? Whoever it was, it turns out they backed a winner. But does The Artist merit the Oscars it has won? I think, yes, it does. This film is a masterclass on how to tell a story using images not words. Yes, there are some caption cards, but they are few and mainly used to clarify: the story is told through performance. And while the story itself is not wildly original, the telling of it is clever and witty, using a style of storytelling which manages to be both old fashioned and fresh at the same time.And the performances, especially Jean Dujardin's Best Actor Oscar winning performance, are simply terrific. Through the first section of the film Dujardin conveys an insouciant charm which makes his physical presence amazingly reminiscent of Gene Kelly (is it a coincidence that this story, about the birth of sound in cinema, bears comparison to Singin' In The Rain?). His descent into despair is equally well conveyed and, like his chauffeur, you just want to shout at him that he should swallow his pride.The direction is first rate, playing with cinematic conventions when it suits the film to do so. And the music, which takes the place of a conventional soundtrack, is just right, always complementing the visuals.The reason why this film has enjoyed its success is that it is a first rate piece of cinema.",8,0,3,4 March 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Part 2 part 1
","In view of the fact that the last Twiglet book has been split into two films, my review of the last Twiglet film is also going to be split in two. I was minded to do this after coming out of the cinema yesterday, and seeing all the little Twigleteers enduring the 4 movie retrospective marathon leading up to the midnight showing of Twiglet: Breaking Wind part 2. The first part of my review therefore chronicles my expectations before actually seeing it: I will add part 2 once I have seen it. I am hoping it will answer the many questions which are churning round, unanswered from the previous movie.Will Edward Sullen's eyebrows revert to normal or will they remain Spocklike to the very end? Will Kirsten Sulk smile at any point? Will Taylor Lautner become less wooden than a storefront wooden Indian? Will Renesmee grow to adulthood quickly enough to make her own decisions and decide to change that ridiculous name? Will any sense of reason ever appear behind the Vampire High Command's arbitrary set of rules? Will Michael Sheen continue to be the only watchable actor due to his glee at camping it up? Will Dakota Fanning rescue the part of her reputation she lost by being so poor in the last one? Will the 'vampires' become proper vampires or remain glittery daylight bloodsuckers? Will there ever be any substance at all to any of this, or will it remain drippy trivial wish fulfilment fantasy for impressionable teenage girls to the bitter end? Will Stephenie Meyer continue laughing all the way to the bank? Will these questions be answered in the second part of my review of: Twiglet: Breaking Wind part 2!!! Part 2: Being bitten and vampirised at the point of death brings sulky Bella some red contact lenses, eyeshadow and false eyelashes, and the ability to jump off waterfalls. It also brings half human/half vampire creepy CGI-face offspring Renesmee to the attention of the vampire high command, who plan to use her to exterminate the Cullens. While the boss vampires (who put them in charge anyway?) hurry along to this showdown (on foot, from Italy to Canada), the Cullens recruit allies from around the world. A showdown ensues. Keen readers of my reviews of the Twiglet movies (such readers being almost as numerous, no doubt, as Twigleteers themselves) will probably have come to the conclusion that my opinion of these films is fairly low. To put it bluntly, I think they are boring, soppy, meretricious rubbish. So it is with considerable surprise that I find myself saying that Breaking Wind part 2 is really good. The main reason for this is that it isn't really a Twiglet movie, it's actually a superhero movie with a terrific superhero battle at the end. The tiresome soppiness between the two main characters is more or less over, apart from a couple of tedious but mercifully brief montages: this film concentrates on Bella coming to terms with the powers which come with vampirism (vampire boot camp, if you will), plot development, and action. And the 'have your cake and eat it' ending actually works well. There are flaws, the worst of which is the tendency for important plot points to arrive just before they are needed. Like Jacob's imprinting with Renesmee in the previous film, the fact that each vampire has a different power really should have been introduced several films ago: the fact that you learn it just before those powers are needed for the final battle reeks of making it up as you go along, and is evidence of poor writing (whether in the original material or the adaptation, I cannot say). And the best line in the film, concerning Jacob's pet name for Renesmee, should have been played for laughs, but is played deadly serious. Michael Sheen is, again, by far the most entertaining performer. If they were to put the key plot events of the previous 4 movies into an opening 'story so far' crawl, Star Wars-style, you could dump the other 4 movies and this would be a fine stand-alone experience.",Null,9,24,16 November 2012
La La Land," Very good, just a shade off great
","Mia is a barista: she is also an actress with endless unsuccessful auditions, as well as being a would-be playwright. Sebastian is a piano bar pianist with aspirations for owning his own jazz club. They bump into each other on several occasions and a bond starts to form. But in Hollywood the path of love never runs smoothly, does it?Written and directed by Damien (Whiplash) Chazelle, La La Land tells a well-travelled romantic tale of two ambitious but unsuccessful young people on the foothills of Mount Showbiz. La La Land, by the way, is an excellent title, being a musical reference, a Los Angeles reference, and of course La La Land also meaning 'living in a fantasy world.'Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have already demonstrated their on-screen chemistry, and this is happily maintained here. They sing well, if not strongly, and the dance routines are attractively presented, if not particularly demanding of accomplished dancers. And Gosling is clearly an able pianist, even if his on-screen fingerwork is not always completely synchronised with what we hear.The film starts very promisingly with a musical number staged on a freeway overpass. There is a strong jazzy/big band feel to a song which moves from a single a capella vocal to fully orchestrated mass vocals (at which point the lyrics to what was a very pleasing song get lost in the mixing). There are several very effective set piece musical numbers: the freeway number, an evening song/dance looking over LA, and a song during an audition, were all standouts for me.The musical contributions sag somewhat in the middle of the film. The start promises that this will be very much a traditional Hollywood musical, with dramatic beats told in, and punctuated by, song and dance, but we then tend to get musical performances rather than integrated songs. And there is an over-reliance on the main musical theme, the one which you will know if you have seen the trailer. This pops up all the way through the movie in a wide variety of different arrangements and orchestrations. I would have been happier to have heard a more varied range of melodies.This sounds very negative, yet I very much enjoyed the movie. If you're not a fan of musicals then it's unlikely that this will convert you, but I found the chemistry of the two main players delightful, they both give good performances and perform well musically and terpsichoreally, and Chazelle directs with immense verve and imagination - just look at the camera movement and the unedited length of shots in some of the set-pieces! He must surely get a nomination for this year's best Director Oscar (which, of course, he went on to win).And, despite the possibility of the ending not being what you may have wanted, the film remembers to be fun.",9,2,2,15 May 2018
Saw," Who needs a big budget?
","Forget about the never-ending stream of sequels - I suppose that if you like the horror genre which involves people being mutilated and killed by increasingly involved methods of extravagant complexity, then the sequels may very well be just what you're looking for - because the first is a true original.It is also a wonderful example of the fact that you don't need to throw oodles of cash at a movie to make it a good one - the cast list which you see is entirely illusory, because this film is pretty much a two hander in a single claustrophobic set. Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell are chained to pipes in a disused basement bathroom, with a single hacksaw. There is a time limit which precludes sawing through the chain/s. The only way one of them will survive is by sawing a foot off.This is such a simple scenario that you wouldn't think it was capable of subtlety and complexity. Yet the brilliant script by Whannell and director James Wan twists and turns all over the place.I say, not for the first time (and, no doubt, not for the last), that a good film requires a good script, and this is one of the very best.",Null,0,1,20 November 2011
Mama," Decent ghost-based horror movie
","We see suicidal Jeffrey take his daughters Victoria (3) and Lilly (1) deep into the woods, having killed their mother and his business partners, with the intention of killing them and then himself. Before he can do so, we see something through Victoria's spectacles-less eyes pull him away and break his neck. Jeffrey's brother Lucas never gives up looking for his disappeared family members and 5 years later the two girls, now feral, are found. Victoria's pre-existing speech skills enable her rehabilitation to be started relatively easily: Lilly remains fairly unreachable. Victoria attributes their survival to Mama, and the audience has a pretty good idea that Mama may well be more real than anyone suspects.This is a good old-fashioned horror story, ghost based, and like all horror stories, it's as good as its monster. I found the monster here a good one. It provides a decent amount of teasing, sudden scares and the like, and manages to be both menacing and sympathetic. You also get a fair amount of 'reveal' towards the end which may disappoint: for me, it didn't.The cast is excellent. Jessica Chastain as Lucas' partner, stuck with substitute motherhood she didn't really want, as an effective central character, Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau is solid as both Jeffrey and Lucas, but it is the little girls who thrill. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse are both superb.Credit also to Andres Muschietti â€“ his story and direction provide an effective, atmospheric and emotional film which provides much of what we expect, but doesn't always stick to the railroad tracks.",8,2,4,1 March 2013
Super 8," Enjoyable but unoriginal
","I came out of Super 8 rather puzzled. On one hand, I enjoyed it hugely. On the other, there wasn't a single moment which I hadn't already seen elsewhere. Much of it seems to have been cobbled together from Spielberg's back catalogue, but huge numbers of other movies have been cannibalised, too (I started listing the movies it derives material from, and stopped when I got to 15 without drawing breath). My mind insists on telling me that I shouldn't have enjoyed it quite so much, because it brings literally nothing new to the table. Nothing at all. And yet I did - a lot - and, in the end, that's all that really matters.All the set pieces work well (especially the train crash) and the effects are flawless. The enjoyable script by director JJ Abrams stitches together all the requisite elements. and structures the emotional and action parts of the film so that they intertwine and develop in a satisfying way.At the heart of the film are heartwarming performances from the young cast, particularly Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning as two youngsters, both of whom have troubled elements in their makeup. There is good chemistry between the cast, especially (and necessarily) between Courtney and Fanning. Elle Fanning appears to be as talented as sister Dakota, and has a definite edge over her in the looks department.As a minor nitpick, I'm not sure the use by youngsters of the word 'totally' was quite as ubiquitous at the time the film is set as it is made out to be here (in fact, I'm quite sure it totally wasn't).And, as a major nitpick, there is one use of the F word. Quite frankly, I thought it was entirely unnecessary and served only to alienate.",Null,0,1,12 August 2011
The Last Samurai," Multilayered
","On its simplest level, The Last Samurai is a straightforward story, well told, of a damaged man trapped by circumstances in a culture clash which changes him profoundly.But this is just one of many layers. There is the political story of late 19th century Japan, still essentially feudal in nature, beginning to interact with the western world. There is Cruise's voyage of discovery and redemption, but there are also the stories of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and Taka (Koyuki). There is the story of culture clash - explored in Shogun, and still fascinating here. There is the spectacle of battle.And all this is told wonderfully visually, with excellent performances from all concerned - the performance of the nervous Japanese soldier being told by Cruise to shoot him is as well measured as Cruise's own. The film looks good, is gripping throughout, well paced, and moving.One of the best films of its time.",9,1,1,29 May 2010
Sinister," Decent horror
","Ellison (Ethan Hawke) is a writer of true-life crime accounts, which explains why he moves his family (wife and two children) into a house where a mass murder took place. When he finds a box of super 8 movies in the loft, he watches them all even after seeing that the first one shows the murders which took place in this very house. Keen watchers of this sort of film will be expecting creepy occurrences and unexplained noises at this point and, sure enough, they arrive right on cue. Ellison clearly is not a keen watcher of this sort of film, because he not only ignores these unexplained phenomena, he digs deeper into the mystery. Run for the hills, Ellison, and take your family with you! I'm not very good at spotting twists, wrinkles and the like, but this film held no surprises for me at all. In particular, I spotted the catch towards the end when it was telegraphed earlier on. But for all that, this is quite a good movie of its type. Without being loaded up with scares, it is pretty creepy all the way through, and it gets under way quickly and without excessive preamble. Ethan Hawke forms a solid centre in a movie which is very nearly a single-hander.Moderately scary, and keeps you interested.",7,1,3,10 October 2012
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," There's something familiar about it...
","Home Alone 2 could also be called 'More Of The Same', but that's OK because there's enough different and the same bit is fine.I'll explain. His idiot family mislay Kevin at Christmas again - this time he is booked into a hotel where he has to bamboozle suspicious concierge Tim Curry into believing he isn't on his own. In due course he falls foul of Harry and Marv, the single minded but dim crooks from the first movie - they want revenge on him, he wants to foil their plan to rob a toy store, and the stage is set for a reply of the siege, full of slapstick violence, and taking place this time in the shell of a brownstone which is in mid-renovation. Finally there is - guess what? - a sentimental resolution.Yes, the siege is violent, but the violence is cartoon violence: although Marv and Joe are hurt, things which would in reality kill them simply leave them somewhat stunned, following which they get up and resume their single-minded pursuit of Kevin.I cast my vote, too, for the bricks and the way the sequence keeps you waiting for a variation which never comes. I also have a soft spot for the replay of the paint tins down the stairwell from the first movie, which does carry some funny variations.And, again, that's the movie's strength - it is very funny.",8,0,1,10 January 2011
Up," Perfection
","Up finally arrives in the UK and, just when I thought Pixar couldn't do better than WALL-E, it turns out they can.It's not often that I find myself thinking that a film is pretty much perfect, but this is one of them. The core story of Carl's adventure in his balloon-powered house together with stowaway Russell is exciting, involving, moral, funny (very funny!), and visually stunning.The 3D is used wonderfully effectively, but without being so in-your-face that you are always having your nose rubbed in it.But I must put my name down as one of those who was stunned by the opening sequence running from the newsreel footage of Muntz' initial exploration through Carl and Ellie meeting and then the montage of their life together. This exquisite sequence wasn't just great animation, it was - in my view - one of the all time great cinematic sequences, on a par with any of the classic sequences since the birth of cinema. In 10 short minutes it not only provided the exposition, it also conveyed a huge amount of information which paid off later in the film, and did both of these without you ever feeling that you were being spoonfed. And I can't recall the last time something moved me so deeply in the cinema.This movie is, simply, a work of genius.",10,1,4,14 October 2009
Snowden," I think I detect an agenda...
","Edward Snowden works for various clandestine elements of the US government machinery. While writing software to shut down Chinese hackers, he discovers that the US is carrying out illegal surveillance over billions of emails from US citizens. What should he do?Well, we know what he did, he blew the whistle. And despite the fact that he was proved right, and measures were taken to stop the illegal collection of uncountable emails, his copybook is so comprehensively blotted that he remains an exile in Moscow.Oliver Stone takes things very seriously indeed, and this can sometimes result in two things: one, his personal agenda overtakes the story he is telling and, two, the issues he is raising overpower the entertainment value of the movie. Both these flaws are at work here.Stone clearly regards Snowden as a hero, a martyr. Maybe this is justified, but it is a little difficult to tell because Stone only ever gives us one side of the picture.And, unforgiveably, the movie is somewhat on the dull side. Snowden's story is interesting and has built in suspense but, at 134 minutes, the telling of it drags noticeably at times.Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a good performance as Snowden, as does Shailene Woodley as his girlfriend Lindsay Mills. For me, the best performance was Rhys Ifans, almost unrecognisable as CIA Deputy Director Corbin O'Brian.I came out of this better informed I think, though it was difficult to tell how much of what I was being fed was fact, and how much was Stone's overheated agenda at work. But I can't honestly say I was entertained that much.",7,0,1,16 May 2018
A Clockwork Orange," Difficult to divorce the message from the medium
","I saw A Clockwork Orange when it first came out, having read the book (not any easy read, incidentally - the droog slang is easier to listen to than to read: the whole book is narrated by Alex). I enjoyed the film (superficially) then it disappeared because Kubrick withdrew it due to the copycat factor.On encountering it again after Kubrick's death I could understand much more easily that the thematic centre of the movie is the morality of depriving someone of choice - what is worse? The evil that someone does, or the evil of depriving them of the ability to choose whether or not to commit evil acts? Kubrick slyly uses a variety of means to make Alex a character we can like and identify with despite the dreadful acts he commits. And then the conditioning process - and the acts perpetrated on him after his release - make us sympathise with him. This is necessary in order for us to understand the theme of the film. Yet it is also the major factor responsible for real world copycat crime based on this movie.This, of course, is an unsolvable dilemma.Personally, I am all for taking away the choice of those who commit such acts.",9,1,2,10 July 2011
Woman in Gold," Excellent
","Maria Altmann, who fled to the USA from Vienna during World War II, determines - with the assistance of lawyer Randy Schoenberg - to petition the Austrian Government for the return of various art treasures stolen by the Nazis. The Austrian Government might be more constructively disposed towards cooperation were it not for the fact that one of the pieces is Portrait Of Adele Bloch-Bauer, Maria's aunt, which occupies pride of place in Vienna's Belvedere Palace.Helen Mirren plays Maria and Ryan Reynolds plays Randy in this dramatisation of real-life events, which is pitched perfectly - the story is gripping (and there is much at stake, particularly for Randy), there is a welcome seasoning of humour, and a selection of sobering flashbacks showing the affluence of Maria's family, and how it can all be washed away in a second. The story is highly enjoyable, but there are some sobering a moving moments which emphasise the importance of the events behind the story - this is about much, much more than a painting.",9,1,2,3 May 2015
Where Eagles Dare," Good but dated
","Richard Burton is the headline attraction, with Clint Eastwood playing second fiddle, in this adaptation of Alistair Maclean's Where Eagles Dare.The story is of a secret wartime mission behind enemy lines, to a fortress stronghold accessible only by cable car. The plot hardly matters: it is simply a hook to hang several set pieces on. They are the ascent, the fighting within the stronghold, the descent, and the chase back to the airfield to escape. All the set pieces work well, though the final chase works best because it features physical stunts and effects and thus looks real. The shenanigans on the cable car didn't really convince at the time, and certainly don't convince now. And the fight in the château is the same as any other dime-a-dozen shootout.If you watch this, you get some idea why Burton headed the cast: even though this is effectively a popcorn romp he is a heavy presence and commands respect. You can almost feel Eastwood deferring to him (as an actor).This is still an entertaining watch even though it is now showing its age a bit.",7,1,5,5 July 2011
Groundhog Day," An original
","Sent to Punxatawny to broadcast on the annual Groundhog Day festivities, obnoxious, ambitious, arrogant TV weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) is put out because he regards the assignment as beneath him. Further irritated due to being snowed in, his annoyance is complete when he finds himself waking up, over and over, to the same day.This film, nominally a comedy, almost defies classification. At the heart of it is the way Phil's experience of re-living the same day over and over gradually liberates him from the petty minded unpleasantness which governs his life, and enables his innate likability (which he has suppresses) to come out. But the variations in the repeat experiences is perhaps the easiest element for the viewer to enjoy, particularly when Phil comes to realise that he can actually do anything he wants in the knowledge that he will be free of the consequences when Sonny and Cher wake him again next morning.There is never any explanation for this, and it doesn't matter in the slightest - the film is always entertaining, always interesting, and is a true original.",Null,1,3,21 August 2011
National Treasure," Fun Romp
","Disney set out to make an enjoyable adventure movie for family audiences and guess what? They succeeded.This modern day take on Indiana Jones-style clue following works well. It has a decent story, plausible enough for disbelief to be suspended, and a good cast who perform well enough in roles which are mostly cardboard cutouts.Having said that, Nicolas Cage and Jon Voight bring a nice tension to a father and son with some not-always-easy history between them.Sean Bean give us a likable baddie, although it is the sort of role he can (and does) play in his sleep.There are some nice physical effects, and a pleasing visual style overall.This is undemanding fare but then, it shouldn't have to be.",7,0,1,25 May 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Grabs you - very good
","I'm beginning to think that the people who make CGI features have got it pegged a lot better than those who make live action movies. So often they seem to have a good story, an excellent script, cracking characterisation, and fabulous visuals.How To Train Your Dragon is no exception.Hiccup is the son of Viking chief Stoick, whose village is beset by dragons which steal the livestock. Hiccup is a disappointment to his father, especially when he doesn't take the same warlike approach to dragon-slaying classes as his contemporaries. But then Hiccup begins to be able to deal with the dragons better than the other youngsters, because he has secretly befriended an injured dragon.This is an outcast story, dealing with a youngster who is alienated, but has the strength of character to stick to his guns in the face of pressure from all sides to conform. But it is also an exciting adventure story with a great deal of humour. The characters are engaging and well-drawn (in the dramatic sense, although they also look good).And the movie looks great. The locations are stunning, the animation is first rate, and 3D is very well used (focus pulls, in particular, work very well in 3D).And, more than anything else, there were big, big chunks of this film where it just got hold of me almost physically (and certainly emotionally) and took me on Hiccup's journey with him. Possibly a little intense for younger children, this is a great family film. I loved it.",9,4,8,1 April 2010
Total Recall," Big sci-fi fun
","Manual worker Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger), mildly out of sorts with life, takes a virtual holiday with Recall, a company which implants exciting memories of the holiday you didn't have (as, for instance, a spy). Armed police suddenly invade the place, and Doug finds himself embroiled in a conspiracy where his is a double (or triple) agent who has had his memories replaced with fake ones, is married to someone who is actually an agent/minder and not really his wife (Sharon Stone, in her breakout role), and ends up plotting against (or possibly unwittingly for), dictator Kolhaagen (Ronnie Cox) while falling in with his real lover (or is she) Melina (Rachel Ticotin). Or is this all part of his 'holiday'? This brash, ebullient sci-fi romp, based on a Philip K Dick short story, is huge fun. Paul Verhoeven handles the action well, all the actors enjoy themselves (Schwarzenegger's shortcomings as an actor are outweighed by his screen presence and verve), effects, makeup and set design are all excellent, and Sharon Stone is unbelievably sexy.Plus the story is good fun, and never lets you go.",8,0,2,31 August 2012
Limitless," Unusual and enjoyable
","Bradley Cooper is Eddie Morra, a down-at-heel writer: despite having received an advance for his book, he hasn't written a word. He lives in apathetic squalor and his girlfriend is on the point of dumping him. Then he bumps into his ex-wife's brother who offers him a tablet - legal, apparently - which will unlock access to the 90% of his brain which isn't normally used. Suddenly Eddie is able to finish his book, read the markets and make money, learn languages overnight, and become a general wunderkind. However, there is a price to be paid. More precisely, there are several prices to be paid.Having seen the trailer for Limitless a number of times, I thought I had a reasonable idea of what I was in for. But, while I was in the same general area, I was in for a quite a lot of surprises (for one thing, the trailer connects audio and images which don't belong together in the movie).This film was a lot of fun. It had a really good story which didn't always go in the direction you expected it to. And, while unlocking 90% of the brain's potential also seemed to give Eddie other powers - speed, vision, athleticism etc.), I never had too much trouble accepting that this was reasonable. All the cast played well and had fun. The direction was striking without being so flamboyant as to be overpowering. And I loved the ending.This was another film which delivered more than I expected.",9,0,1,1 April 2011
Don't Breathe," Edge of seat stuff
","Alex gets information from his Dad's security company to target houses for burglaries which he carries out with Rocky and Money (he fancies Rocky, but she is Money's girlfriend). Rocky is a victim of her alcoholic mother, Alex would be a decent lad if he wasn't besotted with Rocky, and Money is a despicable sh!t beyond redemption. So another job is lined up....The target is the only remaining inhabited house in a deserted section of Detroit. The occupant is a blind war veteran who has a settlement from the parents of a girl who killed his daughter in a road accident: that settlement is the target for the burglary. No-one lives nearby, the old guy is blind, and Money has brought along a gun, you know, just in case. What could possibly go wrong?Anyone who has seen a movie with a similar set-up - it's not uncommon - will know that quite a lot can go wrong, actually. And so it does, And it would be really unfair for me to say any more, for two reasons.One, this film is very suspenseful, and I wouldn't want to spoiler any of the suspenseful elements as our three young villains try to avoid being detected by the unseeing householder.And, two, there are a number of occasions where the story takes you into WTF? territory. Perfectly fairly, it turns out, but sudden turns which come at you out of nowhere. I do love a film which suddenly completely wrongfoots you.Stephen (Avatar) Lang is the blind veteran, but the young unknown actors who play the gang are all very good, too.Despite having some misgivings over the way the perceived moralities of the characters get played with, I thought this was a rather good suspense thriller.",8,1,2,21 May 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Not bad, but the artoon is better
","Small town girl Belle gives up her liberty to free her father from a Beast. She does not know that the captor is a selfish, loveless Prince. He was enchanted to remain a Beast until he discovers how to love. If he fails he will remain a Beast forever, together with his enchanted servants (tough on them, but there you go). Will Belle be the one to unlock the love within him before the last petal falls from the enchanted rose, and free them all? Or will vain Gaston, determined to marry an unwilling Belle, mess things up?You already know the answer if you saw the hand-drawn animated version from 26 years ago. That was the first animated film to be nominated for the Best Film Oscar. So how does the remake compare, and does it stand on its own?It is a handsome film. That's because the basic design - sets, locations, characters - is strongly based on the original. There is much more texture, of course. And Beast's castle is far more extensive. I liked the way that every time a petal falls, part of the castle crumbles: this explains why much of it is in ruins. And the characters, whether human or castle objects are very obviously based on their drawn counterparts.I thought there were times when a location could have been used rather than a set, particularly in the woods, but this is a minor point.The casting is very good. Each cast member fits their part. Most sing well, too - Emma Watson is good, but maybe lacks a little in technique and vocal strength. There has been comment on Josh Gad's gay-leaning LeFou. Well, OK, but it's very understated. There is also a crossdressing gag which is funny, but it's over before you realise it. Incidentally, Luke Evans' Gaston is NOT the size of a barge.The film is inevitably loaded with CGI. As far as the household objects are concerned, this is superb. Lumiere, Cogsworth and co. are all animated superbly, look completely convincing, and integrate perfectly with sets and actors. The fight at the end is stunning.I had no problems with the Beast, but I know there are some who find his CGI face unconvincing. I think young viewers will have no problem.The story is familiar. Essentially unchanged from the animated version, it has some additional backstory. One of the reasons for seeing a remake is to discover the changes, so I will say no more about that. I thought the additions were worthwhile.This is, first and foremost, a musical film. I am delighted to report that the wonderful songs and expected production numbers are all present. Alan Menken's glorious melodies include several new songs and also the soundtrack score. Tim Rice adds words for the new songs. The wonderful original lyrics by the late, and much-missed, Howard Ashman are augmented by some which were cut from the original film. My only criticism is that some of the lyrics of 'Gaston' got lost in the mix of a rather raucous production.There are some good 3D moments, but I wouldn't bother making an effort to see it in 3D.There is much to enjoy here. Maybe it doesn't come up to the standard of its animated predecessor, but taken on its own I think it should find great success.",7,0,0,14 May 2018
Sicario," That woman annoyed me so much!
","An FBI SWAT squad raids a house in Arizona related to a Mexican Drugs cartel: they find 42 bodies before an explosion kills 2 of them. Team leader Kate (Emily Blunt) is recruited by Matt (Josh Brolin) to join a multi-agency task force to take on assorted cartel matters. She becomes disturbed by the way the task force, especially the mysterious Alejando (Benicio del Toro), appears to ignore established law enforcement protocols.This film is brilliantly directed (by Denis Villeneuve) with eyecatching cinematography (by Roger Deakins), and the action setpieces are strikingly well staged, with some stunning aerial photography. That element of this film is flawless.Then there is the intertwined plot thread about Kate's moral ambivalence towards what this group is engaged in. I understand that this is an important part of the film – it may even be the entire point of the film – but I found it tiresome. Specifically, I found Kate's character profoundly irritating. She was told on a number of occasions, 'If you don't like what we do and the way we do it, you don't have to be here,' yet she continued to be part of the team while, at the same time, constantly questioning, arguing, disagreeing and undermining her teammates. I had a great deal of trouble getting past that and, for me, it made the film a less enjoyable experience than it would otherwise have been.I guess I am simply too superficial to appreciate something for the morally ambiguous subtext it presents me with.",7,3,11,24 September 2015
Pulp Fiction," At least the Emperor is wearing underpants
","Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece! No it isn't. It's over-rated. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's not as good as it's painted. And Tarantino's faults - which become more apparent with every (pretentiously) numbered subsequent movie - are all here on show.His dialogue is good - it's his main strength, and is correctly recognised as such. But a) it is over-reliant on the F-word (his CSI episodes and Inglourious Basterds show that he can write excellent dialogue without it), and b) it would greatly benefit from external editing: Tarantino badly needs a McCartney to sweeten his Lennon, a Lennon to apply an edge to his McCartney.His direction is good - he extracts brilliant performances from his ensemble, and his ability to present a truly eye-catching image on screen is beyond doubt. Action is good, effects are good, set design is good etc.But he comes in for undue praise for other things. Self-indulgence is one - again, he desperately needs someone to take him in hand and moderate some of what he does for the benefit of the film.Case in point - Pulp Fiction's non-linear storytelling. The zip-rewind halfway through is not some sudden work of genius. It may very well be experimental but, if so, it does not work as well as linear storytelling would have done (which, I suspect, would have involved more work in breaking the story threads into coherent sections which still worked together when interleaved, or else inserting flashbacks). Tarantino has taken an unconventional, but easy, road and, in so doing, has got away with it because of the 'Emperor's New Clothes' factor. However, it doesn't make Pulp Fiction a work of genius, it actually makes it a worse film.Tarantino's lack of self-discipline means that, despite his abundance of talent, his output continues to be over-rated.",7,3,6,30 March 2011
Jack Reacher," Excellent action thriller
","5 people are shot dead and incontrovertible evidence leads the police to immediately pick up sniper James Barr, who simply asks for Jack Reacher. Reacher, an ex-army policeman of shadowy background, tells defence attorney Helen Rodin (who appears to have taken the case simply to spite her District Attorney father) that he believes Barr to be guilty because he got away with something similar while he was in the middle east. But he starts investigating anyway.Based on what I have read in the press, I find Tom Cruise the man to be an odd individual. But as a performer, there is a reason why he has been at the top of the pile for a long time - he makes good films, and he is good in them. Jack Reacher is one of his best.It is a very good part for Cruise - a macho protagonist, well able to handle himself, but not infallible. The story is strong, if a little familiar. The script is good fun, the action is handled well, Rosamund Pike provides solid support, and Robert Duvall, in a part which is little more than a cameo, is wonderful.But this is Cruise's film, and it is one of the best action thrillers in recent years.",9,17,22,2 February 2014
Les Misérables," Excellent but not perfect
","I'm a big movie fan: sadly, the missus isn't. She is, however, a big fan of musical theatre in general and Les Mis in particular, so this film was a must-see for both of us. I'm a fairly recent convert to Les Mis (the 25th anniversary performance in concert at the O2 did it for me), and I've been looking forward to the film for months.So what did we think of the film of the show of the book? Heaven knows that Hugo's novel of Jean Valjean's life adapts well to the screen, there have been enough versions of it. But this is an adaptation of the show, not the book.On the whole, it has been done extremely well. Cinema can do two things which a stage presentation can't - it can give you panorama, and it can give you intimacy. Tom Hooper's film does both - from the opening sequence in the docks to the superb finale, we are clearly not on stage. And, for much of the important songs, the performers are given close-ups which you wouldn't get in the theatre no matter how good your seats were.This ties in with the songs being performed rather than sung: in some ways this is a little difficult to get used to - there is an element of expecting stage performance, which is not at all how they are presented - but this is more than made up for by the immediacy and direct connection to the emotion of the pieces.In common with a lot of people, we were not convinced that Russell Crowe was the Javert we expected to see or hear, but most of the rest of the casting was good, with Jackman, Hathaway and Redmayne standing out (likewise with the singing: Barks and the students were also very good, Seyfried was a bit over-twittery for me).If you don't like musicals, it may convert you. The music is tried and tested, with at least half a dozen proved showstoppers. And there is a mountain of solid emotion here - my chin quivered and my eyes brimmed for a material percentage of the running time.It has too many flaws to be considered perfect, but it is very good indeed.Original review 16 Jan: update 19 Feb. My third viewing was in the company of hard-as-nails music teacher Mary and her 11 year old daughter Daisy. As predicted, not a tear from Mary and, also as predicted, floods from Daisy. But both thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the music was fantastic.I Dreamed A Dream is not the powerful show-stopping ballad we all thought it was: it is 3 minutes of raw pain set to music.",9,2,5,16 January 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Decent suspense thriller
","Symbologist Robert Langdon gets involved in the aftermath of a sinister killing at the Louvre which, in turn, leads to a quest to uncover the secrets of hidden messages relating to interpretations of Da Vinci's Last Supper.This is an intriguing and exciting thriller which adapts Dan Brown's pacey and thought-provoking novel very well. It never stops to draw breath (which may be just as well!) and is decently performed and well directed.I have two criticisms. One, Tom Hanks seems miscast and, two, the film seems to think it is a lot more significant than it is. Ultimately, it is no more than a decent suspense thriller and the mock religious resonances are actually neither here nor there.",7,2,3,16 December 2012
Titanic," Still an epic
","14 years ago I took my then 12 year-old daughter to see a three hour plus film, expecting her to get fidgety: she did not. Neither did I. And now, having seen the movie a number of additional times on a smaller screen, I revisit it on a big screen after a 3D revamp.My first viewing of this movie carried preconceptions with it: I was expecting it to retell the disaster, and I was expecting spectacular eye candy. I got both, and I appreciated that Cameron had chosen a fictitious love story as a vehicle for audience identification to bring home the tragedy on a personal level.On re-watching it 14 years later, I realise that what I'm watching is a romance, played out against the background of the Titanic disaster. I also realise a number of other things: for instance, the groundbreaking computerised extras are no longer as convincing as they were, James Horner's music is great, Cameron's direction is excellent and his writing, despite the occasional clunky bit of dialogue, is very skillful. Oh, and while the performances of the principals are very good, there is some very dodgy work from some of the bit part players.Overall, the verdict is that this film deserved its Oscars. And the 3D conversion has been very successfully carried out, and confirms that Cameron is one of a very small number of directors who truly understands 3D.",10,3,7,19 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," HP1 revisited
","Having just watched HP7A aka Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, my mind flies back - almost magically, one might say - to the film which started it all.My opinion now is not a lot different to what it was then. The book is a delightful experience - it captured my middle-aged imagination on page 1 and never let go for an instance, telling a cracking story well, and having me believe that Harry and his friends were in real jeopardy throughout. The film's main strength is that it captures much of the book very well.It has two weaknesses, however. The first is that it is, perhaps, a little too respectful towards its source material. This slavish desire to reflect on screen every tiny detail from the novel causes two problems. One, the film becomes somewhat clinically overstuffed with so much tiny detail that it almost suffocates the life out of it and, two, it sets a standard for detail so impossibly high that future films fall short (the portraits and staircases in Hogwarts no longer move, ghosts no longer charge around etc.).The second weakness is the three principals. I'm sorry, but I find Daniel Radcliffe pretty wooden throughout the series (subject to some comedy bits in a couple of the later films) and, if he was the best casting choice available, the others couldn't have been very good. Rupert Grint is saddled with a Ron Weasley who does him no favours at all. Not until very late in the series is Ron called upon to be anything than a gormless foil for Harry, a task which Grint accomplishes with ease (and I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing). And Emma Watson is just awful. So desperate is she to provide a dynamic performance that her mouth takes on an appallingly hypnotic life of its own. I don't ever recall seeing someone talk with such over-emphatic mouth movements. How curious, then, that future films in the series see Watson develop into being one of the very best things Harry Potter offers the viewer.",7,0,1,26 November 2010
In Time," All dressed up and nowhere to go
","It is either the future or some alternate reality. The population is encoded with a clock which is geared to your life functions. When you reach 25, the clock starts ticking away your last year. The currency on which everything operates is time to be added to, or taken away from, your clock / life expectancy. You can earn time, spend time, trade time, win time, or steal time (and all these things happen). Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), who lives in an impoverished time zone, is give over 100 years by jaded rich man Henry Hamilton who has wearied of life. Will makes his way into the affluent time zone where he wins more time gambling with time mega-tycoon Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). However, by-the-book time policeman Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) believes that Will murdered Hamilton, so he confiscates Will's time, and Will kidnaps Weis' daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and goes on the run.The idea of a dystopian society where an early death is pre-determined has been done before, of course, notably in Logan's Run, but I can't recall a story where life expectancy is the unit of currency, and the rich live longer at the expense of the poor dying early. It is a nice - and original - notion, and the surface of this society is well realised.The trouble is that, having come up with a terrific idea, writer/director (also writer of Gattaca and The Trueman Show) doesn't seem to have much idea of what to do with it. We spend a lot of time seeing the privation in the poor sector and the privilege in the rich sector, and the crooks who steal time, and how you pay tolls to cross time zones (it costs you a month to cross out of the poorest zone, a year to cross into the richest zone), but what we are left with is ultimately a chase movie and, what's more, a chase movie which doesn't have any real resolution. I enjoyed it, but I felt that there was a great deal of potential in the premise which wasn't touched.On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried wins two prizes, one for the Bulgiest Bra Scene (sadly, the time police raid interrupted a promising game of strip poker), and the other for the Longest Sprint In Inappropriate Clothing Scene (about 1,000 metres, flat out, in a miniskirt barely bigger than a wide belt, and high heels which were almost as tall as she was).",Null,12,20,4 November 2011
Thor," Non-stop fun
","This was big daft fun. After a short sequence where Natalie Portman and her fellow scientists drive into this chap in the middle of an unexplained whirlwind, there is a lengthy sequence in Asgard. Asgard looks great (the Rainbow Bridge is phenomenal), the Norse Gods are all played well, and the action elements are beautifully done. Then Thor is cast down to Earth, powerless, to teach him a lesson, at which point a) things start to go pear-shaped in Asgard, and b) the goings-on on Earth are somewhat less engaging than those in Asgard, although there is some very well-judged comedy. But the last half hour or more is action all the way, both on Earth and in Asgard.I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, as did my companions (one of whom is far from a committed comics movie fan), and took pleasure in the way further elements are included to set up the Avengers movie - again, don't leave until after the credits. There are places where what you see on the screen screams 'Kirby!' If I was to offer any criticisms, I would say: 1. There is a point where the pace drops somewhat about half an hour in; 2. There is quite a lot of it which reminded me of other movie (the small town battle reminded me of similar sequences in both Superman II and Supergirl); 3. Rene Russo is wasted. I imagine she features strongly in 'Deleted Scenes.' Natalie Portman never really convinced me. Kat Dennings was fun but underused. Idris Elba was a great Heimdall. Anthony Hopkins added an immeasurable amount of class as Odin - a strong ruler, absolutely assured as to his authority, but calm and compassionate when appropriate.But Chris Hemsworth is the big discovery here. His Thor is as nuanced as Chris Reeves' Superman/Clark Kent. A wonderfully enjoyable performance in a film which is non-stop entertainment.",8,7,13,30 April 2011
The Happening," Could be worse. But could be quite a lot better.
","I'm an old enough film enthusiast to remember what it was like before the internet - you found about films from the newspaper film critic, maybe a movie magazine programme on TV, maybe a movie magazine from the newsagent. 3 voices, maximum, and easy enough to ignore. These days, the quantity of opinion on the IMDb alone means that, if you're inclined to read about films before you go to see them, it's almost impossible to go in without some preconceptions.So I took my seat knowing that The Happening had a substantial bad press, and I find myself wondering what I would have thought about it had I not been carrying the opinions of others with me. Because I didn't find it as bad as it was painted.Don't get me wrong - it is heavily flawed. The worst flaw is the script. There is much 'direlogue', character development is somewhat illogical, you leave the movie with thousands of unanswered questions (hundreds of people are dumped off a train in a small town, have a meeting in a diner, and then scream off in a host of cars - er, where did those cars come from? I didn't spot a Hertz next to the diner), there are moments when you really aren't sure what sort of film you're watching, the villains of the piece menacingly wave their branches around (ooh, scary!)... and I think the script and direction are responsible for Zooey Deschanel giving what is likely to be the worst performance of her career. And, given the amount of career she still has left, that's saying something (it gets better towards the end, but in the first half of the film she is astonishingly bad).So what is there that's good? Well, the idea isn't bad. It would better suit an episode of Twilight Zone, but it's still a reasonable idea for a movie. The film gives a nice sense of a small group of people doing their best to survive as civilisation crumbles around their ears. And there are a number of sequences which successfully deliver quite effective shocks.Bearing in mind that I'm easily pleased, and that I have a particular soft spot for crumbling civilisation stories, I quite enjoyed The Happening (dreadful title, though).",5,1,5,19 June 2008
Castle in the Sky," Splendid but weird
","Disney leaped to animation superiority in 1939 and then stayed there for decades. Warner Bros made a spirited showing but they, and everyone else, were demonstrably lower down the scale. But in the later years of the 20th century Studio Ghibli made a definite play to be an alternate line of animation features - not a competitor, for the Japanese movies were - and continue to be - resolutely un-Disneylike in every possible way.Castle In The Sky from 1986, one of the early Studio Ghibli films, is a case in point. It tells the story of two waifs who are looking for the legendary floating city of Laputa while being pursued by two opposing groups.I can't praise this film highly enough. It is always exciting, and visually stunning with an astonishing level of visual imagination. This is impossible to describe, but the two things it called to mind are the general feel of Jean 'Moebius' Giraud's unfamiliar worlds (there is a sequence with a railway chase where the railway tracks run on trestles halfway down a cavernous ravine where dwellings are cantilevered out of the canyon walls), crossed with organic/non-organic hybridisation: the nearest thing I can suggest is the impact of HR Giger's Alien and Species design, although the visual aspect is nothing like that.This film is exciting, involving, and a feast for the eyes. I enjoyed it greatly.",9,1,1,20 June 2010
The Shape of Water," Sunk by Stupid
","An amphibious humanoid is brought in to a government laboratory in 1960s Baltimore. Officer Strickland seems to have it in mind to research the creature to death, preferably via torture. Lonely, horny, mute cleaner Elisa spots a similarly alienated sole in the creature. She communicates with him via jazz records, sign language, and boiled eggs. And she hatches a plot to break him out of captivity...I heard good things, I like Del Toro's work, this is my kind of (geek fantasy) film, and it won Best Film this year. So why was I disappointed?The idea is good - the Creature From The Black Lagoon in a doomed romance with a damaged woman, and a sadistic baddie looming in the shadows. The performances are excellent. Sally Hawkins is heartbreaking, Doug Jones' physical presence is, as always, flawless, and Michael Shannon is chilling. He's over the top, but he is supposed to be. The execution is mostly good, but here it is in the execution where things start going downhill. I think we are supposed to look beyond the credibility of the situation and accept the film as a work of art. But I found this difficult. I could accept Elisa hesitantly croaking accompaniment to one of the records, especially after discovering the creature has an ability to heal (which is never explained or explored). I was less accepting of the full-blown Hollywood song and dance routine which followed.Ultimately, what sunk the film for me was the bucketsful of Stupid and unanswered questions, especially in the latter half. Why did no-one try to communicate with the creature? Why were they intent on destroying him sadistically? Why did the laws of physics not apply in Elisa's bathroom? What was the point of Strickland's bloodied handkerchief. Why didn't they just take the creature straight to the sea? These are a mere handful - there are many more.I wanted to love this film. I admit that I liked it, but there was so much wrong with it that I should have liked it a whole lot more. Yes, it's a fantasy, a romance, a fable, but it didn't have to be so dumb.",7,0,4,1 May 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," Don't believe your own publicity
","The thing which made The Matrix such a good movie was its story. Packed on top of that were some ace visuals and action sequences, but it was the story which carried the film.Not that the story was the greatest thing since sliced bread, because it wasn't. It was a rattling good yarn, but it didn't contain the secrets of the universe.However, watch The Matrix reloaded and you will come to realise that, perhaps, those who wrote the script to this movie do think that the script to the first one had something pretty profound going on, because they have picked up on all the most pretentious elements and amplified them.Oh dear.And it's a shame, because there are once more some splendid action sequences - the freeway sequence, the fight with the multiple Agents Smith, and the opening sequence - but there is also some appalling overindulgence - the Zion rave (which overstays its welcome by a substantial margin) and the dreadful, dreadful scene with the dictionary-chewing Architect.Visuals without story are not good enough to sustain audience commitment.",5,9,14,1 June 2010
The Disaster Artist," Almost defines 'odd'
","Greg Sistero meets the downright peculiar Tommy Wiseau at acting classes in San Francisco. Finding an odd sort of mutual harmony, they go to Los Angeles to try to break into movies. When Hollywood fails to break their door down, they decide to make their own movie: Tommy writes, produces, directs and stars.The opening titles tell you that this is based on a true story. Well, the Coen Brothers said the same thing at the start of Fargo, and there wasn't a word of truth in that. And how could this be true when Tommy is such an outrageous caricature of a character - long black hair, an impenetrable accent in which two thirds of all consonants go missing (think Benecio del Toro in The Usual Suspects x 10), and total mystery as to his true originals and, especially, the source of the money he uses to finance their film The Room.This film is a little bit slow to get going, and my scepticism as to its veracity, coupled with the fact that the excessively mannered delivery of James Franco (not one of my favourite actors) as the ridiculous and enormously irritating Tommy meant that I was wondering wither to walk out or not. It was only the more likeable Dave Franco as the more likeable Greg that kept me in my seat.But as the film production got under way and the titular disaster started to unfold, I got more intrigued, and ended up quite enjoying it.It is populated by a host of the Franco brothers' celebrity friends, often unrecognisable, and all having great fun.And the end titles and the sequence immediately preceding them add enormously to the impact of the film.Directed by James Franco, this is obviously a pet project of sorts but, by the time it was over, I could see why it appealed to them. There is a vast amount of oddness here, but by the end the movie had overcome my initial substantial reservations.",8,4,5,2 May 2018
The Fountain," A lot less than meets the eye
","Invading Iraq must have looked good on paper, but it didn't turn out too well in practice. The Fountain is a lot like that. A sci-fi/fantasy epic with Hugh Jackman, addressing universal truths - must be great, right? Wrong.This film only runs about 80 minutes without the closing credits. And a good 10 minutes of that is material which gets repeated during the movie. So how come I kept checking my watch repeatedly from less than 10 minutes after the start? There are two reasons. One, this film is stupefyingly dull. Two, it is mystifyingly incomprehensible. The narrative is non-linear in places where it doesn't need to be. Things remain unexplained. The audience is cast completely adrift and isn't even offered a smidgen of assistance to navigate their way through the disparate sections. And every slowly dripping second bears evidence of just how self-awarely clever the filmmakers were being. Far more clever than me, obviously (and, oh, how I hate it when filmmakers rub your nose in how clever they are and you aren't! Have a browse through other reviews, and see how many of them are by people who are impressed by it but confess they don't understand it. And those who say they understand it, but don't! Ambiguity leading to multiple interpretations is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that it just might not be quite as clever as you thought. Let me try to explain the story - and you must bear in mind that this is an attempted linear narrative constructed from segments which are delivered in what appears to be a fairly random order, none of which is ever fully explained. Hugh Jackman is a conquistador who is sent by Queen Isabella of Spain (Rachel Weisz) to the New World to find the Tree of Life (apparently God moved it there from the Holy Land, He alone knows why). The purpose of this is so that the Queen and the Conquistador will both live for ever and the Inquisition will be overturned (huh?). Jackman finds the Tree of Life, gobbles down loads of sap, and sprouts so many cabbages that he dies/becomes one with nature/God or something equally improbable / incomprehensible. Meanwhile in present day, research scientist Hugh Jackman is on the brink of discovering a cure for cancer, just in time to save his wife Izzi (geddit? Rachel Weisz again) who is suffering from a brain tumour. Whoops, too late. She is buried in the middle of a snow-covered wilderness, but not before telling Jackman to finish the last chapter of a book she has been beautifully hand-writing, which appears to be telling the story of the Conquistador. She even gives him an elaborate dip pen to use to write it (he, the fool, uses it to tattoo an ink wedding ring on his finger to replace the one which went missing in the lab. And/or at the Tree of Life if you believe that he is the same person as the Conquistador despite having become a cabbage patch). Meanwhile - or later - Jackman is living as a bald monk hermit in a huge gold Christmas tree ornament which contains a tree. I was a bit confused as to whether this was the Tree of Life or a tree which contained the essence of Rachel Weisz (or both). I wasn't confused as to how it and/or Jackman got into the Christmas Tree ornament, or why they were drifting about in gold ether - I simply don't know, because it was never explained. Jackman has been spending his time using his dip pen to tattoo further rings up and down his arms, shouting angrily at manifestations of Rachel Weisz, nibbling bits of tree bark, and hovering about in lotus position (get on with the last chapter Hugh, you've been there long enough for armsful of tattoos!). And then he leaves the Christmas Tree ornament and hovers off into the ether until he disappears in a blaze of light. The end.Incidentally, the special features on the DVD feature a riveting sequence of bald monk Jackman preparing mushroom soup in extreme closeup. Can't understand why they cut that from the movie, he said sarcastically.I must also offer a couple of words of comment about the soundtrack music. 'Constant' and 'Dreary.'This film was pretentious codswallop of the first order. I have no doubt that the filmmakers thought they were producing something of major importance and artistic impact. So, I suggest, did the tailor who produced the Emperor's New Clothes.The IMDb is littered with comments by people saying 'This is the worst movie I have ever seen'. I am easily pleased and would not lightly make that remark and, in fairness, there are some striking visuals and the basic idea, dealt with in a less 'artistic' manner may well have made a half-decent movie. So I wouldn't say this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but I would say that it is one of the least entertaining movies I have ever seen, and I regard it as a major blot on the CV of Jackman, an actor whose work I have otherwise enjoyed (Weisz? Meh).If you like self-important drivel, then this is the film for you. If not, avoid it like the plague.",1,12,19,27 September 2008
Zombieland," Good solid fun
","Poor old Zombieland. It is always going to be the second zombie comedy and, to that extent, it's always going to be in the shadow of Shaun Of The Dead, but that doesn't mean it's inferior, because it isn't. It is, however, very American in contrast to Shaun's extreme Englishness.There is little in the way of story, but a fair amount in terms of character work. And all the characters are likable notwithstanding their substantial flaws. The humour, of which there is plenty, flows naturally from the characters and their situation, and the splatter effects are fine (these, by the way, are the modern, new, go-faster zombies, not the old stumbling around type).All four main characters are well played, with Woody Harrelson enjoying the opportunity to play broad. Jesse Eisenberg seems born to play everynerds, although I find his resemblance to British stand-up comedian Alan Davis somewhat distracting. I am very taken with Emma Stone - having seen her now in The House Bunny, The Rocker and now this, each time she has done well with very different characters. And I think Abigail Breslin is going to have a very effective transition to grown-up actress.This movie entertained me solidly all the way through and I recommend it.",9,1,5,7 October 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," Wonderful, but not perfect
","Rather late in the day - I'm 60 - I finally caught up with Frank Capra's 1946 feelgood morality tale.George Bailey (James Stewart), after a lifetime of putting his own wishes on hold in order to do the best thing for everyone else, finally cracks one Christmas Eve when his uncle carelessly misplaces $8,000, leaving the family business facing ruin. Seeing suicide as the only way out, it is up to probationary angel Clarence to pull him round by showing him the difference he has made to the rest of the world.Reading rather like an updated version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, the first three quarters of this movie leads us in detail through George's life as set-up for the eventual climax. And the story works well, with Stewart, in one of his keynote performances, oozing decency and good humour throughout (except for the high contrast moments when he snaps).Yet there are weaknesses. The 90 minutes spent on George's life story is, perhaps, a little too long, given that its dramatic purpose is mainly to set up the differences in a world without George - it rambles. Lionel Barrymore's Machiavellian Potter is a little bit one-note in his pantomime villainy - you get the feeling that he wishes he had moustachios to twirl villainously while tieing damsels to the railway line. And, worst of all, for me at least, the film ends without the issue of Potter's malicious retention of the missing $8,000 being resolved.But these are minor quibbles with a film which deserves its happy reputation.The DVD transfer I watched was beautifully crisp and sharp, with sensitive colorization (being British, I would prefer to spell that 'colourisation', but I sacrifice technical correctness in favour of accuracy).",8,1,3,7 September 2012
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A good first sequel
","Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts consolidates the successes of the first.It tells a self contained story well (introducing a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher as it does so, in the person of Kenneth Branagh's very funny narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart) and introduces some characters and elements which are part of the larger picture - Lucius Malfoy and Dobbie the house elf, for instance, both destined to have future significance which is not apparent at this stage.As before, the technical aspects of the movie are fine, and the climax is particularly exciting.Most of all, though, the three young stars are noticeably better than they were in the first film, and the improvement is particularly noticeable with Emma Watson. She tried so hard in the first film that she was distractingly bad. Here in part 2, she has already improved to the extent that she is merely young and inexperienced. And she gets better from film to film.",Null,0,1,18 July 2011
Die Hard," Brilliant action thriller
","New York cop John McClane travels to Los Angeles to work things out with his estranged wife, only to find her office block at the mercy of terrorists, and he is their only hope of rescue.Die Hard did two things - it created a template for big budget action thrillers with one good man against the massed forces of evil, and it turned Bruce Willis from a moderately successful light romantic actor with a predominantly TV career into a major macho big screen star.Die Hard was pretty good. It pushed the boundaries of suspension of disbelief, but it never stepped over them. It gave us excellent baddies, a resourceful and admirable - though not perfect - goodie, some idiots (and one sound ally) on the outside, and a claustrophobic environment and solid scenario within which all the elements could play out. And, of course, scads of first rate action.Die Hard was the first and still the best, and I recommend it.",9,3,3,16 November 2013
Psycho," Groundbreaking and brilliant
","I was fortunate enough to see Psycho for the first time at a late night cinema presentation with an audience full of teens who had heard about the shower scene but had, like me, never seen the film before. And, apart from the notoriety of the shower scene, we didn't know the rest of the story.There was no internet, no IMDb, it hadn't been on TV yet, and people had been quite good about keeping the main elements of it under wraps.So we didn't know that we were going to identify with Marion Crane, tempted into committing a robbery, realising the mistake she'd made, having a helpful conversation with the nice young man at the motel she had checked into which led to her resolving to put things right. And then being abruptly, savagely, and shockingly slaughtered. We didn't know we'd identify with her. But Hitchcock did and, while we were sitting in the darkness trying to regain some sort of footing after the emotional carpet had been ripped out from under our feet, Hitchcoock was sitting behind the camera quietly amused at how he had manipulated us.And then he did it again (without cutting us loose from our emotional moorings, admittedly) - Arbogast's killing, the revelation of the mummy, Norman's appearance in the doorway, and Norman's final look to camera - all shocking, horrifying moments.This movie is a masterclass in audience manipulation, with nothing to equal it before or since (Jaws came close).",9,0,0,6 June 2010
American Made," Entertaining with muddied morality
","Bored TWA pilot Barry Seal is prevailed upon by shadowy CIA operative 'Shafer' to fly spy photography missions for them and, subsequently, to courier materials to and from Noriega in Panama. This turns quickly and easily into smuggling cocaine for the Medellin cartel. Much money results and, before he knows it, Seal is in the middle of a very big, lucrative and dangerous business.Barry Seal was a real person, and the events shown in this film largely took place. I'm not sure if they would have taken place in quite the way they are shown here, though. Tom Cruise plays Seal as a likeable chap, an almost-loser who is a mix between savvy and naive, and blessed with an ability to regard morally reprehensible activity as somehow justifiable.The film is played almost as a comedy and is quite amusing throughout, despite the questionable and occasionally violent activity which takes place.I enjoyed it, but I found myself wondering about both the morality of portraying Seal as a likeable schmuck whose only crime was finding himself out of his depth, and also the presentation of what happened as a comedy. These were not merry japes.",7,17,20,8 May 2018
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," More does not equal better
","It was a stroke of genius to invent a toy which, with a few manipulations, changed from a vehicle of some kind into a robot - a simple concept, if complex in the engineering. Creating an animated series as a running commercial for the toys was also brilliant although, like all such things, the fad ran its course and both toys and TV series were relegated to the fond remembrances of ex-small boys. However, nostalgia is big business, hence the reappearance of the Transformers in real-life (well, high quality CGI) in 2007's big screen Transformers movie.Let's be clear - if you thought the first movie was rubbish, there's nothing in Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen which is going to change your mind.I happened to quite like it, and so did lots of others because it enjoyed considerable box office success: so much so that the makers have set out to replicate that success in this sequel.Let me look at the common features of both movies. There is no story, of course, only backstory (viz. the ongoing interstellar war between two groups of shape-changing robots, the good Autobots and the evil Decepticon - this scenario was an adequate hook on which to hang an episodic animated series), but interposing an engaging couple of humans is a great help. Shia LaBoeuf as beleaguered everyman Sam Witwicky is ideal for audience identification, and Megan Fox as the sinuous Mikaela is ideal eye-candy for slavering male fanboys (for, make no mistake, these movies aren't aimed at women). And it was a masterstroke to bring in Peter Cullen's excellent voice characterisation of Optimus Prime - magisterial but compassionate - to bridge from the TV series to the movies. Sam's parents play non-essential but entertaining roles in both movies (particularly Julie White as Mom) and John Turturro reprises his role, albeit more sympathetically in the sequel (his role as establishment a-hole is taken by a newly appointed government something-or-other). The script is blessed with humour, there's lots of action, and the Transformers themselves are visual marvels.Now let me look at what has been changed for this sequel. Er, nothing. No, that's not strictly fair - the big change is that there is far more - FAR - more - of everything, even to the extent of introducing a second, and unnecessary, beleaguered everyman. There are more Transformers, more explosions, more running away, and that's where the problem lies - when the film concentrates on Sam's problems, or on the interactions between the Transformers as characters, it's fine.It's when the action takes over that the flaws of the first movie become compounded. Number one is that the action is so frenzied, and the camera-work (as is the fashion these days) is so verite that it's often difficult to tell what's going on - use a tripod sometimes, folks! Number two is that it is often difficult to tell which Transformer is which, particularly with the Decepticons, and if you don't know who is fighting, how can you care about the outcome. And the third is the overkill factor - the lesson of Matrix 3, that interminable CGI action sequences lose the audience's engagement after a while - seems to have passed Michael Bay by. Transformers 2 could have been at least half an hour shorter, most of it trimmed from the final action sequence.The ongoing potential subplot about Mikaela's Dad's shady past is touched on and then passed over.These flaws are a pity, because there is much to enjoy about the movie, particularly the sequence about the hot chick at college who unaccountably takes a shine to Sam. I could have done without the leg-humping gags, and half an hour of ear-pounding action, but otherwise I enjoyed it.",6,1,7,25 June 2009
The Witch," Excellent performances, production design and cinematography in slow, tedious and self-important period horror
","The Pilgrim Fathers have set up shop, but devout William falls out with them and sets up a homestead miles away with his wife and 6 kids, going from teenager Thomasin down to a baby. But a couple of the kids disappear, and others are at odds with each over as to who is a witch and how witchcraft is affecting the family. Since the family all believes very strongly in witchcraft, this has a major bearing on relationships within the family.It almost doesn't matter whether the witchcraft here is real or not: what matters is what happens to the family, and I'm certainly not going to spoiler whether the goat really is the devil, or whether Caleb really does fall foul of a witch, or whether it is all mind tricks and excessive devoutness. To do that would spoil what little enjoyment you might get from this film.Because this ponderous movie takes itself very seriously indeed. The dialogue is archaic and delivered in Yorkshire accents, and is often very difficult to follow. The images are carefully composed and captured on film, and give a convincing impression of how hard, drab and dark life must have been. Yes, there is a slowly building sense of an awful fate in the offing, but the emphasis here is on 'slowly', and the starting point is pretty depressing to start off with.On the plus side, the performances are all excellent and great effort has been put into what the film looks like. It just isn't very entertaining.",7,2,8,23 March 2016
Jersey Boys," Something of a disappointment
","A bunch of New Jersey lads eventually achieve popular success thanks to the unique voice of singer Frankie Valli and the songwriting skills of Bob Gaudio. But there have been pitfalls along the way - organised crime and family tragedies to name but two.Clint Eastwood directs the big screen version of the hit stage show, using the same conceit of having the group members offer commentary on the story as it goes along. And what we get is proof that what works well on stage doesn't necessarily have the same impact on screen. My two main quibbles are that the episodic nature of the narrative as it recounts the incidents in the Four Seasons' story is noticeably episodic on screen - there is little sense of long-term narrative cohesiveness in the movie: ditto the stage show, but the artifice of the theatre means that this does not matter to anything like the same extent. Also - and, I think more importantly - the stage show imparts a joyfulness, especially in delivery of the songs, and this is almost entirely lacking in the movie. I also thought the 'old' makeup in the 1990 scene was completely unconvincing and John Lloyd Young's lack of resemblance to Valli, which hardly matters on stage, was distracting (he sings beautifully, and nails Valli's falsetto perfectly).It's not a disaster - far from it. The musical sequences are terrific, Christopher Walken is, as usual, value for money, Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito is excellent, the end title sequence is a delight, and the director has a fun cameo. But, compared with the show, it is a somewhat dour disappointment.",7,0,8,4 July 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Slow and emotionally uninvolving. Not my Best Film by a mile.
","CIA operative Maya's single-mindedness eventually leads to the mission which kills Bin Laden.Such a short synopsis for such a long film. Katherine Bigelow's movie is nominated for best Film Oscar. It doesn't deserve it, despite the technical expertise with which it is put together. I will tell you why.This film starts off with a black screen and a welter of sound clips from 9/11 as it was going on. My eyes filled and I choked up. And that was the last point at which I experienced any emotion whatsoever, because this is a cold, clinical, impersonal depiction of someone who gives every indication of being a cold, clinical, impersonal person. I feel sure that this was Bigelow's intention, and she got the performance she wanted from Jessica Chastain, but this did not make this a film in which I had any emotional investment whatsoever. And I really should have had, you know, considering what the events spring from.It is also a very long film, a film from which at least half an hour could (and should) have been cut, possibly even as much as an hour - this could have been done without sacrificing any essential narrative information.The sound design is, at times, spectacularly good, at other times spectacularly fumbled, with garbled dialogue so that you don't know what's going on. The last half hour, the mission, is done well, and is very suspenseful even though you know what is going to happen.What of the torture? I didn't care. Any more than I did when two tears slid down Jessica Chastain's cheeks at the end. And that is Bigelow's failing here, because I should have cared.",7,2,8,1 February 2013
Steve Jobs," Engaging look at an interesting man
","Steve Jobs of Apple Computers has to deal with assorted individuals at 3 product launches: the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT in 1988, and the iMac in 1998.This film was not terribly high on my list of 'must-see's – I'm not a fan of biographies, and I'm not terribly interested in Jobs or Apple. I like most of the cast members (with reservations about Seth Rogen) and of what I've seen, I've liked more of writer Aaron Sorkin's and director Danny Boyle's work than not. It still wasn't high on my list.It is a terrific film. It is full of drama, all of which comes from the interplay between the characters. The characters themselves are all interesting and three-dimensional, with well-balanced virtues and character defects (not least Jobs himself, undoubtedly an enormously able man but, if this is to be believed, not naturally gifted in terms of interacting with those around him). It looks great and is full of the eye-catching, fluid direction which Boyle showed us in Trance. It is also very well-written: the dialogue is not dazzling, but it engages throughout. And the entire cast is first rate. Kate Winslet is coming in for plaudits but, for me, the revelation was Rogen, excelling on a non-comedic role.There is nothing pyrotechnic about this film, in any sense, but it is strong in every sense, constantly engaging, and entertaining for its entire length.",8,0,3,20 November 2015
War of the Worlds," Solid, with some exceptional moments
","Spielberg uproots HG Wells' story of a Martian invasion and transplants it from the 19th to the early 21st century. In doing this, he hooks it onto the back of a story about not-very-competent Dad Ray (Tom Cruise) trying to get his children, terrified Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and alienated (sorry!) Robbie (Justin Chatwin) across country to his ex-wife.This film is full of action - eye-popping, awesome action - but it never loses touch with the human story beneath, of Ray trying to do the best for his children in impossible circumstances and while doing so, gradually becoming a better father.Rooting the film in this way means that we care for the characters, which means that the death, destruction and devastation has that much more impact. There are several astonishing set pieces - the initial attack, the ferry, the basement sequence - but my preference was for what I thought of as the Spielberg touches: the bodies in the river, the clothes raining in the woods and, especially, the lengthy shot with a moving camera circling a speeding car as they flee the city.All the performances are good, with Dakota Fanning being exceptional.",8,1,2,18 March 2012
Hercules," One of the best
","An excellent entry in the Disney animated stakes.Hercules takes some liberties with the stories of myth, but all in a good cause - the tale constructed for the movie makes use of myth while telling its own tale.Gerald Scarfe's highly individual artistic vision, as filtered through classical Greek art and architecture, means that, while still recognisably Disney, the production design on this film means that it looks quite different to any other Disney movie - and this, I think, is a good thing.Hades is a great villain with a truly memorable vocal characterisation from James Woods.The song 'I won't say I'm in love' is one of the very best.Highly recommended.",9,2,4,30 March 2010
12 Years a Slave," Powerful, disturbing, and moving
","Solomon Northup, a respected free black musician and family man in 1841 New York, is kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana and the film, adapted from the book he produced afterwards, recounts his experiences during the 12 years until he regained his freedom.Although this film has elements which did not come from Northup's book, everything in it is true: slaves were treated like this. The vile physical abuse shown very graphically in this film was not perpetrated by every slave owner, but the fact remains that slaves were property with no rights, and things like the naked examinations before being sold, splitting up families and so on - not physical abuse, but abuse nonetheless - are simply part and parcel of what slavery is (I make this point as I have noted some people defensively commenting that the film perhaps overstates its case - well, it doesn't).Having established that the subject matter is factual, dramatic, emotionally involving, and powerful, how well does the film deal with conveying it to the audience? Pretty well, actually. Despite the fact that the content is very strong and, in some ways, borders on cliché, most of the key figures are well drawn and believable human beings, with some excellent performances - Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon holds the film together with a moving performance, but he is matched by Michael Fassbender as Epps (who, frighteningly, believes that what he is doing has God's approval) and Lupita Nyong'o as the unfortunate Patsey.This is strong stuff, but it engages the audience emotionally. And let us not forget that while slavery may have been abolished in the west, that doesn't mean that is not still practised elsewhere.",9,4,8,31 January 2014
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Predictable time spent with nice people
","There are no surprises in this teen romcom. Nearly all romcoms follow the formula of the two protagonists not realising that they are meant for each other until near the end, and this is no exception.However, it does have several things going for it. One is the unusual skeleton, which is to do with various musical matters - going to concerts, and trying to get to a secret concert (does New York really have live amplified rooftop concerts at 5am?). Another is Ari Graynor, who delivers one of the most delightful screen drunks I can recall. And the third is the screen personae of Michael Cera and Kat Dennings as Nick and Norah, who are eventually drawn together by shared musical tastes.Michael Cera is very good at projecting vulnerability, very nearly easing into 'loser' territory, but with too strong a sense of self worth for that to apply fully. Kat Dennings, with whom I am not familiar, plays well, but comes over as a little too adult given the school hall sequence early on (ditto Alexis Dziena, albeit not quite to the same extent).Notwithstanding how slight this film is, I enjoyed it a lot. There are a number of solid laughs (mostly courtesy of Ari Graynor's Caroline) and one gross-out moment - and it really is gross, people in the cinema were groaning! What I enjoyed rather less was the bitch sitting in front and to the left of me who kept switching her mobile phone on every five minutes - it was like having a torch shining in my eyes. So for anyone reading this who tends to do this in cinemas, please don't. It's very selfish.Sermon over.",8,2,3,4 February 2009
30 Days of Night," Vampire upgrade
","Of its type, this is a decent enough effort.It is atmospheric, with something of a tweak in respect of both location and the precise nature of the predatory vampires.It is graphically violent and exceptionally (and imaginatively) gory: this, I hope, serves as both a warning and a recommendation to those who value such qualities.The central performance by Josh Hartnett is very good. Not so good are Danny Huston as head vampire who goes through the whole movie with a dopey-looking open-mouthed expression (one accepts that the open-mouthed bit is a necessary by-product of having one's mouth stuffed with a gobful of fangs), and Melissa George whose character, on the strength of her constant fearful snivelling, must have been the crappest police officer ever.",7,0,1,7 March 2010
Sausage Party," A huge helping of WTF
","Frank (a sausage) and Betty (a bun) are looking forward to finally getting more than just tips together when they are purchased, and get to go to the Great Beyond. Yet there are rumours that the Great Beyond is a lie, and that horror and death await. And, worse, it turns out that the rumours are true!Sausage Party is a CGI movie which combines a story based on a pleasing and very silly 'what if?' ('what if your food was actually alive?') and Seth Rogen's crew of the usual suspects, both writers and performers. This means that is delivered with a healthy (or perhaps unhealthy) dose of pure filth - toilet humour, profanity, drugs and sex.Let's make no bones about it: much of what we see is infantile, and designed to shock and outrage, as anyone who was seen any of Rogen's work will already know. Having said that, it's pretty funny stuff, well animated and voiced, and a much needed antidote to the mostly squeaky-clean CGI features which come out from Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks et al.And it has a bit of substance, too. Lavash (Arabic unleavened bread) and Jewish Sammy the bagel are at odds, what with being stocked next to each other. When Lavash is confronted with the unpleasant truth that he will not be presented with unlimited virgin olive oil on arriving in the Great Beyond, why, the obvious solution is masses of joyous gay sex, isn't it? I'm not sure if this is the most profound commentary on the Middle East problem I've ever encountered, or the most ridiculous and depraved. It is possibly both. But it also shows that there is more to this silly, silly, crude, crass and very funny film than meets the eye.The film finishes with a comprehensive orgy with much imaginative comestible copulation, and a final metafictional resolution, and I walked out chuckling while wondering what the hell it was I had just seen.",8,1,1,26 December 2018
Wedding Crashers," First and best
","This fairly rude comedy features Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson as a couple of dissolute friends who spend every weekend gatecrashing wedding receptions and picking up bridesmaids for the purpose of lots of casual sex. And then they crash the wrong wedding...This is a great set-up. The chemistry between Vaughan and Wilson is good, and there is some terrific support (especially from Jane Seymour and Isla Fisher, who gives us a ghastly, quasi-psychotic, giggly girlie which is hysterical).This is also a great vehicle for the screen personae which Vaughan and Wilson have trotted out in pretty much every movie they have made since. Here, they are both fresh, and it works.There are a lot of laughs, a bit of depth, and a degree of satisfaction by the time you get to the end. A decent, if raunchy, comedy, and noticeably better than the majority of what these two actors have done since.",Null,0,0,9 August 2011
There Will Be Blood," Flawed
","Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, a turn of the century oilman, driven to succeed no matter what the cost.Let's take Day-Lewis' powerful performance as a given, even if it is a very close relative of his Butcher Bill from Gangs Of New York (a much better film, by the way).There is an interesting story to be told here, but There Will Be Blood isn't it. The movie rambles, and the story is told very slowly with many asides which appear hardly relevant - it seems early on as if there is going to be a strong oil vs. evangelism plot thread, for instance, but this more or less disappears.In the end the movie ends up a portrait of a man whose motivations and actions are driven, antisocial, sometimes incomprehensible, and almost always unpleasant. Day-Lewis is always magnetic to watch, but the movie didn't have enough to engage me without something else to offer beside his performance.Many of the music cues appear intended to alienate to such an extent that it is difficult to imagine in what way they are intended to complement the narrative.",7,1,3,7 August 2010
Burlesque," Tolerable showbiz hokum
","Small town girl Christina Aguilera goes to the big city where she ends up waitressing at Cher's Burlesque club. Various sub-plots ensue: Aguilera gets a chance to go on stage and dance, and then sing; a vindictive rival is beset with jealousy at her sudden success; Cher is faced with financial difficulties and has to find a way not to lose the club; romantic issues arise; other bits and pieces.My expectation was that this was going to be trashy (and, in truth, it features its fair share of cliché situations and stock characters), and I don't care for Aguilera's over-ornamented style of singing.So I was most surprised to discover that I enjoyed this enormously. As a first starring vehicle for Aguilera it must be marked a success: her particular brand of girl next door wholesomeness, cross-pollinated with sexual trashiness, translates well to the screen, and she sure has got a powerful set of pipes, which is undoubtedly due to her big lungs. The musical numbers show some variety and are all entertaining (though no wonder the club is having financial difficulty given the amount it must be spending on staging its shows) The biggest problem is that there is no real jeopardy here - everybody is actually quite nice, and all problems get resolved with the minimum of trouble, so the level of dramatic tension is never very high. Although, in some ways, it's quite nice to have a movie where you like the characters and the things which happen to them are sometimes a bit worrying but never really horrible.And there is a lovely relationship between Cher's and Stanley Tucci's characters.",8,2,2,23 December 2010
To Kill a Mockingbird," Superb adaptation of a superb book
","Harper Lee's Pulitzer prizewinner is a terrific book (he observed, somewhat unnecessarily) - it tells the story of 1930s liberal Southern lawyer Atticus Finch's defence of a black man accused of raping a white woman, as seen through the eyes of his young daughter Scout.Robert Mulligan's 1962 film adapts the story well, preserving the dramatic beats of the story, conveying a strong sense of time and place, conveying much of the childlike point of view of the novel, and doing so by way of some superb performances.Gregory Peck's Atticus is at the heart and, to me, Peck embodies all the qualities of Lee's character - thoughtful, intelligent, dignified, brave, and always very human. We never forget that he is not simply a lawyer, he is also a father.But all the other players are excellent, too, so much so that it is hardly fair to single out specific performers for mention. But the children are charming and natural, and the film sees an early appearance from Robert Duvall as the mysterious and scary Boo Radley.This excellent film is as good now as it was 40 years ago, and I recommend it heartily.",10,2,4,13 May 2010
A Hard Day's Night," One of the very best
","From the opening, with that iconic chord, to the very end, A Hard Day's Night is a celebration of The Beatles hitting their stride.The episodic non-story tells of a day in their hectic life, being shunted from pillar to post as they travel to do a TV show, Ringo goes missing between rehearsal and performance, and then they leave for the next engagement. In between this (which, allowing for artistic licence, was probably not an unfair representation of the unrelenting pace of their lives throughout 1963 and 1964), there are opportunities for each of them to have a little bit of their own and, fortunately, some songs.Filmed documentary style in black and white by American Dick Lester, this is the film which took him up into another league. He was helped immeasurably by a strong script from Liverpudlian Alun Owen which captured the essence of the public face of The Beatles, and a strong supporting cast. The Beatles themselves, of course, were at the heart of the film's success: despite the fact that they weren't always able to hide their inexperience as actors, their sheer force of personality carried the day. And, of course, the film's small collection of classic songs helped a bit...",10,2,2,4 April 2012
Man on Fire," Hard but excellent
","This is a startlingly good revenge movie.Washington's burnt-out bodyguard is given plenty of time to establish where he is starting from as Dakota Fanning's Pita, his young charge, begins to work some healing magic on him. The fact that this relationship takes nearly the first half of the film to build, and doesn't simply happen, makes it the more realistic. Therefore, when the inevitable kidnapping takes place and the ransom delivery is bungled with horrible consequences, Washington's icy and implacable (and almost stately) march of revenge is completely understandable - this is personal.All the cast are quite excellent, but it's good to see a streak of mercilessness cutting through Washington's normal civilised facade.I had it in mind that a particular individual was involved from fairly early on, and wasn't too surprised when it came out. And I had a horrible feeling that Hollywood was going to do its usual copping out towards the end which, sure as shooting, it did. The ending was good, but the alternate on the DVD was better.Highly recommended although beware the violence factor.",9,0,0,11 January 2009
Edge of Tomorrow," Big loud fun
","It is the near future, and an alien invasion is close to achieving world domination. Cage is a US Major in Public Relations, happy that this keeps him far from the front and actual danger. He is deeply upset to be railroaded into combat, particularly as this gets him killed. Before dying, however, he has been infected with the blood of a rare alien Alpha, which has the effect of resetting time whenever he dies: he starts to live the same day again. This may even lead to a plan to beat the aliens.I'm sure others have said this, but this movie is essentially Groundhog Day meets Saving Private Ryan, only with the doodads from The Matrix instead of Nazis. Which doesn't make it bad. There is considerable entertainment to be had from seeing Cage (Tom Cruise) trying to worm his way out of being sent into combat, his sheer funk on his way in, and the repetition of his deaths, some of which are very funny. The special effects are astonishing, and the film is entertaining throughout.If I was to be critical of it, I would say that it is a big flashy movie of little consequence other than immediate entertainment value, but that could as easily be an endorsement as a criticism. It is one of those films which, when it pops up on TV, you'll almost certainly sit down and watch it. Get out the popcorn and enjoy!",8,2,7,5 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," More of the same - which is not a bad thing
","The film starts with the Bardon Bellas at the top of their game until a wardrobe malfunction in front of the President makes them underdogs once more: their only chance of redemption is the World Acapella Championships, in which they will face uber-foes, the massively efficient Das Sound Machine. But Beca has other things on her mind...If you saw Pitch Perfect – and you probably did if you're going to see this one – then you won't get many surprises. But you will get a similar amount of enjoyment, because this film doesn't try to do anything other than give you more of what worked the first time. Rebel Wilson's role is expanded, some of the Bellas are almost invisible, and Hailee Steinfeld gets to play the closest thing to an actual character.And the musical numbers are all good fun, too. Music is a funny thing: it can deliver up moments which grip you by the throat and bring tears to your eyes. The last time I remember that happening was when Bruce Robinson appears on stage at the festival in Still Crazy, and there is a similar moment here, which I absolutely loved.Incidentally film-makers, please learn about female anatomy: the TV announcers comment about what was visible referred to the internal bit, not the external bit.",8,14,25,22 May 2015
Whiplash," Good, but not the easiest film
","Andrew is a talented young jazz drummer at a prestigious musical school who is under the tutelage of Terence Fletcher, a band teacher who gets results by humiliation and bullying. This is a method which results in prices to be paid.This film, which never goes quite where you expect it to, features strong performances from Miles Teller as Andrew and JK Simmons as Fletcher. Fletcher is undoubtedly a monster, but the script and Simmons are canny enough to give him some rounded corners so that he is also human. And Teller gives a very physical performance which is not without some subtlety. The musical sequences are well done, especially the final one.It's not the easiest of films to like - Andrew and Fletcher are not particularly likable characters - but it's powerful stuff, and opens a window into what happens when two driven people come up against each other.Well worth watching.",8,1,3,24 January 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," Good, but morally queasy
","Jordan Belfort can do two things extremely well: sell, and teach others to sell. Setting up his own stock brokerage, he proceeds to make vast amounts of money, which he then takes immense pleasure in spending on property, cars, trophy wife, sex and drugs. Lots of drugs. However, the facts that he is not concerned about the morality or legality of how he makes his money attracts the attention of the FBI. First of all, this is a film not to see if you object to nudity, sex, drug use or bad language on screen, because there is a great deal of all these things in this film. Seriously, if this stuff upsets you, stay away.Martin Scorsese's film, fictionalised from Belfort's book, makes no moral judgment as to Belfort's activities: indeed, it goes out of its way to make him (as portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) engaging and likable. Indeed, given that much of the activity here is either callously disregarding of others (much of the money made is at the expense of unseen people who can ill afford it), or dissolute hedonism, it is surprising that the film is often very, very funny (there is a particularly funny sequence showing that DiCaprio has a previously unsuspected gift for physical comedy). The last half hour or so becomes more serious.There are some terrific performances here, and Scorsese's direction is stunning. At 3 hours it is overlong, and there are two sequences where Belfort delivers speeches to his assembled sales team which outstay their welcome, not to mention the fishbowl scene which has little point. But I remained interested and entertained throughout the film's length, notwithstanding some grave reservations about the lessons being illustrated.",8,5,8,24 January 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Disturbing but excellent
","By using a fictionalised framework of an invented Scottish doctor (though one based on a real person) as the everyman who becomes witness to Idi Amin, first as a benevolent despot and then, ultimately, as the savage madman he really was, this film actually contains great truths within its fiction. It is never easy watching, and often profoundly disturbing as you (and James McAvoy's Dr Garrigan) begin to understand the level of unpredictable inhumanity present in Forest Whitaker's Amin.Everyone in this film is good, but McAvoy is excellent and Whitaker is outstanding - if you can bear to watch the vileness this man was responsible for, you will also see one of the greatest screen performances ever.And you can take some comfort from the fact that it is just a performance - you are not watching the real Amin or his atrocities which were on a vaster scale than portrayed in the film.",9,0,1,26 March 2011
Bram Stoker's Dracula," An interesting take
","Dracula is a bit like Batman - the original creation has been filtered through so many different creative viewpoints over the years that it must now be accepted that the character is capable of multiple interpretations. Francis Ford Coppola chose to interpret Dracula, not as a murderous bloodstained monster, but as a tragic romantic hero. Personally, I have a bit of trouble with that particular take on Dracula, but I don't have any problem with accepting it as a valid creative option.Coppola's film is lushly gorgeous - sensual, sexual, with rich colours hidden in the looming shadows, and oily, serpentine, unnatural movements all adding to a sense of unease. Winona Rider does quite well as Mina - here portrayed as a virtual reincarnation of Dracula's tragic lost wife - and the cast of helpers are all quite good: even Keanu Reeves customary stoic (read 'woodon') persona quite suits Jonathan Harker. Hopkins has great fun chewing some scenery, not too excessively, and Gary Oldman gets deep inside a very mannered portrayal of Dracula. Perhaps too mannered, some might say, but there is no question as to the quality of the performance.All things considered, though, Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula isn't my Dracula at all.",7,9,13,22 November 2012
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Good, but not as good...
","New York cop John McClane, going about his business in New York, finds himself beset by terrorists. Even worse, their leader is the brother of the LA terrorist boss from 2 films ago. Fortunately, McClane has a very angry black man to help him.This 3rd film in the series abandons the family element which helped to drive the first two films, replaced by Sam Jackson's furious Harlem native, and is the worse for it. Jeremy Irons has fun as Alan Rickman's sibling, and Bruce Willis gets his vest dirty again as the Law of Diminishing Returns begins to set in.Die Hard 3, as this should have been called, is perfectly enjoyable, but it is not in the same class as the first two in the series.",7,0,3,16 November 2013
Con Air," An action-packed hoot
","Time was I didn't care for Nic Cage, and Con Air was the movie which changed my mind. His Cameron Poe is a relatively by-the-book action hero, a not-so-ordinary ordinary man, put in a situation of extreme prejudice by circumstances beyond his control, and doing the right thing at great personal risk when he has no need to so because that's just the sort of guy he is.This movie is packed with action from start to finish, it has a whole bunch of memorable characters, and a script which is littered with memorable and amusing lines.It is fair to say that it is improbable from start to finish, yet it always manages to stay on the credible side of the line beyond which suspension of disbelief is impossible.And there is a quality to be found in some movies which I espouse frequently (often in the context of those movies where it is not to be found) - fun. Con Air is a fun-filled romp from start to finish, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who hasn't already seen it.",8,1,1,3 July 2010
August Rush," Sentimental but effective
","Cellist Lyla (Keri Russell) and rock musician Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyer) have a one night stand and the child which results is handed over for adoption by Lyla's father. 12 years later, after he dies, Lyla goes looking for her son just as he - now going under the name of August Rush, having fallen in with Fagin-like small-time music hustler Wizard (Robin Williams, playing against type) - is starting to follow his musical muse.This movie is not at all realistic - I liked Freddie Highmore's performance as August, looking for his parents as much as they are looking for him - but he didn't convince me of his precocious musical talent for an instant. Nevertheless, the film is good-hearted, heartwarming, downright sentimental, and quite nicely done. The musical sequences don't convince even slightly, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.",7,0,0,22 December 2012
It Chapter Two," Good but long
","6 of the 7 members of the Losers Club which defeated It have left Derry and, in the course of 27, have found success but forgotten their childhood trauma. Mike Hanlon remained behind however, and when the child murders start up again, he contacts his old friends to remind them of the blood vow they made when they were kids.Part 1, which told the story of the kids getting together and defeating It (as manifested in the form of creepy Pennywise the clown) was very successful, Chapter 2 completes the story. The climax takes some liberties with the book. To be frank, I found the climax of the book to be somewhat lacking, and the film recognises this criticism and has some fun with hit with, one assumes, Stephen King's approval, given that he cameos in the film.That's about it, really. The cast are moderate adult representations of their younger incarnations (Bill Hader is wonderful as Richie Tozier), there is a surprising amount of humour, the kids also appear (digitally de-aged) and the film incarnation of monster-It as appreciably better than the book or TV miniseries version.Watching both movies will consume 5 hours of your life, so plan carefully.",7,2,2,22 September 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Satisfying
","In 1946, newly successful author Juliet follows up correspondence to investigate the curiously named Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, created during the German occupation of the Channel Islands. But behind the story of the Society lies another story...Lily James plays Juliet in this gentle but thoughtful period drama. A well-rounded cast all play well, with Penelope Wilton excelling as a woman overflowing with a variety of hurts.I don't want to say more: rather I would encourage people to see a film which kept me wondering about the answers to questions raised as the film went on.It is beautifully filmed in locations which one would like to think are authentic, even though they are not.",8,5,8,5 May 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not without merit, but doesn't really work
","Eddie Mannix, head of a 1950s Hollywood studio, faces multiple problems – overwork, a female star with relationship and pregnancy issues, gossip columnists, communism, oh, and his big star being kidnapped in the middle of filming a biblical epic.The Coen brothers write and direct this satirical comedy with a great cast, and masses of care given to historical detail. And, as is often the case with the Coens, I end up with a bad case of mixed feelings. My usual problem – the feeling that they are sitting in the row behind me, sniggering at in-jokes which I don't get – isn't the main problem here. The problem is that the disparate elements which go into making up this film – satire, knockabout comedy, affectionate tribute, multiple plot threads – are fairly successful individually, but never seem to knit together into a coherent whole. That's not to say that there isn't enjoyment here – the barely concealed homoeroticism in Channing Tatum's sailor dance number is a hoot, as is George Clooney's befuddled star – but none of the threads has a lot of point individually, Mannix' personal thread is tonally at odds with the other studio-based material, the communist writers' mix of commentary and comedy doesn't really work, and so on.More than anything else, this film made me think of being served up with a plate containing muesli, curry, French fries, and pineapple ice cream – all things I love to eat, but they don't really work together to make a satisfying meal. Hail, Caesar! Is an ambitious attempt to squidge together a number of elements which don't really work when squidged together.",7,3,4,11 March 2016
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Going through the motions, but still exciting and visually dazzling
","The fourth Ice Age movie has two elements to it: the main one is that, following earthquake upheavals as continents divide, Manny, Diego and Sid get washed away on an iceberg and have to get back to family and friends despite falling foul of pirate ape Captain Gutt and his crew. The secondary plot involves Manny and Ellie's teenage daughter falling prey to peer pressure and having difficulty in being the person she really is, rather than the person she thinks others want her to be. I say 'person': she's a mammoth, of course.The action in this movie starts at frame one and never stops - it is wonderfully animated, visually dazzling (although the 3D is not as effective as it could be), often very funny, and a good, solid, family movie which will keep everybody interested throughout its length.I wonder if it is just me, though, but I feel there is something missing - this happened with the Shrek films, too. The cleverness is still there, all the ingredients are present, but there is a feel of going through the motions rather than revelling in the delight of creating something new and original.",7,0,2,20 July 2012
Stranger Than Fiction," Didn't quite do it for me
","First of all, I'm delighted that a film like this got made at all. It doesn't comfortably sit in any mainstream genre - it's downright quirky, and you don't often see the cash forthcoming for a movie without a defined audience. I liked this story.Second, I'm beginning to think that Will Ferrell is an actor with an astonishing range. I've tended not to like much of what he's done in the past, but I'm coming to understand that this is because I have intensely disliked the characters he's played, and he's played them very well. His character here is much more sympathetic and has an interesting development curve: starting as a cypher (as his written character is, of course, at the start) he fleshes out nicely throughout the film. There is scope for a great deal of subtlety in his performance, and Ferrell delivers.Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an attractive performance in a slightly underwritten role, and Dustin Hoffman delivers an OK performance in a very underwritten role. Queen Latifah does well in a role which is hardly there at all.I don't know if Emma Thompson's performance was what was written, what the director specified, or what she judged was needed - it may be exactly what was intended but, if so, what was intended (and whoever intended it), it was awful. Twitchy, neurotic, depressed - not a character it was easy to feel any sympathy with. And I didn't.My main problem is that I never fully engaged with the story because I never really felt that it did as much with the concept as I wanted it to. From the charming quirky start, by the final act I felt it had moved into the mainstream and become not so much predictable as conventional. The originality of plot and delivery at the start wasn't sustained through the film's full length.For all that, I spent most of the running time with a smile on my face, and for all the right reasons.",7,2,4,24 August 2007
The Green Mile," Wonderful
","I remember reading King's novel when it came out in monthly parts, piecework style. It worked well like that.But it works equally well when taken as a whole, and Frank Darabont's adaptation gives no idea of the fragmented nature of the source material.Two things come across when revisiting the movie. One is the strength of the ensemble cast - this is a big cast, of performers who are either well established names, or who have made their names since (and perhaps because of) this film. Every part is well cast, and brilliantly performed. I sometimes think you can tell how good a cast is by reference to how much you loathe the baddies, and Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell deliver in spades. But every part - down to Bonnie Hunt, Gary Sinise, and King/Darabont regular William Sadler - is simply excellent.The second thing which comes across is how well constructed the story is. Every single element o the story is essential to it working properly, and the separate parts fit together like a precision watch.Wonderful stuff.",10,1,2,29 November 2009
The Reader," Always interested, never entertained, impressed by acting
","In 1958 Germany, 35 year old tram conductor Hannah embarks on an affair with 15 year old Michael. Before each session of sex, she makes him read to her. The affair lasts all summer but, when offered promotion to an office job, Hannah quits and moves on. Eight years later, law student Michael attends the trial of Hannah and six other women as war criminals - between them they allowed prisoners to be burnt to death. When asked for a sample of her handwriting to prove that she didn't write the report into what happened, Hannah confesses that she did write it, and is sentenced to life imprisonment as opposed to the 4 years the other defendants get: at this point Michael realises that Hannah is illiterate and therefore innocent of the greater crime. He respects her decision and keeps the truth to himself. Years later he finds the books he had read to her, and begins to read them again onto tape, which he sends to her in prison. Hannah, touched by this gesture, takes one of the books from the prison library and by matching the number of spoken words with words on the page, starts to teach herself how to read and write, writing short simple letters to Michael. As her sentence comes to an end, Michael is prevailed upon to help her with accommodation and work, but Hannah takes her own life before she is released. Michael finally takes his daughter to visit Hannah's grave and begins to tell her of the relationship he has kept secret all his life.This film is an acting masterclass. Kate Winslet is utterly magnetic whenever she is on screen, delivering a Hannah who is complex and simple, compassionate and cruel, full of contradictions and, quite clearly, someone who is faulty in some fundamental way. Fiennes' adult Michael is equally good despite less screen time, though perhaps somewhat lower key (not that any of the performances are particularly flamboyant). And 18 year old David Kross as young Michael is the glue holding the first half of the film together in a performance of remarkable maturity.The main problem with this film is that while it might be a masterclass in acting, it is never that engaging. Young Michael engages our sympathies, but his experiences with Hannah - particularly the court case and its immediate aftermath - damage him, and the film never fully recovers from the remoteness which then envelops the only really sympathetic character. The only sequence which moved me to tears was when Hannah teaches herself to read and writes her first halting letter to Michael.This film is well worth seeing, but I'm not sure I shall want to see it again soon. I can imagine it being Oscar-nominated - it is very worthy - but I'm not sure it is particularly entertaining.And I was greatly saddened to note the much-missed Anthony Minghella (with whom I appeared in a school play back in 1970) on the credits, producing with Sydney Pollack, equally missed.",7,1,2,15 January 2009
Jaws," Brilliant
","Peter Benchley wrote a thriller about an almost supernaturally cunning great white shark which haunted the beaches of a holiday resort. It was an enjoyable book, but not exceptional. But it was definitely cinematic enough for Universal to acquire the film rights, although it was sufficiently low priority that they allocated a director who had only previously directed one cinema feature (albeit a moderate amount of TV).OK, so the director was Steven Spielberg, and everyone has to start somewhere, right? Together with screenwriter Carl Gottlieb (whose contribution shouldn't be overlooked), the soapy aspects of the novel were discarded and the story streamlined to concentrate on the shark and its effects on the community it was stalking. The movie brilliantly intertwines shark action with the interplay between the 3 primary characters, Police Chief Brodie (Roy Scheider), shark specialist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and professional fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw). All three performances are top notch.But the film also contains a huge number of 'moments' - the first shocking attack, the jetty, the beach attack, the nocturnal underwater search (and its brilliantly choreographed shock moment - I recall seeing daylight between bums and seats in the packed cinema when the movie first came out), the fingernail screech... the list goes on and on. Jaws demonstrated that Spielberg's gift lay in orchestrating audience reactions, something he is arguably as good at as Hitchcock was.And let us not forget the impact of one of John William's most effective scores.Bruce, the mechanical shark, isn't always convincing, but that matters little. Even now, all these years later, Jaws still has the power to thrill, shock, and - above all - entertain.",10,3,7,29 June 2010
The Wrestler," OK, but is Mickey Rourke enough?
","Mickey Rourke is an actor with an interesting profile in that he started out as a golden boy, then went into a spiral of extreme self destruction, but came out of it without actually destroying himself, to be reinvented as a rather better actor than he was in the first place. The only trouble is that the self destructive phase has left him with facial problems - structure and mobility. This didn't matter too much in Sin City, where prosthetics concealed the structural issues and, in The Wrestler, it can be taken to indicate the damage this man has had inflicted on him on the course of a long - too long - wrestling career. The lack of mobility is something of a problem, and means that Rourke's performance necessarily comes from his eyes, voice and body language.It is a very good performance, and merits the praise it has garnered. Marisa Tomei is also excellent in a courageous performance as a faded stripper - she still looks good, but for how much longer? I was, perhaps, more concerned about the story. I am a fairly shallow person, and I wasn't looking for subtext, so I saw this as a relatively simple tragedy. Randy's career, such as it is, is cut short by a heart attack so he determinedly changes track, proving to have an aptitude for a job he previously wouldn't have considered, rebuilding bridges in the damaged relationship with his daughter, and working towards a relationship with Tomei's stripper Cassidy. It is Cassidy's hasty and ill-considered rejection which leads to him missing dinner with his daughter through being drunk, which finally destroys any chance at reconciliation, as a result of which he goes back into the ring with inevitable results. It is a small, unhappy story which celebrates nothing, which is why I find it difficult to celebrate this film despite its undoubted merits.A couple of other things I didn't like much: Rourke is the noisiest breather in the history of movies, and there was too much - far too much - of hand-held cameras following people around (Rourke leads us on a complete tour of the supermarket building where he works at one point).I'm glad I saw it, I'm not keen to watch it again.",7,0,0,4 February 2009
Dark Shadows," Entertaining but typically odd
","House Of Dark Shadows never made it across the Atlantic, so my view of Tim Burton's Dark Shadows, a reimagining of the long running US Gothic vampire-based soap opera of the 70s is, of necessity, limited to the movie itself, and doesn't invite a comparison.Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins, condemned to vampirehood by jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green), losing his love Josette (Bella Heathcote), and turning up in the 1970s to reclaim his place in the Collins household and business, currently under the aegis of descendant Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her family. Angelique is still alive and well, however, and just as malevolent as ever.There are two main elements here. One is the power struggle and love tussle between Barnabas and Angelique, and the other is Barnabas' efforts to adjust himself to the 1970s after 200 years in a coffin. The former is a fairly serious affair: Angelique cold-bloodedly plays for keeps with silken malice (Eva Green always exudes an air of dangerousness, which serves her very well in this case), and Barnabas needs to kill people to live and is thus not an entirely sympathetic protagonist. The latter, however, is played very successfully for laughs. The question is how well do they fit together, and the answer is surprisingly well, actually. One might expect them to jar against each other, but they don't.The performances are all good (Green is outstanding), with Depp, looking like DC Comics' character Klarion the Witch Boy (bum bum bum!), and spouting florid 19th century prolixity in a clipped English accent having great fun with a character which is only slightly less flamboyant (in a restrained way) than Jack Sparrow. Production design is, not unexpectedly, excellent although, as is commonly the case with Burton, one feels that style may have taken precedence over substance (Josette's story is overlooked for most of the movie, the startling development with teenager Carolyn (Chloe Moretz) springs out of nowhere and goes nowhere, the deus ex machina deriving from David is, again, left underexplained and, worst of all, there is an entirely unnecessary diversion involving Helena Bonfire Carter - Burton just had to shoehorn his missus in somewhere (again) despite the fact that her inclusion doesn't move the story forward one inch).So this is quite enjoyable, but not without its flaws.",8,2,9,18 May 2012
Hancock," If I was allowed to shout I would shout 'Avoid Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!'
","Let me start by saying two things. Number one - go and see this movie! Number two - steer clear of spoilers.I like Will Smith well enough, but I've never yet been to see a movie simply because he's in it. But I like superhero movies well enough, and that was sufficient to get me into a cinema with a good-sized audience of mostly young people.For the benefit of those who haven't caught a trailer, Will Smith is Hancock, a super-powered drunk. He does good deeds in a messy way and is generally frowned upon by society as a result. He saves the life of a PR consultant who determines to rehabilitate him. Not the easiest project in town, as first of all, Hancock has to want to be rehabilitated....The trailers are fun and, as expected, there are laughs to be had. Most of these derive from Hancock's curmudgeonly character and couldn't-give-a-stuff way of doing things. But most of the stuff in the trailers feature in the first half hour or so. The film then takes a turn in an unpredictable direction - not featured in the trailers at all, and certainly not spoilered here - and becomes rather darker before heading for a satisfying but unexpected ending.The superhero stuff in Hancock is excellent - a totally convincing depiction of superpowered activity in the real world. Hancock works as a superhero movie. It also has its share of laughs, although it isn't a comedy - far from it. Instead, it's a film about people - Ray (Jason Bateman), a decent man who simply wants to turn Hancock from a perceived liability into an asset, his wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who is deeply concerned about the impact this graceless drunk with godlike powers is having on their life, and Hancock himself. Smith's portrayal is not unlike his morose detective in I, Robot, but sunk even further into depression and unhappiness for reasons which become clear.I loved this film.",10,1,5,2 July 2008
12 Strong," Action with questions
","A group of 12 US soldiers is sent to Afghanistan to help an Afghan warlord strike a decisive blow against the Taliban.This true but previously classified tale of US seeking to weaken Al Quaeda's power base after 9/11 has Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon as the senior members of the squad (Michael Pena is the only other member I have ever seen) and the excellent Navid Negahban as General Dostum.The two main elements of the movie are the uneasy development of the relationship between Hemsworth's character and the general (we are told that Dostum is now Vice-President and that the friendship between the two men has continued) and action.I'm in two minds about the action. It is well staged and exciting, but I sometimes felt I was watching a western from the 40s or 50s when the 7th Cavalry storms an Indian village and wipes out every one of those pesky redskin varmints. The ease with which hundreds of anonymous Taliban black-clad spear-carriers are mown down by the goodies pays little heed to the fact that, irrespective of how abhorrent you find their beliefs and activities, these were human beings, many of them possibly pressganged into service against their will.I was entertained, but felt uneasy about it.",7,1,4,1 May 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Jackson delivers industrial quantities of Hobbit
","After Smaug the dragon goes mental, assorted groups of orcs, elves, men, dwarfs and a hobbit battle endlessly with each other for reasons which are far from obvious.With the shortest film in the set, Peter Jackson's lengthy love affair with Middle earth draws to a close, so how do I feel about it? I feel pretty much as I did about The Hobbit parts 1 and 2, actually: whereas The Lord Of The Rings married epic with intimate in both the books and, fittingly, the film adaptations, the relatively small story of The Hobbit, feels bloated by the gargantuan epic Jackson has made of it. I enjoyed it, but I looked at my watch, often, during the extensive battle sequences which fill the bulk of the latter part of this movie. As Jackson's King Kong demonstrated, he isn't always able to tell that More does not necessarily equal Better. This trilogy has been crafted with care and skill and with a complete inability to apply the editor's red pencil when necessary. The story, such as it is, takes a remote second place to the eye candy on offer.Which is not to say that it doesn't have its moments - it does. The opening sequence of Smaug exacting revenge is quite wonderful, there are highlights among the action, the individual performances from Freeman, McKellen, Pace and some of the others are excellent, and the closing sequence in the Shire is quite good fun, especially the reappearance of familiar LotR music cues.But against that, we have CGI which is sometimes shockingly unconvincing (Smaug is magnificent, whereas the ballista trolls and Thranduil's elk and Billy Connolly's mount, for instance, aren't), a mixed-race romance which seems entirely out of place, an orc villain who doesn't seem important enough for the emphasis he is given, a batch of featured dwarfs who continue to be indistinguishable and unmemorable (apart from the Irish one, the Scottish one and the handsome one) and, worst of all, an omnipresent and hideously unfunny 'comic relief' slimebag who never gets the comeuppance he has been asking for throughout the movie.I also fear that future generations, watching these three overblown films as a lead in to Lord Of The Rings, simply won't bother with the (chronologically) second, and far superior, trilogy.I quite enjoyed it, and I shall no doubt watch it again, more than once, but I shall do so without the passion with which I still watch the LotR films because, if I am honest, these films have been something of a disappointment.",7,14,27,15 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Better...
","This is the one where all the bits in episodes 1 and 2 were attached to the plot threads which were in place as episode 4 opened so dynamically.Doing this obviously caused some problems in that the 4/5/6 plot threads weren't always that coherent to start off with, and episodes 1/2 were fairly ineptly plotted also.By far the weakest part of this aspect of the movie is Annakin's, frankly, stupid move to the dark side (notwithstanding Palpatine's manipulation, Annakin must be dim on a cosmic level to stoop to murdering the Padawans because of a bad dream), and the unbelievable death of Padme because she can't be bothered to live any more. Oh please.Conversely, the Annakin/Obi-Wan duel is great, the final battle is fairly good, and the closing touches of the things we'll see in episode 4 is pleasing (though, only for oldies).And when Palpatine launches himself over the desk at Mace Windu, it was the only time in all the films that I found myself thinking 'Wow! This guy really wants Windu dead!'",8,7,11,14 February 2011
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," So how does it stand up?
","The Wicked Queen arranges for Snow White to be killed, but she finds sanctuary with 7 dwarfs.Made 80 years ago, how does Disney's trailblazing animated feature hold up, he asked, having just watched it through in its entirety for the first time - I can't imagine how I haven't seen it in full at some point during the last half century or more. But now I have.The story is familiar - this is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Grimm Brothers' original, albeit nicely tweaked to point up (for instance) the humorous role of the dwarfs and, frankly, to pad it - there are a number of sequences which are very entertaining but not very plot relevant. The drama works well, the character design is excellent, the animation is very good (and the effects animation is stunning), several of the songs are classics (and several aren't), and there are places where it is genuinely scary, especially for small children.It's not perfect. Current audiences might find stylistic elements somewhat dated, and Adriana Caselotti as Snow White is rather irritatingly twittery.But on the whole, it fully justifies its classic status.",7,4,7,3 April 2016
Shooter," Much better than expected
","Shooter is one of those rare joys where a film which, on the face of it, offers an average package of enjoyment, turns out to deliver much more.It is an action/conspiracy thriller where protagonist Wahlberg's master sniper is manoeuvred into position as a patsy for an assassination within a conspiracy where all loose ends end up dead. The tension in the film is created by uncertainty as to whether Wahlberg's resourcefulness will be sufficient to protect him against the sheer power of the forces ranged against him, both political and physical.The film is intelligently plotted and steers clear of many of the glib shortcuts commonly encountered in such movies. For instance, Wahlberg is shot early on and, rather than soldier on manfully clutching his wound, he actually has to address the fact that the wound is sufficiently debilitating that it will kill him unless it is properly dealt with.The action sequences are well realised, there is some interesting gun stuff if that's your thing, and the performances are all good. Wahlberg delivers on the action, although his performance is not particularly nuanced, and I was never convinced that the incisive intelligence of this well-trained survivor resided within the same body as the action man hero. Danny Glover's voice seems to have developed a speech problem of some kind.I enjoyed this movie a great deal more than I expected to.",9,1,2,2 June 2009
The Lion King," Not quite there for me
","The Lion King is unquestionably a first rate animated film - my daughter counts it as one of her favourite films of all time (and pinched my copy of the DVD when she left home!). But something about it doesn't quite work for me.The story is excellent, and I love the way that Simba's story is effortlessly tied in to the (non-preachy) circle of life broader picture.The voice talent is all excellent, character design and animation first class, the emotional high (and low) points are all reached as planned.Maybe it's the songs. I like Hans Zimmer's score, but I must confess to not liking all of Elton John's songs (particularly The Circle Of Life itself).And maybe it's just because I am becoming a grumpy old curmudgeon. Because, without any doubt, it is an absolute classic children's film.Edited 10 October 2011 after seeing 3D version at the cinema.Am I correct that this reworking is the first full-length 3D film using traditional drawn animation? Whether it is or not, it is a terrific conversion: it adds an element of visual majesty to a film which is already very good.",8,5,9,10 March 2011
Inception," SciFi blockbuster with brains
","Way back in the 60s there was a sci-fi movie called The Fantastic Voyage where a disparate group went on an expedition through highly unlikely locations. I was reminded of that film as I watched Inception - there is some similarity in the general idea, but that's where it ends.The basic scenario is straightforward enough - Dom Cobb, who specialises in stealing secrets from dreams - a specialised form of industrial espionage - is tasked with the much more difficult job of seeding an idea into a dream, for which he has to assemble a team of specialists. However, there is a spanner in the works from the start, because Cobb isn't being 100% truthful. And there is no point in my trying to synopsise beyond this point, because things get very complex very quickly.Everything about this film works, starting with the idea. The story is good - challenging, but solid. The script is very good. It isn't brimming over with one liners, and it's not laden with poetic imagery, but it there are many thought-provoking ideas delivered in single short pieces of dialogue. And yet, for a story which is, above everything, thought provoking, the film is also full of action and incident. It is visually striking, although the visual effects are all rooted in reality and are in service to the story.And the cast are excellent. I always thought DiCaprio was a good actor, albeit one who was somewhat hamstrung by his youthful appearance. As he gets older and the babyface roundness acquires some craggy corners, he continues to impress, as does Ellen Page.But above everything, this is Chris Nolan's movie. As writer and director he would only have had himself to blame had Inception fallen flat on its face, showing that the Batman Begins/Dark Knight double was down to the character, not him. But he succeeds here while wearing both hats. It won't be to everyone's taste, but it was certainly to mine. It's not often a movie gives you blockbuster sci-fi eye candy but also has you walking out afterwards pondering where reality ends and imagination begins, the nature of subjective time, responsibilities to yourself and to teammates etc.",9,1,7,18 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Overly expository
","Legendary Belgian detective moustache Hercule Poirot is taking a brief leisure trip on the Orient Express when - wouldn't you know it! - the train is stranded by avalanche, one of the pencil moustaches on board is murdered, and Poirot is faced with a train full of deeply suspicious and hugely famous suspects (except some who aren't quite so famous).Knight of the realm Kenneth Branagh directs and wears Poirot's vast and enormously distracting moustache with its inconsistent grey streaks in this second pass at Agatha Christie's classic whodunit.It's nicely staged, with a quantity of not entirely convincing CGI showing us the train amid attractive Alpine scenery. Another theatrical knight and a Dame join some high profile Americans, Rey from the new Star Wars and the idiot snowman from Frozen. All of them have fun especially offscreen - chatshows make it clear the rapport between them.I suspect they have more fun than the audience. After a while I started to lose interest in the wealth of detail about the interest in, and connections to, a crime which was not the one being investigated. I was force fed a vast amount of information, not all of it relevant (or 'red herrings' as such stuff is known in the Whodunnit game), and I suspect this sort of information dump works better on the printed page, when you are able to go back and re-check who said what to and about whom.This is not altogether successful, although it is not without merit (star power, and the opening sequence in Jerusalem, to name two).",5,1,1,8 May 2018
Defiance," Not quite there...
","Defiance retells a true story from World War II, whereby the three Bielski brothers take responsibility for the welfare of a large number of Jewish refugees by hiding them in the extensive forests in Belorussia.Think Robin Hood meets Schindler's List.This film is worthy, but never exacts the same grip on you that Schindler's List did. Perhaps this is due to the forest locations which, while often very beautiful, feel very claustrophobic and hem the movie in. The story merits a more expansive canvas.The cast are all excellent, particularly Liev Schreiber who shows rather more range than one is accustomed to seeing from him.I felt my attention begin to think about wandering at around the two thirds mark - there were some soap opera elements which felt a little out of place. And I felt somewhat dissatisfied at never knowing some of the specifics/nuts and bolts of what, after all, was something of a challenging situation - how many people were there all told? How did they organise food preparation? What sort of area was involved? What weapons did they have and where did they get them (Tuvia fails to take weapons from the policeman's house early on, for example). I felt the movie needed more of this and less of Azael making eyes at Chaya etc.But I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from seeing it - it's a worthwhile movie, and holds your interest (mostly), I was just left feeling that something was missing. But I can't put my finger on what it was.",7,1,7,21 January 2009
Lord of War," Umm... well....
","There was once a film called Little Big Man. That film told a story which alternated between humorous sequences, some bordering on farce, and high tragedy. And it worked very well. So the juxtaposition of humour and tragedy can be very effective.I'm not sure it worked in this movie.The events of the film are not, in any way, funny, but Cage's droll voice-over narrative is constantly amusing. In fact, you spend most of the movie thinking 'Gee, what an engaging fellow - witty, funny, the very essence of good company.' And yet what he is doing must mean that he is either completely stupid (if he does not understand the effect his actions have) or completely devoid of any sense of morality (if he does not care). Even when his actions bring his life crashing down about him, he doesn't change.I'm not sure the making the audience empathise with a wholly repellent protagonist is the best way to get your point across.I quite enjoyed this film, but I was left feeling somewhat uneasy - there is something about it which just didn't feel right.",6,0,1,1 July 2008
Sherlock Holmes," Pretty good
","Well, here's a strange thing. Diamond geezer director Guy Ritchie, who has struggled to repeat the critical and commercial success of diamond geezer London crime movie Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, gets to direct a Hollywood blockbuster, complete with a couple of big names and special effects coming out the old wazoo. Not something I would have predicted, but there you go. So what's it like? Rather good fun, actually. It's a solid story, with lots of action, lots of detectiving, a fair amount of humour, and bags of period feel (albeit tempered with some knowing anachronisms, especially in the dialogue). At the heart of it is the relationship between Downey's Holmes and Law's Watson (a good deal ballsier than any Watson I have seen elsewhere, a diamond geezer in fact), which is greatly assisted by the genuine chemistry between the two actors. The script is entertaining, the two principals give very good performances, and they are assisted by solid support from Mark Strong (always first rate) and Eddie Marsan. Only Rachel McAdams fails to engage, but perhaps that's just me.The effects budget has gone towards creating a very authentic looking Victorian London (although I can't help thinking that Baker Street, where I used to live, would have been wider than that back in Victorian times).I have only two reservations. One, Downey's accent never convinced me for a second: I was always aware that this was someone doing an accent, not that it was Holmes' natural way of speaking. And, two, I thought that some of the music was ear-manglingly awful. The Irish jig and gypsy dance-type pieces not only did not fit particularly well in the sequences they were applied to, and were so intrusive that they threatened to pull me out of the movie.Apart from that, the movie was hugely enjoyable.",8,1,3,14 January 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Great fun
","Max's comfortable and happy existence, marred only by Katie's inexplicable absences every day, is thrown into chaos when extremely large and bumptious Duke comes into the household. The ensuing conflict finds them out on the street, imprisoned by Animal Control as homeless strays, and pursued by pets from the apartments who are trying to rescue Max, and an assortment of outlaw animals, led by psycho bunny Snowball, intent on revenge-based harm.We love our pets, don't we? And we especially love to read human characteristics into them. The partial anthropomorphising of Max, Duke and Co. is cheating a bit - they have animal characteristics when that suits the movie, and they have human characteristics when that is appropriate - but that's no more than we do with our pets anyway, is it? And the fact that these characters can have both animal and human attributes as the story demands is not only absolutely fine, it feeds the film with charm and laughs.This CGI adventure is packed with action and humour. There is a huge cast, and every character is well designed with a distinctive look and an even more distinct character - you never get the various animals confused, and every one stays true to his character throughout. The look of the film is hugely attractive, with a New York which is realised in bright colours and simplified design, but recognisably the Big Apple nevertheless.But the thing which raises Secret Life above the average is the subtext. Family, camaraderie, trust, second chances - these are all issues which are addressed during the film, and never in a way which beats you over the head with moralising. The film has heart, a quality all too often lacking.The 3D could have added to this film: regrettably, it doesn't,I thoroughly enjoyed this, and recommend it.",8,0,1,23 May 2018
WALL·E," Yep. Me too. Great.
","If I disagreed with the trend, I would say so. But I don't. This is a fine film, a worthy addition to Pixar's list of winners.It always looks gorgeous, even when portraying the rubbishy desolation of the ruined Earth. There are moments of humour, suspense, romance (honestly!) and pathos as it tells a story which always holds your interest. The story carries a worthwhile message, and doesn't beat you over the head with it.But most of all, this film is notable for the way the character of Wall-E is the most human character seen on the big screen this summer. A metal box with caterpillar tracks and a pair of binoculars on top almost instantly becomes someone you care for. I went with friends and, near the end - you know the place I mean - 6-year old Daisy started snuffling. And I'm not ashamed to say that I wasn't far off myself.A lovely film.",10,1,4,23 July 2008
Finding Dory," Good but not as good as Finding Nemo
","Amnesiac Blue Tang Dory takes centre stage in this sequel to Finding Nemo: Finding Dory might more accurately be called Finding Dory's Parents, although Dory finds herself, too.Dory's memory which, we know from Finding Nemo, is highly unreliable in the short term, conveniently returns sufficiently for her to recall her parents and, voila, we have our plot. Dory, accompanied by Marlin and Nemo, goes on a search which takes her to an extensive Sea Life Centre, where her trip from tank to tank, exhibit to exhibit, is helped enormously by a 7-tentacled octopus (heptopus?) who is talented at slithering from place to place.The story is fairly straightforward - far from dissimilar to Finding Nemo, in fact - but, rather than the heart of the story being the need to let go of your children (quite a deep concept for a kids' film), here it is friends, family and hope, a more accessible idea for a young audience.Dory is a likeable character as we already know, but is she strong enough to carry a whole film? My personal jury delivers a mixed verdict here. Baby Dory is simply wonderful, and Ellen DeGeneres does an exemplary job as the voice of adult Dory, but I found that a little of Dory's constant disquiet over her forgetfulness went a long way. And there was a lot of it, so it went a very long way. I understand that it was the central element to the plot, and that it was used to ratchet up the emotional stakes: I still found it tiresome.On the visual side, the often quite lovely visuals were matched with an awful lot of swimming about in dark, murky tunnels, pipes, weeds and depths - the film wasn't as dazzlingly eye-catching as Finding Nemo. Having said that, the finale was great, and the reveal of the multiple shell-trails caught me by surprise and choked me up.The 3D had little value.This is a worthwhile sequel with much to enjoy, but Finding Nemo is still the reigning champeen.",8,1,2,23 May 2018
Arrival," Is it as deep as it appears to be?
","After a brief but devastating flashback prologue, spaceships arrive in stationary positions at a dozen locations across the world, and language specialist Louise is recruited by the military to try to communicate with the aliens within. Verbal communication turns out to be impossible, and Louise concentrates on visual communication: the aliens use symbols which look like the stains coffee cups leave. Meanwhile, some of the countries hosting the other ships are getting jittery about their guests...Arrival is, I think, going to be the new Matrix. Like The Matrix, I fancy Arrival is going to have a lot of people thinking that it is a masterpiece of cerebral science fiction and, like The Matrix, I think it will turn out to contain a good deal less than meets the eye.Don't let me talk it down too much, though, because it certainly contains some food for thought. The best notion for further examination is that the language you learn in infancy influences the way your thought processes develop, notwithstanding that this was a key concept in Robert Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land back in 1961.I felt that this idea (which drives the concept of the perception of time which, in turn, enables the resolution) was never coherently developed, though, and needed to be spelled out a little more clearly, especially as regards how it tied in with the prologue.The international paranoia and local xenophobia angles are far more straightforward, albeit straight out of The Day The Earth Stood Still.The cast are all very good in a film which takes its time to tell a story which, ultimately, is fairly simple. Amy Adams holds centre stage effectively, and Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker provide excellent support. And the visuals are interesting: not especially flashy, but always in service to the story. Denis Villneuve's direction is excellent - I liked this a great deal more than Sicario - and is one of the reasons why people are going to think there is more to this film than there is.I wouldn't go so far as to say that this film is an example of The Emperor's New Clothes, but it may well be a case of The Emperor's New Underpants. It's definitely worth seeing, though.",7,0,1,16 May 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Good for the spirit
","Stephen King's novella is a damn good yarn. The narrative is always engrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed without exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out as they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification, part of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it without seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the direction.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's guilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and others) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the three quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films I have ever seen.",10,4,5,14 June 2010
The Cannonball Run," Silly but OK
","The Cannonball Run, for me, disappears into an pit of indistinguishability with the Smoke And The Bandit movies - Burt Reynolds, lots of driving stunts, some sort of pursuit, yadda yadda yadda (you should admire my being able to say 'yadda yadda yadda - I'm not even American).This one has an excellent cast, albeit many of the cast members are slightly past their sell-by date.But, for me, the two things which make this film really worthwhile are - no, not Adrienne Barbeau (well, yes, Adrienne Barbeau, obviously) - Jack Elam's boggle-eyed Dr Van Helsing, and Dom DeLuise's inspired and hysterical (dan dan daaah!) Captain Chaos.This film is fun, and you don't get that in movies as much as you used to.",7,0,0,28 June 2011

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Weird, but a must for lovers of cinema
","Riggan Thomson is an actor whose big moment was as superhero Birdman in 3 movies 20 years ago. He is hoping to establish some late-career acting bona-fides by writing, directing and starring in a self-financed Broadway adaptation of a cult novel. Opening night is soon, things are not going well, and a late cast substitution brings in Mike, enormously talented but somewhat dangerous. Then factor in Riggan's daughter Sam, still smouldering with childhood resentments, acting as his assistant, developments in relationships with other cast members, concerns over what the most influential Broadway critic will say, and Riggan's own ongoing dialogue with the Birdman character he resents.This is possibly the most odd film I have ever tried to write a review for. The synopsis above presents a relatively straightforward linear dramatic narrative about theatrical goings-on. But the narrative is possibly the least significant element of the film: far more important is the way the narrative is presented, which is effectively one continuous take stretching over several days (with some tricks such as time lapse to move time along). Director Alejandro Inarritu's camera is constantly moving, always gracefully, and is blessed with some phenomenal edits and unnoticeable digital transitions – the special effects here are nothing short of miraculous, yet hardly noticeable.The film is described as a comedy: it certainly isn't, despite some amusing moments. That is (arguably) part of the problem: it doesn't conveniently fit into any sort of category, not least because it is largely an exercise in pure cinema rather than a story.The performances are all very good: I didn't feel Oscar calling, though.I have seen it called pretentious. There are those who love it. But it is possible to admire it without necessarily liking it very much, and some may find it utterly bewildering. All of these are absolutely valid reactions to it, and I felt all of them at different times as the movie progressed. But the one thing I can say with certainty is that it is completely original, and anyone with a love of cinema should experience it.",8,5,13,16 January 2015
Centurion," Full of joy and good cheer - not really
","If you like your films to be dirty, cold, bleached out, full of violence and misery, then you're going to have a ball with this one.It's the fag end of the Roman occupation of Britain, and a small group of Romans is trying to escape from the irate Picts on the wrong side of Hadrian's Wall. The problem is that the mute tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko) isn't working for the Romans after all.That's it really - one long chase across some of the bleakest landscapes ever put on film, with intermittent slaughter. The script is functional and occasionally witty. The performances are mostly OK, insofar as you can tell underneath the layers of furs and grime.The action sequences tend to suffer from both hand-held camera syndrome and quick cutting syndrome - it isn't always easy to follow what's going on.I do wish Imogen Poots would change her surname, she sounds like a character out of Monty Python.But, of its sort, it is entertaining enough.",7,6,16,5 May 2010
The Big Short," Cleverly done
","At the start of the banking meltdown in the 2000s, a small number of individuals / traders realise ahead of time that something weird is happening in the markets, and follow various courses of action.I never thought any movie would approach the thrill of Gungans blockading trade routes, but the intricacies of bonds based on sub-prime mortgages has Phantom Menace beaten hands down! I'm being facetious, of course. The Big Short takes an event of global economic significance, which is built on financial shenanigans of horrendous complexity, and it presents it in a way which audiences can understand. This is absolutely brilliant. It is also frequently very funny – I found myself laughing at the same time as being completely outraged by what was going on.There is a high level ensemble cast here and all are very good, although my money is on Steve Carell, proving that he is one of his generation's great actors. But the real stars here are the script, direction and editing, so Adam McKay gets the main credit. Who knew that a film about a subject this dry this dry could be so entertaining and full of outrage?",9,0,1,29 January 2016
The Conjuring," Well made, but no surprises
","Roger and Carolyn Perron and their 5 daughters move into a house which turns out to have all sorts of haunting events going on. Professional demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren confirm this to be the case, and end up having to perform an exorcism.Based on a story alleged to be true (about which I voice no opinion), my comments to you about this film depend on your familiarity with horror films, particularly haunted house, possession, and exorcism films. If you have never seen such a film then this is likely to scare your socks off. If you have - and if you are in the audience then this is likely to be the case - then you will enjoy it, because it is a slickly paced piece of entertainment with a lot of scare value generated by anticipation but also a reasonable amount of 'payoff' material. But it won't have anything in it which you haven't seen many times before.The casting is good - Vera Farmiga (Lorraine Warren) is always very watchable, and Lily Palmer as Mom Carolyn Perron is good, as are several of the girls, the atmosphere is effective, and it isn't overly dependent on loud noises.If you like this sort of movie then The Conjuring (where does that name come from, by the way?) is a good one.",7,0,2,9 August 2013
Prometheus," Yes of course it's a prequel
","I must state at the start that this review contains spoilers. That is because of the absurd claim in the early days of this movie that it is not a prequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 movie Alien. Of course it's a prequel - it sets up the scene where the Nostromo exploratory party discover the 'sky pilot' in the alien ship, for a start off. To say it's not a prequel is ridiculous.This movie starts with a very striking and mysterious scene following which it switches to scientist Noomie Rapace who, it turns out, has discovered a clue to the secret of where human beings originally came from, which leads mega-rich (and dying) Guy Pearce to fund a mission to the point in space indicated by the clue. The crew of 17 includes Rapace and her bloke, Charlize Theron in charge, and Michael Fassbender as the android assistant of Pearce's character.I was disappointed in Alien back in 1979. After all the hype, I found the first hour slow and boring and the second hour a standard monster in haunted house / last man standing yarn in a spaceship setting. Prometheus, I am glad to see, while referencing many of the moments in Alien which were fan favourites, is a much more consistently entertaining ride, and very much its own thing rather than just a reprise. The visuals are terrific, there is a fair amount of gory and revolting stuff, and it's quite a good story (albeit the philosophical issues are ditched eventually in favour of blowing sh*t up). Some surprises are revealed along the way.It's not perfect. There are elements of character set up which are never used, and there is at least one misplaced laugh moment, like the one in the original when the Muppet baby alien skitters across the floor, taking all the steam out of the otherwise shocking chestburster sequence. If I just say 'staples' and say that everyone in the cinema burst out laughing... And - big spoiler coming up - after setting up the sky pilot, who was it in the lifeboat grappling with Noomie Rapace's hitcher, and how did the sky pilot's chest burster happen? Or was that a different craft (it was established that there were others)? And how did the android know that? Perhaps not all questions were answered after all.But this was a good, entertaining, horror oriented science fiction movie.There were times when the 3D was stunning but, overall, it wasn't essential.I am adding these comments after a second viewing. It is clear on second viewing that the Engineer spacecraft seen in this film is NOT the same one seen in Alien: to that extent, there is no direct link between the films.The music and eye candy are terrific.And the film is full to overflowing with illogicalities, inconsistencies, matters unexplained which need explaining, and downright errors (nearly all of which have been covered in other reviews, although I can't recall anything mentioning the disembodied head gurgling despite having no lungs with which to propel a gurgle upwards). It is as if the filmmakers have devoted so much effort to imparting Significance, Art, and Meaningful Subtext to the piece that no-one had any time to go over the script for fundamental c*ck-ups. How come the storm blows away the scooter and not Shaw? Is she heavier than a piece of machinery? The more I think about this film, the more it annoys me.",8,1,6,8 June 2012
The Water Diviner," A good film
","Australian farmer Connor's three sons join the ANZAC forces at Gallipoli and never come back. His wife never recovers from their loss and, following her death, he makes her a promise to find them and bring them home. He meets obstacles at every turn before being helped by a Turkish officer who sees a way to atone for the wrongs done – and still being done – by all sides in an ongoing conflict.Russell Crowe's first effort as a director bears the legend 'Inspired by True Events'. I imagine that this probably means that a single element – in this case, the one father who went looking for where his sons fell – is used as the central element in a fiction. This doesn't matter – Gallipoli happened, and this film presents a fair emotional view of its impact on individuals and on the country in which it happened.There are a number of fairly discrete sections to the film: the Australian section is lyrical; the Gallipoli combat section is harrowing (and the fate of the sons, teased out through several flashbacks, very emotional); the Istanbul section (which comprises both the administrative blocks Connor encounters, as well as a developing relationship with a Turkish widow and her son) contains, for me, the emotional heart of the film, for it shows that, notwithstanding the heartbreak, Connor (and Ayshe and Orhan) can go forwards; the Gallipoli war graves search section is sobering and quietly devastating; and the final section where Connor is accompanied by Major Hasan is fairly standard action adventure stuff.It is a measure of Crowe's achievement as a director, particularly a first-timer, that these disparate elements are all individually well handled, and the film as a whole hangs together coherently.I suspect that this film may think of itself as important: it isn't, but it does tell a worthwhile story very well.",8,5,14,10 April 2015
Despicable Me," The kids will enjoy it, and so will you
","I probably don't need to explain that villainous Gru, annoyed that rival Vector is in the process of outvillaining him, adopts 3 orphan girls as part of a masterplan to regain the ascendancy, only to find that the girls turn him into a softie.This CGI 3D animated feature is daft, charming, and very funny. It manages to have its cake and eat it, the cake in question being real vs fantasy - Gru lives in a variation of a suburban house, drives his villainmobile around suburban streets and, in many ways, lives a completely conventional life, but he also freeze-rays people in the coffee shop, has an enormous secret laboratory under his house, and is assisted by a host of small yellow non-human minions.The plot serves two purposes. It is a vehicle on which to hang a number of gags (most of which greatly pleased the young audience in the cinema - there is no question that this movie works very well with its target audience). And it delivers a gently sentimental message in a fairly non-glutinous way.The visuals are very good. Character design is excellent, especially the girls and the minions. Voice characterisation is solid with, again, the girls and the minions standing out, although Steve Carell's Germanic/Russian Gru is also good fun. The 3D is occasionally effective but mostly irrelevant, although the end credits sequence, where various minions vie with each other to get closest to the camera, is well done and very funny.",8,5,7,22 October 2010
Back to the Future Part II," The perfect sequel to the perfect movie
","I thought BTTF did it all so well, then along comes BTTF2 and tops it.The time travel story is as good, if not better, and takes in a third time zone.There is more playing with the topography of the Town Square, and Biff chasing Marty (or variations thereof).There is the delight of the main actors playing multiple versions of themselves.There is the even greater delight of the events of the second film being played out against the background of the events of the first film.The effects are as good, and include some amazing pre-digital physical interactions between different iterations of the same character.The only flaw in this movie is that, being the first part of a two-part ending to the trilogy, there is no ending.And now I cast my vote for Elizabeth Shue's head being pasted digitally over Claudia Wells' in part 1!",10,0,0,15 October 2010
Carrie," Monsters
","Stephen King is noted as an author of horror stories - stories involving monsters, if you will. Carrie tells the story of a teenage girl with telekinetic powers which kick in with the onset of puberty, who kills her entire high school year at the Prom - at first glance, an obvious monster. Yet the beauty of this story (and it is an ugly beauty, if such a thing is possible) is that Carrie is not the monster -she is a victim. The monsters are her mother and a large part of her class at high school.The only major discrepancy between King's novel and DePalma's adaptation is that Sissy Spacek is a good deal cuter than King's Carrie White. But she is just as vulnerable, damaged, frightened and victimised and, ultimately, the difference in appearance does not matter in the slightest for dramatic purposes.This film is excellent all round. The performances are all very good, and the direction is stunningly effective - it suits the material perfectly.And the movie is also notable for the names it put on the map - DePalma, King, Spacek, Allen, Travolta. King hasn't always been fortunate with film adaptations, but he had nothing to complain about here.",8,4,6,14 April 2011

Taken 2," OK, but not as good as its predecessor
","Four years ago, Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) rescued his kidnapped daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) from sex slavery by virtue of slaughtering vast numbers of Albanian human traffickers in the unexpected (and now somewhat iconic) hit Taken. Now it seems that the patriarch of the deceased Balkan hordes is of a mind to apply some retribution to Brian by seizing him, Kim, and (ex-)wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) prior to killing them horribly in reverse order.This no more than a fairly minor variation on the first movie. That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining, of course, but it does mean it's not very original. One of the things I loved about the original is that, while Brian was very focused on his love for his daughter, in many respects he was not a very nice man: there was no room for gentlemanliness in his quest for Kim. Not a believer in human rights, he was brutal in his treatment of those who would seek to profit from the sale of his daughter. While Taken 2 is violent, I get the feel that the edge has been taken off in order to widen the certification (the first film appeared on DVD in a less stringent cut than that which visited cinemas). Also, Brian's position as kidnappee puts him on the defensive for a goodly chunk of the film, when he should be the active protagonist (although he is far from helpless). And there is nothing which comes close to Brian's wonderful telephone speech in the first film.For all that, this is a tolerable action thriller, but it doesn't come close to the first film.",7,0,2,10 October 2012
The Woman in Black," Let down by Radcliffe
","Although I have never read the novel, I have seen two different versions of the stage show which tells the story of junior solicitor Arthur Kipps' trip to remote village Crythin Gifford, to deal with the affairs of the recently deceased Alice Drablow at (even more remote) Eel Marsh House, a creepy house reached via a causeway which disappears under water at high tide. Shunned by the locals, Arthur finds that he may not be as alone as he thinks at Eel Marsh House as he begins to backtrack Alice Drablow's circumstances and the reason why the villagers are so hostile.The Woman In Back is a decent late 19th / early 20th century ghost story, and the stage adaptation (turning it into a two hander) is very effective. The film is also moderately effective, even though it takes fairly extensive liberties with the original, not least of which is turning Kipps into a widower from the outset in order to shoehorn in an ending which is at odds with the author's original shocking conclusion.The film is unquestionably atmospheric, but there is a distinct air of trotting out haunted house clichés, many of the early ones of which are somewhat dishonestly manufactured into 'Made you jump' moments (carriage driver Keckwick appears behind Arthur accompanied by a massive orchestra hit - 'Made you jump!' Yes, because you just played an enormous orchestra chord right in my ear!). Fortunately, there are some genuine scares later on and the film only just stays - perhaps for lack of gore - within its 12A certificate. So there are worse ghost story movies to see, and it is nice to see Hammer Films up and running again. And it is worth mentioning Ciaran Hinds' terrific performance as Sam, local rich man with as many secrets as the other locals.Now to the criticisms. One is that it is never made clear why The Woman In Black (for - spoiler apologies! - you are left in no doubt that she exists, we the audience see her when Kipps doesn't) exacts such revenge on innocent people who were not involved in her own tragedy: it all seems a bit unreasonable, and doesn't work as well here as it does in the theatre production. The other - and the main one, I fear - is that Daniel Radcliffe simply isn't very good. In performance terms, Arthur Kipps is simply Harry Potter without glasses but with whiskers. He has one expression - earnestly anxious, and this passes for mourning at the start when his wife dies in childbirth, and continues 4 years later as he is sent on this assignment, and remains in place as The Woman In Black appears in the shadows and just on the edge of his vision, winds up clockwork toys, rocks invisibly in a rocking chair etc. etc. - Kipps remains anxious. Radcliffe's one-note performance convinces no more than his one-note Harry did. And his mildly estuary English is so contemporary that it simply doesn't ring true for the era in which the film is set, and ends up being distracting.By the way, given that Crythin Gifford is a tiny village in the back of beyond, drowned with rainfall, obscured by fog, with a population of miserable souls who are hostile to strangers, how come the inn is so fully booked that Kipps can't get a room?",7,0,1,17 February 2012
Shrek," Classic
","Shrek is an irascible ogre who lives in a swamp and enjoys his isolation. Much against his will, he is pressured into journeying with a donkey to save a Princess from a dragon. The journey turns out to be one of self discovery.Let me say at the start that I am not a big fan of Mike Myers' voicings here. He is OK, but I've heard better. Having said that, everything else about this film is perfect. It would be very good as a straightforward fantasy adventure, but when you factor in the constant, and spot on, potshots at movies in general (and Disney in particular), it raises the game substantially. Factor in CGI of a standard not previously seen, non-stop gags, exhilarating action, and inspired voice talent - especially Eddie Murphy - and you have a classic.I repeat - a classic, and highly recommended.",10,0,1,30 December 2013

Suffice it to say that, like the best adaptations, there's enough of the original material to remain true to the spirit, but enough variation to keep you interested and surprised. It is a very satisfying story with - so importantly! - a very good script.The film is brilliantly cast and the performances are uniformly excellent, with the central performances of McAvoy and Fassbender being the note-perfect glue which holds the whole thing together (please excuse the mixed metaphor!). Jennifer Lawrence's Raven is also a creation of shifting emotional layers.The effects and set pieces are executed flawlessly, with the sole exception of Emma Frost changing back from diamond form, which doesn't really convince (neither does January Jones, who doesn't really convey very much of the Emma Frost I expected).There is a single, completely unnecessary, F-bomb.Overall, though, this film is great fun, terrifically entertaining, carries some emotional wallop, and has jumped straight to first place as my favourite X-Men film.",10,3,8,2 June 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," Half-hearted wannabe pervert porn
","Shop assistant, impending college graduate, cutie and improbable virgin Anastasia encounters hot millionaire businessman and adopted sexual screw-up Christian, and there is an immediate attraction between them. The relationship develops and Christian, having tenderly and intimately relieved Anastasia of her virginity, makes it clear that his interest lies in S&M (and, more specifically, domination/submission) with no intimacy or tenderness. Anatasia umms and ahs and tries it out a bit, and the film ends with a crisis, all set up for part 2.I am male, English, and 62. The books (which I have not read) were not aimed at me, and neither is this film. Nevertheless, I will approach it as objectively as I can.The reproductive urge and underlying sex drive is a major motivation in the animal kingdom, not least for humans. Being blessed (or cursed) with rational thought, humans can cross-pollinate their sex drives with all sorts of extraneous elements: societal taboos, personal moralities, fetishes, perversions and the like. It is undeniable that the book from which this film derives tapped into something which made it a phenomenon in a particular niche market (primarily respectable whitebread middle class women). I suggest that it tapped into some sort of vicarious wish-fulfilment area, giving the frisson of the sexual deviation/s depicted without the actual risk or pain involved.This is a difficult thing to convey in a film, especially one which finds itself hidebound by the practical problems which face this movie. On one hand, it knows that it is intended to appeal to the niche market which purchased the book in truckloads. On the other, it desperately wants to have mass-market appeal. Despite the film's undeniable glossy coating, this latter quest is tied together at the ankles by the fact that making a romance predicated on tieing someone up and hitting them very hard is fundamentally unappealing unless you are already converted to that particular cause. The camera slowly makes its way down naked bodies in sensuous close-up – very nice - following which there is a bit of bondage and a bit of flagellation, and I go 'OK, you just lost me.' There seems to be far more time devoted to the rules, non-disclosure agreements and contracts involved with Christian's little foible than on the little foible itself. And there is an interesting story to be told about two people, each of whom is intent on changing the other against their will, a story touched on but not explored.Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan look very attractive both in and out of their clothing, and they both work hard, but I didn't find either character very believable, and the relationship between them even less so. Miss Johnson has a dusting of pubic hair which the camera constantly shies away from for some reason, and Mr Dornan's todger is, famously, not on display. For a film which depends for its appeal on sexually frank subject matter, it is astonishingly coy about it and, consequently, not very convincing. Above everything else, it is hugely unerotic.There is a saying in the north of England – 'Neither nowt nor summat' (translates as 'Neither nothing nor something.') Fifty Shades Of Grey is a prime example of what that expression means.",6,13,19,23 February 2015
The Wolverine," Not perfect, but very enjoyable
","In a brief preamble, we discover that mutant Logan, held prisoner in Nagasaki during World War II, saves the life of Japanese guard Yashida when the atomic bomb is dropped. Years later, while Logan is having extreme difficulty in coming to terms with his having killed the woman he loves, the now wealthy Yashida summons Logan to bid him farewell as he is dying. But Yashida has other motives...Much of this movie will be a puzzle to anyone who has not watched X-Men 3 or Wolverine's Origins movie - who is this woman in Logan's dreams? How come he has claws, and heals so fast? How come he was in WWII and is still alive without ageing now? But who cares - I know, that's why I went to see it! And I expect you do, too.The Wolverine origin movie didn't go down that well, although I enjoyed it. This one feels totally different - the Japanese setting comes through very strongly - and is much more clearly structured to belong within the X-Men movie universe continuity (not least by way of the mid-credits teaser). I enjoyed this one, too, with two mild caveats. One, I felt that there was, if anything, too much action: there wee times when lengthy action sequences followed one after the other without advancing the (fairly sketchy) plot one step further. And, two, in a serious movie, there were a couple of times when I felt like laughing.Jackman retains the physicality and intensity which has characterised Logan's 5 previous appearances. Harukiko Yamanouchi is an imposing older Yashida: the other Japanese male actors were less impressive. Svetlana Khodchenkova never really convinced as Viper but Rila Fukushima, in her first feature, was excellent as Yukio: physically very able, sexy, funny and dark - an extremely accomplished feature debut. And Tao Okamoto as the iconic Mariko was, I thought, perfect. Her character's development arc probably covers most ground (after Logan) as Mariko teaches him how to value being alive again, and does so with a centre of serene intensity.The obligatory stand-alone F-bomb doesn't even have the virtue of being amusing like the one in X-Men: First Class. It really annoys me that it seems to be seen as essential to include one 'just because we can.'",Null,1,6,26 July 2013
Win Win," Neither fish nor fowl, but engaging nonetheless
","I'm not too sure what to make of Win Win. Paul Giamatti is Mike. His law practice is going down the tubes, and the high school wrestling team he coaches is rubbish and loses every match it plays. When he gets involved in Leo (Burt Young)'s affairs - Leo is in the early stages of Alzheimer's and his daughter is absent with a drug habit - he sees an opportunity to put Leo in a home (Leo wants to stay in his house) and pocket the management fee paid by the State. It then turns out that Leo comes with a teenage grandson who happens to be a phenomenal wrestler. And then the daughter turns up.This film doesn't conveniently fit into any category. It is sometimes amusing, but it's no comedy. There are elements of Karate Kid and Rocky in the wrestling matches. And, most of all, it is a morality play of sorts:Leo's actions put him in a difficult place, but he develops as a person as a result. In that respect I suppose the film is quite successful, and it benefits from believable performances from all the principal characters.Where it falls down is in that there are a number of areas where it simply isn't believable. While I can understand Mike falling victim to temptation, surely he would then have gone on to arrange to rent out Leo's house? The sums didn't really add up here. And I found it difficult to believe he would have got off so lightly, notwithstanding the daughter's attitude. And the wrestling grandson was a major coincidence.Having said that, I was quite happy to live with these reservations, and I found the movie quietly pleasing.",7,9,11,27 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Flawed but enjoyable
","I am pleased to say that I finally arrived at the third and final movie in Christopher Nolan's and Christian Bale's Batman trilogy without having encountered significant spoilers. I have encountered a number of reviews, however, and I was expecting to be disappointed. I'm therefore also pleased to say I wasn't disappointed at all. The movie powered along nicely, kept me interested throughout, and did a number of things which I liked. To be fair, it also did a number of things which I didn't like quite so much, and I fear I am going to be doing some spoilering myself in respect of these points, although I will try to keep things as non-specific as possible.This film was clearly constructed as the finale of a 3-act story: much which is in it is definitively final, and one of the things which both annoyed me and pleased me is the way the film contrived, at the end, to have its cake and eat it too. For me, it achieved this successfully, and this was probably the single element I enjoyed most. But I also liked the action (except the two Batman / Bane fights, in which these highly trained masters of multiple combat styles punched and punched and punched...), the music (those fabulous booming, blaring horns), the reveals in the closing section, and the way Bane's story tied into Ra's al Ghul's. And I liked the comic acknowledgements, something which Nolan has studiously avoided until now (apart from using comic characters, of course): here we had both No Man's Land and, more significantly, The Breaking Of The Bat, both presented on screen.I enjoyed all the performances. Anne Hathaway was a nicely conceived and performed Selina Kyle, perfectly capturing the conflict between a life of crime and an essentially good heart (plus the tight leather catsuit was, in my view A Good Thing. It was nice to see Juno Temple, too, albeit in a meagre role). I liked Bane - a well realised variant on the comic. I loved his vocal performance - those psychotic, murderous utterances delivered in that hearty, convivial manner was not at all what I expected. And, as in the previous movies, Michael Caine's Alfred was the beating heart of the film, and the one part which injected a massive dose of emotion, thus going a long way towards countering one of the main criticisms of Christopher Nolan, namely that his films tend to be intellectual but heartless.Which is why that aspect was high on the list of things which disappointed me: when Alfred walks out halfway through the movie so, too, goes much of the emotion, and what follows is exciting but not especially involving, especially when a muddy sound mix meant that dialogue was often lost. There were a number of elements in a needlessly complicated plot which didn't bear close examination, most of which didn't worry me too much (after all, he is The Batman!), but two items niggled. One was the idea that it would be possible to calculate the rate of decay in a nuclear device to the second: there were so many other ways to have incorporated the suspense of a countdown into the plot which would have been more elegant and credible (and, to that extent, better written: this was clumsy screen writing). And the other was the determination of Batman's nemesis to obliterate Gotham City in a nuclear blast: given that this could have been done at any point during the latter half of the movie, why didn't they simply do it? Incidentally, for something so quintessentially American, how little of the primary talent in these films has been American: out of director, screenwriters and actors, only Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Katie Holmes, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have been American (Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Tom Hardy - English; Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy - Irish; Heath Ledger - Australian; Rutger Hauer - Dutch; Marion Cotillard - French). I'm not sure what this says, though.",8,1,3,27 July 2012
The Croods," Solid family movie
","Eep is a teenage cavegirl who badly wants to spread her wings. Trouble is that Dad Grug is overprotective, afraid of everything, and keeps the family shut up in the cave all the time so that they are not exposed to risks. Then handsome young Guy comes along, full of ideas and open to exploring the world, Eep is entranced, and Grug's authority and philosophy is challenged.I think one can over-examine this film - by any rational standards, Grug is doing exactly the right thing for his family, and making him the fall guy made me feel a little uneasy. So perhaps it is best to take a step backwards and just look at this as a family movie, on which grounds it succeeds admirably. It is exciting, there are a lot of laughs, the design (characters, environments, quirky creatures) is brilliant, the movie is spectacular, and the voice characterisation is good (Emma Stone's Eep is a bit shrill, but then, she's an excitable teenager).The big surprise is that the movie, which the trailer sells as a rite of passage story for Eep, isn't about her at all, it's about Grug learning to change. My only real complaint is that Grug's resistance to change goes on for so long, and in circumstances where it is so massively stupid, that it becomes somewhat tiresome. For all that, the family will enjoy it.The 3D has its moments.",7,1,3,25 March 2013
Iron Man," Damned with faint praise
","First things first - I have never had an Iron Man comic, I don't think - Iron Man is simply an incidental character in other comics I've read. Kind of like Marvel's Aquaman (although I have at least had some Aquaman comics from time to time). So I'm pretty unfamiliar with Iron Man's mythology, origin, supporting cast etc., and I'm therefore not in a position to say whether the movie is faithful to its origins or not. I'm simply approaching it as a generic super-hero movie.There is much to like in this film, although I came out entertained but not jazzed. Downey is great, the effects are mostly fine, Bridges is a very good duplicitous villain, the chemistry between Downey and Paltrow is good, and there are some nice moments in the script. And I was surprised to find it was 2 hours, it felt more like 90 minutes as it whizzed by.But it left me curiously unmoved, unengaged. I didn't care that much about these characters. On an overall entertainment level I would put it on a par with the FF movies, with the key distinction that the relationship between the FF meant that you did care about them. Not so here.Having said that, the 'first night out' in the revamped suit is GREAT - really fun and exhilarating.",7,4,8,1 May 2008
Mother!," Those are lovely New Clothes, Emperor
","My name is Aaron Darrenofsky, and I am much cleverer than you. Specifically, I can make a horror film except it's not a horror film, you see. It's a very clever metaphor.But what's it a metaphor for? That's even cleverer, because I don't have to tell you! No, I can leave you to make up your own meaning and then you'll be pleased that you're (nearly) as clever as me! And if you think 'What a pile of pretentious claptrap' then I have an army of people who really love The Emperor's New Clothes, and they'll tell you that you're too stupid to understand it.This starts off well, then you come to realise it's art-house nonsense, just dressed up in horror film clothes. Jennifer Lawrence gives the worst performance of her career so far in a part which her boyfriend has underwritten and badly directed: he has not done her any favours with this unsympathetic, unrealistic, one-note sacrificial lamb.A bad, horrible film. Please avoid it. And please avoid Aaron Darrenofsky and the similarly named charlatan who made this pile of tripe.",4,14,25,22 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Terrific visuals, other great stuff, but the movie is very very flawed
","Following the massive destruction in Metropolis during the battle between Superman and General Zod's forces, Bruce Wayne, distraught at the deaths of his employees in his office block, decides that Superman is too dangerous to exist in our world and, in his alternate identity as vigilante Batman, determines to do something about it. Squillionaire businessman / scientist / weirdo Lex Luthor comes to a similar conclusion. Probably. There is a senator who is similarly concerned. Various battles ensue.Man Of Steel, the predecessor to this movie, polarised opinions, and its sequel looks set to do the same thing. Let me make one thing clear before going on to other matters – Zack Snyder is without equal in bringing truly eye-dazzling visuals to the big screen (albeit the 3D version of this is pointless because the 3D is unnoticeable).I come to this with a slight change in my mindset. I loved much of Man Of Steel, but I took profound issue with its portrayal of Superman and (primarily) Pa Kent. Pa Kent (who turns up for an utterly unnecessary cameo here) was simply fundamentally misconceived – instead of giving Clark the selfless values which are Superman's watchword, he taught him to put himself before others, leaving a long way for the character to travel if he was ever going to find the inner nobility which is (or should be) his main characteristic. And Superman was written into a situation where he had no alternative but to kill, a deliberate statement by the filmmakers about the character. And guess what? I bet you thought Batman hates guns and doesn't kill, didn't you? Well, think again.I grew up with the Silver Age iterations of these characters, albeit the movement of Batman from camp to dark was a good one. And Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman is fine work, notwithstanding his casual attitude towards the deaths of criminal henchmen and (possibly) innocent passers-by. But in oder not to despise this film and its predecessor, one has to not be imprisoned by that pre-existing view and, instead, look at these as alternate interpretations of the characters – easy in Batman's case, since he has been interpreted many ways of the years, not so easy with Superman where grim, depressing and joyless are all terms which are the antithesis of the fairly consistent interpretation of the character over its 75-year history. My son says it's a Superman for the 21st century, and maybe he is right. It's not MY Superman, that's for sure. And the single scene which tells me that is when Superman stands in the middle of a massive explosion and does nothing to minimise the explosion or save people. Instead, he just stands there rather sadly. Nope, that's not Superman.Cavill does his best with a character who isn't written as the hero he should be. Affleck is terrific. Gal Gadot's short appearance as Wonder Women is galvanising and makes you wish her film had arrived already. Lex Luthor – well, I like Jesse Eisenberg enormously and think his talent and versatility has motored through his rather clichéd nerdy appearance very effectively, but this interpretation of Luthor isn't one which is obvious. For me, it didn't really work. Amy Adams still doesn't have any real chemistry with Henry Cavill – there is more chemistry between them when they're on chat shows. Jeremy Irons' Alfred is excellent. The action, effects, props, sets are all first rate – as noted, visuals aren't Snyder's problem.The film itself is a problem. If you're not careful, you'll finish it with a bucketful of unanswered questions, not just those which will fall to be answered in future films, but questions about motivations, opportunities, why no-one spotted this or did nothing about that – there is a LOT of carelessness in the script, which seems engineered to always set up a cool visual rather than progress things logically. The film is over two and a half hours long, and contains little bits of plot which never really go anywhere, never get developed, and which could have been dropped with minimal re-writing, making the film tighter and with better narrative flow. In particular the lead-up to the Batman / Superman fight feels terribly artificially engineered, although the fight itself is splendid.I enjoyed this – it's the nearest I'm going to get to a World's Finest movie in my lifetime – but to say it's flawed is an understatement. Let Snyder capture his visuals by all means, but get someone who knows what they're doing on the screen writing, please.",7,3,6,30 March 2016
Bruce Almighty," Carrey promoted above his pay grade
","Bruce Nolan is a local news presenter in Buffalo NY, who badly wants to be promoted to anchor: he loses out to rival Evan. Bemoaning his lot to God, he is astonished to discover that God is not only listening, his solution is to give a full set of powers to Bruce. But will this solve Bruce's problems?No, of course it won't. It will simply create more but, hopefully, along the way, he will gain an insight into what he really wants and, maybe the best way to get it.Jim Carrey, as Bruce, gets another opportunity to indulge in some physical humour as he tries out his divine powers, not always in the most philanthropic of ways. Morgan Freeman is a likeable God, Jennifer Aniston a satisfactory love interest, and Steve Carell steals the show with some rogue speech.This film is good fun.",7,0,0,15 March 2020
The Greatest Showman," Musical numbers better than the film
","Impoverished Phineas Barnum marries a girl from a rich family against the wishes of her parents, and proceeds to make his fortune by presenting displays of the rare and unusual, including people with attributes which have them labelled as freaks.Hugh Jackman plays Barnum in a musical celebration of the positive elements of his career (as a frosty critic tells him, some might say that it is a celebration of humanity). His story goes off the rails a bit when he brings Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind to the USA - I have no idea how accurate the almost-affair is, followed by the consequences of anti-freak action, but all ends well as the Big Top is erected. Jackman and the rest of the cast look to be having a whale of a time, and understandably so, given the gusto with which the musical numbers are presented. There were times when the lyrics were hard to make out, especially early on, but the melodies were all catchy and hummable and the lyrics (when clearly heard) were inspirational. The dancing was never technically challenging in terms of intricate footwork but the musical numbers, without exception, were exhilarating and emotional.I gather the critics haven't given this an easy ride. Well, content-wise it is fairly standard fictional biopic stuff, but the musical numbers are the best I can recall for some time.",8,4,8,1 May 2018
Monsters University," Very good, but not terribly original
","Mike Wazowski has wanted to be a scarer ever since he was at elementary school. He gets to attend Monster University which he hopes will help him realise his dreams.12 years ago we met Mike and Sully working for Monsters Inc. Here we see their first meeting at Monsters University in a story which is an odd but generally effective mixture. It is a fairly routine college underdogs movie though, for its target audience of younger viewers, it may well be the first time they have met this storyline. Conversely, a lot of the college related gags and plot elements are unlikely to have much meaning for them (and, to be frank, the fraternity stuff is, as always, a complete mystery to non-American viewers).Having said that, the story works well, the visuals are first rate (and the 3D, while unessential, is effective), the film is bright and colourful, the voice talent is spectacular, Crystal and Goodman retain the excellent chemistry which so enhanced the original movie (Goodman's Sullie is surprisingly unsympathetic for much of the movie, albeit this is a plot point), and the film does not end how I expected it to.So I think it must be acknowledged that the film is not terribly original - very un-Pixar-like - but it will have wide appeal to both young and older audience. It entertains, and what more can you ask of a film?",8,0,0,19 July 2013
Ben-Hur," Not perfect, but nearly
","Probably Charlton Heston's finest hour, Ben-Hur is a very good film version of a good bible-related story. General Lew Wallace's book tells part of the gospel stories through the interesting means of someone else's story, which crosses Jesus' at two or three critical points. Which is not to say that Judah Ben-Hur's story is lacking - it's an interesting, gripping, emotional, credible, engaging journey, told brilliantly well.The film is spectacular, with great performances, particularly Stephen Boyd.Hindsight makes the model work of the naval battle somewhat obvious, although, for the time, it is very good. And the film is maybe a touch more earnest than it needs to be.But it is still a great film. And that chariot race!!!",9,0,2,16 April 2011
Casino Royale," A game of two halves
","When a film has a lot of comments, I often look at the negatives first.The negatives here mostly express disappointment that Casino Royale is not yet another version of the Bond film which became increasingly standardised from You Only Live Twice onwards. Yes, they were fun, but by heavens, they were stale. Die Another Day was a dose of fresh air to start with before it reverted to the formula in the second half.But Casino Royale was a real fresh start. It had the feel of the early Bonds - espionage thrillers - but with a modern take. Bond became a more rounded person than the bit of cardboard he has been in most of the movies. The cheesy one-liners were, for the most part, thankfully consigned to the rubbish bin. The performances were uniformly excellent (and by heavens, Judi Dench delivers, doesn't she, in those cameos?). The ties to the earlier films in the series were few, but exquisitely judged - they send a shiver up your spine when they came. And Daniel Craig - about whom I had as many doubts as everyone else - was very very good indeed.Roll on Bond 22!",10,0,5,6 December 2007
Toy Story 3," Excellent, but not entirely for children
","Let me start by saying that, as expected, Toy Story 3 is a wonderful film. In the company of the characters we have come to know and love over the previous two movies, together with some new ones, we embark on one last adventure which is full of thrills, excitement, humour, scary bits, and tearful emotion before arriving at a moment which brings the Toy Story films to an entirely appropriate conclusion. The story is predicated on the problem of what to do with Andy's toys now that he is going to college, and the plot involves the complications which ensue when most, but not all, of the toys are donated to a daycare centre - the central section is effectively an extended prison break caper.Having said that, and having had a few hours to let things settle down in my mind, I find myself thinking that Toy Story 3 isn't a children's film at all, although it will undoubtedly be greatly enjoyed by children. The themes are, as always, entirely adult - the importance of family, ageing, the inevitability of separation, letting go and so on - but Pixar (and Disney historically) have never felt it necessary to shie away from adult themes in kids' films, so that isn't really a factor in my speculation.There are two things which make me say that Toy Story 3 is predominantly an adult film.One, it is much - much! - darker in tone than the previous films. Sid was a disadvantaged kid given to mistreating toys with no conception of the consequences of his actions, and the Collector meant toys no harm. But in TS3 we have, for the only time in the Toy Story films, a character who makes a deliberate choice to act in a way which is entirely evil. We also have the characters facing their deaths in a way that even young children can understand. Adult themes are one thing, the reality of an unpleasant death is something entirely different.And, two, while the movie works as a standalone movie, it acquires a richness when watched as the third part of a trilogy by an audience which has aged at the same rate as the characters in the film, and this is perhaps reflected best by the fact that the entire story rests on Andy standing on the threshold of adulthood - issues of maturity have replaced simple childhood playing, and this is understood by an audience which identifies with where Andy now finds himself. This is the same sort of thing which Jo Rowling has gone for in the Harry Potter books.None of this in any way diminishes what a fine film this is, though - if anything, it enhances it, and shows once more how effectively Pixar make movies which work on multiple levels.While I'm at it, a quick word of praise for the accompanying short Night And Day, an astonishingly clever work of visual imagination.",10,1,1,22 July 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," A bit over-familiar
","I don't want to damn with faint praise, but I suspect that's what it's going to sound like.I liked this film, but I didn't love it. It was fun, but not hysterical. The 3D was good, but not great.There was absolutely nothing to criticise - everything was done competently at worst, with great skill at best. The voice characterisations were all good, with Simon Pegg chipping in an excellent characterisation as swashbucking weaselly hero-type thing Buck. The baby critters, of whatever species, are all dead cute. The backgrounds are wonderfully well realised. The story is solid and the moral is worthwhile. And yet...I think my problem is that, by film 3, it's all so familiar. Notwithstanding a change in locale, we know the characters so well that what they get up to is, too me, beginning to become a little limiting (so hooray for the trip to the subterranean world and the change of scenery which goes with it.Take your kids and go and see it - you'll enjoy it. I did. But...",7,1,3,15 July 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," But what happened after that?
","Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie: I wouldn't want to give the impression that the reservations which follow mean that I didn't.Vicky Cristina Barcelona is essentially a drama, even though the plot sounds more like a French farce - Vicky (Rebecca Hall, tightly controlled, life on a strictly predetermined plan) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson, chaotic free spirit) are students, lifelong friends who go to Barcelona for the summer prior to Vicky marrying fiancé Doug that autumn. They are propositioned by charismatic artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem): Vicky is appalled but Cristina happily goes along with it. Before their liaison is consummated, however Cristina falls sick, at which point Vicky suddenly and unexpectedly drops all her defences along with her knickers and enjoys a night of passion with Juan Antonio. This is strictly a one-off, and Juan Antonio resumes with Cristina at a later date. At this point, his ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) arrives on the scene following a suicide attempt. Juan Antonio and Maria Elena are inextricably bound together: soulmates who cannot live without each other, but cannot live together either. It turns out that Cristina is the essential catalyst in their relationship, and they fall into a three-way relationship which works. By this time Doug has arrived in Barcelona and he and Vicky have had a quickie wedding despite the fact that her one night stand with Juan Antonio has lit something of a fire in her. Cristina tells Juan Antonio and Maria Elena that while the relationship may work for them, it's not what she wants, so she goes off for a couple of weeks to find herself. They fall back into old ways and Maria Elena steams off after another row. Vicky visits Juan Antonion to try to scratch the itch he has created: before they can do so, Maria Elena appears and shoots Vicky in the hand. The two girls and Doug go back to the US.The film has a very strong sense of its Spanish location, and all the cast are attractive and perform well, particularly Penelope Cruz, whose Maria Elena who is either excessively emotional or else mildly disturbed.The main problem I had with this movie was the lack of resolution. The characters are interesting and the dynamics between them are entertaining, but not that plausible. To then be served up with a realistic ending - in that everyone simply gets on with their lives with no resolution to any of the arcs which are set up and pursued - is, I felt, cheating the expectations of the audience.The other problem I had was that all the main American characters - both girls, Doug, the narrator, and Patricia Clarkson as host Judy - all delivered speeches at different points by way of Woody Allen impressions. The aping of Allen's distinctive stammering self-deprecating delivery was so marked that it can only have been intentional, and it was so out of place each time that it pulled me out of the movie.",7,1,6,19 February 2009
Pitch Perfect 3," Weak
","The Bellas are back in what is clearly intended to be a final film, although the lure of the mighty buck is not something to be easily denied, so who knows.This time they are off to entertain the troops around the Mediterranean and, guess what, they find themselves in a contest again and, as usual, find themselves subject to hostile judgement from the two hostile commentators who, this time, are making a documentary. Add to the mix Fat Amy's Dad, who arrives on his luxury yacht to see his daughter perform, But he's not necessarily a very nice person...The plot here is the daftest yet. The girls are increasingly anonymous, with Rebel Wilson overwhelming everything, Anna Kendrick coming 2nd, Hailee Steinfeld 3rd, Brittany Snow 33rd, and the rest indistinguishable from each other. The very funny Hana Mae Lee as Lily gets distressingly little to do.
John Lithgow gets to do an Australian accent which, in terms of accuracy, trails some distance behind Dick van Dyke's cockney one.The musical numbers are well arranged and (mostly) well staged, but I didn't find most of the songs very good: the hummability factor was low.",6,0,1,2 May 2018

","After a rather puzzling introduction sequence we find ourselves in the company of a motley group of individuals all of whom are stranded at a remote motel when bad weather washes the road out. There is some friction between them - not unexpected - but it doesn't seem sufficient to explain away the disappearance of one of their number, subsequently found dead. Is it one of their number, or someone else? Then another member of the group dies...All this seems familiar enough stuff and, indeed, it is. Up to about the halfway mark. Then we realise that the fact that everyone is trapped here has some significance, and the movie goes in a direction which - to me, at least - is entirely unexpected.A decent cast, headed by John Cusack and Ray Liotta, play this for all it's worth. The material might not convince in other hands, but it is in safe hands here, and a film which starts out by pretending to be one thing and ends up as something quite different succeeds very well.Highly recommended.",8,1,1,5 July 2011
Saving Mr. Banks," Sentimental, but fair enough
","Walt Disney pursued author Pamela Travers for over 20 years for the screen rights of Mary Poppins, finally luring her to Hollywood to work with his creative people on the screenplay. Truth be told, she didn't want to let go of her characters because they had been her way of dealing with the pain of her troubled childhood in rural Australia.This interesting and, perhaps, unusual, adaptation of real-life events alternates between showing the difficulties Disney and his people had with the awkward, stubborn, stand-offish and cantankerous Travers, and the events of 40 years earlier in Australia. I have encountered a number of comments where people say that the Australia sequences took them out of the film, and I can understand this: the Disney Studios sequences are played for comedy, whereas the Australian sequences are straightforward drama: sentimental at times, surely, but often quite harshly emotional in showing the way the young Travers idolised her flawed father (and he her) but was powerless - as was everybody else- to rescue him from the alcoholism which destroyed him. However, I felt that these sequences, none of which was overlong and all of which were interspersed throughout the film's running length - were the heart of the story, without which it would not have worked so well.Tom Hanks' everymannish-ness is ideally suited to the avuncular public personality Walt Disney affected, albeit we also get a look at the hard-nosed businessman who created the Disney empire. Emma Thompson's Travers strains (sometimes successfully) to escape a one-note personality, but this is perhaps a reflection of Travers herself. Colin Farrell has come in for some criticism, but I thought he did well as Travers' father. And Paul Giamatti's chauffeur Ralph is perhaps the most likable (and least realistic) character in the film, but we love him anyway.This film manipulates our emotions (but hasn't Disney done that right from the start anyway?), but does so in the cause of an unusual but very rewarding story. I enjoyed this rather more than I expected to.",9,2,6,6 December 2013
Beowulf," Good but weird
","It is a very strange sensation to watch a film where the cast comprises largely imitations of the people in the cast: watching Anthony Hopkins occupy a replica of himself is profoundly weird. The experience then becomes even weirder when the character inhabited by the larger than life persona of Ray Winstone isn't Winstone! (despite his avowed intention of doing away with monstahs!) One also has to overcome the expectation that a cartoon film (if one can refer to a wholly CGI film as such) is aimed predominantly at the younger viewer: Beowulf contains some quite savage violence, not to mention some earthy humour, and is definitely not for youngsters.It is a worthwhile effort, though. Taking some liberties with the ancient epic poem, it tells an exciting story, and always looks good. The cast are all excellent (even if, as noted above, they are somewhat distracting), and it is worth singling out Crispin Glover for his stunning performance as Grendel - he makes a barbaric murdering monster something deserving of sympathy.I can't comment on the 3D as I saw a flat copy, but I can imagine that it would have been very effective.An interesting experiment, and one which was successful in artistic terms, even if perhaps not in commercial terms.",8,2,3,5 January 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," I did not like it very much
","Aren't preconceptions horrible? I went to this movie convinced, on the back of having seen the trailer numerous times, that I wouldn't enjoy it. And guess what? I was right.I'm a big fan of mainstream stop-frame animation - I have the complete Harryhausen (excluding Earth vs The Flying Saucers, but including all the Puppetoons etc.) On my DVD shelves, and I'm a big fan of Willis O'Brien, Jim Danforth, and Phil Tippett. I don't much care for the middle European stuff from the 50s and 60s though.And that's pretty similar to the style adopted here, and I have to say I don't care for it. There were times when I greatly admired the way some effects were achieved, but I really didn't like the way this film looked (from a character and set design point of view) or moved. In fact, populating an essentially rustic English setting with distinctly American animals didn't really work. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it was simply that the execution meant that there was, to me, an irreconcilable disharmony between the two.The voice talent was, on the whole, very good, with Clooney, Streep, and Gambon not unexpectedly taking the honours.The script was, I thought, awful. Wes Anderson joins the Coen brothers and Darren Aronofsky in that select group of writer/directors who make films which display, with utter confidence, a belief in how clever they are, a belief which a) I don't necessarily share and b) irritates me intensely with its arrogant disregard of me as an audience member.Finally, this film has no idea - and doesn't care - who its audience is. In many ways it is clearly pitched at adults, but then it is tweaked downwards for tinies: the script contains a number of instances where the word 'cuss' is substituted for the F-bomb, for instance.",5,10,22,4 November 2009
Speed," Terrific
","In Speed, everything comes together. The concept is simple - revenge-bent nutcase rigs a bus so that it will blow up if the Speed drops below 50mph. A gung-ho cop and ditzy everywoman are tasked with keeping the bus going, and its passengers alive, until the traps and precautions placed by the nutjob can be circumvented. In its own way it's a bit like a Road Runner cartoon in the way that many variations on the theme are introduced, played out, and then moved on from.This was Sandra Bullock's second breakout film (after Demolition Man), and she and Keanu Reeves handle the tension and action very well. Credit also to Dennis Hopper for another in his collection of nutjobs. We actually quite like this one, especially as he has a point.But, above all, this is non stop entertainment from start to finish.",Null,0,0,13 July 2011
Live Free or Die Hard," It all depends...
","See, I'm easily pleased. The old suspension of disbelief thing - I'll suspend mine at the drop of a hat. I'll go more than halfway to meet the filmmakers, they must love people like me.I enjoyed Die Hard 4.0. Quite a bit. Watched the UK DVD version with my wife, expanded to include more action and bad language.It's only afterwards that I started to think, 'Hang on a bit...' I guess there are some spoilery bits in what follows.You expect some action sequences which step gingerly over the line of plausibility - the lift shaft in DH1, the 747 wing fight in DH2, the cable slide, outracing the flood etc. in DH3. So I could deal with launching a police car at a helicopter (although I, too, wondered whey none of the cars in the tunnel put their lights on - no Volvos?). But outracing the collapsing overpass in the articulated lorry, and dancing about on the Harrier, took such flying leaps over that line of implausibility that my wife and I sat there howling with laughter.And I've got to say, I don't need swathes of foul language in order to enjoy a film. It doesn't upset or offend me especially, I just find it irritating that filmmakers think it's necessary when it isn't.Good bits - I really liked Justin Long. Played nicely away from his customary nerd persona, had some edge, hit a note of credibility throughout. Good job. The attack on Justin Long's apartment was a good sequence. I liked the young Miss McClane, too, and I could envisage a Die Hard spin off franchise with these two in it. I thought the cyberplot was credible (and I recall the traffic chaos taking place in Turin in the original Italian Job many years ago, so I was quite prepared to believe that) although I too would have liked to know what the end purpose was - that kind of got overlooked. And I liked Maggie Q - I thought her fight scenes were very good, and she had an element of hard-faced relentlessness to her which was a strong plus.Not-so-good bits? Maybe the character Willis played in Unbreakable was John McClane in disguise - you can bruise him, cut him, make his vest dirty, but you can't kill him. This is OK up to a point, but there were some ordeals he went through which were so outrageous that they didn't convince. And when he fired that shot - through his collarbone, it appeared to me - which then killed Timothy Olyphant, I was a little surprised to find him up and quipping about 10 minutes later.Why did the gas in the gaspipes explode? I can understand Timothy Olyphant killing the hackers who'd freelanced the work which hacked into the national infrastructure - stops the powers that be tracing him - but why did he kill the ones who were still working for him? Lots of plot holes which needed filling.So it's a romp if you're not terribly demanding, but it shortchanges you fairly comprehensively if you're at all inclined towards being critical.",6,5,8,9 November 2007
X2: X-Men United," First rate
","Bryan Singer follows up the somewhat exploratory X-Men with a sequel which goes forwards with further developments in the 3-way conflict between humans, mutants, and militant mutants. He also goes backwards in tracing part of Wolverine's back story. Plus he introduces more characters to the ensemble and raises the stakes (both narrative and cinematically) by an appreciable percentage.Once more he orchestrates his ensemble masterfully. Everything which made the original film successful is here again, only there is more of it - but Singer never goes into overkill.The main unexpected joy of this film - to this ageing fanboy, at any rate - was how exactly right they got Nightcrawler. Alan Cumming was perfect casting, the makeup works perfectly, the opening sequence shows perfectly how Nightcrawler's action in the comics translates into 'real life', and they found the perfect sound for 'Bamf!' More huge fun.",9,0,1,23 March 2011
Thor: The Dark World," Huge fun, by Odin's Beard!
","All is going well in Asgard: Loki is imprisoned after the New York incident, and Thor has restored order to the 9 Realms. Odin's favoured son is in his Dad's good books. But no-one has reckoned on Dark Elf lord Malekith coming out of hiding with secret weapon Aethir. To add complication, the Aethir takes up residence in Jane Foster. And Thor is definitely NOT in her good books - 'Why didn't you at least phone?' The second solo outing for Marvel's God of Thunder is very much its own beast, although seeing the first movie and the Avengers will help. And the good news is that it is very entertaining. At times it felt like a Star Wars movie - a good one. The supporting cast all return (Fandral is re-cast) and much more of the movie, especially action sequences, take place in Asgard. There are some punch-the-air moments, some humour, some emotion, and certain of the relationships are developed nicely. Not everything goes as you would expect. Watch out for... no, no spoilers! I loved this.",Null,12,25,1 November 2013
Lucy," Flawed but fun
","Lucy has an experimental drug surgically inserted into her abdomen (against her will) by an oriental gang which wants to use her as a drugs mule. The bag leaks its contents into her which stimulates changes whereby she can increase the capacity of her brain to 100% from the 10% which is the normal maximum from humans. This gives her increasing control over her own body, other people, matter, energy and all sorts. But a clock is ticking, and the drug lord wants revenge...This is essentially a superhero origin movie, in which Scarlett Johansson plays a character who goes through some serious changes, giving her a wide range to play (which she does very well). There is some fun action, sprinkled with decent effects, and enough storyline to hold your interest until the end.There are also some major flaws, and these may be dealbreakers. They include, but are not limited to: The 10% of our brains thing. One, it isn't true and, two, the way it is presented in the film makes it clear it isn't true, and the fact that such nonsense is delivered in expository chunks by 'foremost world expert' Morgan Freeman to a symposium makes this even more laughable. Freeman is there because his 'elder statesman' persona adds gravitas and, therefore, spurious credibility, as does the symposium setting, but it is all too obvious that this element is there to provide the audience with a) an information dump for the rules the plot is playing by, and b) a ticking clock.Lucy's changes give her control over her body. We are told this, and we see her doing it. So how come the changes will kill her? Given that she has control of her body on a molecular level, why can't she modify the apparently fatal changes? Given how ready she is to kill the gangsters who got her into this, why does she spare the gang boss, thus giving him the opportunity to come after her later on? How come her abilities don't enable her to take action near the end, thus saving many lives?Having mentioned the flaws, I have to go on to say that I enjoyed the film, I loved Johansson's performance, and I was greatly taken with an audacious, unexpected, but fitting ending.",7,3,10,29 August 2014
Amélie," Charmant
","The only reason Amelie misses out on a 10 is that it is a tad over long.It demonstrates a deadpan sense of humour which one has never previously suspected the French as having, and a delightfully convoluted structure which involves a multitude of disparate details, all apparently independent of each other, which swirl delightfully together as the film finally disappears down the plughole.The whole thing is deeply improbable, of course, but that itself is part of the set-up - the lugubrious voice-over informs us throughout of things as they happen, and coincidence is an essential part of Amelie's synchronicity. Either you like this sort of whimsy or you don't, and I loved it.Audrey Tautou, sporting probably the worst haircut in the history of cinema, is so utterly adorable that you could simply melt. Also, she does some of the best knowing looks to camera ever seen (Mike Myers, watch and learn - mugging is not necessary). Among these is the moment when she is being made love to early on, and she is trying not to laugh. Wonderful! A fairy tale for grownups who haven't grown up.",9,1,6,2 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Well, it worked for me
","It is over 30 years (or the galactic equivalent) since the evil Empire was overturned and democracy returned to the galaxy (it's still a long, long time ago, though). A New Order has arisen from the ashes of the Empire and a planet-scale Death Star has been constructed. Luke Skywalker has not been seen for years after his Jedi apprentice turned to the dark side of the Force, adopting the masked identity of Kylo Ren. When a conscience-stricken stormtrooper deserts, and then joins up with a strangely skilled girl from nowhere and a droid with hidden secrets, we are in territory which is both unknown and yet strangely familiar.30 years after the original Star Wars trilogy, we return to a galaxy where real time has passed while we were away. Time shows that those first three films were, perhaps, not quite as wonderful as we thought they were at the time, although they still hold magic, and are noticeably better than the effects-laden but dry, dusty and heartless prequels which Lucas turned out later. And now, in the hands of Disney, JJ Abrams helms a true sequel. But is it any good? It benefits enormously by having the Gang Of Three back, and particularly Harrison Ford who gives us a Han Solo who is still a reluctant hero, with many more miles on the clock, and some relevant backstory. Significant things have happened to these characters in the intervening period: they are not as we left them. This aspect of episode VII gives the story a great deal of heart: there are some genuinely emotional moments here, maybe even more effectively handled than in the original movies.But, despite the fact that Ford, in particular, makes a major contribution to the many action sequences, this film is about passing the baton, and this is something which is gracefully done. John Boyega as newly named Finn, Daisy Ridley as plucky and feisty Rey, and Adam Driver as would-be Vader Kylo Ren all rise to the challenge well, and I have complete confidence that they will be safe hands for the future of the franchise.It isn't flawless: the synopsis in my first paragraph above shows that much of what we see will be very familiar to those who have followed this saga over the years, and a fair criticism is that it sticks too closely to templates used in episodes IV and VI.After years of jealously guarding Star Wars, George Lucas has said that he was looking forward to seeing a Star Wars film on the same basis as any other audience member: I can't help feeling that he will be pleased at what he sees, because I was.",10,18,65,18 December 2015
RED," Hugely enjoyable action adventure comedy
","RED stands for Retired Extremely Dangerous. Retired CIA operative Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is so bored in retirement that he tears up his pension cheques just so that he has a reason to telephone pension clerk Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). He is therefore a little put out when she reacts to his unheralded arrival in her apartment by screaming and objecting to a) being kidnapped and b) his lack of hair. To be fair, his reason for abducting her is because she is in danger from the same people who have destroyed his house while failing to assassinate him. What follows involves Moses recruiting fellow wrinklies Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) to find out what is going on, while Sarah (who, we already know, has a yearning for travel and adventure) gradually starts to enjoy the excitement.This movie is a romp, and makes no pretense to be anything else. All the cast appear to be having the time of their lives, and Parker makes a much better fist of it as the everywoman sucked into action/adventure hi-jinks than Katherine Heigl and Cameron Diaz managed earlier in the year. Malkovich, in lowbrow mode, is very funny as someone who is excessively squirrelly due to having been force fed far too much LSD.RED is based on a comic written by Warren Ellis and, like Ellis' comic work, it remembers that it is supposed to be fun. It isn't deep, it isn't important, but it flows fast, the action sequences are well staged, the cast are seasoned pros and they deliver, and it is often quite funny. I sat and watched it with a broad smile on my face most of the time.My only quibble is that, while I'm not an expert on the geography of the USA, it seemed to me that people were travelling vast distances overland in very short periods of time without using air flight. But maybe I was missing something.",8,0,0,29 October 2010
Flight," Flawed, with an excellent central performance
","Denzel Washington plays Whip Whitaker, a pilot who pulls off an amazing bit of flying , saving 96 lives out of 102 on board when mechanical failure puts his plane into a dive. Unfortunately, Whip is an alcoholic and substance abuser, and was flying while loaded. What effect will this have on the enquiry into the crash? You will have gained this much from the trailer (if you've seen it). What you won't have picked up is that, after the stunningly realised crash sequence which takes up the first half hour of this film, the rest of it is more or less taken up with Whip wrestling with his demons. Washington is very good, but we never get to know Whip (which is reflected in the final sequence) - we only get to know the Whip who is being piloted by alcohol.So I have a number of criticisms, but I'll stick with the two big ones. The first is that the script is a bit of a shambles. A number of the characters are there specifically to serve particular purposes (John Goodman's drug dealer is the embodiment of the evil done to Whip by drink and drugs, as symbolised heavy-handedly by Sympathy For The Devil on the soundtrack when he first appears, Kelly Reilly's sympathetic heroin addict provides both a reflection of Whip's possible redemption as well as a sounding board for this otherwise solitary character etc.), so there is a degree of obviousness, and certain elements are raised (the religious motif), referenced, and then not taken anywhere.The second is that the trailer solidly sells this as an interplay between the crash and the effect Whip's condition may have had on it. And this issue (what would have happened had Whip not been high? Would the 6 who died have lived? Or would all have died?), though unanswerable, is never considered. To me, it is the question posed by the trailer and would, perhaps, have made a more rewarding 90 minutes viewing than Whip's denial of his alcoholism. The climax and what follows are, if a little glib, satisfyingly dealt with in a film which tries hard but, ultimately, fails to achieve its potential.Honourable mention must go to Nadine Velasquez whose contribution to the first two or three minutes is quite spectacular.",7,1,2,8 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Excellent with a slight fumble
","It's not fair to do a book-to-film comparison: the differences between the two media mean that there must be differences. And let me say that this eighth film is a worthy finale to the saga, in terms of action, emotion, performance and epic visual quality. In particular, Alan Rickman is simply - excuse the expression - spellbinding.Nonetheless, much as I enjoyed the movie - and I did! - there was one area where I felt the film dropped a ball which the book ran with, and that was the matter of Harry's discovery that Voldemort's death was conditional upon his own. When I read the final book, I found myself within 20 pages of the end, totally unsure of whether Harry would survive or not, and I thought this was a spectacular piece of storytelling. Here, that circumstance is discovered and, five minutes later, bingo! Problem solved.That aside, this final movie contains most of the payoffs we have waited for. Not without other flaws (read other reviews!) it is a hugely satisfying movie for fans of the series.",Null,0,1,15 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Stunning
","Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to its epic conclusion in fine style: Frodo and Sam enter Mordor while the Battle of the Pelennor Fields begins, largely as a feint to draw Sauron's army away to allow the Ringbearer clear passage to Mount Doom. Following the Ring meeting its fate, all story lines are brought to their resolutions in a half hour or so of winding down.Jackson's visualisation of what happens inside Mount Doom is faithful to, and improves upon, Tolkien's source - once again, Tolkien threw away one of his set pieces in less than a page. The one false note is Gollum's final expression - I would have expected agony rather than 'Blimey! That's a bit of a surprise!' There are at least five separate end-pieces - the Fellowship reunited, Aragorn's coronation, the return to the Shire, the Grey Havens, and Sam's return home (it is possible to argue at least a couple more). The film could have been ended on any of these, and there are those who argue that it should have been. But although the film could have ended there, the story could not, and credit to Jackson for adding a half hour capstone to a ten hour film in order to properly resolve all that should have been resolved.I feel this particularly strongly since this closing section contains two of my favourite moments. One is the moment in the tavern - the four Hobbits, traumatised by war, sit together in silence in stark contrast to the trivial carousing in the opposite bookend tavern scene in Fellowship. And the other is Frodo's final look back. If Elijah Wood never delivers another moment on screen as powerful as that one (and I'm sure he will), that is enough.A towering achievement in all respects.",10,3,6,28 April 2010
The Purge," Tolerable sci-fi suspense thriller
","It is the near future, and the USA has discovered that it can enjoy a near zero crime rate by means of having a once a year amnesty, when anyone can commit any crime, including murder, with no consequence. Over one night, from 7pm to 7am, sensible people batten down the hatches while danger roams the streets. While the poor, unable to afford security, suffer particularly badly, the Sandin family have done very well due to Dad James being very good at selling high-spec security systems. However, he didn't bank on daughter Zoey's boyfriend sneaking in just before the shutters came down, nor of son Charlie raising them to allow a fugitive from a murderous mob to escape within. And the mob want him back...This film - which seems to have caused enormous annoyance to those who find its basic premise unbelievable - falls clearly into 3 acts. Act 1 sets up the basic conceit of Purge Night and introduces cocky nouveau riche Dad James (Ethan Hawke), everywoman Mom Mary (Lena Headey) moody teenage daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and neurotic and sensitive son Charlie (Max Burkholder), as well as various neighbours. Act 2 kicks off purge night and deals with the immediate consequences of the two unwanted guests. This is also perhaps the most interesting sequence in that it poses the moral question of what should the family do? Provide shelter and protection for the mob's victim despite the risk to themselves if the mob can breach their security, or hand him over for slaughter? Act 3 is fairly routine action/adventure stuff involving fighting back against home invasion.If you find the basic conceit so unbelievable that it becomes a deal-breaker, then I quite understand, and it is very unlikely that I am going to change your mind: if so, I suggest that you do not see this film. Personally, I was happy to go along with it. I liked the moral dilemma in act 2, I liked the action shenanigans in act 3, I thoroughly enjoyed Rhys Wakefield's unsettling mob leader, I liked the fact that it didn't play out exactly as I expected, and the final sequence contained the most gratifying piece of physical violence since John Wayne laid out George Kennedy with a wooden ladle in The Sons Of Katie Elder (darn it, I'll go back to Wayne smacking Akins in the back of the neck with a shotgun in Rio Bravo).But on the other hand, there were a number of things which irritated me. One was expected follow-ups which never happened - was Charlie's hypochondria really only there so that he had a heart monitor for a later sequence? Couldn't better use have been made of Zoey's boyfriend? Likewise Charlie's remote control video thingie. Also, even if you accept the premise of the story without question, there was much that was unbelievable in what happened, foremost among which was leaving it until the last minute to put the shutters down. Come on, you'd have them down as soon as everyone was indoors, wouldn't you? You wouldn't sit there, have dinner and an argument, and then put them down at 6:59? I quite enjoyed this as I was watching it, but the more I think about it, the more I come to the conclusion that it's probably not as good as I thought it was last night! I'll still watch it when it pops up on TV, though.",7,0,6,5 June 2013
Munich," Powerful, affecting
","There are two obvious courses of action which come to mind when considering making a film based on the Munich terrorist slaughter and its aftermath. One is action thriller and the other is documentary.Spielberg charts a third course and delivers a thoughtful examination of the effect that carrying out a vendetta has on those who carry it out. Given the nature of the source event, one might expect Spielberg to take sides, but this film is very balanced: it shows but does not judge.All the cast are quite excellent, and they have a lot to do - as much of the film is spent sitting round the dinner table as actually engaged in retributive action, so there is ample opportunity for detailed character to be shown.One wonders if watching this film might actually have an effect on those engaged on both sides of those conflicts which have been going on for generations.",9,1,2,20 February 2009
Pitch Perfect," Undemanding comedy with music. Or musical with comedy.
","Would-be record producer Beca starts college at the behest of her father and gets drawn into a competitive all-girl a capella singing group.Anna Kendrick plays a likable if mildly conflicted young woman in this musical comedy. The musical sequences are nicely done, if somewhat improbable (the number of times groups drop into perfectly realised vocal arrangements ad lib strikes me as unlikely), the cast are all personable, and the humour is solid albeit occasionally drifting towards the unsavoury (which, admittedly, generates a couple of the biggest laughs). Rebel Wilson steals the show: she is very talented and comfortable with her size, but I wonder if her market (and therefore her career) is going to be rather limited unless she loses weight.My only real criticism concerns payoff. The situation as regards Beca's nemesis within the group is resolved satisfactorily, but the hostile oriental roommate thread is left dangling (so what was the point?) and obnoxious Bumper from the rival male group not only receives no comeuppance, he actually ends up rewarded, which was not what I wanted to happen at all.These minor quibbles aside, if you want a relatively clean and swear-free comedy with music, this one's for you.",8,3,6,28 December 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A good second episode
","Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark go on tour around The Districts following their victory in the 74th Hunger Games. It is clear that Katniss has become a symbol of hope to the downtrodden everywhere, so President Snow determines to stamp out hope by populating the 75th Hunger Games with previous victors (all of whom believed that winning meant that they were forever out of the running). Things do not go according to plan, for anyone...After thoroughly enjoying the first movie, I read the books and thoroughly enjoyed them. Despite being more Old Adult rather than Young Adult, and male rather than female, the post-apocalyptic dystopia trope is one I have enjoyed since I first started reading science fiction in 1960, and I greatly enjoyed the often unpleasant and non-heroic protagonist, a refreshing change. The film preserves much of this albeit some of the edges are, perhaps necessarily, softened. Jennifer Lawrence continues to do an excellent job of portraying this character.The film adapts the book quite well, introducing us to more of the behind the scenes intrigue, showing us more of this world and then dropping us into the preparation phase leading up to the Games themselves, so like the ones we have seen before and yet so different. There is much in this part of the story which is unexpected, particularly in character dynamics and relationships. There is more blood in the action sequences than was the case in the first film.I have two reservations. One, Josh Hutcherson joins Daniel Radcliffe as child actors who have matured into adults where, for heroic roles, their diminutive stature is distracting. And, two, Katniss has changed from being a very able archer to being Legolas or Hawkeye, capable of quickfire reloading with pinpoint accuracy which, sorry, I don't buy. And that element of unrealism taints the need to suspend disbelief elsewhere.",8,2,19,29 November 2013
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Keanu's finest hour in inspired comedy
","Poor old Keanu comes in for some stick, but Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure (or BATEA as I shall refer to it from here onwards) showed that he had a distinct propensity for understated exaggeration - that might sound like a contradiction in terms, but both Bill and Ted are very subtly pitched at a level just on the wrong side of accuracy.The idea is brilliant, and the time travelling misadventures of the empty-headed pair are inspired. The script is immensely strong (both story and dialogue - how often I see films full of resources and potential which fail dismally because they don't have a script worth a dime koff koff Sucker Punch). As well as the central conceit of the two slackers and their history project problem, there are some inspired elements arising from both the time travel conceit (Bill fooling himself with the fingers) and the time travelling guests (who can fail to be tickled by Napoleon in the water park or Beethoven delighting in the wonders of electronic instrumentation).Plus there is a moral, and George Carlin. Huge fun!",8,1,1,9 April 2011
The Matrix," Credit where it's due
","You've got to hand it (well, some of it) to The Matrix.The concept is great. That concept is translated into a decent screen adaptation. The film has a wholly original (and much copied) look to it. The action sequences are generally well choreographed, if a bit over-reliant on slow motion. The effects are simply brilliant and, in places, groundbreaking (there aren't many films which add something 100% new to the filmmaker's bag of tricks, but The Matrix is one of them). The principals mostly deliver excellent performances, and Keanu looks cool, as he is meant to.But there is a distinct element of The Emperor's New Clothes at work here. It's very evident in some of the fanboy gushing, and I suspect that the Emperor's tailors also believed that they had sewed a suit of clothes which was a lot more visible than it actually was. Apologies, I'm disappearing up my own metaphor here.I think The Matrix thinks it is very much cleverer than it actually is. There's no denying that it's a good yarn, told with a distinctive style and a great deal of panache, but that's all it is.

Godzilla," Pretty good, with faults
","There is an incident at the nuclear plant in Japan where they both work, and Joe's wife Elle dies. Joe spends the next 15 years labelled as a nutcase, pursuing the truth of what really happened. Then the same thing starts happening and Joe's son Ford, now grown, gets caught up in it.Let me start by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this. Loved it - no, but enjoyed - certainly. Because there is some terrific stuff here Bryan Cranston, as Joe, is simply wonderful, but won't get recognised because of the type of film this is. Elizabeth Olsen is also terrific, and these two actors give the film the beating heart it needs to avoid simply being a special effects extravaganza (because Aaron 'Kick-Ass' Taylor-Johnson, as Cranston's son and Olsen's husband, unfortunately, operates merely as a merely cookie-cutter hunk, and offers no emotional weight whatsoever). The effects themselves are terrific, and we finally get a Godzilla which looks like what the man in the rubber suit would look life if the creature he was portraying actually exists.And there are a number of things which are not so terrific. None is a deal-breaker, but all could have been better.One, the heart goes out of the film when the effects start. Having established characters who have an emotional stake in what happens, and made us care about them, we hardly see them once the destruction is under way.Two, Ken Watanabe has little to do except put on an expression which is halfway between awestruck and concerned.Three, Sally Hawkins - why was she in it, again? (I love Watanabe and Hawkins, by the way: they were wasted, though Juliet Binoche's cameo was classy).Four, are the US forces really so dumb that they keep using small arms fire against these critters?Five, are the US forces really so dumb that they keep sending fighter planes against critters that defend themselves by emitting EMPs?Six, we unfortunately know that collapsing buildings create vast dust clouds. Emulating these dust clouds accurately in a battle which decimates San Francisco, and staging the battle at night, means you don't see what happens clearly.Seven, the US battle strategy (as regards the bomb) makes little sense.As a friend of mine observes, though, this is pretty much one of the original Godzilla films but with bang-on special effects. As a result, it can be taken seriously (though not too seriously).The 3D conversion is poor.",8,4,9,16 May 2014
Shall We Dance," Charming
","Lawyer John has everything, but still feels somewhat discontented. On his train ride home he frequently sees a woman looking wistfully from the window of a dance studio and, on a whim, signs up for dance lessons. He keeps the lessons secret from his family: could this be because mysterious dance instructress Paulina holds some sort of promise for him? This rather gentle movie has a lot of dance sequences, some veiled romance with mild suspense over what might happen, quite a lot of humour, and decent performances. Richard Gere holds everything together well, Susan Sarandon as wife Beverly gives some feeling to what is essentially a functional part, and Jennifer Lopez does well as the emotionally conflicted Paulina, a rather awkward and angular character.I liked it: if I actually liked dance, I would have liked it much more.",7,0,0,13 July 2014
Looper," Breathtaking - literally
","It is the near future. Time travel has not yet been invented, but it will in a few years. Joe knows this because organised crime in the future no longer murders people because of difficulties disposing of the bodies: instead, it sends them back in time for people like Joe to kill and dispose of. Joe makes a good living doing this until, one day, the victim sent back is himself, and future Joe escapes. Present-day Joe is driven to find and kill future Joe (and thereby put his own life back on track) and future Joe is driven to find future crime boss The Rainmaker to prevent a future tragedy.I love science fiction, I'm a sucker for well constructed time travel stories, I like violent crime thrillers, and I very much like Bruce Willis (future Joe) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (present-day Joe). So this movie ticked a lot of my boxes before it started. And it continued to tick them all the way through: it is an intelligent science fiction action thriller with good performances all round - Willis is probably as good here as he ever has been, and Levitt does well in capturing Willis' speech patterns, aided by prosthetics, and hampered by deeply distracting eyebrows. Emily Blunt - not a favourite - is very good, and Pierce Gagnon gives an astonishing performance for a child his age. I suspect that not all of the plot stands up under close examination, but it definitely works well enough for me.And, a rarity, there is a moment in it which literally (and I do mean 'literally') took my breath away - I was so emotionally and intellectually shocked by it that I gasped and then could not breathe for moments. I'm sure not everyone will have that reaction, but I did, and that moment stayed with me as I left the cinema.Highly recommended for those with a leaning towards science fiction and crime thrillers.",9,4,12,4 October 2012
Life," Last Man Standing. Again.
","The 6 members of the International Space Station crew are tasked with catching an unmanned capsule bringing samples back from Mars. Among the samples is what appears to be a frozen single-cell organism. Should they unfreeze it and see if it's alive?Of course they should! And of course it's alive! What's more, it grows quickly, is highly resourceful, and is almost unkillable. Oh, and it's murderous.
Yes, folks, what we have here is Alien. A different critter, and a smaller, more claustrophobic setting, but the story is the same: Last Man Standing. This is a horror movie in a sci-fi setting.But it's a good one. The 6-strong cast, headed by Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson, are all very good as they get trimmed down. Of course, we usually expect to see the unknown cast members go first. But there is always a mystery to the order and manner of deaths, and who will survive to the end. And Life treats the audience well when playing the survival game.The International Space Station is very well realised. It is a convincing labyrinth of interconnected chambers. The cast swim around in zero gravity as well as if it was filmed on board. This is one of the most believable space settings I have seen in a film. The entire space setting is done as well as 2001 or, more recently, Gravity.It's not much of a monster to start with, just a single cell. But Calvin - named in an Earth-side vote - grows quickly. It ends up like a transparent rubber starfish thingie. It swims in the ISS weightlessness very quickly and efficiently. And it seems to have an innate ability to do the right thing to survive, which doesn't bode well for the crew.That would be telling, wouldn't it? And I'm not going to give it away. But let me say that there is a shot concentrating on two drops of blood which is a clear contender for hinting at the end. Aha, but is it a red herring?",7,0,1,14 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Hugely enjoyable, but hindsight reveals flaws
","I was 24 when I saw this when it first came out. I saw it on a really big screen, and it was the first film I had seen with sound so carefully constructed on a system which did justice to it. I couldn't believe the bass rumble when the Imperial destroyer appeared overhead chasing Leias' shuttle-craft, and the stereo 'whuzzh'ing of the light-sabres across the auditorium - wow! And I had been a big fan of the Lensman books in my teens, and this movie was quite obviously cut from the same cloth - this was the first time that space opera had appeared on the screen and been visually convincing. Even now I still taste that magic when I watch episode 4.Hindsight shows that the script wasn't that hot, and that the characters were fairly cardboard. But the movie is so full of great moments that I can forgive it most things.",8,1,1,14 February 2011
Footloose," I never saw the original, and this is what I thought of the remake - very enjoyable!
","I have not seen the original Footloose, so these comments are based solely on the 2011 iteration - no comparisons with Kevin Bacon's version.The story is a simple one - in small town Bomont, 5 high school seniors are killed in a car crash coming home from a dance. The town Council, prompted by Councilman and preacher - and father of the dead lad who was driving - Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) passes a batch of laws to protect their kids, including the outlawing of loud music and dancing in public. Into this town, three years later, comes Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) to live with his Aunt and Uncle following his mother's death. Knowing nothing of the laws he immediately falls foul of the local over-zealous police officer, and gets labelled as a bad influence. He joins in the youth underground music/dancing culture, gets very taken with the preacher's daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) and becomes the driving force behind a move to try to make the town's elders understand that the time has come for them to loosen their grip somewhat.This is essentially a feelgood musical comprising a number of musical/dance routines (given a strong leaning towards line dancing) hung on a light rebellious youth plot and, as such, it achieves what it sets out to do perfectly satisfactorily - the musical numbers are all enjoyably executed.There is an almost irrelevant subplot about Ariel's relationship with an abusive boyfriend, and there are some amusing goings on involving Ren's new best friend Willard (Miles Teller) and his inability to dance. Two songs from the original are brought in - Footloose and Let's Hear It For The Boy - and both are given affectionate framings. And it is interesting to have a film where almost all the dramatic tension is driven by Survivor's Guilt - this motivates Ren, Ariel, Preacher Moore, and the town's Councilmen. It is clear that this is a major factor in everything that happens: it is rightly touched upon and, equally rightly given the nature of the film, it is never laboured.The actors are a pleasure. Dennis Quaid who, of late, has delivered performance which are, to be as kind as possible, phoned in (yes, Pandorum, I'm talking about you. You too, Legion. And GI Joe), here shows us a man whose knee-jerk, grief-driven reaction to do the right thing, has blinded him to the wrong things which have resulted from it. Kenny Wormald (who bears a strong resemblance to English actor Jeremy Edwards) does a nice job of developing Ren from a slightly sullen youth dealing with his own grief to an independent minded young man with many good qualities. Miles Teller is amusing, and the chemistry between the cast, especially the younger members (who can all dance, it goes without saying) is excellent.But the standout here is Julianne Hough. She can dance, she is achingly beautiful as well as eye-wateringly sexy, and she can act too. She has a couple of moments which merit comment, one involving an argument with her father and the other a brief moment when it is heart-stoppingly clear that, in her case, Survivor's Guilt has damaged her more than anyone realised. And, at the risk of showing myself up to be completely superficial, I must say that she jiggles nicely when she dances. She is going places, I hope.",Null,4,11,21 October 2011
50_50," Very good, but doesn't totally do it for me
","Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is 27 and has a comfortable life. A job he enjoys, a semi-live in girlfriend, an uncouth best friend, an overbearing mother and a father with Alzheimer's. And backache. When the backache turns out to be a fairly nasty cancer, things get turned somewhat upside down., and 50/50 (which, he discovers on the internet, are the survival prospects of someone with this type of cancer) tells of how he, and those around him, deal with the consequences of his diagnosis.Wrongly billed as 'the cancer comedy', 50/50 is a drama in which there is a lot of humour. The cancer is never treated lightly, but it is also clear that reactions to it, and how someone chooses to navigate their life after diagnosis, are important issues - how you live is perhaps more important than simply dealing with the illness. One of the strengths of this movie is that you do not know what is going to happen to Adam any more than he does, and you genuinely care about him.There are terrific performances in this film. Gordon-Levitt continues to build on his reputation for strong roles which are mostly outside the mainstream. Rogen plays yet another variation on his customary foul-mouthed oaf character, but manages to convey a touching and genuine love for his friend (even so, I can have enough slacker obscenity fairly quickly). Bryce Dallas Howard is good as Adam's girlfriend, trying to do the right thing but not very well, and Anna Kendrick is terrific as Adam's inexperienced counsellor. Anjelica Houston is pretty good as Mom, too.There were times when I was very moved by this film, and I was often amused, but I didn't laugh out loud at all - it isn't that sort of film, no matter what sort of press it has generated. I have read very strongly positive reviews: while it is undoubtedly a very good film, I wouldn't rate it has highly as others. Perhaps because I have been lucky enough never to have personally had a friend or family member touched by cancer, it may not reach me on as deep a personal level as it does some others: I don't know.It is nonetheless a thoughtful, human, and entertaining movie, and I recommend it.",8,1,2,2 December 2011
Deadpool," Vastly entertaining
","Wisecracking smart*rse Wade Wilson, ex-Special Forces, and currently engaged in small-time 'enforcement for pay', falls in love with hooker Vanessa, and her with him. Shortly after this idyllic state of affairs begins, Wade is diagnosed with terminal cancer. All is not lost, however, as he is offered a treatment which will not only cure his cancer but also kick-start his mutant gene, giving him superpowers. Wade opts in, not realising that the people doing this have nefarious intentions: he is cured and enhanced, but (not-very-)hideously scarred. How can he show his face to Vanessa before he has got villain Ajax to cure him? So, masked up and using the name Deadpool...Ryan Reynolds, having played Wilson/Deadpool in X-Men: Wolverine – Origins, has a second pass at the character, this time somewhat outside the control of the X-Men franchise (although this movie is firmly within the X-Men movie universe). And this time, they get the character right. They get everything else right, too, including the fact that Deadpool makes it very clear, directly to the audience, that he knows he is a character in a comic book movie.This film is very funny, from the opening credits onwards. It is also very violent, very foul-mouthed, and fairly rude. It is not a kids' super-hero movie – far from it. Wilson is not so much morally compromised, as completely amoral from head to toe: this is clear throughout, but made explicit by his response to a speech from Colossus which explains to him what makes a hero. There is bags of super-hero action, mostly very well staged although it sometimes goes so fast that it can be a bit difficult to follow (some of the slo-mo is therefore very welcome). I think non-comic fans will enjoy it but, for comic fans, it is full of gags drawn from comics, movies, and Reynolds' own super-hero screen career.It's not without flaws – how come his mutation/treatment heals everything except his face? – but it is hugely enjoyable, and completely vindicates Reynolds' lengthy efforts to get it made. I'm looking forward to the sequel, greenlit a couple of days ago, already.",9,7,20,12 February 2016
Get Him to the Greek," One in the eye for Daily Mail reader
","Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) works for a record company and is tasked with getting hard living but has-been rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand, playing the character first seen in Forgetting Sarah Marshall) from London to Los Angeles in time for a comeback concert, despite Snow's concentrated efforts to indulge in sex and drug fuelled rock'n'roll chaos instead.As a Daily Mail reader of mature years I hate Russell Brand, of course, and I deplore the vast amount of recreational drug use and the constant bad language in this movie, of course, and I have hated Jonah Hill ever since I first loathed the character he played in Superbad. So there was no way I was going to enjoy this movie. Of course. How could I? Thing is, this is a very funny movie. The humour ranges widely from character based, to verbal, to situational (and, yes, to unmentionable body parts, sexual matters and drugs) and is often laugh out loud funny. The mostly young audience I watched with laughed a lot, and so did I. Brand is a very talented man - he sings well, has an engaging screen presence, and knows how to use his face and body to excellent dramatic and comedic effect. I even warmed to Jonah Hill, playing a much more sympathetic character than usual. And Rose Byrne, usually so serious, was an absolute revelation, playing Snow's gorgeous (and more successful) ex, Jackie Q, with earthy and very funny gusto, and an occasionally dodgy gawd luv us cockerny accent.The music is quite good, too, being peppered with songs in the same vein as Snow's videos in Sarah Marshall, ie. effective and enjoyable spoofs of their particular genres, with lyrics which are just overstated enough to be effective parodies of something which you would often think couldn't be parodied.I enjoyed this film a LOT more than I expected to.",8,0,3,24 June 2010
Cloud Atlas," Enjoyable, but requires effort
","I'll try to keep my synopsis simple. There are six stories, each taking place in a different era: 1. A trader in the 1800s becomes ill on a voyage home; 2. A young homosexual in the 1930s becomes amanuensis for an elderly composer; 3. A journalist in the 1970s investigates shady goings on involving a nuclear energy company; 4. A writer/literary agent in the present day encounters the results of financial imprudence; 5. A genetically engineered waitress in 2144 is liberated from servitude, but there are consequences; 6. A goatherd in a feudal-type village After The Fall is called on to help a visitor from a technologically advanced area. Each of these stories has one or more links to others: sometimes the link is an artefact of some sort, sometimes it is a family connection, sometimes it is thematic. As if to reinforce this, the same actors play the principal characters in each story.The stories are not told sequentially (ie. one after the other). They are told chronologically, however, and the cross cutting between them makes for some interesting choices: sometimes the cut is simply to maintain suspense, but sometimes it is to point up plot similarities, or thematic, or visual, or bridged by sound. I was very impressed with the editing; it was easy to follow the narrative of all six stories, and each of them had plenty of drama and interest (my favourites were the two in the future, though there was moderate audience laughter at the present day story).I have mixed feelings about the actors playing multiple parts. I can see why this choice was made (and the make up is superb throughout), but sometimes it is distracting trying to figure out who is playing what.I was very taken with Doona Bae, playing genetically engineered Sonmi - she conveyed enormous emotions in a performance which required her to appear almost totally unemotional.This film is going to require repeated viewing to get the most out of it, but that's fine: three hours zipped by before I knew it.",8,11,20,27 February 2013
300," |A stylistic triumph if a bit lacking elsewhere
","Let's think about the aspects of 300 other than what it looks like.It tells a true story, but twists some elements, omits others, adds fictional bits, and otherwise sacrifices veracity for cinematic effect. The story is not a complex one, by the way, but but it does have some emotional resonance.The script is serviceable but not great. Dialogue which works in a comic does not always work on screen. Having said that, there is dialogue included which has echoed down the ages, and there are some effective bits of dialogue.There are monsters added. They aren't necessary, but they are very cinematic.The cast do tolerably well, although the male members seem mostly to have been selected for athleticism rather than thespianism (those Greeks! I don't know...) It is very violent. Well, I guess that if you're watching a film where 300 men with sharp implements fight thousands of others, also with sharp implements, you have to expect a little violence.But what does it look like? There's the rub - this film is almost entirely about visual impact. A great deal of effort has been devoted to making 300 look quite unlike anything ever seen on the cinema screen. It is a stunning piece of work visually, although perhaps over-reliant on slow motion (and, particularly, intermittent transitions between slow motion and normal speed).If you can stomach the violence, then it is worth seeing simply for how wonderful it looks.",7,0,1,26 September 2010
Kingsman: The Secret Service," It's James effin Bond, innit?
","Eggsy gets to train as a secret agent for the same ultra-top secret organisation which his father once worked for.This is James Bond at boot camp, featuring Colin Firth as Eggsy's mentor, Samuel L Jackson as the villain, Mark Strong as the training sergeant, Michael Caine as head of the organisation, and newcomer Taron Egerton plays Eggsy. Now let's take on board that it is directed by Matthew Vaughan, co-written with Jane Goldman, and based on a comic by Mark Millar, and we should be prepared for it to be original, full of (often outrageous) action, stupefyingly violent, overflowing with profanity, very funny, and vastly entertaining. Think Roger Moore-era Bond crossed with Kick-Ass and Wanted.Millar doesn't come across as likable when I see him interviewed but, by heavens, the films based on his stuff are entertaining. For me, everything in this film works – the performances are all terrific, the action is great and often laugh out loud (it manages to be both funny and credibly visceral – think the birdman at the start of Kick-Ass or the computer keyboard in Wanted). I could have done without quite so many F-words, but oh well.Recommended if you enjoyed Wanted or Kick-Ass.",9,4,15,30 January 2015
Tarzan," Yes with some no
","It's unusual for a Disney animated feature to be anything other than successful, and Tarzan doesn't buck the trend. It is a solidly entertaining animated feature. Which is not to say that it's perfect.I didn't care for the songs. Disney songs are usually notable for two things: one, they are memorable and, two, they move the story along. Well, perhaps these songs will become more memorable on repeat viewings, but I didn't feel that they moved the story along particularly well. Worse, they seemed horribly familiar, at least a couple seeming to have been bodily lifted, with only minor musical tweaks, from The Lion King. Oh well, perhaps it's just that I don't care for Phil Collns' voice serenading me in a Disney movie.The movie picks up on more of the Burroughs original than most movies before it, but it soft pedals Kerchak. This isn't entirely surprising, and is a reasonable editorial decision. I'd still like to see the original, though.As well as swinging through the jungle using vines, Tarzan has taken to ''surfing' down moss-covered tree trunks and branches. Well, OK, I suppose. But the production people have come up with some fancy footwork along intertwined branches which supposedly emulates skateboarders skating between obstacles. They are so inordinately proud of this manoeuvre that it appears everywhere - in the movie, in the trailers, in every documentary on the special features DVD. I've got news for you, guys - it looks stupid.And I could do without the comedy sidekicks a retread of Timon and Pumbaa.The story is a serviceable simplification of the original, the voice talent is great (particularly Minnie Driver), and the jungle backgrounds are exquisitely animated - the film is handsome.Maybe I'm just getting picky in my old age!",7,4,7,27 July 2009
The Hangover Part III," Catch the coda of this generally unsatisfactory comedy
","Back in the States after the events of Part II, the friends try to take Alan off to some sort of treatment centre, but get sidetracked by crime boss Marshall who holds them responsible for Mr Chow relieving him of millions of dollars in gold bullion. With Doug held hostage and threatened with imminent death, Phil, Stu and Alan have 3 days to try to find Mr Chow and recover the gold.As with its predecessors, Part III is built around hugely improbable events which trail along in the wake of the path through life taken by the hugely unbelievable child/man Alan (Zack Galifianiakis), and this is both the the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the series. In the first film, the character was funny and what happened was funny. In Part II, less so. Part III is actually quite dark and, while there are some laughs, mostly this could have been filmed as a straight crime drama. Alan was never credible, but by this point he has started to become tiresome and, with a relative absence of laughs (and several fairly cold on-screen killings), this works against the film. I'm sure this won't affect its box office.It does at least bring the series to a satisfactory conclusion, and I hope they will resist the temptation to roll out part 4. Do hang on past the first section of credits, and make sure you catch the coda which is by far the funniest part of the film - I thought 'Now THIS is what I wanted to see!'.",Null,5,13,24 May 2013
Easy A," Witty and thoughtful
","Nice girl Olive (Emma Stone) tells a friend untruthfully that she lost her virginity, she is overheard, and the next thing is it's all over school and her reputation is in tatters. At first, this appears to be a good thing, but then things get complicated.Superficially a teen romcom, Easy A is actually a very impressive piece of work. Drawing on Nathanial Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (in more ways than several), it is fairly serious underneath. But, on all levels, it is sharp, witty, and often very funny - it is a pleasure to encounter a film which pretends to be superficial and trivial, but which is as well written as this.All the performances are very good, but Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Olive's parents are very funny, and it is now clear that Emma Stone has what it takes to hold a movie together - again, she delivers an intelligent and sexy performance.I really enjoyed this film",9,1,2,4 November 2010
Fast Five," Fifth is good
","One normally expects the law of diminishing returns to set in with sequels. But Fast Five is fine.Diesel, Walker & Co are in Rio looking for a big score, with Dwayne Johnson's crack team looking to bring them back to answer for various crimes (the fact that these guys have no jurisdiction in Rio is mentioned, but otherwise overlooked).There are a couple of excellent set pieces bookending some entertaining character stuff and plot movement. And when I say 'excellent', what I mean is not very probable, but immensely entertaining, with brilliant stunt work interlaced with visual effects so well that you can't tell which is which.I thoroughly enjoyed this.",8,9,16,21 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," What a surprise after two dull movies
","I went into the third Twilight movie on the assumption that it was half a fingernail - you know, ripping off half a fingernail isn't much fun but, having got to that point, you might as well rip the other half off. You know from bitter experience you aren't going to enjoy it, but at least it finishes things off. The first movie told how sulky Bella got together with stylish vampire Edward, and the second one told how werewolf Jacob became a second contender for the underwhelming affections of this depressing teenager. So in I went, all ready to start tearing the second half of the fingernail off.D'you know, I enjoyed it. It has a lot of action and a strong sense of developing threat and dread, and several flashback sequences showing how members of the Cullen family became vampires in the first place. All this stuff was well done and very entertaining, and comprised a large part of the movie (compare this with the first two movies which were downright dull). The only time the movie flagged was when it spent time with drippy Bella and her besotted rival paramours.What else did I get from Eclipse? Apparently native American werewolves are several times bigger than the humans who turn into them. And apparently vampires are made of wood (at least that's what it looks like when bits get knocked off them. Plus they burn really well). And it turns out that the Volturi (aka Vampire High Command) are needlessly sadistic and unpleasant (plus, from Twilight 2, they are stupid enough to have their headquarters in a town which holds an annual anti-vampire festival), so my money is on a showdown between the Volturi and the Cullen clan in the final chapter, especially as Bella's nemesis Victoria is now cinders.I no longer blame Kristen Stewart for Bella - it is hardly her fault that she is lumbered with performing one of the worst conceived and written characters in the history of Gothic romance.So my verdict is: unexpectedly enjoyable.",7,2,8,15 July 2010
Pineapple Express," Not perfect, but funny
","Pineapple Express combines genres - it is a mix of stoner comedy, knockabout farce, buddy movie, and crime thriller. The crime thriller element provides the plot on which everything else is hung and, it has to be said, is probably the element which sits least easily with the others - for instance, after the intermediary dope supplier has amusingly betrayed the two hapless protagonists to the bad guys, they shoot him, and suddenly funny doesn't seem quite so funny any more. Having said that, genuine jeopardy is a valuable engine for driving the story.I didn't care for Seth Rogen very much before seeing this movie. My attitude has softened, but not by very much. His character here simply isn't very likable, and most of his performance is delivered in hysterical shouting. By contrast, James Franco (who also does his fair share of shouting) comes across as a much sweeter, if befuddled, character. In fact, by far the best thing about this movie (if one discounts Amber Heard's not inconsiderable decorative value) is the buddy aspect, and the way the friendship between this pair of losers develops and comes to be recognised by both of them as something which is of such value that it transcends the horrible situation they find themselves in.My knowledge of marijuana culture is limited, so a number of the stoner gags were lost on me (though not on the row of young men sitting just in front of me, who laughed uproariously at points which left me puzzled). And there is a lot of stoner stuff, particularly in the first half hour. But there are a lot of other funny lines too (not least from the parents of Amber Heard's character), some very funny physical stuff and, at the heart of the movie, an engaging relationship between the two main characters. The mixing of genres may not be 100% successful, but it works well enough to make watching the movie worthwhile.It is probably redundant to mention that the use of our old friend the F-word is almost incessant.",7,0,3,17 September 2008
John Wick: Chapter 2," Poor
","Keanu Reeves' John Wick returns in a sequel which delivers - exactly - more of the same.By which I mean it delivers non-stop action in which Keanu headshots over 100 anonymous opposition items in gouts of CGI blood. As soon as he has despatched a pair, another pair emerge from the walls, exactly like video game slaughter-fodder. There is no emotional heft to this, he might as well be knocking skittles down.There is some fisticuffs too, on broadly the same basis.Good points: Ian McShane, offing the baddie, and the mute bodyguard.Bad points: the utter absence of any emotional or moral consequences for the wholesale slaughter, the waste of Laurence Fishburne, and the discovery that 50% of the population of New York is made up of hit men.I enjoyed the first one: I thought this was empty piffle.",3,25,59,28 February 2017
Annihilation," Visuals triumph over story
","Lena is a geneticist whose husband reappears after going missing on a mission a year ago. All is not well with him. Lena and 4 other women follow in his footsteps into a phenomenon called the Shimmer (from which he is the only person to have re-emerged in its 3-year existence), something which is growing from the site of a meteorite hit. Strange things happen.Natalie Portman is Lena in Alex Garland's follow-up to Ex Machina, a cerebral sci-fi mystery. There is good and bad here. The good is mostly visual: there is fantastic use of locations and effects, and terrific cinematography.The bad is that the story seems to think it has great depth, but I couldn't see any. It seems to think it's pretty brainy, but I thought not. It contains things like flashback sequences which ought to be reflected in what's going on presently but, if so, I couldn't see how. In short, I found it a straightforward story which went on far too long, and with an incredibly jumbled conclusion.I was impressed with the look, and some intense emotion in the first 5 minutes, following which it dragged.",5,2,5,25 April 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Almost elegiac
","I could never get on with Anne Rice's novels, but I quite enjoyed this film adaptation. It takes a leisurely approach towards relating the events of Louis (Brad Pitt)'s life (or, rather, un-life) from the time he is vampirised in 1800s Lousiana to the present day, as related to scribe Christian Bale.Central to this is Lestat (Tom Cruise) the louche vampire who sets Louis on his path, and pops up from time to time over the years. Tom Cruise's casting, so far out of type, was a sensation at the time, but he is very good. However, he is not the only one - Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea and, especially, 11 year old Kirsten Dunst in her breakthrough role are all excellent, too.There is sufficient horror for horror fans, but this is essentially a character piece. The plot is a straightforward linear narrative, simply recounting the episodes in Louis' life. The film is handsomely mounted with some well-staged set pieces but comes perilously close to outstaying its welcome - perhaps it is slightly more leisurely than it needs to be.",7,0,0,24 February 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Pretty darn good
","I never really cared for the sequences with the Falcon parked on the asteroid (and all the faffing about with the faulty hyperspace drive stopped being funny fairly early on), nor with much of the Dagobah stuff.In fact, although I love all of the Star Wars films, this is probably my least favourite of the original trilogy. But I like the fact that it starts with the established characters even more established - the relationships from the first movie are now solidly in place (although Han and Luke jockeying for position over Leia becomes slightly uneasy in view of what is now the pre-knowledge that they are siblings).The Hoth sequence is great (and it has my late friend Michael in it), and the carbonite chamber and fight between Luke and Vader are fabulous, notwithstanding the bunny teeth which Luke develops when Darth Vader delivers the message which, of course, will no longer be such a knockout punch to audiences who have seen episodes 1 to 4 before this one.",8,1,2,14 February 2011
Minions," A delight
","The little yellow fellows who assist Despicable Me's Gru have, over the centuries, always sought to help the biggest, baddest Boss around. And so, in the 1960s, Stuart, Kevin and Bob, seeking out a new Boss, end up working for villaness Scarlet Overkill as she seeks to usurp the British throne for herself.The Minions find themselves in their own well-deserved feature, and it's a hoot. The story concentrates on just 3 of the Minions – a smart move, since we get to know them personally – although the full crew do turn up when necessary. Scarlet Overkill is a very good baddie, and the various scenarios are all colourfully realised (London is great, if geographically inaccurate). It is daft, and great fun.For Beatles fans it is worth mentioning that there is a lovely Beatles-related gag in it. And, while the voice talent is all excellent, it is worth singling out Pierre Coffin, whose voice characterisations in the Minions' almost-language is a huge part of their charm.The 3D is good in places, but mostly forgettable.",8,18,34,16 July 2015
Aladdin," Magic - literally - but....
","The third out of the box in Disney's animated Renaissance, after a Mermaid and a Beauty, was Aladdin.This is a terrific adaptation, full of excitement and magic and colour and movement and characterisation and music and story, all the stuff that Disney, at its best, is so good at.And then...I'm going to throw bricks at two of the things which everyone praises.Tim Rice took over as lyricist following Howard Ashman's tragically early death, and the film is the poorer for it. Rice is not half the lyricist Ashman was, and I suspect that he doesn't bring nearly as much to the table in terms of theatricality, either. Rice's lyrics are functional and workmanlike - they do not have the panache and zing which Ashman brought to them.Robin Williams. I love Robin Williams in straight roles, in comedic roles, doing stand up, as a raconteur, but oh how I wish he had not been cast as the genie. It is when the genie arrives on the scene that this film stops being Aladdin and starts being the Robin Williams show. He simply overpowers it. It is a tour de force, certainly, but it is out of place in an ensemble piece, where the characters should be stronger than the individuals voicing them.For all of that, this is still a pretty good film.",Null,0,1,12 October 2011
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Best of the lot
","The mismatched menagerie is back for its third outing, still trying to return to the New York Zoo. On this occasion, pursuing the aeroplane which the penguins and monkeys have taken to Monte Carlo, they make the mistake of attracting the attention of rabid French animal cop Mme Dubois. In an attempt to escape her, they attach themselves to a travelling circus where, initially, they are not very welcome. Mme Dubois, however, has not given up...I never cared for the main characters in the first film: Ben Stiller's anxious lion and Chris Rock's hyper-intrusiveness irritated me, and David Schwimmer's giraffe revisited all the aspects of Ross's whiny personality which had grated on my nerves so severely. I found the second film an improvement, and I liked this one more still. The circus animals add some welcome variation, the story is fast paced, Dubois is a well-realised (and much-needed) villain, the character dynamics are good, and the whole thing is a visual feast with some dazzlingly realised action set-pieces.This movie brings the series to a satisfying end. I hope they resist the urge to add a further instalment to a series which come to a pleasing conclusion.The 3D is first rate, and adds immeasurably to some of the sequences.",8,0,1,29 October 2012
Sin City," Polarised opinion
","There are some movies where it is difficult to offer excessive praise or condemnation - one expects to see them gain average marks from IMDb critics. Then there are those which polarise opinions: viewers love the movie or hate it. Sin City is one of those: it is very difficult to feel indifferent to it, and it's as well to know that going in.If you're going to hate it, this will be because of the very high level of violence, brutality, and perceived misogyny. Well, if you're someone who fights shy of that sort of thing then I suggest steering clear of Sin City. It is violent and brutal.But the violence is stylised - as is everything in the film - simply because it has been sourced directly from the pages of Frank Miller's comics. You can read the comics along with the movie and hear every word you read, and see every frame converted to movement. As someone who loves the comics, I thought initially that this would be a good thing. And it is, but it's also a bad thing because the film holds no surprises - none, count 'em, zero - for anyone who is familiar with the books.For all that it is a striking, and largely successful, exercise in converting narrative from one medium to another.The cast is uniformly excellent.",10,3,5,18 March 2010
The Ugly Truth," Mucky, but has its moments
","In The Ugly Truth, Katherine Heigl plays Abby, a TV producer whose magazine programme is going down the tubes until, against her wishes, crude, crass Mike (Gerard Butler) is brought on board with his segment The Ugly Truth in which he examines relationships in a crude, sensationalist, oafish way. And ratings go up.Abby (established early on as a humourless control freak), having not been able to establish a relationship for ages, recruits Mike to advise her on how best to hook new neighbour doctor Colin, which he achieves for her. The only thing is that she and Mike.... well, you get the drift.The plot is pretty straightforward. The film, as seems to be the fashion these days, is sometimes fairly clinical in its examination of sexual matters (notwithstanding that the vibrating knickers sequence is pretty funny). Some serious issues are exposed even if conclusions aren't always reached. Gerard Butler does OK as Mike despite the fact that he has little apparent screen chemistry with Katherine Heigl.But Katherine Heigl is fantastic. She is a gifted comedy actress and a decent serious actress (she gets the opportunity to do both here). Plus she does demure and outrageously sexy at the same time. One hopes that her fabulous looks won't eclipse her undoubted skills.This is a decent romcom in the modern manner, suitable for the broad minded.",6,0,4,19 August 2009
Gangs of New York," Powerful and evocative
","Martin Scorsese's period piece, telling of street warfare between differing immigrant factions in the mid-19th century, is long, violent, and features some excellent performances, notably the always intense Daniel Day-Lewis as Butcher Bill (it was good to see Cameron Diaz playing in something completely unfrothy, but I felt that Leonardo DiCaprio was a little too lightweight as protagonist and the audience's eyes).More than anything, though, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and feel of this movie. It captured a sense of place and time really well. I obviously can't say how accurate it was, but I was more than happy to accept it completely as somewhere and somewhen with which I was completely unfamiliar, and a very real location for the events of this film.",8,0,1,24 July 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," An absolute hoot
","Two girls and three guys go off in a van to spend a weekend in a remote cabin in the woods. After an encounter with a sinister man at a filling station, they eventually arrive at the run down cabin, and start behaving in the ways in which young people in remote cabins are accustomed to behave. But what are those men in white coats up to? Drew Goddard's first movie as director (co-written with Joss Whedon) tells us, before we sit down to watch it, that it is playing with a sub-genre of the horror movie, and that it wants us to know this right from the start. And what follows is as playful as the title. We get our fair share of cabin in the woods shenanigans, but we get a heck of a lot else, too. And I'm not going to say anything about them, because this movie has surprises up its sleeve.It also has a very good script, with some laugh out loud moments. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.",9,4,19,14 April 2012
Spectre," Another great Craig Bond
","James Bond is involved in a mission which M knows nothing about. Given that the department is under threat from a new broom in Whitehall who is looking to merge the UK's information-gathering machinery with that of other countries, M suspends Bond. As if that would stop him! What follows is a dizzy mix of opposing factions, with unexpected support and treachery.When writing a review for a film which is barely out of the starting gate, but which is sure to have a massive audience, one has to take care to avoid spoilers. Well, everyone managed it for the big one in Skyfall, so I'm certainly not minded to blow any surprises here. And there are some, including faces we didn't expect to see, nods to the past, and even nods to Fleming's books.But this isn't really a film for big surprises. It's a film which has a strong story, and some terrific action – just watch the opening set piece, and realise how long the first shot takes and the amount and nature of the camera movement involved in it – stunning! The cast are all excellent. Craig has now officially overtaken Connery as the best Bond in my book, Ralph Fiennes sits comfortably in M's chair, and the support team are better used by far than they were in the days when Lee, Maxwell and Llewellyn turned up for a day's work each. Christoph Waltz is an entertaining baddie, Lea Seydoux has an air about her which means that you're never quite sure which side she's batting for, and only poor old Monica Bellucci gets the short end of the stick in a part which is somewhat underwritten, and definitely underused. And while the music features all the usual Bond cues, there are several places where it is wonderfully original for a Bond film.But, for me, there are two things which stand out. The first is that I really like the way the Craig Bond films have developed, and held to, an internal continuity – this film ties in with the previous three – as well as acknowledging a (necessarily fluid) continuity with earlier films. And the second is that, again, Sam Mendes has given us a Bond film which is not simply an action/adventure travelogue, he has given us a work of art, where every scene contains images which could be presented on the walls of an art gallery. Light, shade, colour, composition, all are used to fill the screen with a film which is a great pleasure to just look at.The title song, the arrangement of which uses all the clichés we have come to know and love is, in my view, hideous. I may be out of step here, but I think it is a strangulated mess.",9,14,38,28 October 2015
Braveheart," Epic, if inaccurate
","Provoked into resistance by the savage murder of his wife, William Wallace leads the Scots in a fight for independence from English oppression.Braveheart, Mel Gibson's finest hour, deserves its Oscars - it is a fine film, epic in scale, well acted, brilliantly directed, full of iconic sequences and moments.On the downside, it is violent, and Gibson's favourite dislike after the Jews, the English, are monsterised as subtext (see also The Patriot). This does not diminish Braveheart as a film, it just adds to one's knowledge.It doesn't help me like Gibson, although it gives me great cause to admire him as an actor and director.",8,0,3,10 August 2013
Joy," 5-star Lawrence in 3-star film
","Put-upon housewife and mother Joy tries to be everything to everyone – her eccentric mother, kids, grandmother, ex-husband, father, sister – and finds a possible exit route when she invents a self-squeezing mop. But this may just cause more problems than it solves.Based loosely on a real life situation, this domestic drama marks a third collaboration between writer/director David O. Rusell, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper (although Cooper's part is little more than a cameo) and the second involving Robert De Niro. It is a relatively slight piece, where Joy is the everywoman we root for while she is fighting the demands of her odd family and the complications brought about by trying to market and manufacture her invention. I never thought I would be that interested in the fortunes of a mop, but there were times when I definitely cared, and this is due entirely to another terrific performance from Jennifer Larence which, to be frank, is far better than the film merits. The other cast members aren't in the same class, although the fact that they are mostly playing fairly unsympathetic characters doesn't help them.I enjoyed the film and it held my attention throughout although, as well as the slightness, it sometimes tries to be a bit too clever for its own good (there are soap opera inserts throughout which fail to make the point they were intended to make, whatever it was), and throws away its satisfying resolution to Joy's jeopardy almost half-heartedly.",7,1,5,15 January 2016
Moon," Excellent thought-provoking sci-fi
","The field of non-pulp science fiction film is sufficiently small that any new film will call to mind its predecessors. When, as in Moon, it presents elements of a puzzle, the mind is immediately set to mining those predecessors for clues and possible answers.So, when we meet Sam Bell near the end of his 3-year contract in isolation on the far side of the moon, and quite possibly going stir crazy with only computer/robot Gerty for company, our thoughts immediately suggest that Sam is going crackers/being influenced by his environment a la Solaris, and/or Gerty has gone mad and is playing tricks on him a la 2001. As it happens, there is another explanation, and one which is much more credible.This film is an engrossing conundrum with a standout performance, both technically and dramatically, from Sam Rockwell, and is well worth watching.I have only two reservations: one, the film works on the apparent assumption that clones are brought to full adulthood in a minimal timeframe and, two, there is a clear implication that the clones have a limited 'shelf life', but this is never mentioned yet alone explored despite the fact that it looks as if it could usefully have been made into a major (and helpful) plot point.",8,2,8,15 December 2010
Happy Feet," Has a certain weird charm all its own
","Apparently, Emperor penguins select their mates via the medium of pop songs so, when young Mumble turns out to be tone deaf, he becomes an outcast. However he is also a dancing fool, and this not only ties him up with a group of latina Adelie penguins, it is also instrumental in repairing a break in the food chain (don't ask). If penguins singing pop songs and taking part in mass - and I do mean mass - dance routines is your thing, then you are going to love this one.I mean, it's barking mad, isn't it? But CGI features have given us equally barking mad stories of robot romance, and balloon powered houses, so I suppose dancing penguins night be regarded as only mildly eccentric by comparison.And, let's be fair, it is extremely well done - it looks fabulous, the music is all great, the voice talent does well (although Robin Williams is getting a bit too ubiquitous for my taste), the dancing is fun, and there;s a decent subtext about exclusion for simply being different.Sometimes we need something that's barking mad, especially if it has something worthwhile to say, and a sense of charm to say it with.",7,0,1,14 August 2010
Her," Overlong and boring
","Following his marriage breaking up, Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix) finds himself very taken with the artificial intelligence operating system in his computer update which adopts a female human personality named Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). He falls in love with her and she with him, and the film charts the ups and downs of their relationship.Self-aware AIs are an interesting fictional concept, and have not been overused, so this was a good idea. Unfortunately, the relationship between a man and a voice from a computer/mobile phone is inherently uncinematic, and the film lasts over two hours. So, if your idea of a good time is 120 minutes of close-ups of Joaquin Phoenix (with a bad moustache) going backwards and forwards between twittery schoolgirl mode and anguished betrayed lover mode (and all stops in between) while Scarlett Johansson talks dirty and is never seen, then this film is exactly what you have been waiting for. Me? Not so much.Johansson's voice work is excellent and Phoenix is good (as other the rest of the cast), but this story is not executed well at all. There are a couple of cringeworthy phone sex sequences, Twombley (one of the worst names ever coined for a romantic protagonist) is unsympathetic to start off with, no effort has been made to make the story cinematic, it is far too long, and it is boring.Not recommended.",6,0,2,21 February 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Excellent
","Slumdog Millionaire uses the deceptively simple device of telling young Jamal's life story from being a small child in the slums of Bombay in order to explain how come he knows the answers to the questions on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, leaving him one question short of the top prize. The answers/his story involve (among other things) the death of his mother, a short career as a beggar, the interaction with his less scrupulous brother over the years and, beyond everything, his ongoing search for Latika, the girl he befriended when they were small children.It is not a pretty story, but it is always gripping, always visually fascinating (and sometimes appalling) to these western eyes at any rate, sometimes very humorous, and very often sufficient to make you despair at the sheer unfairness at how life - and some very unpleasant people - treat Jamal and Latika.I've heard it described as a feelgood movie, and it's certainly not that but, if I can liken it to anything, I would liken it to The Shawshank Redemption in that it is a story about the ability of the individual to strive for something positive in the face of every obstacle life can throw in your path, and the soaring joy to the spirit when that elusive goal is finally achieved.The cast, most of whom are unknown to western viewers (Dev Patel, who plays Jamal, has had some TV exposure in the UK) are uniformly excellent, and the youngsters who play the 3 principals at two different stages of childhood deserve special mention.And India plays a huge part - the film is so immersive that, much of the time, it is like being there. The only things missing are the smell and the heat.This is an entertaining, enjoyable movie which has real substance to it. Highly recommended.",9,1,3,21 January 2009
The Nice Guys," Good film, too much UNNECESSARY profanity
","Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are paired in a crime thriller set in 1970s Los Angeles which contains more than its fair share of laughs.Private detective Holland March, engaged on a missing person case, is warned off when hired muscle Jackson Healy beats him up. The two are forced to join forces to search for Amelia, who has become involved in porn - sorry, make that 'experimental movies.'Shane (Iron Man 3) Black directs and co-writes this period crime thriller in which Ryan Gosling is March and a rather tubby Russell Crowe is Healy. A tolerable crime thriller plot engages the attention throughout, while this pair stumble their way through the search for Amelia. Neither is especially good at their job but fortunately (or, perhaps, unfortunately), March's 13-year old daughter Holly takes it upon herself to assist them from time to time.That's not all, though. If you've seen the trailer, you will know that, although this film has a serious plot, not everything about the delivery is straight-faced. The humour includes some funny dialogue and some great knockabout business and I was delighted to discover that Gosling, who I have previously found to be rather expressionlessly one-note in his previous work, has a definite flair for comedy. I chuckled often, and laughed out loud several times.Yet the jeopardy is quite real, and isn't played for laughs. There is always some genuine danger involved, which means you have an emotional investment in these two well-meaning but somewhat inept sleuths.The action is well-staged, the period feel is authentic (starting with the opening music, very Shaft-theme), Crowe and Gosling have an effective on-screen chemistry, and the cast are all good, especially Angourie Rice, who plays March's daughter Holly. She holds the screen whenever she's on it: keep your eye on her career, she's going places.If I was to criticise, I would say that there is relatively little substance here: the engaging performances and witty script elevate the film above its natural level. And the profanity in it doesn't always service the storytelling: there is much swearing which is here for no other reason than Because F*ck.But this is an entertaining movie with much in it to justify recommendation.",8,0,1,30 May 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Eye-catching but empty
","In Apocalypseland, Max Rokatansky finds himself strapped to the front of a vehicle forming part of a convoy crossing the desert in pursuit of a bus which has hijacked the harem of some feudal overlord-type in a mask whose name I didn't catch (in fact, I didn't catch any name apart from Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa). Max escapes and, after some disagreement, ends up helping the 'brides.' I was very excited about the original Mad Max, because I love post-apocalypse fiction. And the first film in the original series actually started by addressing the crumbling of civilisation, showing a bridge between familiarity and the new order. Hindsight shows that what creator/director George Miller really wanted to do was get, as soon as possible, to a place where Max is a lone proponent of traditional values in a world which appears to consist entirely of feral gangs, victims, and sand. Fair enough, but it's not post-Apocalypse, is it? It's an alternate reality. Fury Road is a continuation, not a reboot, in which an entire sub-civilisation has built up in a remarkably short period: Max, a cop before The Fall, is still a young man, but the feral youths here have their own mythology. And how come, in this bleak, arid world, has the petrol not all evaporated? How come people are happy to waste petrol and water, both of which have to be scarce resources? Max's world makes no sense within the context of its own origin: that's why the original series annoyed me, and this addition doesn't change that.In terms of eye candy, it's certainly spectacular: there are some phenomenal stunts, the effects work is good, and the desert locations are dramatic. But the story – an extended chase for two hours - is no more than a hook to hang the visuals on, the characters are mostly uninteresting and undeveloped (not that it matters, because this film isn't about character at all) and Max is uncharismatic because Tom Hardy doesn't get to give an idea of what sort of person he actually is.If you like the idea of spending time in the eye-catching interior of a biscuit tin and being violently shaken for a couple hours, then I suspect you're going to really enjoy this. As for me, it tickled my eyes, but I would have liked a bit of food for the brain, too. I have friends who rated it highly: I had hoped I would too, but I'm afraid I have to record overall disappointment. This is an empty, empty film, and I'm not in a hurry to see it again.",6,19,40,22 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," First rate true story
","Desmond Doss joins the US Army after Pearl Harbour, but refuses to touch guns. But he sees combat in Okinawa as a medic, and perhaps he isn't the coward his fellow recruits assumed he was.Mel Gibson directs this dramatisation of Desmond Doss' early life and army experiences, culminating in his experiences at Okinawa. These turn out to be utterly extraordinary, except that the real-life Doss and some of his contemporaries appear at the end of the film to drive home that this is actually all true.The first section of the film shows Doss' troubled home life (with a superb performance by Hugo Weaving as his war-torn disciplinarian father), followed by boot camp and the opprobrium he attracts as a conscientious objector, leading to a Court Martial, where salvation comes from an unexpected direction. Though lengthy, it always engages. Among the extensive supporting cast, I would single out a luminously lovely Teresa Palmer as Doss' love interest, and Vince Vaughan as boot camp Sergeant Howell, showing that he actually can act. But Andrew Garfield simply IS the gentle but steely Desmond Doss in a performance which blends gentleness and strength with religious conviction and a joy for life. Garfield has always been good, but here is a performance of genuine stature.The combat sequences which occupy the final third of the film show what a good director Gibson is, especially with action. They give a very strong impression - feeling, even - of what it must have been like to have death screaming down at you without any idea that it would ever abate. This section is often schockingly graphic: think Saving Private Ryan, only more so. And like, I guess, reality, the shock begins to wear off and all that's left is violence, weariness, and grief at the loss of friends.While being clearly anti-war, this is also done entertainingly well, a contradiction which concerns me somewhat. But before the 'war as entertainment' vs 'anti-war message' battle breaks into fisticuffs, Doss' achievements start to come to the fore, and mightily overpower everything else.Though strong in content and, perhaps, containing elements which mirror Gibson's own rocky road in recent years, this is an excellent and worthwhile film.",9,1,1,15 May 2018
Me Before You," A difficult subject handled well
","Who would have thought there were so many laughs in a tale of someone paralysed from the neck down? Emilia (Game Of Thrones) Clarke encounters Sam (Hunger Games) Claflin while involved with Matthew (Harry Potter) Lewis in a film which has nothing to do with any of those fantasy franchises!Lou is a tea shop waitress in a small rural English town. On losing her job she applies to become a carer for Will Traynor, paralysed in an accident. She doesn't realise what a moody unpleasant person he is, nor does she realise he is determined to commit assisted suicide at Dignitas in Switzerland. But as feelings start to grow between them, despite their intentions, could it be that Will might change his mind?To be frank, this isn't my sort of film, a feeling which was reinforced within the first 10 minutes as Lou turned out to be unbearably cute, endlessly compassionate towards the quirky old lady patrons of the cafe, possessed of an apparently massive wardrobe of unbelievably eccentric clothing and, to cap it all, convinced that all problems could be solved with a Nice Cup Of Tea. She was a character drawn from the Wacky And Loveable Young Thing box of clichés.And Sam Claflin's immobile moody young man was more credible, but no different in essence: Mr Rochester on wheels.But the two of them turned out to have decent chemistry, and the film turned out to have far more laughs than I expected, so I stuck with it. And I'm glad I did. It used humour to soften the edges of what, in many ways, was a very brutal story. Despite the late Christopher Reeve's sterling efforts in support of stem cell research, there is still currently no coming back from catastrophic spinal cord injuries, something which Lou does not initially realise, and something which lies at the heart of the once athletic Will's decision.Whether the burgeoning love between Will and Lou will be sufficient to overrule his decision is the dramatic focus of the story, and I would not want to spoiler the ending. But I will say that the circumstances and issues of quadriplegia and assisted suicide are presented unflinchingly, and without any moral judgement in either direction.This is an easier, more accessible film than Whose Life Is It Anyway?, the only other film I'm aware of which addresses this issue, but it doesn't draw conclusions any more easily than that film did.After being a bit queasily saccharine to start off with, Emilia Clarke settles in to the role, and both she and Claflin provide an effective emotional heart to the film: Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents are also touching. The main location (Pembroke Castle) is gorgeous, and Clarke's wardrobe is (deliberately) awful. There was only one wrong note: I felt mild annoyance at the Traynor family's wealth. The ability to load Will onto a private jet and fly off to the Caribbean added a glib tone which I would have preferred to have been absent. The very end of the film fell into this category, too.Overall, though, this addressed a difficult subject in an entertaining and credible way.",8,2,3,30 May 2018
Gladiator," Watch it a second time for the acting
","I recently watched Gladiator again.On my first watching I was pulled along by the exciting story, thrilling action sequences and fabulous visuals.This time I was able to appreciate the performances, particularly Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver Reed.Commodus is not a sympathetic character, but he is a complex one. Phoenix brings great depth to him. You never like him, but you understand him. Phoenix' work is remarkable.And Oliver Reed's performance reminds you of just how powerful he could be in the right part, how unfortunate it was that he was in so much rubbish, and what a loss his death was.",9,2,3,28 November 2009
Pocahontas," Agenda-driven fantasy with some lovely animation
","The British arrive in Virginia, under the leadership of gold-mad Ratcliffe. Captain John Smith meets Pocahontas, daughter of the local chief, and their budding romance may be instrumental in staving off hostilities - or perhaps it may make things worse.Disney's adaptation of the Pocahontas is a very loose adaptation indeed, and I don't just mean the comedy animal sidekicks or spirit-tree-Grandma. The story is greatly glamourised, not leasr in the character design of the beauty queen native American princess (who probably wasn't actually a princess). British leader Ratcliffe is clearly insane and all his men are sheep except Smith. The situation is clearly noble native Americans on the receiving end of violence and theft of land and resources from the vile British, which may explain why Mel Gibson was attracted to it. I'm sure there is some substance to this viewpoint, but this animated feature is very one-note.There is some lovel animation, and Alan Mencken's score is good, but the songs are rather lacklustre, even the much-feted Colors Of The Wind. This is one of the more disappointing entries from Disney's renaissance years.",7,0,0,21 May 2020
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," If you like Transformers....
","My son had a couple of Transformers when he was a kid. They intrigued me as toys: I liked the idea, I quite liked the TV series, and I greatly enjoyed the animated movie.When the first live action movie came along I was pleasantly surprised, particularly at the script being as snappy as it was. The second instalment was a bit 'Oh dear', however. I didn't find the story particularly engaging, and the action was terribly difficult to follow because all the Transformers looked the same.Number 3 is much better. Megan Fox is gone (her absence is due to her dumping poor old Sam, we are told), but Shia LaBoeuf, his mum and dad, John Turturro and a couple of the forgettable military people are back (as are Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving in the voice department), with several well-known faces who I was surprised and pleased to see, all of whom seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. And the new romantic interest, Rosie Thingie-Wotsit is OK, albeit I found her top lip hugely distracting.The story has more going for it, and it is pleasing to see Leonard Nimoy voicing Sentinel Prime (Nimoy voiced Galvatron in the animated Transformers movie back in 1986). Nimoy's presence gives rise to two pleasing moments in the film.The action - and there is a lot of it, the last 40-odd minutes is a non-stop action sequence - is much easier to follow than it was in the previous film. There are places where the 3D is absolutely spectacular, particularly in the first 10 minutes or so.This is a superior popcorn movie.",8,2,5,30 June 2011
The Social Network," Food for the brain
","I really enjoyed this film. It is something of a rarity, in that it is aimed at the part of the brain which involves thinking, not the parts which involve feeling, or enjoying eye candy, or visceral reactions etc.I have to approach it as if it was a work of fiction as I'm not able to assess the extent to which it uses dramatic licence in telling which is otherwise the true story behind the creation of Facebook.Two things drive it. One is the two legal actions deriving from the creation of Facebook together with the actual gestation (told simultaneously in flashback), and the other is the interactions between the main characters involved, principally Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), his partner Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), the predatory Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) and the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer). Both are presented masterfully by director David Fincher.If there is a weakness here, it is that (with the possible exception of Saverin) none of the characters are particularly sympathetic. But that doesn't matter too much because the story is sufficiently interesting to survive that. In particular, Timberlake delivers a character who is unpleasant and amoral, but nonetheless very three dimensional, and Eisenberg - previously a charter member of the self-deprecating loser fraternity - is simply phenomenal, playing a character whose interaction with others takes place almost exclusively on intellectual, not emotional terms. He is aware that there are such things as social niceties, it is just that he is completely unequipped to access them.And a quick word of praise for the special effects. What special effects, you may ask. Quite. In most of the scenes in which the Winklevoss twins appear, they are both played by Armie Hammer, and the inclusion of the actor twice in the same scene is absolutely flawless. And there are quite a few such scenes. Brilliant.",9,3,4,17 October 2010
Macbeth," Oddly unemotional retelling
","During Scottish civil wars, nobleman Macbeth and his friend Banquo receive prophecies from witches: they tell Macbeth he will become King. Macbeth's wife pressures him into making this prophecy come true by murdering King Duncan. He does so, but the assassination causes him more problems.Shakespeare's tragedy of predestination has been filmed many times before and, here, stars Michael Fassbender as Macbeth and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. I was expecting great things from a film of a play I know well and love. And I got some great things, principally the look of the film which is truly bleak. I loved some of the visuals presented here.But I wasn't terribly impressed with much of the rest. The determinedly Scottish accents mean that the dialogue is very often difficult to make out. Some of the performance and directorial choices are truly puzzling - Sean Harris' reaction on learning of the murder of his wife and children was strangely dispassionate (by contrast, showing their brutal murder directly at Macbeth's hand was very effective), and the decision for Lady Macbeth to deliver the 'Out damned spot' speech in rather gentle fashion, while very much not washing her hands, was utterly mystifying: her descent into madness made little sense as shown.In fact, the overall impression I got from most of the performances was emotional distance. This story, and the dialogue in which it is told, is visceral but, apart from some of the action, this film is not. The actors are all first rate, so the blame for a rather dispassionate reading of a classic play must lie with director Justin Kurzel. I highlight one major exception: Fleance's reaction to Banquo's death was wonderful.The music, heavy with celtic pipes and, especially, groaning cellos, is intrusive, distracting, and composed by the director's brother. I did not feel it improved the film in any way.Overall, I was pretty disappointed.",6,16,27,9 October 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Terrific
","In his third outing, Indiana Jones is off in pursuit of the Holy Grail, accompanied by his father, and despite the efforts of assorted Nazis to prevent him.The customary thrills and action very nearly take second place here to the delightfully portrayed dysfunctional relationship between the Jones boys. This relationship is hugely enjoyable - it is obvious that Indy is a chip off the old block, and that their similarities are the reason these two men don't get on.Of course, the thrills and action are there, and are as exciting as always.",9,1,2,9 July 2012
Back to the Future," Don't take any notice of me - see it if you haven't already!
","I have seen BTTF loads of time on the small screen but never at the cinema so, lured by the promise of digital remastering, off I went. The ads before the film were pin-sharp and very impressive. BTTF certainly looked good, but I didn't go 'Wow!' at the image quality.This hardly mattered. Despite its familiarity, BTTF sucked me in at the first frame and didn't release me until the very last. This is one of those films with a delicious concept and fabulous execution. It is not perfect, but it comes close.If I had to come up with criticisms, the minor - very minor! - points I would raise are: 1. ILM's effects, just before the digital age, are still good but could be done better now (the first set of fire strips below Doc and Marty at the Mall, for instance). Likewise the facial prosthetics; 2. Crispin Glover's George McFly is a touch overcooked throughout most of the film. Not until the punch and afterwards does George convince; 3. The episode with Biff berating George in the McFly house in 1985 serves two purposes: it loads up material to be revisited later (when the dialogue repeats in the diner in 1955), but it also illuminates George's and Biff's character, and the relationship between them. The first 20 minutes or so is packed with details like this, and necessarily so, but not all of it is delivered gracefully under the guise of character exposition (the Peabody reference comes to mind, clumsily lobbed into conversation for no particular purpose, just to reference the name on the mailbox later on); 4. Having been stunned into open-mouthed disbelief at encountering younger versions of his father, mother, Biff, and Goldie(!), Marty doesn't register his grandparents with any sense of wonder, and this doesn't ring true (he would have had some sort of reaction whether they were still alive in 1985 or not).I'm nitpicking. This is a great, great film - sheer entertainment from start to finish.",10,1,1,7 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," An Event worth experiencing
","In the roaring 20s, Nick Carraway moves into a small rented Long Island house, across the Sound from his cousin Daisy and her wealthy husband Tom. Nick's house is next to a mansion where the mysterious and somewhat reclusive Gatsby hosts massive parties. Nick gets drawn into the lives of these three people and finds that there are secrets to keep.As a Brit, The Great Gatsby is not on our school reading lists, and the Redford film version had never appealed, so I came to this with only the vaguest idea of what it was about. Despite the running time (nearly two and a half hours) I was absorbed throughout: I will mention nothing about the events of the story in case anyone reading this is also in ignorance.Which leaves talking about the film itself. Well, the performances are fine, although poor Tobey Maguire loses out somewhat - as narrator and observer he is on screen throughout the movie, but Nick is a thankless part, being necessarily neutral and colourless until towards the end.The production design is very good, and it wouldn't take you long to work out that this is a Baz Luhrman film if you didn't already know. I sometimes think that 'Luhrman' should have been 'Lurid', his visuals are so vivid and in-your-face. Which is not to say that the visuals aren't effective, because they are, but I'm not sure that the air of camp which they lend is entirely fitting to the story. Maybe, maybe not.Oh, and see it in 3D - Luhrman is one of only a handful of directors who, on the basis of this, understands how to use 3D as an artistic tool.",8,2,5,17 May 2013
The Proposal," Enjoyable romcom
","The bare bones of this romcom are fairly familiar, albeit with a role reversal element. Sandra Bullock is Margaret, a hard-as-nails editor who makes the life of her personal assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) a misery. When she is faced with deportation back to Canada she blackmails him into marrying her. During the long weekend at his family home in Alaska the ice maiden gradually thaws and the inevitable happens.But for a movie which runs along such well-oiled and predetermined tracks, The Proposal is very entertaining. Bullock is very convincing as the boss from hell, and her gradual change is believable. Reynolds is sympathetic and funny and knocks out some decent acting. Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson give good support as Andrew's differently motivated parents, and Betty White has a ball as nonagenarian grandmother Anna.The script is bright and breezy with some very funny moments, decent motivations for the characters, and sufficient sentiment without being schmaltzy.I liked this movie a lot.",8,0,3,22 July 2009
Warm Bodies," Delightful
","In a post apocalyptic world, we learn (in a strangely articulate voice-over from the zombie who we come to know as R) that zombies prefer to eat brains because this gives them the memories of the meal, making them feel more alive: it also prevents the corpse reanimating). Also, it seems, that when zombies are particularly far gone, they devolve into skeletal scavengers called Bonies. Having eaten the brains of non-zombie Perry, R feels a strange bond with his girlfriend Julie and kidnaps her. The feelings he experiences gradually begin to bring him back to life, and rub off on the rest of the zombie community. But will that prevent Julie's father, leader of the human enclave, from blowing R's brains out on sight? Warm Bodies lays claim to being the first zombie comedy rom-com and, delightfully, it manages to succeed in all three genres, as well as being a fairly specific transplant of Romeo and Juliet (R and Julie) into the zombie world, complete with balcony scene. It is extremely well staged, the makeup is good, and the cast all perform very well (Nicholas Hoult is terrific as R). The Bonies don't always convince, and R's lucid voice-over would have been better recounting what had happened (where it would have been credible) rather than what is happening (where it isn't).But overall, this is very successful and very good fun.",8,5,10,12 February 2013
Sully," Good but padded
","In January 2009, Captain Chesley Sullenbeger, aka Sully, successfully ditches a powerless jet airliner in the Hudson River, resulting in the full complement of 155 passengers and crew surviving. The event happens in full view of numerous cameras, and becomes known as Miracle On The Hudson: Sully is a hero. But the subsequent enquiry seeks to establish the landing as pilot error by proving that Sully could have successfully landed back at La Guardia.This dramatisation of real-life events is not unsuccessful, but is nonetheless a little odd.Director Clint Eastwood reconstructs the moment from the bird striking the jet engine to the ditching extremely well. The trouble is that, as in real-life, this took only a few minutes (it was less than half an hour until everyone was safely on boats), so we get to see it twice from start to finish, several more times in fragments, and from a variety of angles.And there is no suspense to it: we already know everyone survived.So the thrust of this movie is the enquiry. Popular opinion has, to his embarrassment, labelled the self-effacing Sully as a hero, whereas the enquiry seeks to blame him for endangering lives, which will end his career.There is actually some decent drama here: one, I didn't know how the enquiry had gone so, for me, the outcome was in doubt and, two, the public hearing at the conclusion of the enquiry is an excellent bit of theatre.Tom Hanks is, as usual, a class act, especially playing an ordinary man displaying extraordinary qualities, but Aaron Eckhart as his co-pilot is as good. Laura Linney as Mrs Sullenberger is wasted, her role being simply to take part in distressed telephone calls.If there is a problem here it is that the only real drama is the hearing, and there is perhaps insufficient meat on those particular bones to sustain a feature without adding a fair amount of inconsequential padding.I'm still glad to have seen it, though.",7,1,2,16 May 2018
Princess Mononoke," Excellent, but not for everyone
","Princess Mononoke, like most of Studio Ghibli's output, has a Japanese sensibility which is quite alien to a western audience which has grown up on Disney and Looney Tunes. The story hardly matters - the striking visuals rule.The story is perfectly fine, though: its vague ecological message survives the other-wordly weirdness of demons, forest gods, and warring factions kept apart by a pair of unlikely peace brokers.But it looks terrific - character design, backgrounds and animation are all first rate. And its weirdness is part of its appeal. There's no guarantee that you will enjoy it but, if you give it a chance, there is a lot to enjoy here.",8,1,2,11 December 2011
Jurassic Park," Fantastic!
","Growing up, Ray Harryhausen was my movie hero - he specialised in putting on screen things which didn't exist. For the last 35 years his place has been taken by Stephen Spielberg, simply because he makes such very, very good films. And he has been known to put something impossible on screen every now and then, too.To synopsise, a theme park is set up on an island, populated by dinosaurs reconstructed from prehistoric DNA extracted from mosquitoes preserved in amber. During the 'test drive' of the park, attended by palaeontologists, things go horribly wrong...Michael Crichton's book, though very enjoyable, is filled to overflowing with technobabble, particularly with regard to the park's computer system. And, if one is brutally honest, it recycles the basic idea of Crichton's own Westworld some 20 years earlier, albeit different theme park, different victims.Spielberg strips away, simplifies, gives us a range of very human humans as potential (and actual!) victims, and a moderate amount of exposition so that we always believe what happens, and then sets off on the first of a number of spectacular set pieces. The story is minimal and almost incidental.The cast are all good. Jeff Goldblum is not always to my taste, but Sam Neill's sincerity and dignity compensates. But this movie is never about the cast, nor the story.The dinosaurs (and their integration into the movie) are nearly flawless - there are one or two points where the gallimimuses don't convince 100% that they belong against that particular background plate. They vary between mechanical/animatronic effects and CGI - and this is quite near that dawn of CGI for photo-realistic characters wholly integrated into movies - and it was impossible to distinguish which shots are physical and which are photographic. If you don't believe how truly remarkable Jurassic Park's dinosaurs were, particularly for their day, try comparing them with any CGI monster from the SciFi channel's specially commissioned movies nearly 20 years later, and see how unconvincing CGI critters can be, and how woefully they can be integrated into backgrounds (or, indeed, NOT integrated!). They stand up as well now as they did when the movie was first released and, given how far CGI has come since then, that is a testament to their quality.If I had a criticism, it would be that the film is rather too leisurely in dealing with the set up - with the benefit of hindsight, the disastrous events of the second half of the film could have started a little earlier. However, this is more than made up for by John Williams' wonderful score.Addition: April 2013 The recent 3D conversion is quite superb: you would never know that the movie was filmed flat.",9,5,6,23 July 2010
Beetlejuice," Inspired
","Whenever I get annoyed at Tim Burton's propensity for hacking the work of others to pieces with blithe disregard, in order to build something with his own stamp (Batman, Sleepy Hollow, Alice In Wonderland et al), I remember Beetlejuice.Beetlejuice is a work of fierce originality. Telling the story of freshly deceased ordinary couple Adam and Barbara, forced to share the house they love (and are restricted to) with the family from hell, it is savagely original in concept and execution. Nominally centring on the bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, it spreads its favours far and wide - Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the dead couple, Jeffrey Jones and the exquisitely funny Catherine O'Hara as the new residents, Winona Rider as their terminally depressed daughter and Glenn Shadix as their appalling interior designer, and Michael Keaton in a career establishing turn as the over-the-top Beetlejuice himself.The special effects are great, as is production design, but the real star here is the story and script. Any film which can deliver a sequence so brilliantly conceived, staged, and performed (just watch the faces of the dinner guests!) as the Banana Boat Song sequence is a classic.",10,1,2,2 March 2011
Valkyrie," Decent suspense thriller
","Let's get the criticism out of the way first. Valkyrie thinks it is an important film. It isn't.It is, however, a more than effective suspense thriller using an actual event from WWII as its plot, whereby Tom Cruise and half the cast of Pirates Of The Caribbean try (and fail) to blow up Hitler. Its effectiveness is all the more remarkable given that the audience knows from the outset that the plot failed.The level of tension is sustained throughout, and towards the end you find yourself half hoping that it will turn out that the plotters succeed - the suspense is that effective.The cast of mostly British stalwarts are all excellent, including both the unexpected (Eddie Izzard doing a good turn as a reluctant conspirator) and the blink-and-you'll- miss-'em (Bernard Hill as an officer blown up in the first five minutes). It was very pleasing to see the delectable Carice van Houten in a mainstream movie.But this is Cruise's movie, and he shows again how well he holds the screen. This is a decent performance - not award winning, but solid.The movie held my attention throughout and I left feeling solidly entertained.",8,2,5,28 January 2009
Alien: Covenant," As dumb as Prometheus, but not as conceited
","The spaceship Covenant carries 2000 deep-sleep colonists and a lot of embryos. The crew are also asleep: only synthetic Walter is awake when an incident leads him to wake the crew. They discover a message with a John Denver song coming from a nearby colonisable planet, so they go to investigate.Obviously they haven't seen Prometheus, or they would have guessed this was where Elizabeth Shaw and David ended up. But before they find that out, horrible things start happening. I won't say what, because horrible deaths, and what order they happen in, is the reason for Alien films.This is Ridley Scott's 3rd trip in the Alien universe. He started it all with a straightforward sci-fi horror back in 1979, and then gave us Prometheus in 2012. This was a film which was so full of pretentiousness that it completely forgot not to be stupid. Fortunately, Covenant isn't anywhere near as pretentious as Prometheus.It has its share of stupidity, however. If the humans (aka 'alien fodder') wore helmets in the atmosphere of the new planet, then a lot of trouble could have been avoided, for instance. And why weren't the colonists' sleep pods secured better? Hanging from cup-hooks is asking for trouble, surely?Michael Fassbender plays David, the synthetic from Prometheus, and Walter, another synthetic created from the same template. They are very different characters, their English and American accents being just one of the ways to tell them apart. Fassbender is, as always, brilliant. The effects used to allow the two characters to interact in their scenes together are flawless.The rest of the featured players vary in how much impact they have. The bigger the name, the bigger the part and the bigger the impact. We do identify with most of the characters, so it matters what happened to them. Even so, there are those who are in the film only because we need someone to at various points.I felt that I had seen much of the film before: it goes over familiar ground from the very first film and also from Prometheus. We even have a facehugger. We get more story material, though, and an ending you can see coming from a mile away. The deaths are very gory indeed, and the aliens - a mixture of CGI, puppetry, and suited actors - are very well realised. If you are viewing this because you enjoy inventive, splattery slaughter, then you will be pleased. And, of course, this will be one of the reasons why many will see it. The film looks good, and the effects overall are as slick as we have come to expect these days.Prometheus annoyed me immensely. Being so pretentious, yet so carelessly stupid, I felt it insulted me. Alien: Covenant is a much more direct and straightforward film, and succeeds all the better for being so.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but I did, a lot.",7,2,5,9 May 2018
The Wizard of Oz," A very good year
","By the time 1939 came around, sound had only been present in films for 10 years, and colour had barely put in an appearance. But that year saw 4 films arrive, each of which made revolutionary use of the new full colour technology with a breadth of vision which would never be repeated - Gone WIth The Wind, Snow White, The Adventures Of Robin Hood, and The Wizard Of Oz.The Wizard Of Oz builds on Baum's source material and adds some wonderful touches of its own: the songs are the obvious additions, but the parallels between Oz and the real world are another, as is the inspired decision to have the real world in monochrome and Oz in dazzling Technicolor.The entire cast is also excellent, notwithstanding that the performance style is rather broader than we are used to these days. In particular, Judy Garland's Dorothy, despite being perceptibly older than Dorothy should be (even after the physical torment Garland was put through to make her look younger), is an achingly honest performance, blessed with one of the most sublime songs ever committed to the screen.The only possible criticism is that the stage sets are a little obvious these days, but that is a minor point to raise against a film which is as fresh now as it was more than 70 years ago.I note that it has never been mooted for a remake, a fact which speaks for itself!2014 update: the 3D retooling is first rate, and enhances a film which was already close to perfection.",10,3,4,30 March 2011
The Soloist," Did I care? Not really.
","Journalist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr) happens upon down-and-out Nathaniel Ayres (Jamie Foxx) and discovers he is a superb cellist who has dropped out of society due to schizophrenia. In pursuit of a story, Lopez ends up befriending the hapless Nathaniel.This movie is essentially Rain Man with a cello. Downey plays the Cruise role of someone who starts off as, essentially, an unlikeable man with only his own interests at heart, but who becomes a more compassionate and caring person as a matter of necessity. Foxx plays the Hoffman role of someone who (ironically) would have been referred to by Downey's Tropic Thunder character as 'full retard.' The story is always interesting, although it is a little unsatisfying in that there is no formal resolution - a closing voice-over and titles inform us that Nathaniel is still just as mentally precarious as ever.This is Downey's film - the Lopez character has a satisfying development arc. Conversely, while Foxx does well in delivering Nathaniel's speech patterns and sometimes there, sometimes not attitudes, the character doesn't change and is difficult to feel sympathy for.And that is a flaw which lies at the heart of this movie. Despite the fact that it holds your interest, it is difficult to care. I should have cared but, come the end, I discovered that I didn't.",7,1,2,30 September 2009
The Martian," Well done
","A manned mission to Mars is forced to leave the surface because of a storm and return to Earth: astronaut Mark Watney, abandoned because he is believed killed in the storm, survives, and is forced to rely on ingenuity to restore communications and create food and water from Mars' barren surface until a rescue mission can arrive.Ridley Scott is a director about whom I have very mixed feelings. I have the utmost respect for his ability to put stunning visuals on screen, but I have found many of his films sorely lacking in narrative credibility. In The Martian â€“ all 141 minutes of it â€“ I have to award him full marks. Yes, it looks great, but I expected it to. Where it succeeds magnificently is in how it tells the story. This varies between the high excitement of the set pieces (the two major sequences which bookend the film, and several smaller ones along the way), the lucid portrayal of what could have been complex technical recounting of the procedures Watney (and others) follow in order to solve problems, and the emotional impact of his predicament on Watney. This latter element is dealt with sparingly, but hugely effectively.The supporting cast is also used effectively, with unknowns shouldering as much of the weight as names (and there are some big names in here). But most credit goes to Matt Damon, because much of the film is a one-man show, and Damon hold s the stage with ease.There are moments when the 3D is effective, but Scott doesn't make full use of it at all. Don't bother seeing it in 3D.This was a good film, and I look forward to seeing it again.",8,3,61,2 October 2015
The Fighter," Enjoyable kitchen sink boxing drama
","Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a moderately talented boxer, younger brother of his trainer Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), who himself once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard before he ended up addicted to crack.. This film follows Micky's career path, and the influences on it of his brother, his girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams) and his mother Alice (Melissa Leo), together with various other figures.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film. A long-term project of Wahlberg's, and based on true events (and presumably brought to the screen with the co-operation of the two brothers, who are featured in some footage as the credits role), it is one of those dramas - there is very little humour here - rooted in run-down urban America featuring what appeared to be a story of a decent man with potential, supported by a good woman, but ultimately doomed to be dragged down by the importance to him of his family, leading to his being let down by his unreliable petty criminal brother who he idealises, and his appalling manager/mother and herd of harridan sisters.The story didn't go exactly as I expected, however, and I rapidly came to care about Micky so much that I wanted to see things through to the end. The fight sequences were very well staged and, while I wasn't up on my feet cheering, I felt like it.Looking at performances and award nominations, I felt that Bale was rather too cartoony, particular in the early scenes, and Melissa Leo was rather one-note (if the film was indeed made with the co-operation of the two brothers, then heaven only knows what mother and sisters made of the monsters they are portrayed as). On the other hand, I very much enjoyed Amy Adams playing against type, and Wahlberg's performance of quiet sincerity also appealed greatly.",8,0,2,25 February 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Enjoyable but morally questionable
","Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton sees his wife and daughter savagely murdered by a pair of burglars. Jamie Foxx's Nick Rice is the DA who plea bargains a short sentence for the worst of the pair to turn State's evidence against the other. It turns out that Shelton is a former covert specialist in planning and executing sudden and secret death for the Government, as Rice finds out when the two murderers met highly unpleasant demises, following which Shelton turns his attention to the flawed system which failed to hold them properly to account.This is essentially a revenge movie, albeit dressed up with fun but unlikely trappings, none of which bears examination in the cold light of day. It's full of action, holds your attention, and even engages you from time to time with issues which require some thought. Having said that, there is some very muddled morality in it - given Shelton's actions, and notwithstanding the murders which catalyse him, is he fundamentally any more moral than the murderers? But if you remove your thinking apparatus and simply get aboard for the ride, there is much to be enjoyed here.",8,0,2,2 December 2009
Up in the Air," A film for Grown-Ups
","If you are trying to decide whether to go and see Up In The Air, the big question is 'Is the brief shot of Vera Farmiga's delightfully unclad derriere sashaying across the screen reason enough, in itself, to go and see this film?' Without hesitation, I give you the answer - 'Of course it is!' But there are quite a lot of other reasons for seeing this movie, despite the fact that it is really difficult to categorise. It's not a comedy, although it is often very funny. It's not a romance, although there are romantic elements. It's not a drama, despite having a lot of (low key) drama in it. It isn't social commentary, but you will be aware of some acidic observations on modern day living. And so on.There are four distinct elements, although they are so deftly intertwined that they never strike you as distinct and separate. They are: 1. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)'s determined espousal of his executive traveller's lifestyle and rejection of a conventional rooted lifestyle and the connection to other people that goes with it; 2. The arrival of pushy young Anna Kendrick (Natalie Keener), the threat to Ryan's lifestyle which she poses, the defensive action he puts into play, and the effects this has on Anna; 3. The development of Ryan's relationship with fellow executive traveller Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga); and 4. Ryan's family, from which he is almost estranged.The core of the film is the way in which all these things work on Ryan. This is a film for grown ups. The audience when I saw it were all of mature years, and there was quite a lot of knowing laughter, particularly at some of the unconsciously patronisingly ageist remarks Anna makes. The performances are uniformly excellent, and Clooney (in a part which suits him down to the ground) is given an opportunity to show that Ryan has depths he never realised he had. The script is sharp, and a first class example of how effectively a decent script lifts a film into becoming something special.An excellent film, and I thoroughly recommend it.Plus, like I said, there's this bit with Vera Farmiga in it...",9,1,3,4 February 2010
V for Vendetta," Powerful
","V For Vendetta was a powerful comic, and it is a powerful movie. There are a number of ways in which it has been changed for the screen - it has been simplified a great deal, with layers and characters stripped away - but the thrust remains the same.One of the things which entertained me about the film was that, in many ways it remained true to the vibe of the original, but that it resonated as a comment on then current politics (ie. Blair's Labour government as opposed to Thatcher's Conservative government which was the target of Moore's comic) - British, at any rate - with a government which increasingly seeks to control what the population is allowed to do (an article in the UK papers at the time of the movie's release tells us that civic authorities are secretly installing electronic bugs in refuse bins which can be read by the garbage trucks, and which will tally evidence on what individual households are throwing away, enabling non-recycling penalties to be applied). Despite Moore's left-wing polemic, the dramatic thrust of the piece remains undisturbed when the target is an authoritarian left-wing government rather than a right-wing one.The main changes were: 1. Dietrich (Stephen Fry's character) wasn't in the book at all; 2. Evey's backstory was different; the involvement of her parents gave her motive for joining V; 3. In the book, Evey didn't use the Lilliman paedophile setup as a way to escape V (I thought the film was an improvement here); 4. There were a lot of minor subplots from the book which were omitted - the incomprehensible Glaswegian psychopath, for instance; 5. The ending differed - in the film it wasn't entirely clear whether Evey had taken on the mantle of V. Plus in the book, there was no public uprising (a good film moment).Hugo Weaving's voice work is superb. Natalie Portman is excellent, although her accent lands haphazardly in the Home Counties, the East End, and the middle of the Atlantic at different times. The supporting cast is excellent, with Stephen Fry doing particularly well.A unique comic becomes a most unusual, exciting, and somewhat thought-provoking film.",9,1,7,17 July 2010
The Island," So nearly...
","The Island, so nearly a great film, ends up merely a good film.The first act is terrific. As we meet the inhabitants of this unexplained futuristic city, the puzzle of where, when, and how come is very pleasing. The most likely explanation seems to be some sort of riff on Logan's Run. Bits of the puzzle are supplied piecemeal, and each leaves us more puzzled than we were before.Then act 2 kicks in, and the reveal isn't half as satisfying as the mystery which preceded it. However, it leads to some decent chase sequences, and Ewan McGregor and Steve Buscemi both get to have a little fun (not so with Scarlett Johansen, however, whose function is to serve as decoration, sounding board, light romantic interest, and occasional damsel in distress).Act 3 simply wraps matters up and gives Sean Bean an opportunity to be the villain, which we already knew by then. Bean brings nothing more to his portrayal of the villain than he has brought to such parts many times before. Djimon Hounsou, however, lends a depth to a part which should have been one dimensional, and is probably the best thing in the film.It passes a couple of hours well enough, but no better.",Null,0,1,17 October 2011
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Engagingly daft
","I always approach a Will Ferrell film with trepidation: I think he is very versatile and talented actor, but so very often I dislike the parts he plays.Ricky Bobby, however, is quite a nice guy. A little on the dumb side, but essentially decent. And the movie overall is fairly amusing - not that much in the way of major laugh-out-louds, but quite a lot of chuckling more or less throughout.I know nothing about NASCAR and care even less, but this doesn't matter - it is simply a world in which to set the story. And, as is so often the case, there is profanity which I found fairly unnecessary - this would be my main criticism.All the cast are good. The two boys playing Ferrell's sons get some fabulous lines, and Sacha Baron Cohen gives the most - 'ow you say? - individual French accent since Peter Sellers' Clouseau.Good fun in an undemanding way.",7,1,1,4 April 2010
Furious 7," Ridiculous, entertaining and, ultimately, moving
","Dom's family comes under threat from Deckard Shaw, the brother of the fellow they were up against in episode 6. Also, a mysterious government fellow pressures them to rescue a hacker who has invented a whizzo bit of kit which can spy on anyone on the planet.This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has gradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action movies into, at this point, super-hero movies – Vin Diesel and Jason Statham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be proud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was stretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red car in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly entertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government seriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they have to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo plane in their cars? Really?).Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death during production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to bring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole, this has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of clunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the awareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit to the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a dignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of tribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the character and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend and brother.",8,81,104,10 April 2015
