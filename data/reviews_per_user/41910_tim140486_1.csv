Howl's Moving Castle," Read the Book
","READ THE BOOK, For everyone who doesn't understand what some details are about, just do it. I read it quite awhile ago, and now have seen the film, and its really, very, very, different. But still, all the details are in the book, its very easy to get. Alof of things peaple have said thus far about the movie, much has been written off as the 'subtle miyazaki' creativity, when in reality, it was more along the times of what was happening in the book, rather than how he created it. the details are good, and about the same just, evens happen differently, peaple are together in different ways and so on, between the book and movie, most of the pieces are there, they're just in a different order.",9,2,4,15 June 2005
