The Incredible Hulk," Solid Movie
","Story: The story is pretty cliche but not in a bad way. What's kinda bad is the pacing of the movie. Sometimes it gets a bit slow and might bore some. 6/10
Characters: The characters are the weakest thing in the movie. The general is one-sided and dumb, Tim Roth seems like a decent man who loves to fight at first but halfway through the movie he just becomes a maniac, Liv Tyler doesn't really offer much other than being the one the Hulk thinks when he needs a power-up to defeat the bad people cliche. I think the best character was Edward Norton, he delivers as Hulk big time and overall his performance was solid. 4/10
Cinematography: The movie aged pretty well, the scenes look nice and the action is A-MA-ZING. Every action scene in the movie is shot quite well and the punches deliver every-single-time. 10/10
Enjoyment: The movie is pretty fun for the most part, except some few parts that it becomes slow. 8/10
Overall: 7/10",7,0,0,25 June 2019
Iron Man," Excellent movie
","Story: The story is simple and engaging at the same time. Fast paced, cool action and what's happening is clear to the viewer at all times. 10/10
Characters: Solid character development to everyone, even the supporting crew. The main characters are hugely interesting and the two main characters (Downey Jr and Bridges) deliver big time. 10/10
Cinematography: The fight scenes are excellent, the special effects are beautiful and the directing is on point. 10/10
