First Man," Chazelle is a terrible director
","Shaky cameras don't affect me but when it takes up 10% of the movie; it's a crap experience. Terribly directed movie. Zero characterization. I didn't get to know a single character and barely knew their names. Apparently no one told Gosling he wasn't supposed to act like a replicant again. Horrible one nite performance. I've seen driftwood with more range. Only Foy manages a decent performance. Apparently Chazelle thought we'd rather see the inside of the cockpit instead of the majestic sight of seeing a rocket soar away from the Earth. The one good scene was when they were trying to land. Tedious, uninvolving and a terrible slog. I can't beluevevwnyone would champion this movie.",1,3,8,23 January 2019
Hereditary," Hahahahaha. These reviews are a joke!!
","When I say that nothing happens I'm understating the movie. Literally nothing happens. Somnambulant people walk around talking about nothing. There are zero scares, dread or any menacing scenes to speak of. I would question the mental capacity of ANYONE being scared by this movie. They'd probably be scared of the wind or crickets chirping. Truly one of the worst movies ever made alongside Get Out. I refuse to believe that ANYONE that's lucid could possibly enjoy this travesty and joke of a movie. Good actors are completely wasted. Avoid at all costs unless you're brain dead.",1,3,9,15 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," In no Universe is this the best Spider-Man movie!!
",Anyone thinking that is seriously delusional and might even need help. However the film is immensely entertaining and hilarious. My wife and I watched this with huge grins on our faces. The first hour is superior as we meet Miles and watch him become Spider-Man. It also has the best Spiderman ( the one from Miles own World ). Unfortunately it goes off the rails in the climactic altered reality battle where the animators went haywire loco. It also loses points for the hunchbacked and unnaturally strong Kingpin. The manga and pig Spidermen were also stupid. But just about everything else is spectacular and spot on. Great twist from one of the villains and some shocking deaths. I'd love to see a movie with the first Spider-Man and his ( Alfred ) Aunt May. Overall the movie delivers and the high praise is well deserved!!,8,2,7,15 January 2019
