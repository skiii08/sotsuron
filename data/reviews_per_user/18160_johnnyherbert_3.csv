Minority Report," A neo-noir sci-fi which is a rarity.
","Minority Report is a stylish neo- noir science fiction from Steven Spielberg destined to become a classic of the future. Taking place in 2054 it concerns a group of police force which are equipped with the capability to foresee a crime about to happen with the help of three mutated humans called 'precogs'. Unfortunately for John Anderton (Tom Cruise) as he sets up to work on the next crime about to happen he is horrified to see that the offender is he himself. What follows is a cat and mouse hunt which involves his entire corporation and then some. The visual effects are amazing, and the tone of the film is finely balanced between dreary, rainy grey and futuristic blue. Cruise and Colin Farrell star. Great movie.",Null,2,2,7 August 2018
Cloverfield," Awesome handheld science fiction film.
","I absolutely loved Cloverfield even though I am no fan of the shaky cam. The movie is interesting because it's so damn different. It takes a worn concept and invigorates it by applying an innovative approach. The style will anger and offend some viewers but, if you're able to accommodate the camera, the movie delivers. There are moments of high tension and the sense of danger feels closer and more real than in any recent motion picture. The missteps - the greatest of which is the interminable introduction - are forgivable because the payoff is strong. In some ways, Cloverfield gives the impression of having been produced on a low budget, but the special effects are first rate. The monster and the devastation it causes look real. We believe. And, ultimately, that's the reason why Cloverfield works - because this film takes you into the heart of the maelstrom and leaves you there.",Null,0,0,30 December 2018
The Thing," Icy sci-fi film reeking of atmosphere.
","John Carpenter's The Thing is such an atmospheric film that even now three decades on it feels as though it was shot last night. It's a remake of a 1950s film and one of the few examples of the remake being better than the original. The plot concerns an American team stationed in Antarctica that suddenly find an alien creature that imitates other life among their midst. One by one this alien entity starts devouring the team. Kurt Russell is in sublime form as Macready the station helicopter pilot and the only one with balls and a rational outlook. This is not just a science fiction film but a character study of humans, done so very subtly. Carpenter is a filmmaker magician and The Thing is one of bis finest tricks.",Null,1,2,23 July 2018
