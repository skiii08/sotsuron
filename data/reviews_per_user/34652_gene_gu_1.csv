The Equalizer," Breathtaking!
","What a surprise! Went into the theatre just expecting a regular action movie with Denzel taking the lead. Did not expect what I was gonna see. Great acting, memorable characters, decent story, action is amazing with a incredible performance by denzel. Wouldn't mind a sequel at all as plenty of depth to discover in the characters.",10,0,2,3 August 2018
