Source Code," wow... best sci-fi...
","I have no idea whats the movie is all about. I didn't watched the trailers either.My friends said Source code is a wonderful movie, but I don't know how I missed it. Yesterday I rented the DVD from my DVD library to see why they talk this much about it, well the movie now made me to talk.I didn't kept my eye out of the TV screen till the end. There is no suspense in the movie, but the way the movie goes is like a suspense movie. Its just a one line story 'find the boomer, save millions.'The acting is good. good visual effects and Cinematic's. Worth watching. Best sci-fi.",10,0,4,20 November 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Next level of motion capture CG
","Tin tin was the first and one of my Favorite Comic on my child hood. I was waiting long time to see a CG animated version.Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, that big combination drag me to this movie and its as expected. Seeing the character's of Tin tin and Tin tin himself in 3D animation is a wonderful experience. Lighting, colors, physics. I wondered how they managed to animate Tongues even. Wow, the final fight between the Captains on harbour crane is shot great.I am going next week again to see the movie and now waiting for Blu-ray release.Great Job, SS and PJ good entertainment.",10,0,2,14 November 2011
