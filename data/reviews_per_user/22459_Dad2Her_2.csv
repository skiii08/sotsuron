Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You can't judge a film by it's first showing!
","I'm a big Star Wars fan.  That aside, I must say that the first time I saw Episode 1, I was disappointed.  But then something happened.  I had to see it again and again and again.  I recently got both the Widescreen and Pan and Scan editions on vhs and I must say that I now see this film as EXCELLENT!  I am not hesitant to give it nine stars out of ten!!!The casting was excellent.  I especially liked the actress that portrayed Anakin's mom.  Excellent acting and non-verbal acting.  The music was superb...another great score by John Williams.  The special effects were literally out of this world.  And Jar Jar ...was loveable!This is the kind of movie that you just can not fully appreciate after only one viewing.  I've seen it now seven and I still see more new stuff every time that I see it.If you are looking for a good family film (some of the scenes are a bit intense for younger kids)with a good deal of action, special effects and a very deeply laid plot...rent this one!",Null,0,0,12 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Same Star Wars galaxy but not the same quality
","As a big Star Wars fan since it's inception in the late 70s, I was very disappointed by the first half. From the start,I was lost in the vast Star Wars galaxy, being overwhelmed by the incredible graphics but very slim plot. The special effects were out of this world for sure but they grabbed my attention more than the plot did. What was the plot for the first half? I gave the film five out of ten because of the lucid plot. However, on the positive side, the film picked up quit a bit as it progressed and comes to an appropriate end. I was pleased with the obvious plot in the second half and was not in the dark regarding the sinister plans of Darth Sidious. The contrast between the good and the bad was obvious and so kept my attention. I walked away though with a big question in my mind as to why did Lucas involve the volcano planet? I know that it gives meaning as to what happens to one of the key characters in the film but aside from that why such a backdrop? Too much of this film came across to me as contrived and not as fluid as the originals and the previous two installments.In all honesty, Episode I and II were much better than this one. Too much going on and too complex.",5,2,4,28 May 2005
