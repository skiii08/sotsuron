Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Expectations
","With all due respect to Mr. Lucas, I think it was frankly impossible for him to live up to every expectation of fans who have long awaited this moment. In that regard I think many people set themselves up for disappointment when they were hoping to get the same feeling they had for previous Star Wars films.  I think that may be the problem many have had in keeping themselves from enjoying Episode I and in others it is what has allowed them to forgive all this films short comings.  Frankly, I think the original Star Wars was a very corny movie, I still loved it and had a great time watching it but it was some what lacking in plot itself.  I think if one looks at Episode I as the equivalent to Star Wars Episode IV in the respects that this is only the first part of a much greater story and Lucas is only trying to set us up for what is to come, it is all much easier to take in.  It doesn't help that we are not so closely attached to all the new characters we are meeting but for that matter I wasn't so closely attached to Luke, Leia, Han and rest, after my first time watching Star Wars.  I think all the hype behind it is another main factor keeping many people from enjoying it. It most certainly wasn't the greatest movie of all time but it was still pretty good.  Let go of expectations and just enjoy it.  I know I had a great time watching it.  It of course had elements that I found annoying but for that matter so did the other three and I've yet to not have a good time watching Star Wars.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
