Vertigo," Just watch and enjoy
","Every now and then I like to revisit old Hitch – It is part nostalgia, part worship of the old man who never fails to surprise and thrill. There is certainly no director like him. Although I enjoyed it once again, I must admit seeing Vertigo after many years was somewhat of a disappointment. I wanted it to be perfect; it wasn't. Like many of Hitchcock's plots, this one is silly, convoluted, outrageous. But if you stop looking for flaws, what a treat it is to ride with Jimmy Stewart as he (endlessly) drives around San Francisco in his fabulous '58 DeSoto, following the stunningly beautiful Kim Novak in her green Jaguar with the bright whitewalls. This is a period piece with full orchestral accompaniment, with spectacular scenes of the 1950's city by the Bay, some of the sights like the Presidio no longer there, the restaurants, the Legion of Honor, the streets filled with all those wonderful American made behemoths (with an occasional VW beetle thrown in). And, of course, who can forget the famous scenes of the now 75-year old Golden Gate Bridge. Hitchcock of course, was the master of suspense, the unexpected shocker, the moment of revelation. But he also was expert in his use of the camera. Experience the visual, let it roll over you. The acting is magnificent. It is enough reason to see the film just to watch the masters at work: Jimmy Stewart, and Kim Novak in her duel role who as one of the few surviving principals in the film recently paid a visit to San Francisco to display her artwork. But we shouldn't forget Barbara Bel Geddes, the underrated 3rd wheel – she is wonderful in her role as faithful friend Midge. And just for fun: don't miss the old man himself walking by in his traditional cameo near the beginning of the film.The time capsule is amusingly dated, not just for the cars and silly plot: Attitudes depicted are out of touch today: the unselfconscious exploitation of women by domineering men; the almost laughable depiction of psychological disorders (acrophobia/vertigo, for example, is treated as a disease); the effortless instant love at first sight. Flawed plot and dated though it is, it is a nevertheless a simple pleasure to experience the genius at work: Hitchcock, a true craftsman who wasn't afraid to take chances and who strove to keep us hooked until the very last second, always with a sly wink awaiting us. Implausible? Sure. Who cares? For pure cinematic skill alone, I give the film high marks.",8,2,5,11 June 2012
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Coming of Age director?
","Weird. I love coming of age films, but I thought this one was a self-conscious embarrassment, riddled with eye-rolling clichés, platitudes, and cartoon characters with no depth. In an apparent attempt at 'seriousness', every troubling subject known to man was thrown in -- suicide, mental illness, sexual abuse of children -- but just thrown in, superficially, with no understanding or depth. Grossly sentimental. This feels like a coming of age film made by a coming of age director. There are many fine coming of age films that are authentic: Rob Reiner's Stand By Me, or Running on Empty, two wonderful examples. I cannot understand the overly high ratings of the viewers on IMDb for this one -- usually anything over 8.0 is a winner. I give it a generous 6 for a few good scenes and occasional good acting. Don't bother.",6,3,6,17 February 2013
Gravity," An embarrassment
","This is not a spoiler. There is nothing to spoil. I have rarely given a film such a low score, and I am one who enjoys the subject of space travel and good sci-fi. I am shaken that any part of this film was nominated for an Oscar. I am disappointed at the high score of readers on IMDb - - in my mind, it creates a cloud on all future high ratings. By any measure, except special effects (even those are not that spectacular), this film is a failure. If you enjoy watching things fly around and Sandra Bullock grunt and gasp for an hour and a half, by all means watch it. Dialogue, what little there is, is insipid. Plot is preposterous. I can only imagine NASA workers laughing and rolling their eyes. Anyone seriously interested in the craft of filmmaking, take my advice: Don't waste 90 minutes of your life. You can't say you weren't warned.",1,2,6,27 February 2014
Lost in Translation," Beautifully understated
","'Lost in Translation' begins by focusing separately on two characters, Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), Americans arriving at a Tokyo hotel, each in a private lost world. They don't meet until fairly far into the film Before they speak to one another 32 minutes into the film, they brush at opposite ends of a crowded elevator. There is just a glance and the barest hint of a connection via Charlotte's self-conscious smile. They depart from the elevator and go their own way. That's it. This brilliant piece of editing and acting sets the tone for the entire film. Their next meetings are equally understated, and so it continues.As the plot develops, there are moments of silence, when nothing seems to be 'happening'. There are moments when Bob and Charlotte are each alone in their rooms and we feel the emptiness of their lives. There are moments when they are together but silent with one another. But even as we feel their growing connection, we feel their emptiness. While the pace may lag for some viewers, the film moved along very well for me and kept me fully engaged.The characters are in two opposite but similar worlds: In Charlotte's own words, she is 'stuck'. In Bob's words, he is 'lost'. Bob is an actor, 50-ish, who realizes that most of his life is behind him. He has fallen into a cycle of meaningless work, and while he loves his family, the tedious details of his life, whether it be posing for whiskey ads or choosing rug samples, no longer bring him joy. Charlotte, in her 20's, is barely out of college and in a marriage that clearly isn't working. She doesn't know who she is or what if anything her future holds. While he is lost in the past, she is unable to imagine her future. For both, the present lacks meaning. All this is set in a country where the incomprehensible language, along with curious customs and attitudes, reinforces their alienation and loneliness.The characters ultimately find meaning, at least temporarily, in their connection, but perhaps not in the way they expect. The film doesn't descend into cliché and the tidy ending anticipated in most Hollywood films. This has disturbed some reviewers, but for me, the climax of the film on the crowded streets of Tokyo is all that much more powerful.I can't finish without mentioning the cinematography. If there is any beauty to be seen in an overly large and obscenely commercialized city, it is wonderfully captured here. Yet, in keeping with the mood, the beauty as the characters view it while riding through daytime streets or gazing at the 4AM lights from their hotel windows, has a rough edge: there is emptiness as well as beauty that comes through the crowds, traffic, noise, and garish lights.One might categorize this as a romantic comedy. While it is certainly romantic, almost painfully so, and while there are some hilarious comic moments, that particular classification doesn't fit. Most romantic comedies are made for light escapes. The fundamental mood here is serious, almost depressingly existential. Yet, unlike my feeling after viewing Coppola's subsequent film 'Somewhere', I was uplifted. This film aims for and hits on an emotional level that stays with you for days.Kudos to all involved, beginning especially Coppola (director, writer, and producer) but also the actors, cinematographers, everyone. Even after a second viewing, this film delivers.Added 4 years later: Even after a 3rd viewing, the film delivers a punch. I'd still rate it a perfect 10.",10,1,2,14 March 2013
Hugo," Please see in 3D!
","Pleasantly surprised, in part due to low expectations from some tepid critical reviews, but as always, IMDb viewers know best. The film may appear to move slowly if watched in 2D -- the endless chases, windings in and out of the walls, trips through the Paris neighborhoods, all these so beautifully executed (I use that word with respect), all are devoid of purpose unless watched as they were intended. 3D is a main character, perhaps THE main character, both thematically and technically. I'm somewhat surprised Scorsese released it in 2D format. It's all slight of hand, wonderful magic. If you allow yourself to suspend disbelief for the brief time it takes to watch, it will thrill. I don't know if any other 'regular' films yet to come (i.e.,Great Gatsby?) will have the same impact, so I'm not sold yet on the 3D medium, believing it will unfortunately be misused or overused. But in this one case, at least, it fits like a glove. I don't give many 10 ratings. A must see for children of all ages, and all lovers of film. Bravo!",10,1,4,5 March 2012
The Artist," A very good film...but
","This is one of those films which deserves a '10' for originality, execution, acting, and overall brilliant filmmaking. Many reviewers here rated it that way. It is no doubt a great concept – a silent film about the silent film era whose mood and tone perfectly emulate the genre of the time! The story line is more allegorical than real. There are some allegories that can pack a punch, hit you on an emotional level. For me, this film is not one of them. Unfortunately the very qualities that give the film its uniqueness also interfered with my ability to become engaged. Too self consciously original, perhaps. It screamed out, 'Look at me, look how clever I am!' Even as I watched and respected the film, I found myself drifting. To its credit, I imagine months or even years from now I will remember this film while totally forgetting other more engaging films that kept me riveted from beginning to end. Nevertheless, unless a film keeps one wondering, anticipating, caring – in short, feeling – I don't believe it deserves highest honors. It is more memorable as a curiosity than as a work of art. Certainly a creative and original concept is to be admired. But a truly great film must also reach out, give you an experience, change you. 'The Artist' is a very good film, not to be missed. It is not a great film.",7,2,5,25 November 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," Hard to keep eyes open.
","With the hype last year - magazine covers and all - I expected something more. Much more.I give the film a generous 4. I thought it failed on several counts: Tom Cruise has never been a favorite of mine. In The Firm, at least, he came closer to character playing a smart-ass attorney, but his self-assured semi-smirk and perfect Hollywood looks don't fit the character of a young doctor. Both the Cruise and Kidman characters were superficial to the extreme, with no more personality than cartoon characters.The characterizations were bad enough, but the acting didn't help. The two leads in particular seemed acutely self-conscious. Whenever Kidman spoke, she exuded 'I'm a sexy actress playing a REALLY hot role - listen to my every profound word!' I could prepare a snack before she finished a sentence. By the time she did, I was so irritated I nearly lost track of what she was saying. And her intoxicated demeanor while dancing at the party with a stranger - who came off as some hack's quick-fix cliché - was simply embarrassing.As if the pace of the dialogue wasn't slow enough, questions had to be repeated - i.e., 'What do you....think?' (pregnant pause) 'What.....do... I think?' 'Yes, what.... do you.... think?'  Over and over and over again. Please, not EVERY word is such a big deal. The result is a pretentiousness that simply overwhelems. Is it really necessary for this film to take nearly 3 hours? Not if the characters sounded like real people instead of robots stuck on repeat.  I'm reminded of Kubrick's revolving spaceship in 2001, accompanied inexplicably by a Strauss waltz. I remember wondering - will this scene ever end? Unfortunately, I had the same feeling in this film, many times.  That shouldn't happen in any film, let alone one with a subject matter that should - de facto - keep everyone enthralled, and one that is the last film and the crowning achievement of an important director's life.What a shame. Sexuality - as opposed to sex -- is not often dealt with at all, let alone successfully. I kept hoping for a hook to reality, an honest statement. Instead, the plot degenerated  into a convoluted hodgepodge which, while titillating (no pun intended), was never sufficiently explained or resolved.I would have rated it lower than a 4, but for its ground breaking attempt as a serious treatment of sexuality. For a main stream film, it was bold. But again, self-consciously. For me, nothing rang true. As for nudity - frontal nudity, yes. Breasts, plenty of 'em. Sex, er, maybe. But men's privates are still apparently just that - private. And sex - weird and not at all erotic, and only filmed from strategic angles. There is still that familiar and conspicuous holding back, not just of nudity, but of the treatment of sexuality itself. Come on, we're supposed to be grown up. And this is supposed to be a film about a grown-up subject. Unfortunately, it came off more like an adolescent's wet dream.",4,1,2,29 May 2000
Flight," Flight of fancy
","Much as I like thrillers, especially films involving planes, I was disappointed in 'Flight'. This was not much of a thriller - not much suspense here. Without resorting to spoilers, let me simply say that I found the plot riddled with clichés, and oversimplified improbable situations. In particular the ending was so banal, so neatly tied into a pretty ribbon, that it ruined any saving graces the film had for me. Perhaps I am too cynical, or too unfamiliar with the effects of alcoholism to be that sympathetic to the 'hero'. This film left me with the feeling that it could have been much, much better. Nevertheless, having said that, kudos to some good (but not stellar) acting, although it was hampered by unfortunately weak writing and and even weaker plot. The plane crash was the best film portrayal I've ever seen. Fearful flyers, be forewarned!",5,2,4,9 February 2013
