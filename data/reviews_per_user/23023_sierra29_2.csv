Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 9.5/10
","My only reason I am not giving this movie a 10/10 is the incredibly bad usage of humor.  Star Wars is not funny!  Neither is Star Trek but that is a different story altogether.  In the original Star Wars the only humor really came from C3P0 and it was not all the time. I have a very hard time stomaching a movie that is trying to be very serious and then throwing out tons of one-liners.  The Mummy was a very good example of this. I am also not sure where all of these people are coming up with 'no story line' or 'Weak Plot'?  I am guessing that these are the same people who enjoyed The Mummy or Armageddon?  Possibly two of the worst movies in history and have absolutely no story at all. The visual effects were awesome, again Lucas is way ahead of his time. The acting was again done very well.  I am very interested in seeing how Anakin will be taken to the Dark Side.  The only acting that I really had a problem with was that Jar Jar character.  Very annoying but friendly enough.  The Queen also did a very good job with her part. In my opinion with its few down falls, the rest of the movie was able to hold it up and I even forgot about the terrible slap stick lines.  Overall I would say I was in awe and thought it was a wonderful movie. Would have been a 10 except for a few minor details!",9,0,0,6 June 1999
