The Monuments Men," Art worth dying for
","I am convinced that George Clooney felt compelled to make a statement about the importance of protecting what's essential to Western Civilization. The film says that art is that essential ingredient. Glimpsing the bad and aggravated reviews it's obvious that the message did not get across all that well. My reaction to the film was entirely different from it's louder critics. I have never seen the Ghent Altarpiece nor the Madonna of Bruges. But I made a vow to go see them for myself asap. And I am grateful to Mr. Clooney that he nudged my priorities in the right direction. It is true enough that Clooney should have made a much better film of it all. It is odd to see men supposedly looking for hidden art in dusty cellars and blown-up mine shafts, themselves looking like aging movie stars on a costume picnic in their spotless just off the rack uniforms. On the other hand, repeated departures from any sense of realism seem to be a choice of style rather than just mistakes. I intend to give the film a second chance and just try not to be annoyed by its obvious flaws. After all, as far as war films about art go, there is just this one, so it's the best of it's genre as well as the worst.",7,1,3,28 February 2016
World War Z," Pandemic film features the latest in zombie evolution
","Zombies have shown remarkable evolution since the 1940's, when they had to be dead, buried and then summoned by a voodoo priest. In the 1970's they evolved the bite, a faster way to spread whatever it is that makes the victims turn to zombies as well. By 2000's zombies were getting faster than they used to be. And in World War Z, dead zombies easily outrun most people who are alive, underlining the inherent absurdity of the living dead concept. Many reviewers here were disappointed, because they expected to see 'real zombies' and what they saw was the wrong kind. I really don't know what to say to that kind of logic or lack of one. But what I saw was a pandemic film with humans acting as zombie-like delivery systems for the unknown pathogen. The concept is familiar from 28 Days. In Z, the creatures do not bother to actually die, turning from healthy humans to zombies instantly. World War Z turns out to be a pandemic action film seen from the viewpoint of one individual who never hesitates and never gives up. Brad Pitt just keeps on going, just like his adversaries the zombies do. As an actor he pulls it off well. I really felt for his character, going from one losing situation to the next, although many obviously did not. The single hero viewpoint chosen means that the film has little to do with the novel of the same name. If you want the book, go ahead and read it. One has to accept some plot holes in a fantasy film of this kind to keep the action and suspense going. For me, the combination in this respect was just right. The solution in the end is believable in the framework of the film, based on the supposition that it is the pathogen that controls the zombie and uses it's senses. It took me by surprise however. This is an industrial film and as such uses a lot of safe and proved solutions but there are enough new twists to warrant seven stars. Lack of gore was for me a definitely positive factor, since in terms of the plot there was no need for any.",7,0,0,26 October 2015
The Notebook," Romeo and Juliet get a second chance
","First of all, this film is not a guide to romantic love, just as Saving Private Ryan was not a guide as to how to conduct a World War. Both films are originally based on a true story, but the charm of these stories is their exceptional nature. I guess we need miracles. Eternal first love is not just bliss in this film. Director Nick Cassavetes and his Romeo and Juliet, Canadian actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do depict the pain, heartbreak and misery that the stubborn lover cause each other and to others around them. The film really gets going when the former teen lovers of 1940 return from World War II, now adults. America has changed morally, their relationship is no longer quite as unimaginable and unrealistic as it used to be. For the viewer, the tension really builds up - something is bound to happen, and You will find yourself on the edge of your seat, biting your nails. The films is really well dramatized from the novel, the casting is perfect and Nick Cassavetes shows himself to be a masterful director. As a curiosity, she does direct her own mother Gena Rowlands here as well. The Notebook works on many levels. Even an old guy like me had to shed some tears here. However, the teen affair part of the film was a bit long and there were too many I love yous to merit more than 8 out of 10. Gosling and McAdams are great physical actors and pledge their love in electrifying fashion, there just was too much of a good thing here. This is an experience that will haunt you for some time.",8,1,2,1 December 2015
Non-Stop," Claustrophobic action Hitchcock would have appreciated
","I am very surprised that Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 thriller North by Northwest doesn't get mentioned in reviews of Non-Stop. Here Liam Neeson plays a character whose situation is as maddening as that of Cary Grant in the Hitchcock classic. He is unexpectedly framed and treated by the world at large as a suspect for serious crimes. For most of the film, the protagonist of both films tries to sweat it out but has no clue whatsoever as to who is framing him and for what possible reason. Main difference between the films is that Neeson sweats in the confined but familiar environment of a transatlantic jet. No escape through the corn field this time! North by Northwest wasn't marketed as an action film, but by 1959 standards it was pretty much non-stop action. It is the mystery and the accompanying suspense that makes the film in both cases. True motives of the villains in the Hitchcock film have always seemed somewhat nonsensical to me, but who ever cared? In Non-Stop the point is who is pulling the strings, not really the why. I see the film as a refreshing twist in the already familiar hijack formula, well written and acted, and the fact that the plot is not that plausible is a relief for all of us frequent fliers!",7,0,1,28 December 2015
Ex Machina," Philip K. Dick would have loved it
","Philip K. Dick would have really liked Ex Machina, yet he would have felt slightly schizophrenic about not having written it. And rightly so, since in a way he did write some of it or at least pave a way to the film's central ideas with his Blade Runner/Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. You could pretty much sum up Ex Machina in one sentence by saying that it's a prequel to Ridley Scott's classic film. However, that would do no justice to either film. Ex Machina is a clever film with a remarkably hole-free plot. In a claustrophobic setting underlined by an eerie soundscape, you have once again the mad scientist and his creation. And what a lovely creation it is, brilliantly played by Swedish actress Alicia Vikander. The viewer is drawn in the games the characters play with each other, not sure what the goals are and unsure even of who is human and who android. If you are a thinking person, this film will feed you a lot of valid questions about consciousness and conscience, too. I had to watch it twice.",10,0,3,19 June 2016
The Adjustment Bureau," Is everything planned? Really?
","You know how it is. When someone tragically dies, you are supposed to think that it was God's will and we do not understand his plans. Or if you like, we can't understand the big picture, but there is a meaning behind all the suffering. In the Adjustment Bureau, the protagonist has the courage to ask if it is morally acceptable to make people suffer against their will, if it is your power not to do so. Shouldn't the plan be better? This is a pretty daring question in a theological context and would easily have led the questioner to lose his life in the past. Some would call it blasphemy even today. The short stories Philip K. Dick wrote back in the 1950's are a bit dated by now but they still inspire the best in American film making just as his novels of the 1960's do. The superior being who adjusts things on the ground to comply to his plans is called the Old Man in the original story, in the film the title is more bureaucratic, so it 's not clear if we are dealing with God, an AI or some other entity. It's your call. Einstein said that God does not play dice. But in the story and the film he certainly does so as his adjustment agents keep on tweaking the odds to keep his plan going. The first time around I didn't really like the film as I was having a hard time deciding if it was a sci-fi or a religious film or simply a romantic comedy with an unusual amount of action. So I decided to give it a second chance and the film began to make much more sense. Besides asking the viewer a lot of very difficult questions the film also incorporates a mighty romance. Normally I do not go for the romantic comedy genre, but Matt Damon and Emily Blunt act the parts in a Casablanca kind of manner. It's hard to define but if you have seen the film you already know what I mean. I never knew Matt Damon could be so intense. The scene where the couple accidentally meet in a men's rest room is absolutely thrilling to watch. As far as adaptations of Philip K. Dicks groundbreaking work go, the Adjustment Bureau has to be one of the most imaginative.",9,0,3,6 December 2017
In Time," Time is literally money in stylistically retro sci-fi flick
","Now hold on. This is supposed to be sci-fi, but instead of futuristic computer generated images what you get is cars, clothes and buildings made no later than the 1970´s or the early 1980´s at latest. The film takes place in 23rd century so what do we see here? In all likelihood this is what the writer-director Andrew Niccol had in mind. While taking place in the future, the entire film is made as if it was made way back in the past. Shot digitally it doesn´t look it. Slightly grainy look and reddish-brown, sometimes bluish coloration is just as if the whole thing had been shot in the early or mid seventies 16 or 35 mm film now aged and discolored. Same goes for editing, camera angles, the chase scenes, acting style and so on as well. The clothes, furniture and even the cups the characters drink from are from the sixties. Significantly there are no computers, no electronic devices hand-held or otherwise and no electronic displays of any kind in the film. The exceptions are the silly fluorescent remaining lifetime displays everyone has on their arms. The cars are supposedly souped-up with electrical engines but they sound more like the electrical toy cars of the sixties. Stylistically, if this was a film from the early seventies by say Kubrick of the Clockwork Orange period or Michael Crichton of the Andromeda Strain period, the only unusual aspect would be the novel basic idea of using remaining lifetime used as currency instead of money. In 2011 terms the plot may be simplistic at times but in 1971 the whole thing would have been really far out, man, cutting edge sci-fi. Obvious homage is being paid to Arthur Penn´s Bonnie and Clyde, the major film of the period about people on borrowed time. I thoroughly enjoyed my two-way time trip and the core matter of the plot, thought-provoking, utterly brutal economics of time running out, more deadly than money. A good reminder of one´s mortality, too, and that is more than most films have to offer. A satisfying film for a long-time movie freak but I do understand that it would be baffling for the uninitiated who see the dots but do not register the connections.",8,0,0,15 December 2017
Life," When humans have the losing hand
","The morning after seeing Life I woke up thinking about the plausibility of the storyline. The more I thought the more plausible it seemed. Usually it´s the other way around with U.S. alien films, especially those of the Alien lineage. Admittedly plausibility limits creativity, but Life at least seeks a balance between the two. The film speculates how a life form discovered out there, in this case Mars, might be difficult to contain. It does this in a seriously scary way, as the scientists at the International Space Station slowly begin to understand that the organism can and will outsmart them. It felt like being in a poker game and having all your money on the table, just to realize that you can´t beat the other guy after all. Many complain that the film follows well worn paths familiar from the Alien series, which would really be hard to avoid since the whole genre was begun back in 1979 by the original Alien film. I didn´t see this as a problem, to me Life tried to put some new life into the genre, so to say. Few seem to know the 2013 sci-fi film Europa Report, about a mission to seek life in our own solar system, which takes place in a ship very similar to ISS used in Life. Science in that film was if not 100 per cent accurate at least taken seriously. It almost seems that makers of Life have seen Europa Report and thought, hey, we can make a better movie with these premises. And they did a good job.",8,1,3,26 March 2018
