The Devil's Advocate," Vanity, my favorite sin
","The Devil's advocate is one of those movies you watch the first time just to see the climax, then with repeated viewing you pick up on the message of humanity and sin.  Al Pacino plays the role of Satan in a very powerful and believable manner. The exchange between Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino towards the end of the film may upset a few people's religious beliefs. Al Pacino as Satan really makes you think and nod your head in agreement.  Warning....Al Pacino is so convincing he may make some people start questioning their own beliefs.  Keanu Reeves is at his best when confronting Satan as if he is playing poker with him. In the end he succumbs to vanity as all humans do from time to time.  I think that Keanu portrayed the stages of Kevin Lomax well. He goes from a small town southern lawyer who never questions why he never loses a case, to a big city attorney who hears revelations from his mother about his father and sees his wife commit suicide. In the end, Kevin Lomax uses one of Satan's lines, 'free will', against him.  This is an excellent film worth seeing again and again.",9,40,46,21 February 2002
Monster," Anti Death Penalty movie
","Charlize Theron did an excellent job in the movie Monster and in my opinion deserves to be awarded the best actress award. My problem with the movie is that the majority of the focus of the movie was portraying her as the victim in a love relationship with another female. Sprinkled in the film was Charlize's character killing men as a prostitute for a few dollars. This was a movie based on a true story where Charlize's character was executed in Florida for all of her murders. In my opinion, whomever directed and produced this movie was trying to show the human side of murder and that she did not deserve the death penalty.  I realize that this was NOT a documentary, but it could have enhanced the real trial proceedings instead of covering it up with soft music.",6,1,2,16 February 2004
Lost in Translation," Nice Tokyo setting
","I have trouble understanding why this movie rates so high by both the members on this board and the critics who nominated it for Best Picture. What I liked about the movie was the view of modern Tokyo. The nice hotel, the nightclubs, the skyscrapers and the freeways. I did learn that in Japan, they also drive on the left side of the road. It does make me want to visit Tokyo on a tour someday.  That is what I enjoyed about the movie.",5,0,1,11 February 2004
Annie Hall," Good use of political incorrectness
",Annie Hall is a must see movie for anyone who likes one liners and politically incorrect humor.  Woody Allen does an excellent job in this film without coming across in a hateful manner.  We need more of these types of films. It seems that many of us get too sensitive over generalities not directly aimed at one individual. We all need to lighten up a bit on this type of humor. It's good medicine.,9,1,2,7 August 2003
Shine," Shine has a few clouds
","***************POSSIBLE SPOILIERS HERE******************************Shine was a good film but in my opinion, has a few holes that the viewer must assume to fill in the gaps. A film should try and title it's location, especially if it is out of the U.S. I'm assuming that Shine took place in Australia by the credits. Also, when a film goes back to someone's past, like in David's case, they should tell the audience how many years ago it was. The major hole in Shine is what exactly was David's disease?  One place I read said it was a nervous breakdown brought on by David's father and teachers. It seemed to me that it was a form of Parkinson's disease that gradually progressed over 15 years or so. The best part about Shine was the relationship between David and his strict father. David's father seemed worried more about losing his only son than what David could actually accomplish with his gift. It's too bad that the film didn't focus a little more attention on David's 'condition' and what the root cause of it was.",6,1,5,16 August 2003
Speed," Keanu is up to speed in this film
","After just watching this movie again for the first time in awhile, I can tell you what separates this movie from many others of the same type.  The growing relationship between Keanu and Sandra in this movie is top notch. They balance each others' personalities perfectly.  Also, Dennis H. reminded me of Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Keanu Reeves makes Jack Logan fight to stay focused and think quickly to keep up with the challenge.  I would like to see Keanu do more movies in which he acts in the law enforcement capacity.",9,0,0,28 January 2002
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," A most excellent history lesson dudes.
","This movie gets high marks for originality and creativity.  It was also the movie that put Keanu Reeves on the map. (no pun intended.)  13 years later, phrases made famous in this film are still being used today.  The title is often quoted substituting current names.  NO WAY, be excellent to each other, all we are is dust in the wind, and party on dudes, are some of the catchy sayings from that film.   Bill and Ted must time travel to the past and learn about history so they can pass their final exam.  In the process, they bring back the actual characters from the past to present day California.  Characters such as Socrates, Napoleon, and Abraham Lincoln are suddenly walking around shopping malls and bowling alleys.  What makes this funny is that Bill and Ted are a couple of goof balls when it comes to school.   Ted, (Keanu Reeves), cannot even pronounce the names of these characters correctly. The film is extremely funny and both Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are actually believable doing their goof ball routine.  I only wish the film could have devoted a little more time to the historical characters wandering around in present day California.  The film portrays that laid back suburban airhead stereotype pretty well when the historical characters introduce themselves to the locals.  At one point, Bill's mom, when introduced to the likes of Socrates and Abraham Lincoln, says `nice to meet you;' as if they were just other ordinary people.   The bottom line, if you like history, you will love this movie.  In general, I do not care for comedy films where the plot is ridiculous, but credit goes to both the actors and the writers in this film to make someone like myself enjoy it.",7,0,0,16 September 2002
The Thin Red Line," Not a good war movie
","I guess after seeing Saving Private Ryan, I thought that The Thin Red Line would be almost as good, considering its length.  With a cast that includes George Clooney, Nick Nolte, John Cusack and John Travolta, one would expect more. I think I understand that the point of the movie is having the characters display their inner struggle with war and in one good case, authority. Not that there is anything wrong with that; its just that I didn't expect all three hours to be devoted to that theme.
****POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE****************Very little is mentioned on the location of the film with the exception of the map of Guadacanal. It seems that this theme would have been much better done in a Vietnam type of setting. The scene where a body is split into two by a possible land mine is isolated from the rest of the movie.
In summary, it seems like a waste of time with the great cast of characters and the length of the film.",4,1,2,31 January 2004
