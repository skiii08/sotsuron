The King's Speech," Always hated Colin Firth BUT...
","This movie is OUTSTANDING. And so is Colin Firth, I freely admit! The film I saw previous to The King's Speech was Tron Legacy, and this movie had more tension in the first two minutes than Tron had in its entirety. And after that, The King's Speech just gets better and better. If anyone had told me that a movie about a guy stammering could be this good, I would never have believed them. Seriously - you have to see it with your own eyes, because it sounds pretty lousy. Colin Firth is astonishing, but every other part is played to perfection and Geoffrey Rush is superb.Moving, funny, dramatic and compelling throughout. Deserves every award it picks up and - for once - the huge score it's getting on IMDb.",10,2,5,24 January 2011
Changeling," Vastly overrated treatment of an amazing story
","I liked this movie less and less the longer it went on. Eastwood is an interesting director but his biggest fault lies in his inability to see the woods for the trees. Like the latter-day Spielberg, he just can't bear to end the movie or at least cut out scenes which stretch the patience. There are long, tedious swathes of this movie (the hearings at the end, the trial of the killer) which could have been drastically edited or (in the case of the outcome of the hearings) cut completely and dealt with in text at the end of the movie or in a far more succinct denouement.Conversely, there are parts of the story dealt with so briefly that they are simply confusing. The reason why a small boy would pretend to be a missing child, how he got the idea and who encouraged him are inadequately provided, and the solitary scene of the boy being left as collateral in a diner is scant compensation.It's a testament to the slightly unfocused film that I felt it necessary to read more about the real case online when I got home, just to fill in the gaps. In my e-travels I found an interview with the screenwriter who says he didn't want to glorify the heinous crimes which formed part of the story, but wanted to focus on the personal tale of Christine Collins and her disappeared son. That's all very well, but it was only really in the scenes involving the crimes that the film really felt alive and driven, instead of melodramatic and pedantic. If I had to see Angelina Jolie slap her heart and shout 'I want MY son!' one more time, I'd had have wanted a refund. Or earplugs.Jolie has had loads of plaudits for her role and she was good - but I found her lips so distracting that I can hardly judge. Against a muted 'period' palette, her scarlet protuberances - often in the act of grief-induced quivering - intrude like two giant red jellies in a pot of porridge.This is not a bad film - parts of it are very good and some of it is shocking. But someone needs to let Clint Eastwood know the line between drama and melodrama, taking time and tedium, and attention to detail and pedantry.I would have given it a 6 but I'm giving it a 5 in an effort to drag the ridiculously high score down to a sensible level as quickly as possible.",5,37,62,19 December 2008
3:10 to Yuma," A good, honest western
","This is not a film that exceeds its Western genre, but it sits so nice and firmly in the saddle of that genre that I give it a solid 8.The script is really pared down and careful. It's written like a 1950s/60s Western - with honesty and a nice lack of fussiness. Russell Crowe's outlaw is the more seductive of the two leads but Christain Bale's scrawny, uncertain wannabe hero is the more interesting.The film almost careens over a cliff of Shane-style cliché surrounding Bale's rebellious son, but does just manage to avoid that fall with good casting of the boy and the downbeat ending, which is nonetheless satisfying.It's a pleasure to watch a Western that doesn't cave in to postmodern winks at itself, inappropriate humour or over-staged violence. Instead, 3.10 to Yuma rides quietly and unpretentiously into town, does its job with honour, and disappears into a well-deserved sunset.",8,1,2,28 September 2007
Star Trek," Can't imagine anyone being disappointed (SPOILER AT END WITH WARNING)
","FINALLY a spin-off/update/remake/tribute/big-screen version of a much loved TV show that DOESN'T disappoint. I'd become so disenchanted with such so-called blockbusters but Star Trek is an absolute thrill from beginning to end. There's a pretty seamless weaving of ST lore with really nicely observed prequel characterisations of all the main characters.The best thing about this movie though, is the wonderful casting, which makes you believe completely that these characters ARE the younger versions of Spock, Kirk and Bones. Its not often the Casting Director gets kudos in a feature, but this is one who deserves as many plaudits as the director or stars themselves. It is absolutely immaculate casting, and the actors have then improved on their basic similarities with lovely, understated but wholly authentic body-language, facial expressions and tonal inflections which are a joy to watch. Simon Pegg as Scottie didn't really convince me as a precursor to the dour Scot we all know and love, but was fun nonetheless and delivered some classic lines with gusto.The plot rolls along and there's a good mixture of action and character development.HERE COMES THE LITTLE SPOILER ***** The ONLY bum note in the whole movie is the weird, unmotivated Spock/Uhura kissing! It makes Uhura look like a slut and brings Spock too far down to human level. It really jolted me out of my suspension of disbelief.Other than that, an absolute belter!",9,3,8,13 May 2009
Argo," Better than I expected. BY FAR ;-)
","I'm not a great fan of Ben Affleck as an actor OR as a director. Plus, the publicity pix for this movie makes it look like yet another dull/ridiculous Ben Affleck spy/cop thriller.Not so. Argo is a really well written, well directed, gripping movie, that spins easily between high drama and sharp wit. The fact that it's based on a true story is an added bonus.Not only is the movie very enjoyable and tightly produced, but it's shot like one of those great 70s thrillers, like The China Syndrome or The Taking of Pelham 123. From the film stock to the production design, Affleck really covers every possible base in making a great looking period piece set in 1979 Iran.Alan Arkin is glorious as the producer and there are some good laughs amid the tension, but in the scenes in Iran, it was easy to forget I was watching a movie, because it felt so authentic.I came out feeling smarter. Is there any higher praise?",9,3,5,22 November 2012
Superbad," Funny in places - but needs its mouth washed out with soap
","I was a bit disappointed with this movie. The trailer was very funny. Unfortunately, they should have let the trailer-makers edit the movie because some of the lines and scenes that were so sharp in the trailer fell a bit flat in the film in their slightly longer versions. Superbad would still be a superior movie to something like American Pie EXCEPT for the fact that it's just so pointlessly, grossly, disgusting in places. I KNOW these are high school kids; I KNOW they MAY talk like that to each other, BUT THAT ALONE DOESN'T MAKE IT FUNNY! A smart writer should be turning that foul-mouthed rubbish into something witty and insightful, not just repeating it verbatim. And having a running gag about a guy getting period blood on his leg is just not amusing unless you're drunk, under 16, or - apparently - a teen-flick maker in Hollywood today. Have some restraint, for god's sake guys!I have to look at the common link with The 40-Year-Old Virgin - Judd Apatow. Like Superbad, that movie also really demeaned itself by indulging in some truly repulsive language and imagery early on, and therefore never really rose above that to be what it should - and could - have been: a clever, original, side-splitter. Learn the lesson Judd - there are very few worthwhile comedies that can recover from the random, gratuitous and wholly unamusing use of the C word. After that point, the whole movie is always going to be scrambling to try to make up for itself.",6,3,10,28 September 2007
Nacho Libre," Shocking waste of talent
","As a fan of writer Mike White, I was really looking forward to this movie but it was so bad I'm still reeling. First let me say that the director did a great job in one respect. The film looks amazing, so hats off to the cinematographer and art director too. It's shot like a Mexican Amelie, with the same scenic eccentricity. It has a beautiful and engaging visual style and the wrestling scenes are well choreographed. Where the film falls woefully short is in the script and the casting of Jack Black. It comes over like a film that was written as a rather whimsical little oddity and then suddenly bumped up to Hollywood 'comedy' status as a vehicle for Jack Black. In so doing, any subtlety or gentle comedy that may have been present originally has been trampled by JB at his mugging, farting, sophomoric worst. I think Black has his place in film, but this sure ain't it. He plays the wrestling-mad priest with the heart of gold like something from The Dukes of Hazzard. Maybe he knows there's not a funny line to be had in the whole debacle, because he mugs and flails throughout, trying to make his perm and his fat gut work the room for him. The film itself grabs desperately for a fingerhold on funny, it'll take it any way it can get it - relying on Black's Mexican accent, random farts and a frantic soundtrack to try to bolster a story crying out for the human touch. The tacked-on 'relationships' are by-the-numbers and without a single iota of authenticity. The whole thing plays like a sketch that would have been pushing the envelope of humour at two minutes, forget two hours. I can understand children finding it fun, and adults who accompany children to movies they find funny usually get a buzz out of that, so on that basis I gave it a 2. But miscasting AND poor writing is a double whammy that no film can recover from - and I don't think the director is to blame. It's not that the lines aren't hitting the comedy mark - they just aren't funny in the first place. It's truly tragic to watch so much hard work and talent - not to mention money - go to waste. Oooh it's shocking!",2,3,6,27 February 2007
Life of Pi," Disappointing and confused
","I haven't read Life of Pi, and feel that being too faithful to the book may have been where screenwriter David Magee went wrong.At its heart it seems to be a simple story - an allegory about a boy and a tiger that masks an horrific experience on board a drifting lifeboat. However, the structure of the piece means that when the truth is finally relayed in the film, all its impact is lost in the confusion of what has gone before. Instead of shock, I felt only irritation that the two-hour allegory had been so unambiguous and had given no hints to the truth which - for maximum effect - should have immediately become apparent in the telling of the second story. So instead of feeling illuminated by the end, I felt cheated and disappointed.Visually it's gorgeous, the acting is first rate, the CGI seamless and the 3D is nice enough, but the movie drags in several places (the mangrove island is just pretty padding) and although the animals portrayed are CGI versions, they are so realistic that I was more upset by the scenes of their slaughter than I was when that was related to the deaths of real people. I would not take a child to see this movie without considering the scenes of animal suffering. Just because they are CGI animals does not make it less traumatic.All in all, a disappointing trip to the movies, where I felt the writer and director lost sight of the most important emotional arc and thereby diminished any impact at the end which would have made up for a rather slow - if beautiful - film.",5,33,59,26 December 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Don't buy the Emperor's new clothes.
","Users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with. Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.From the first, BU is just a chase film. We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no time 'wasted' on plot, character development, or boring old reality.If you haven't see the other two Bourne films, you're pretty lost. If you have - you only WISH you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema.Paul Greengrass's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on United 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen, but on Bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character. He runs. He jumps. He punches. He gets blown up. He clears tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he SURVIVES. He survives like a plastic Action Man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension. So he drives off a building? So what? He'll survive. Yawn.There's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor. I've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet.Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie. He was turned into a killing machine. Big deal. He finds out his true identity. So what? It doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes.The 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, the more I think about this film the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! I'd better end now before the slide continues.I love a good action flick and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither. It's a loud, tedious series of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. The idea that it 'shows the way' to the Bond franchise is utter crap. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.",4,61,104,23 August 2007
Baby Driver," Stupidest film I've ever seen - and I've seen Prometheus
","I must be stupid.I feel like I just handed over the family cow for a handful of magic beans. I saw the trailer for Baby Driver and thought it looked dreadful. But I was still stupidly suckered into seeing the whole movie by the post-truth IMDb score and enthusiastic reviews from trusted sources.They're dead to me now.I've enjoyed Edgar Wright's work in the past but Baby Driver is the puerile fantasy of a twelve-year-old boy. It's a fantasy where bopping along the street in tune to your 'beatz' makes you look super-cool instead of like an attention-seeking tosser, where simply not talking has the power to turn a pudgy-faced teenager into Robert Mitchum, where the hot waitress falls inexplicably in love with you before you've even ordered a Coke, and where driving at full speed into the back of a lorry in a crash that kills both your parents, leaves you with only two cool little scars and a slight ringing in the ears, instead of hideously squashed and sucking soup through a straw for the rest of your life.It's also cool - when you're a getaway driver - to drive very very fast and with a lot of squealing tyres and crashes - even when your shitty driving is the only reason the police are chasing you in the first place. God forbid you should just mirror, signal, manoeuvre - and disappear quietly into traffic. God forbid you should just... GET AWAY!There are so many ridiculous inconsistencies, unlikely coincidences, dumb actions and unintentionally hilarious lines in this film that I kept expecting Leslie Nielsen to pop up and make a beaver joke.Baby Driver has tinnitus which comes and goes as the plot requires (or not - either is fine). He has an endless supply of iPods and sunglasses - as one pair is slapped off his face, he pulls another from his sleeve like Paul Daniels on a sunbed. Baby Driver is an orphan but he cares deeply (aka shallowly) for his foster dad who is black AND disabled AND deaf, which is like the Cliff Notes way to Create Sympathy. But it still doesn't work. Baby's not sympathetic. Or heroic. Or sexy. Or even a good getaway driver.Likwise, Kevin Spacey's Doc is supposed to be 'the best' at putting together tip-top teams for heists, and yet he employs a series of infantile squabblers who all resent the hell out of the toddler-of-mystery that is Baby Driver.Throughout the film, Doc has Baby Driver in a brutal iron grip - threatening to break his legs and slaughter everybody he loves. But then he wilts like spinach at the sight of Baby Driver with his instant girlfriend and within seconds showers them with money, tells them to get away and 'never look back' and - in the grand emotional fulcrum of the whole movie - reveals: 'I was in love once'. Another one for Cliff Notes, I think.In short, Baby Driver is a stupid film where stupid people do stupid things while saying stupid lines to each other.Avoid at all costs unless you're a twelve-year-old boy.A stupid one.",Null,19,44,28 June 2017
No Country for Old Men," Good but not vintage Coens
","But good Coen brothers is still a damned good night out at the movies, right? No Country for Old Men falls somewhere between Blood Simple and Fargo, with the gritty gore of the first and the dark humour of the second. But somehow the gore's too casual to be really interesting or shocking, and the humour's not quite sharp enough to make this a funny film to match Fargo.It IS good. But I think the huge score here on IMDb really reflects the sheer relief of seeing the Coens back in the swing of what they do best post-Ladykillers.NCFOM is deceptively simple, giving the characters room to develop and breathe in that unique Coen way. However, apart from the fantastic sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, none of them are quite up to scratch.The killer is menacing, sure, but is SO relentless that I felt some of the threat dissipate, rather than increase. His indestructibility leaches some hard reality from the film.Most of the parts are played wonderfully, with mostly no-name actors acquitting themselves well in possession of a very good script. The exception is the usually reliable Woody Harrelson, whose part here is two-dimensional, and who fails to convince in any context.Personally I felt the absence of a smart plot turn. The Coens always offer up the unexpected, but here those twists are mostly about the characters, rather than the story. From a duo who built their early career on clever convolutions, this feels just a bit lazy.All in all, this is a workmanlike, rather than inspired, effort from the Coens. But it still kicks most other movies' butts.",8,1,3,25 January 2008
District 9," Something different in scifi
","District 9 is uneven in places but basically a very innovative, enjoyable movie.The documentary style perfectly suits the near-future world where aliens have visited the planet and been coralled into townships around Johannesburg. Obviously the whole premise is based on Apartheid South Africa's treatment of its native population, and this really gives another level to the movie.The lead - Wikus Van Der Merwe - is the best anti-hero in any movie I've seen in 20 years. The bumbling fool who is given an important job because of family connections is perfectly played. There are laughs aplenty - particularly if you have any knowledge of South Africa and its inhabitants - and the plot and pacing are really tight.At the end District 9 does succumb somewhat to Matrix-style shoot-em-ups, but is redeemed by the bittersweet ending.All in all, a remarkably original and entertaining flick.",8,1,3,22 October 2009
2012," One of the best worst movies I've ever seen
","I hate to love it, and I love to hate it! 2012 is AWESOME in all respects. Awesome special effects and awesome disregard for science, script, originality and simple common sense.My boyfriend and I must have looked like Al Jolson as we sat simultaneously open mouthed and rolling our eyes at the astonishing CGI and the laughable cod-science on offer, including mutating neutrinos, underfloor microwave heating (but no apparent increase in the air temperature!), dodgy political shorthand and grand larceny from every disaster movie from The Towering Inferno onwards.The effects are preposterously over the top and fantastic, with no road left uncracked, no plane able to fly higher than danger, no city too big to upend and slip into the sea like a punctured lilo. The destruction of LA is wanton and wonderful, with palm trees and piers disappearing before your very eyes, and the downtown area immeasurably improved by falling into a large hole.Then it's on to Vegas, and one can't help thinking there's something of the Sodom and Gomorrah in the glee of both cities' total annihilation.Similarly, the only moral of the story - if one can be found under the rubble - seems to be 'Plastic Surgery is Bad', as everyone involved in a particular boob job comes to an unpleasant end.John Cusack is a great actor and without his inclusion this movie would have been even more stupid, but he always manages to inject a bit of intelligence and humour, even into the Apocalypse. Good on yer John! There's an extraordinarily hackneyed 'plot' about a hopeless dad reconnecting with his kids during a disaster - a role already played once to good effect by Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds. Sadly it seems that nowadays - according to Hollywood - it takes Armageddon to make men grow up and take a bit of responsibility. The moral maze created in this particular instance (where the caring, loving, hardworking stepfather meets an unexpectedly unjust death merely to facilitate rekindled romance for Our Hero) is too tangled to be tackled in a mere review. Along with the patchwork science, it really needs a thesis to do it justice. Suffice to say, you've seen it all before, just not as big or as loud or as clichéd.The script has a few funny lines (mostly from Cusack) but they are overwhelmed by many hundreds more which were predictable, familiar, and downright dumb.The unintentionally hilarious moments include someone yelling about a job being 'a SUICIDE mission' - right before a ten year old boy manages to pull it off with a torch and a deep breath - and the brilliant geologist volunteering to fix a stuck gate on a trillion-dollar ship because, of course, scientific and mechanical knowledge is 100% interchangeable.Anyway, you get the picture. Take a friend you can laugh about it with afterwards, but I guarantee that during the show your eyes will be popping!",7,4,6,19 November 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," if you don't expect too much, you won't be disappointed
","Unlike some other reviewers of Silver Surfer, I didn't expect this sequel to improve on the first film. In my opinion, sequels rarely do. In these super-hero flicks it's ALWAYS more fun to see the initial changes taking place, the fish-out-of-water elements unfolding etc.However, Silver Surfer still manages to be an action-packed, fun and pretty human story, with the 'still-adjusting' bit coming in the form of Invisible Girl and Mr Fantastic trying to tie the knot while threats to the planet interfere with their tux hire and seating arrangements. There are some cool stunts and good lines and it's always just nice to find that someone's taken a bit of care over a sequel.Ioan Gruffudd looks much more confident in his role than in the first movie; only Michael Chiklis is a little under-used in this film.I rented the first movie because I was not sure it would be worth seeing at the cinema, but I happily paid to go and see this film and didn't feel I'd had anything but value for money.",6,1,3,6 August 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rare combo of tasteless and boring
","I'm at a loss. The book was so dull I couldn't finish it, and decided to watch the movie instead to discover the 'amazing' characters and 'gripping' plot everyone's talking about.I can't work out whodunit in an episode of Miss Marple, but even I was ahead of the protagonists. The thought that this was a murder mystery that had flummoxed the greatest brains in Sweden for 40 years was laughable. Clunky plot, ridiculous clues, convenient misidentifications - this has got the lot.The only things I can see that mark this film/book out as being in the slightest bit different from average TV-movie fare is the completely gratuitous sex scenes.I'm not the kind of person who says 'I'm no prude but...' BUT The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like a middle-aged man's nasty sex fantasies mixed with humdrum missing persons case. It even features that most pathetic of porn titillations - the lesbian who only really needs a good man to convert her (and presumably to get her to leave her live-in girlfriend who's completely disposable, of course). By the end, the edgy, rather ugly, punky lesbo Lisbeth is even transformed by a blonde wig, spiky shoes and some golden backlighting. Presumably so that the plain-as-a-potato saggy hero has a PROPER trophy for all his daring journalism. Effing dire.On top of that it's packed full of clichés and cardboard cut-out characters. The much touted Lisbeth Salander is vaguely interesting until she decides randomly to have sex with the hero - a decision so out of character for a lesbian abuse victim that it would be laughable if it wasn't so insulting.I couldn't watch this film without thinking of the millions of people who have been conned into thinking they are reading/watching some kind of breakthrough master of crime at work. I also couldn't help thinking that I'm happy Stieg Larsson is dead so he can't profit from his tedious claptrap.A really unlikeable film, and I despair for the world.",1,30,63,22 October 2010
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," overrated!
","It says a lot about this movie that Jim Carrey was the best thing in it. Usually I find him unwatchable but he's really good in this film.Unfortunately the rest of it is a bit disappointing for fans of Charlie Kaufmann's previous work. It's too disjointed and makes the same points again and again and Kate Winslet's character is so irritating! Talk about role reversal. People walked out of the screening I was in. It's not all bad - there's some wonderful dialogue and it's not dire, just not great. Can't believe it has such a high rating and can only imagine it's a hangover from Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, both of which were so innovative and clever.",5,0,2,15 May 2004
The World's Fastest Indian," Girls enjoy motorcycle movie - Shock!
","A friend and I went to see this movie with some trepidation as neither of us wanted to see some boy-toy rubbish about piston rods. But the IMDb reviews were so good that we decided to take a chance. We were both so glad we did! Not only is this movie entertaining from start to finish, but it features one of Anthony Hopkins greatest ever performances (which is saying something) and was laugh-out-loud funny to boot! Hopkins depiction of Munro was immaculate. the movie left me wishing I'd known the man, and Hopkins perfectly captures the unpretentious, friendly character of many New Zealanders which made Munro an innocent abroad when he took his bike to the Bonneville Salt Flats. I wondered how Roger Donaldson was going to make this movie interesting, but it's really gripping throughout. Munro's character has a lot to do with it, but it's also more of a road movie than a film about motorcycling. Munro's journey from his garden shed to the record books is a delight and an inspiration. There are some terrifically funny lines in this film which emerge simply from Munro's down- to-earth character. The audience we saw it with was really amused. We didn't expect it to be so funny. As usual, the only downside is that this film doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves. If I hadn't seen the IMDb reviews and just returned from a trip to NZ myself, I would have missed the best movie of the year so far. All involved with the making of this film deserve the highest praise.",10,12,12,22 March 2006
Jack Reacher," Tom too short to walk tall
","I'm not an all-out fan, but I've defended Tom Cruise for years on the basis of great acting in movies like Magnolia and Rain Man, so I was prepared to suspend disbelief while he acted six foot five.Unfortunately, for the first time ever, his height bothered me. And the fact that it must have bothered him might explain why Jack Reacher pulls its punches on the the smart/funny front and descends predictably into a shoot-em-up. A more secure - oh let's face it, a TALLER - actor could have pulled off the Man of Mystery thing, but Tom Cruise JUST CAN'T. He has the look of a well-scrubbed, well-fed farm boy who's been working out in the barn, not a dangerous lone-wolf drifter, appearing from the mist to solve crime with his intellect and his fists. Without that definitive central characterisation, Jack Reacher could only have saved itself with a cracking plot and sparkling humour - making Cruise taller with knowing wit. There are a few stabs at it, but Tom Cruise is out of his depth here and he's not even in the deep end. Instead he flails for the lifesaver of fast cars and big guns, while the plot is only workmanlike. His skills as an actor are redundant, and in their absence, he's exposed in the spotlight and found wanting by ten inches.Everything else about the movie is standard fare. Rosamund Pike does her usual deer-caught-in-the headlights thing. To keep Cruise seeming sexy in the absence of sex, she's required to be a lawyer but with a very low neckline. More headlights-caught-in-the-headlights. It's distracting to everyone but Cruise, who's not tall enough to look down her cleavage.I don't know how Lee Child handled the plot, but it's spoilt here by having the reveal right up front, which is an unusual technique when you then have Jack Reacher take 50 minutes to reveal what you already knew.The action is generally poor, with Cruise looking dumber and dumber as the film goes on. He walks backwards out of doors into crowbars and chooses the loudest possible method of sneaking up on villains. More than once his well laid plans depend on slapstick crooks and trained killers who can't shoot straight. Werner Herzog is a comic-book baddie who chewed off his own fingers to stay alive in a gulag. Not sure quite how he got into construction after that, but this part of the plot/motivation is so weak it's more like an afterthought and doesn't matter. In smarter hands, even Tom Cruise could have made us believe he was Jack Reacher, by embracing his lack of height and making it work in his favour. But the flashy attempts to distract us from his stature only makes us think about it constantly.The trailer-makers knew what the film should have been - a roller-coaster of thrills and laughs and original, quirky moments. Sadly, it's more like the teacups.",6,2,8,9 January 2013
30 Days of Night," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","Oh! this film's so bad! What a waste of resources! I was lured into the cinema by the presence of Danny Huston after eye-catching performances in Ivans XTC and The Constant Gardener but how he got mixed up in this is anyone's guess. To give him credit, he is the best thing about this movie.But he's so outweighed by rubbish there's no redemption. The plot has got more holes in it than Dracula with cavities. The script is deplorable. The editing is so fast and annoying that I wanted to hit Pause. And - once you've seen a whole vampire - the tension is non-existent, and the film relies on gore and jumps for the duration. The most ridiculous of MANY plot devices is that - after enduring 29 days and 16 hours of vampire hell (even though it seems about as hellish by the end as it did at the beginning - nothing is made of the sheer hardship that would have been faced, even without vampires lurking) Josh Hartnett decides that NOW is the time to turn himself into a vampire to give his wife a chance to escape.Not only does turning himself into a vampire barely even make him a better fighter, but when he DOES create a decoy, the silly bint doesn't even take her chance to run away! She just stands and watches him. That's gratitude for you.And THEN to add dumb insult to already itchy injury, Josh manages to suppress his new vampiric urges long enough to kill himself rather than rip her throat out. The action jumps about without motive (including a convenient jerk from 'Day 7' to 'Day 27') the snow is wasted; the dark is wasted; the few clever things they do are wasted; the actors are wasted saying stupid, corny things. Any movie which includes in its first scene an actor slitting his eyes around the horizon and saying: 'Who would DO such a thing?' in response to some incinerated mobile phones, is a movie worth rushing out of immediately to get your money back. Sadly, I stayed put.HOWEVER. In the interests of fairness, the overhead shot of the vampire attack is wonderful and the vampire make up is genuinely scary. I give it 1 mark for each of those things.",2,114,243,4 November 2007
There Will Be Blood," Curious.
","This is an interesting film. Interesting in a very broad sense. For a start, it's been praised beyond its worth. Why? It's very slow and very meaningful and it seems that slow and meaningful is the Emperor's New Clothes when it comes to modern movie audiences. To glance at your watch is sacrilege; to question any aspect of its import is lowbrow.I did like There Will Be Blood. I just didn't love it. It has moments of real quality - every one of which is about Daniel Day Lewis, whose own performance in this movie really can't be overstated. He is a towering presence here, even handling the rather clumsy ending with real commitment and passion. Although I ultimately wasn't bowled over by the destination, I was 100 per cent there with DDL throughout the journey.The film charts a man's spiral from integrity to madness but the most interesting arc is Daniel's relationship with his son. Dillon Freasier as HW is a great foil for DDL's Daniel, and his rejection by his 'father' is horrible and real. Although, strangely, I found no part of this film genuinely moving. There's a detachment throughout which is only alleviated in a single brief flashback to the relationship the boy once enjoyed with his father.Otherwise, Daniel's character is peeled like an onion, but I didn't feel any single revelation was truly momentous. Instead we get a series of insights which I was surprised was deemed to be sufficient to build into Daniel's ultimate disintegration. His reunion with his young son is so fierce and then we leap forward to the boy's marriage and everything's fallen apart. We're left to fill in the gaps for ourselves, which is less than satisfying when the demise of that relationship is pivotal to the film.There Will Be Blood is a bit long and I found myself shifting in my seat and welcoming the end credits.As so often, don't believe the hype and you'll enjoy the film. Believe it and you might be a bit baffled.",7,2,7,12 February 2008
Arrival," Definitive proof that it IS better to travel....
","A derivative and unsatisfying film in which giant intergalactic squid travel through space and time, only to be sorely disappointed by Amy Adams with an Etch-a-Sketch. Close Encounters still blows this clean out of the fishbowl.",4,1,4,22 February 2020
Parasite," A film without a heart
","Two families exploit each other with dire consequences. Beautifully shot and well acted, but devoid of emotional engagement. Little comedy, horror or tension and at no point did I care about anybody involved - which amounts to a wasted trip to the cinema, in my book. Very disappointing, given that it beat some truly exceptional films to the Oscar.",4,5,17,22 February 2020
Music and Lyrics," leave your street cred at the door and enjoy
","This movie is only really worth six out of 10 but I'm giving it seven to make up for pre- judging it! I mean, what's not to pre-judge? Hugh Grant. Drew Barrymore. Dopey rom-com. Happy ending. But I guess it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it (the mantra on which Grant seems to have built his entire career). However, just as in Miss Congeniality, Marc Lawrence manages to take high-concept crap and turn it into a good night out at the movies. Hugh and Drew bounce off each other, with greater honours going to Hugh Grant for his total lack of ego in even considering a role where he's made to look so hilariously stupid. The plot is not important (which is lucky cos it's fluffy rubbish), but the leads - ably supported by Brad Garrett, Kristen Johnston and Hayley Bennett - just careen about having a great time with some very funny lines and scenes. The movie even manages to make a point by popping (no pun intended) the bubble of pretension that means some people look down on the creators of three-minute singles. Sure, you wouldn't want to be photographed coming out of this movie, but at least if you do it will probably be with a silly grin on your face.",7,0,1,22 July 2007
Prometheus," Where no idiot has gone before
","Prometheus is the story of a trillion-dollar mission to discover the origins of human life on a distant planet. Basically, this is supposed to be the greatest exploration undertaken in the history of mankind.So who do they send? A gaggle of fractious goons whose collective scientific nous is rivalled only by that of the Three Stooges. Within minutes of touching down (conveniently beside the only 'man-made' structures on the planet, a'la 1960s Star Trek) the 'scientists' are yanking off their helmets, on the basis of 'it seems fine to me', dipping their fingers into strange organic ooze, and lugging a severed alien head back to an unquarantined spaceship in a sandwich bag.Once there, they speedily discover the meaning of life. Then, while one of them gets a bit drunk, his two female companions decide it would be useful to stimulate the head electrically to reanimate it. They don't say why. They give it a bit too much juice, then too little,then dither over too much or too little like a couple of schoolgirls fiddling with a dicky bunsen burner, while the most important scientific discovery in human history waggles its ears and rolls its eyes - before eventually blowing up like a frog in a microwave.Are the scientists abashed? Is the man angry? Do they all calm down and remember they have degrees in clever things, not diplomas in macramé? Do they heck.The WHOLE MOVIE is a litany of ludicrous so-called science, schoolboy errors, and pseudo-profundity about the origin of species. Ironic really, when none of the crew would have a chance in hell in any sort of contest governed by Darwinian rules.Crass stupidity is rampant in every department. Hi-tech helmets record every heartbeat - apparently until anything worth recording happens; stranded crewmates are abandoned to their fate in favour of a quick shag, and the spaceship door is opened to anyone who comes a-knocking. Although, after hitting the 'welcome' button, Idris Elba does do a double take and go 'Hold on a second!' but that might have just been an involuntary ad lib at his own character's baffling idiocy.There is spectacular cinematography and effects, but not one iota of originality has been squandered on plot, subtext, tension or characters - which are as shallow as the Prometheus's muddy little gene pool.Ridley Scott is a hero of mine, but Prometheus is not the intelligent, emotionally satisfying prequel that Alien deserves. It's a derisory, empty experience - and anyone who loved Alien is surely too old and too smart to be fobbed off with something this bad just because it's shiny.",1,2159,2750,5 June 2012
Casino Royale," One in the eye for the critics of Daniel Craig - myself included!
","Okay, so it's a Bond film and there's only so much you can expect from what has become a tired franchise. But Casino Royale gives the whole series a kick in the pants by getting back to the gritty down-and-dirty Bond of Fleming's original books.Daniel Craig is a revelation. After all the flak he took on the run-up to the release of this movie he must be rolling in I-Told-You-So's. He's sharp, sexy, funny and human, and a wonderful antidote to the foppish, anal Pierce Brosnan.The plot is minimal, but the action is original, fast and furious (without being gratuitous or boring), Bond is fresh and he and the Bond girl are believable as people of the 21st century. The script is sharp by Bond standards and authentic too.The movie really gives the feeling that we can expect the whole Bond movie experience to enjoy an upsurge over the next few years, because those of us who'd got bored by the whole tired thing will be going back to the cinema in droves.Kudos all round!",8,3,6,28 November 2006
Toy Story 3," GREAT movie but too scary for small children
","This movie really has it all - belly-laughs, wonderful animation, sly observation - the list goes on. But it's also extremely frightening in places and I wouldn't want to be the mother of a five year old during - or for several years after - taking it to see this film! There is a real air of threat hanging over our trusty Toys for much of the film, and some genuinely dark and scary villains. Of course, children's films have long been peopled by menacing characters - the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Cruella Deville etc - but the baddies in Toy Story 3 have less of the cartoon and more of the nightmare about them, and I found them quite chilling.It's also a bit of a tear-jerker on several levels - for adults as well as children! - and if you take children to this one, expect to deal with the fallout of tears and fears for a while afterwards! Also, the movie's 3D version is a big waste of money. The most noticeable thing in 3D was the subtitles, and I wouldn't waste my money on the extra expense of a 3D experience on this one.Despite all the dire warnings above though, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It was more emotionally involving than any live-action film I've seen this year. It's a very long time since I actually GASPED in a movie! Toy Story 3 is a winner all the way.",10,2,2,12 August 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," the best no-brainer action flick of the year?
","How much more world weary can Bruce Willis get in his role as super-cop John Maclean? How many more times can he survive car crashes, bullets, strafing, falls off tall buildings, kung-fu killers and explosions that demolish entire apartments yet leave him with only a slight, short-lived limp? This Die Hard has thrown caution, reason, logic, human physiology and budgetary restraint to the winds - and is so much better for it! It's like the producers and Willis have given up any semblance of reality and just gone for some of the most staggering stunts and action sequences I've ever seen - and lots of them look non-CGI enough to make you really grip the armrests. The direction of all the action is fantastic, the script is just this side of laughable and the characters are just about human enough to make you give a damn.The first half of the movie is really something, with good old fashioned stunts dominating, but the whole thing takes a turn for the dumb after that with Willis the target of various killers (who always leave him alive just a second longer than they should have), and even more various death machines, big trucks and faulty infrastructure. The stunts then become so over the top that they lose any credibility and the last 20 minutes of the film are ho-hum. But loud ho-hum. My biggest criticism of this and similar franchises is that characters go through stuff that would leave them crippled in a heartbeat and yet somehow manage to defy death or even hangnails. It severs any illusion of reality and makes what could have been an exciting sequence merely laughable. I certainly laughed more at Die Hard 4.0 than I did at The Simpsons movie. It is truly ludicrous in places. The hi-tech computer-controlled premise of the film is interesting but, presumably for reasons of billing, had to give way to the low-tech Willis machismo. Still, it made for a different and original backdrop for an above-average action flick.",7,1,3,5 August 2007
Moonrise Kingdom," Innocent, beautiful and brilliant fun
","Despite the dreadful title, Moonrise Kingdom is simply wonderful. Since his flying start with Bottle Rocket and the triumph of Rushmore, I felt that Wes Anderson had rather tottered off a true path. The Royal Tenenbaums was hit and miss, The Darjeeling Limited was too twee, and The Life Aquatic was simply AWFUL. I take against ANY film that wastes Bill Murray.Moonrise Kingdom doesn't repeat that error. Despite covering ground Anderson's already visited to an extent in Rushmore, MK looks at a teenage crush with fresh eyes, and surrounds it with a fantastic cast of oddballs and misfits. Unlike his films where the characters are irritatingly quirky for the sake of it, these oddballs seem organic to their strange island home. Star among them is Ed Norton as Scout Master Ward, who looks as if he's having the time of his life in shorts and woggles, in charge of a troop described as 'beige lunatics'.Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand and Bill Murray all play their parts but never feel as though they're elbowing for the spotlight, which keeps the mood kind, befitting the hearts of all involved in the search for runaway scout, Sam, and his pen-pal, Suzy. Visually, it's a feast of saturated colour and fabulous design, but - as with the best of Wes Anderson - the devil's always in the detail. The laughs come from minutely observed accessories (keep an eye on the scouts' badges!) and from throwaway truths. And the soundtrack is a great mix of wistful Western and classical pieces. Definitely buyable. Anderson flirts with surrealism, but never gets Burtonesque, controlling his story with a firmer hand and to better effect. His situations might be bizarre, but the people in them are always painfully, wonderfully human. It's also a rare film - one you could watch with your grandmother or your grandchildren, with only a couple of moments where young eyes would have to be covered, and no real violence or swearing.There is an overwhelming feeling of innocence and good will throughout.I loved it from the opening frames, and it only got better from there.",10,235,324,31 May 2012
Slumdog Millionaire," get a grip people!
","As I watched this cliché-ridden, manipulative and wholly-predictable film unfold (quite slowly) on the screen, I kept thinking - if this film was set on a Glasgow housing estate, it would have sunk without a trace.I'm gobsmacked that filmgoers have apparently been so dazzled by the fact that it is set in Mumbai that they are blinded to the corny seen-it-all-before nature of the plot and characterisation. I felt throughout that my emotional strings were being pulled by a clumsy child. I didn't believe one single emotion in the whole movie. The brothers Jamal and Salim stuck together when it suited the plot and fell out when it suited the plot. Jamal's love for Latika was poorly drawn and ultimately cardboard. The device of the gameshow was a tenuous link for a series of vignettes which built not to an emotional peak, but a fiscal one. The climax of the show was so predictable that I guessed it in the second scene of the movie. Even so, Danny Boyle found it necessary to beat us over the head with the set-up at least twice more before the end, even using a flashback just in case we might not appreciate the punchline when it was finally delivered with all the comic timing of Stephen Hawking.Nothing in this movie exceeded my expectations, which is a terrible indictment when the film is about a place and circumstance you know very little about. I felt as if I'd guessed every scene in the film before I watched it. The story and characters are so familiar to watchers of small British melodramas that they seem disconnected from their landscape, and I couldn't help feeling that Boyle had failed to exploit the city in the way that would have given depth to the story. Apart from the opening scene on the airstrip, I was never surprised or delighted by the strangeness or odd juxtapositions of the setting.Simon Beaufoy will forever hold a place in the hearts of movie fans for his excellent script for The Full Monty. Slumdog Millionaire doesn't have a tenth of the heart or originality of that film and doesn't deserve the rave reviews it is getting.Stories of young friends or siblings facing hardship and danger are common and I can think of a few excellent films straight off the top of my head that handle the theme so much better (Small Faces, City of God and A Room For Romeo Brass).Simply setting a film in an exotic city cannot - and should not - mask the shortcomings of plot and character.",5,3,9,28 January 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Over-long and under-interesting
","This isn't a bad film but it sure is a long one - or at least it feels that way. While the story of Chris Gardner is admirable and inspirational to a point (see below!), the film crawls along at a snail's pace, with the score only underlining the rather repetitive nature of Chris's trials and tribulations. The movie could have done with some serious cutting back to increase the pace a little, and would still have had nice characterisation and strong performances at its heart. So much angst is piled upon this poor guy that it almost becomes comical, and I had to remember my own sense of decency not to snort out loud in the cinema. Will Smith is always very watchable and delivers a really great performance as the dad trying to make a better life for himself and his son. HOWEVER - although I know it is 'inspired by a true story' - for me the character lost some sympathy because when his wife left him with a five-year-old to take care of, he still took a six-month UNPAID internship in the hope of getting a great job, thus putting his son through some real hardship and trauma. With a child involved then, frankly, he should've been getting a job as a waiter or something, not trying to be a stockbroker. I mean, if he hadn't succeeded in the end, then the movie would be about an evil, selfish dad who wouldn't knuckle down and accept the responsibility of caring for his child properly. I know this is not strictly a criticism of the movie, but it bugged me throughout, and probably affected my opinion of the film itself, because it's like glorifying a fantasist who spends money in expectation of winning the lottery. Anyway, I'm obviously in the minority, judging by the IMDb score, but for me this movie wouldn't have been worth paying to see without Will Smith.",5,0,0,22 January 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Over-hyped
","Love the Simpsons on TV - but there was always a danger that stretching the format to feature length would just add padding to the same number of jokes, and - sadly - that's what's happened here. The Simpsons is by no means a bad movie but it's just not so much funnier or smarter than any one of the TV episodes that I think it's worth paying cinema prices. Sure, there are some great gags and very funny lines but at the end of the day, it's a very long cartoon without even the surprise of original characters to recommend it (as happened with movies like Monsters Inc and Shrek). If you (like me) prefer the TV episodes that deal mostly with the immediate family and the way they cope with rather mundane problems, then you'll probably be underwhelmed by this movie. By necessity its plot is widened to encompass world issues and other locations. I notice the rating has already dropped from a ridiculous 9, and fully expect to see it slide to a more sensible level once people come to their senses. No criticism is implied of the makers - I think they did as well as they could with the feature format. I just think most half-hour shows work well precisely because they're half-hour gems, tightly packed with ideas, laughs and funny asides. Watching exactly the same formula for three times as long didn't work for me.",6,3,6,29 July 2007
