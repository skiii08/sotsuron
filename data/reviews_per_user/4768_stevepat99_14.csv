Black Swan," Perfectly delusional - Sadly thrill-LESS
","You could say such as: we follow this delusional woman or hard-to-take visit into a woman's not-all-there mind or haunting and most accurate of all films ....on....emotional disorders or this confusion and terror is probably one of the best aspects of the movie or pursued by internal demons but then again these were all said of the 1948's Snake Pit regarded as a classic, ground breaking cinema study of the ravages of mental illness.Black Swan may will be a 21st century reincarnation of sorts. The title Ballet Pit rings the right bell.Perhaps it was the fact that the Swan was billed as a 'thriller' that found me chuckling aloud during several scenes where thrills were clearly tossed out the door replaced by delusions or were they delusions? I was taken so far into Nina's head that I quickly waved adieu to any semblance of a real tale of suspense & thrills and instead slide, against all my effort, down Nina's rabbit hole into her world where heads are tails and tails are heads.I missed several of the major thrills as I averted my eyes while others were on the edge of their seats wondering just how far the macro shots of self mutilation would go. Now those were thrills the film delivered.Although mother Erica is touted as the slave driving, relentless stage mother she is the one who tells Nina that she is pushing herself too hard and needs to cut back, slow down and ease up on her career.Aside from the delusional.... I found myself shaking my head at these junctions: A ballet director selecting some one he believes is one dimensional and so is not up to the role? Willing to replace the show's star Nina even after she assures him she is fine and ready to work? Casting couch BITE? By the film's finale I was so far down the rabbit hole that Nina could have metamorphosed into real black and white swans and this would have fit the 'norm' of scene after scene where suspense gave way to guesswork of reality versus delusion. At least Jacob's ladder delivered a suspenseful thrill ride before dropping the final scene s reality gotcha moment.Swan lake screams gotcha ad nauseam but does this in an otherwise perfectly crafted film. For me....time to watch Snake Pit again.",2,25,66,19 December 2010
Hereditary," Horrifying NOT!
","My buddy and I offer 2 thumbs-down votes. Oftentimes we disagree ... but not on this one. We both sat there and began checking our watches...30 minutes, then 50 minutes then 90 minutes and then I whispered to him: I'm sure the horrifying part is coming soon. The movie moved at a glacial (pre-global warming) pace to the point we were considering jumping ship. We were rejoicing over the fact that we used MoviePass. The major action during all this time was a glass moving on a table. My buddy asked: what is the husband's occupation? I whispered: I hope he's a family/mental health worker. Now, if you are into 90 minutes of a dysfunctional, angst ridden family....this is your pot of gold. 
 
We stayed the course and found nothing horrific in the final 'action packed' 30 minutes.",1,86,177,15 June 2018
Passengers," Great Sci-Fi space travel flick (FYI: Sony mucks up the IMDb intro)
","Skip the Sony one sentence intro which Sony managed to screw up. The IMDb 'Storyline' got it right.The story revolves around a malfunction in a sleep chamber that awakens one passenger. Suffice to say 'things' happen as the space tale goes on its merry way.Cinematography and special effects, tops. This was especially true of the swimming pool/gravity scene. Great space romance and super chemistry between the lead actors. The bartender/robot adds good comic relief. The script is top notch with suspense and great action sequences in the last 1/3 of the filmFrom first to very last scenes this film delivers. Its 7.1 rating is well deserved. One of the best all around Sci-Fi films I have seen in quite a while.",10,12,24,3 January 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Read the real story which explains why it a boring mess
","Ron Stallworth fooled the clan on the phone. This is basically a 'one joke' movie. After he does this he never, ever sees even a single KKK klansman in person during the 9 month investigation. Becuse he's black his partner does ALL the undercover work for 9 months. His partner is not Jewish as portrayed, Stallworth's entire romance never happened, the bomb plot and klansmens death in the explosion never happened. Boring because there was no violence, no KKK attacks just blabbering endless N word chatter. The lie detector scene, used for suspense, never happened. Boring because the 9 month investigation ended with ZERO arrests. Again, the partner did ALL the undercover work, took all the risks. So no reality based tension. It is said the operation disrupted 2-3 cross burnings and nothing much more. One true funny moment when Stallworth is assigned to guard David Duke and takes a very funny photo with Duke. The use of Harry Belafonte to retell a lynching story from perhaps the 1910-1920 era was misplaced. He's too recognizable as a 'current' 80+ year old man now in real time. Hence, he could not have been an 80 year old in 1972. An unknown old man should have been used. 30 minutes into the film I am wondering where this 'story' is going. No KKK plots of any kind, no KKK violence of any kind, no real threat to the undercover cop which explains why there were NO arrests ever made.This 'one joke' premise makes for an interesting event but does not stretch to an entire film. Good acting from the lead actors. Nice music tracks. Boring way too long film. Contrived ending. Could have just shown David Duke surviving and thriving currently.",3,54,103,23 August 2018
21," And Alice in Wonderland is also Based on a True Story
","Out of the box the 'real' Stacy character says THE MOVIE IS MOSTLY FICTION and that HE'S NOTHING LIKE STACY. Hollywood's tortured version was 'wisely' created to spoon feed young demographics with its success duly confirmed by the high IDMb ratings and comments.Here Hollywood plunges into fantasy mode creating casino-guest violence (there was and is none of this type in this manner), hand signals one could see a mile away, the group not permitted to so much as look at one another in the casino but arrive together by limo and saunter up to the casino door so that welcome camera can get a good shot of them. Then, to keep that low profile they go off clubbing together, shopping together....everything together. Like the gang that could not 'stealth' straight. Ben is such the MIT genius he can do no better then the equivalent of keeping his huge cash horde under his mattress. Has he ever heard of a dorm burning down? Does he deserve to be in MIT or Harvard where he can not figure out how use bank safety deposit boxes? They stay mostly in one casino which of course would never have worked.Welcome to a Las Vegas where casino employees may invite you to please follow them to the casino's nearby torture chamber. Not just the fact that the movie trashes reality to create a MOSTLY fictional flick but the insulting stupidity of the whining, erratic and out of control counting group. Hence my new title for this movie: COLLEGE CARD COUNTERS GO WILD! Stacy's rants reminded me somewhat of Charles Dickens Fagen which may be the true reality base of the film. On the big plus side the card dealng cinematography was top notch.",3,2,4,8 April 2008
Enchanted," My one HUMBUG with this Enchanting film - (don't think it's possible to write a real spoiler???)
","Okay, okay, the world LOVES Enchanted for 95% perfectly good reasons. So did I hence my '10' rating. However, even excellent films can be bugged. Given that one must tread very lightly when applying 'real' values to a Disney Fairy Tale my Hum Bug is, I think, never the less valid.Many laud the 'lesson' the movie teaches young girls to wit: Even a man who seems to be a Prince Charming may not be the right man for you.Now, if that is a LESSON then here goes lesson #2 that no one mentions:Expect your true love to DUMP YOU for a woman he's met and known for a day or two and despite: 1) You've been a devoted girl friend/fianc√© for FIVE YEARS 2)You've been faithful for five years 3)You are very smart,sophisticated, educated and savvy.4) You are understanding, not pushing him into marriage given his history of a wife who walked out on her husband and child. 5) You dismiss your jealousy when you find a beautiful girl in his apartment because you TRUST him. 6) Even at the end, at the ball, you hope against hope that he will not betray your five year relationship. 7) You are simply stated a very NICE GIRL in all the right ways.8) Finally, you are so depressed, all your hopes and dreams having been dashed, that you resign from the human race and take the first opportunity to jump off a roof....NO I mean jump down a man hole.Why can't the writers simply have Dempsey dating his girl friend for several months instead of FIVE YEARS which is so absurd. OR use the tried and true film technique of the UNSYMPATHETIC girl friend???Have any of the writers seen like Sound of Music or the all time favorite, The Parent Trap? In the latter Dennis Quaid's 10+ hottie girl friend is not only 100% deliciously evil but is also shallow, a gold digger, secretly hated his kid, was 1000% materialistic and was forever scheming for her self interest. She was a girlfriend all loved to hate, So that her day of reckoning was hilarious and welcomed by all. Such comedic writing was a high point of those and other similar comedies. WHY NOT HERE?",10,0,2,2 December 2007
It Follows," IT FOLLOWS You Should Not Waste Your Time or Money on this one
","I totally agree with numerous reviewers who noted the music score was a fail and in particular with the reviewer who said: The music was obnoxious and overly dramatic. Loud, obnoxious and worse, time and again during at least the first half hour music kept hitting the famed horror crescendo and then NOTHING happened.Lame story, lame acting and scene after boring scene going no where. I will say that, for all these reasons, I had to bail after about 30 minutes. NOTHING was happening which made this a horrible movie. Recommended for those who have a need to waste time. Recommended for those who want to learn what to avoid when making a film.",1,80,161,5 August 2015
The Theory of Everything," A soapy tale of devotion to science, wealth and the help of others
","A ten star reviewer actually said: ...these two....had a marriage full of trust and devotion to one another. What movie exactly was he watching? Full of trust and devotion that is until Hawking had a blazing affair with his married care giver/assistant and fled from his wife and kids to marry her. The film also depicts his wife having her own fling. Devotion to science yes but as others have pointed out the empty chair in the room is science itself, left out in the cold. We learn little about his scientific genius. We see awards, invitations to award ceremonies etc.but almost no real essence of his achievements, what they are, how they have altered our thinking and understanding of the universe. Suddenly he mentions god, why? Suddenly he abandons his early theory, why? How? When?I say devotion to wealth because this is how and why he survived when almost all others with his disease have perished early on. His fame and fortune helped provide him the best 24/7 care possible plus electronic gizmos that gave him the gift of communication which allowed him keep working and hence keep his sanity. The help of others: We see so many stories of devastating illness and how films depict people's successful efforts to overcome i.e. special Olympics. Sadly, Stephen's illness is so devastating that there is never an issue of recovery, of regaining speech, movement etc. He can and does survive but we can only witness a progressive disease that never lets up, even for an instant. Sadly, most of the film hammers us with the step by step progression of this horrid disease and its sequele. Unlike other man/woman conquer disease stories Stephen was never able to overcome the physical damage to his body. Luckily, his brain, his genius survived.We watch the same relationship soap opera many have lived, namely,a family under great stress that succumbs via his wife's inability first to cope with his care and next have an affair whilst Stephen is having his own affair with married women until he leaves his wife and kids for a grass-is-greener divorce and re-marriage that lasts all of about six years. Once science was left out of this film we are left with little more than a very well acted (cheers to the Oscar) daytime soap.",2,6,9,22 February 2015
The Mist," If only there were a MIST between me and the screen
","Rather than simply disagree with the many rave/positive reviews there is much we agree on:(1) Half the movie or more takes place within the narrow confines of a well lit supermarket(2) the market's 'customers' are eager to engage in or promote race/class warfare vis a vis locals vs. outsiders, religious 'fanatic' vs. run of the mill Christians, rich vs. poor, young vs. old, educated vs. idiots, black vs. white, army vs. civilian and child vs. adult.(3) Those holed up need a small bag of drugs from a nearby pharmacy. At most a one person mission. Yet 4-5 men & an old women leave the safety of the supermarket to enter the deadly MIST.4) There is mention they might HELP others at the pharmacy. BUT they have no weapons or means of delivering any real help. (5) Marcia Gay Marden's endless, obviously dangerous early on religious RANTS which go unchallenged. (6) There is virtually no music scary or otherwise. (7) What good is covering PART of the store's front window leaving plenty of glass for critters to break through. (8) During the entire period Dave is driving his passengers, at least an hour or likely much more, the vehicle is never attacked. There is no reason for Dave to believe they are facing imminent death simply because the car has stopped moving. Under these conditions it is insane for Dave to consider his 'final solution.' (9) Any idiot, except Dave that is, understands that if two people are standing in front of one another and one is shot in the chest they will BOTH BE SHOT and BOTH will likely die from the single bullet. (10) There is no closure. Will the mist move on to another town or return??? (11) Nice group of run of the mill customers in a matter of hours turn into a murderous mob biting at the bit to engage in human sacrifice of an innocent. (12)Soldiers that MP's came to collect and who are due ASAP at their base are stuck in the market...so the army knows they are all missing and knows their location.No reason given for most of what is going on, like why the army did not arrive ASAP to deal with critters that are easily killed by a single bullet. At the half way point I found myself rooting for the critters to gobble up every actor and actress on the set. ANYTHING GOOD? Sure...Fun critter scene at the pharmacy...all dem bugs, acid stringers and gore....and also the main attack at the market. Nice FEW minutes all told. Kill 30 minutes at least, do a good re-write, re-do the absurd ending, eliminate the class/religious warfare and stick to the horror/monster tale and overall don't deviate so drastically from King's story and maybe,,,,,just maybe you have the makings of TREMORS WITH A TWIST OF MIST. If you MUST see MIST in a theater at least apply the Boy Scout motto and 'be prepared' by taking an aisle seat for an easy ABORT. Best would be to spend no money and wait till MIST hits cable. You may be very glad you did.",1,15,30,27 November 2007
Paranormal Activity," Paranormal sans real horrific, scary activity equals a hand held mess
","Such great expectations, from all the hype, going into this one. Both myself and my wife gave this one two thumbs down. Okay, with a 15K budget the films creators did what what low budget horror flicks have been doing forever....relying for 95% of their films on little more than low, medium and loud off screen noises...reeeelllll scaryyyyyy. Move an object here or there....more terrific to the core horror. NOT. Add to this the all to familiar dizzying hand held camcorder and lack of any sub-plots or other serious cast members. Then, to cap it off they toss out a clear as a bell spoiler that let us know well in advance exactly how the film would end. So much for the surprise finale scene that was NOT.In one scene the boyfriend Micah spends a minute or longer checking out the hallway. Who was holding the camera? Since girl friend Katie yaks her hatred of the camera in almost every scene it certainly was not her. Bit of continuity problem there. In fact, I should add that Katie spends about half the film kvetching screaming at Micoh to turn off the damned camera.We saw this 2 for 1 so we fared better than most. But really the comparison of this film to horror classics is shameful.Want to experience real horror right now? Check out Fourth Kind...killer horror film and even more horrific you are immersed in the fact it all really HAPPENED!",1,3,7,10 November 2009
La La Land," If only I had not just watched Singin' in the Rain
","Thought this would be a dandy New Years film. Just days before, when Debbie Reynolds passed away I spent time watching the classic dance/song numbers in Singin' in the Rain. Yes, the film's opening number was a fine homage to musicals of the golden age. Then, I could not help but compare Ryan and Emma's lack luster amateur dance efforts to the amazing talents of such as Debbie, Donald and Gene Kelly. Blah versus excellence. Next, I had to endure Ryan trying to sing, total failure. Emma a notch better but again not ready for prime time. No one left the theater humming anything close to an unforgettable tune. Time for me to again start humming Singin' in the Rain.The 'story' moved at snails pace for the most part. A major plot whole when a character makes a major, life altering decision which is totally ignored as if it never happened. Perhaps there is a missing scene on the cutting room floor since this then permitted an alternate ending which, of course, made no sense.Finally, many others are right to note the lack of chemistry between Ryan and Emma.To vote anything close to an 8.9 you need memorable songs, great chemistry, ever greater singing and dance talents plus a story that makes sense rather then contradicting itself. Sadly, I found all these qualities totally lacking.",2,109,218,1 January 2017
August Rush," News Flash: Enchanted, Sleepless in Seattle & Pretty Woman lack realism
","Nailing a fable/fantasy for being unrealistic is like fishing with a stick of dynamite. Sooooo easy but why bother when one need only read IMDb reviews BEFORE buying a ticket. August Rush is above all else an urban fairy tale where the audience is expected to believe that dreams do come true. The film was neither made to please professional musicians nor match the literal progress of Mozart's youthful genius. The term 'suspend one's belief' system is meant to apply to a fable/fantasy such as August. It allows viewers to enter an alternate universe where all can believe in miracles. A magical, musical universe where our usual rules do not apply. A place where music literally fills the air at all times in all ways. The film is refreshingly original in that regard. The film also tosses us excellent performances by all three leading actors and a very well paced three track story meshing rock and classical music with the magic of a quest ridden prodigy. Robin Williams 'mean streets' Wizard fits perfectly into this parallel system of good and evil.Bottom line: August Rush was three hanky ENTERTAINING on multiple levels. It does well to appreciate that such well crafted, heart warming, escapist entertainment is a major part of what good movie making is all about.Reviewer Angie Errigo (Rotten Tomatoes) said it best noting that August Rush is 'Unapologetically preposterous, but it is a (very sweet) fairy tale...' Well said Angie!",8,1,4,3 December 2007
Hancock," Great fun, entertaining Summer film sans CGI characters
","While the young masses may flock to and rave about Iron Man and the newest Hulk I have had it with CGI characters doing their by the numbers obligatory endless (so it seems to me) final battle. Enter Hancock, a breath of fresh cinematic air and the cure for my CGI character blues. I need not rehash in detail all the spot on positive comments. Suffice to say that Smith is awesome in a multi dimensional role, a very 'human' role given his very special sort of humanity. Humor abounds, chemistry is good to great and originality sparkles. 'Do I smell alcohol on your breath?' a woman asks Hancock. Then and there you know just how original a super hero film this is. It is no more difficult to suspend one's belief system with this story and its conclusion then it is with most highly rated sci-fi/horror films like Underworld. The patch quilt of cinematic elements including drama, pathos, humor, humanity, relationships and frailties work in almost every instance. What a fun, Summer cinematic ride.",9,2,6,4 July 2008
Lucy," I love Lucy
","I have enjoyed most of Scarlett's films including her work with Woody Allan and Lost in Translation. One recent exception being urrgghhh Under the Skin. What a come back from that one. Given my love of science fiction films this one was, for me, a grand slam.Morgan Freeman was fine, as always, in his supporting role. Special effects also takes a big prize. Visuals galore and even better on our local XD 'IMAX wannabee' size screen.This is a super FUN, action packed gangster/Sci-Fi film that includes the expected (Paris car chase mostly against one way traffic) and also many unexpected moments. The early raw and violent scenes give way to Scarlett's on screen transformation step-by-fun-step.From Neanderthals and American Indians to intelligence as possibly interstellar pure energy the movie never stops to take a breath in its 89 minutes (it did not seem that short)journey.Scarlett owns almost every scene and she does a stellar job. The film tosses a half dozen genres into a blender. Scarlett guzzles it down and runs with it.The script came up with, for me at least, a perfect ending. In this film Scarlett, Morgan, the Paris 'cop' and ultra-evil villain deliver a truly entertaining film.",10,16,42,29 July 2014
