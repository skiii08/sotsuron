Iron Man 3," Amazing but felt there was something missing.
","Iron Man 3 oh how eager I was to see this film.Tony Stark is seen in a different light in the film he gets stripped from his armour and we get asked the question does the suit make the man or the man make the suit? The movie certainly pleased me and Robert Downey Jr steals every scene. This film is much more humorous than the others which was good but the constant need to puncture every half- serious moment with a witty one liner grew tiresome. Tony Stark had differently improved his tech though, I was amazed. The last full paced action scene was differently the best out of all the Iron Man films and will please many I also loved how Pepper Potts got to kick some ass! The special effects were done exceptionally well! The Mandarin I thought was a great villain until the twist. I was actually a bit disappointed as our new villain didn't cut it for me. Overall was a good movie better then the second not sure about the first.Overall I give Iron Man 3 a 8/10 -Being a big Marvel fan there seemed there was something missing. I think it had to do with they totally completely did not mention SHIELD at all- I mean when Tony Stark was in trouble they didn't try to contact him or Pepper Potts like the previous films.",8,2,12,24 April 2013
