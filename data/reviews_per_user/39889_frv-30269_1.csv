Blade Runner 2049," My Views On Blade Runner 2049 and a dash of film industry commentary
","Perusing the reviews one easily notices a verifiable pattern of love it or hate it emerging throughout the page.I was predisposed to the film given my admiration of the original. The original sits proudly on my DVD shelf while Dick's novel is not far away among my books.BR2049 is indeed awe-inspiring in its graphics and visuals. I can imagine seeing the original in the cinema back in 1982 would have done the same for those viewers. What is more, the women are beautiful and there I admit it attractive women draw me in. The music puts in a good attempt of being equal to Vangelis and his art. No one would be able to match that of course but the effort and artistic merit is there. The morale and message to the audience is lofty and worthwhile and it is not preached without a measure of subtlety, which is appreciated.With that said, and I was somewhat partial also because of the lead Canadian actor and Canadian director, the film is too long. I do not have statistics, but these films have lost the art of editing. Lights go down ten minutes after they are supposed to, a mobile game plays to garner loyalty to the cinema chain and debit card, fifteen minutes of trailers and unwanted commercials kick in for me to buy a car, a chocolate bar and get yet another credit card that will sell my information and lose it to NSA hackers and then we have the film itself. The film was good and immersive, but who authorizes the non-edits?I liked it but all in all this film reminds one why we should not pay to watch the next six Star Trek sequels and why it is very smart to boycott the next dozen Star Wars films and Marvel's weekly release schedule.
