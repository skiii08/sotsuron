War Dogs," Entertaining performances and visuals alongside a slight lack of serviceable writing
","Usual hit-or-miss director Todd Phillips returns after the last couple of force fed Hangover duds, but delivers a steadily paced and solidly entertaining biopic which has been marketed as a 'Wolf Of Wall Street' for the 'Hangover' fans.The film's plot revolves around two young in-over-their-heads gun runners, told from the perspective of the relative straight man of the duo David Packouz, portrayed by Miles Teller. Jonah Hill plays Efraim Diveroli, the bombastic and over confident member of the two. The film relies on the set up to be the plot as the story more or less takes us through the whole meaty parts of the true story in a positively meandering fashion, as the leads run into major success as well as major mishaps.Both Hill and Teller successfully carry this film, though Hill is given center stage as well as more scenes and moments as opportunities to shine. Teller works well in his role once again deferring from the loud/party animal figure his introductory roles offered. After seeing 'The Spectacular Now' and 'Whiplash', it was hard not to think of how great his role here could have been if given more room to work. Hill impresses in his role, offering layers of seediness and greed under the likable and humorous character he portrays. Nonetheless the acting all round is solidly delivered. Phillips does a sufficient job with his directing duties, as the passion can be noticed behind the film. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher offers impressive visuals of each of the settings that are shown throughout.I would recommend this film for it's entertaining performances, steady pacing and visuals. Though the writing may be on and off in its quality throughout. 7/10.",7,2,3,10 September 2016
Source Code," A great achievement from director Duncan Jones.
","Director: Duncan Jones Stars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle MonaghanDuration: 93 minutes Plot: An Afghanistan soldier's (Gylenhaal) mind is transferred into the body of a victim during a train bombing. His duty is to save the passengers aboard by finding the bomb and bomber to prevent them from dying. Verdict: A great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal and a great achievement from director Duncan Jones (son of pop star David Bowie). Michelle Monaghan shows her role's innocence. Vera Farmiga is obviously good in here. Jeffery Wright is the best person to portray this kind of role.Chris Bacon's music score sounds phenomenal. The effects are really great and The script is very well done. Genre: Mystery, Thriller, Suspense Rating: owenomahony21 gives this a 9 3/4 /10",8,0,1,11 February 2013
Man of Steel," Not bad but not great either...
","This film had been building up so many peoples hopes for a long time that by the time it came out people were expecting the greatest superhero movie ever. So when it came out and didn't turn out excellent, people started hating on it. This film is not as bad as people put it out to be but it's not great either. Cavill is OK but seems to be focusing too much on perfecting his American accent and forgetting to act aswel but is by far the best choice for the character. The casting seems perfect at first until you watch it and discover that most of the cast is just plane and bland. Zack Snyder and David Goyer is the main problem. This film is enjoyable and Michael Shannon is great. (!SPOILERS!) I also didn't mind at all about the controversial scene when Superman breaks Zod's neck. Overall a 65%",5,0,0,19 December 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson's new comedy is a great film and definitely one to watch.
","Wes Anderson returns to his comfort zone with his new comedy set in 1965 where two 12-year-olds Sam and Suzy, played by the talented newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, set out to the wilderness to escape their wretched lives. Hayward and Gilman lead an all-star cast of Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, Harvey Kietel, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban and Frances McDormand. Murray and Schwartzman have worked with Anderson on several films as the Royal Tennabaums, Fantastic Mr Fox, The Life Aquatic and The Darjeeling Limited. While Kietel's role is more of a cameo but a good one. Willis and Norton give great performances while Murray and McDormond bring great ones! My result for Moonrise Kingdom is 4 stars out of 5 stars and 9/10.",7,0,1,30 December 2012
