The New World," A beautiful movie giving form to the story of Pocahontas, John Smith and John Rolfe
","First of all, this is not a movie based entirely on fact and truth. There are many inventions and many events that are not entirely chronological correct. I grew up adoring Pocahontas, and when I was almost six years old I watched the Disney version of the movie. Three years later, I watched the movie 'Pocahontas: The Legend' which was disappointing but yet didn't stop my fascination for the story of Pocahontas. In 2000, when I was going to be eleven years old, I saw the famous painting of the engagement between Pocahontas and John Rolfe in the Capitol Hill, Washington D.C.This movie shouldn't be seen solely for historical truth; but rather solely for entertainment and its beauty. It's a fascinating and great story, yes, but the legend of Pocahontas varies depending on where the source came from. Also, most of the stories of Pocahontas has been invented, or romanticized to make it more interesting. Yet, the only facts that I can determine are true is that Pocahontas was a real person as well as John Smith and John Rolfe. But whether they actually were in love with her, and if she actually loved them we never can know. But what's true is that Pocahontas eventually married John Rolfe.Other than that, this movie can almost be called an art. The photography is so beautiful, and tends to stay at a point of scene a bit longer than most movies usually do, which give the movie a real, calm and thoughtful feeling. Unfortunately, it also leaves a lot of empty gaps in the movie, which makes the 2 hours and 15 minutes story feel a bit too long. Anyways, you feel as if you could identify with what the characters of the movie felt. This movie is so totally different the earlier versions, including the Disney movie.Like all the legends of Pocahontas, this movie starts with the Englishmen shipping ashore to the Virginia coast in 1607, and meets the naturals who first act very friendly and curiously. But what happens thereafter is too uncertain, and too loose based on too many theories and speculations. So, let's say the rest of movie is based on a lot of theories, a lot of mythological stories we've learned about Pocahontas and a lot of fiction, too, to make it more interesting.",7,1,4,13 June 2006
Romeo + Juliet," excellent movie... DiCaprio & Danes are magnificent.
","First of all, I want to tell that I haven't watched this movie before and that the first time I did watch this was yesterday. Further, I can say that by watching this movie I understood what I've been missing... Danes and DiCaprio is such a great couple in this movie... This is such a truths worthy and realistic movie, all authentic to the Shakespeare story except from that fact that the story is moved from Verona in the 16th century to present time in Verona Beach and some changed lines, some changed scenes and a bit modernized story. Beautiful scenes, beautiful cinematography, sad story, fine person chemistry between Danes and DiCaprio. Can say that if the book was for grown ups, then this movie is mostly for teenagers and younger.",9,0,1,25 July 2005
Batman Begins," A masterful and thrilling movie... Bale is perfectly characterized as Bruce Wayne alias Batman
","First of all, I want to tell you that I have been one of Batman's greatest fans since I started reading the comic books. Actually I discovered Batman before I started reading the comic books, which is not that strange because I was born in the year of 1989. When I was about eight years old, I watched the first Batman movie starring Michael Keaton. And yeah, I liked the humor in that movie a lot. I didn't like the second movie as much as I liked the first, but it was yet a great movie. But when I watched the third and fourth movies, which was after I started reading the comic books, I really disliked it. I couldn't understand why they wanted to make such two bad movies when Burton did good with the two first movies. Although Batman & Robin was a bit fun, I yet disliked it.And now, the fifth movie has finally arrived and come to the cinemas anywhere. This is the movie that tells the background story of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman... And it has never been that good. It is darker than ever, but the mind of humor is still there, and is noticed sometimes throughout the movie. You notice a few known faces - whose names are such like Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy, Liam Neeson and Rutger Hauer. And of course, not to be forgotten, the star of this movie - Christian Bale. Honestly, I think Bale is perfectly characterized as Bruce Wayne alias Batman, probably also better than Michael Keaton, who I couldn't really like in the first two movies.. But in here, I really feel Bale is the right one as Batman... He gives a mix of feelings with fear, power, charisma and revenge. But I have to admit that Michael Caine really is great besides Batman as his butler, and he is also the first who gets to know Bruce's intentions of becoming Batman... and helps him in all ways, being like a sort of uncle for him. Caine is really an excellent actor and he gives a proof of him being one of the movie's greatest actors throughout the movie's history in this movie.It starts with Bruce as a little boy being attacked by a lot of bats and how he is getting nightmares of it. Some days later, interrupting a Opera show because of his fear of bats, Bruce sees his parents being murdered of a thief. He becomes powerless, making it his life purpose to revenge the one who killed his parents. But some incident 14 years later gets him to hide himself, taking him to the criminal way... and to a prison and finally to a mountain, where he meets a mystic man who teaches him to accept his fear and to fight. Back to Gotham City, Alfred becomes Bruce's truths worthy assistant and soon Bruce is able to characterize himself as Batman, Gotham City's rescuer from falling in decline. With help of a police (Oldman) and an employer of Wayne Tower (Freeman) who knew his father , Bruce tries to save the city and surprise the villains and give them what they deserve. But it becomes a hard fight against decline.A great movie that is thrilling, amazing and magnificent as well as masterful. Gotham City looks like a darker version of Chicago, Manhattan and Chinatown, and is greatly illustrated and dark toned. The stars are great and Holmes is fitting as Rachel, her serious charisma making it realistic. But even though it is great, the background story takes much time but it is yet great to know the background story of Batman, when you only experienced a few minutes of it in the first Batman movie with Keaton. This time it is different, modern, darker and more spectacular than ever, but I can't say if it is better than the two first movies - but one thing is true and it is that the background story is greatly made and that the stars have never been better. Actually, everything is great and I can't complain of anything bad in this movie, but I feel it is yet not enough to give this movie full grade... something is missing. It is the third movie this half year that is based on a comic book - first it was Sin City, then it was Fantastic Four and now this... Still Sin City is the best.",9,1,2,23 July 2005
Million Dollar Baby," a beautiful as well as horrible movie... I loved it fully.
","If you would name a few movies that are almost perfect or perfect in your eyes, this is a movie you would name (in my sight, anyways). Million Dollar Baby is far different from other movies you've seen - especially when it's about fighting in matches, wanting to win and fighting for dreams come true, such like The Karate Kid (a bad one) and Rocky (a good one, but the sequels were bad). This movie takes another perspective on the boxing world - into the woman boxing world mixed into a story about a woman, overage who really WANTS to be a professional boxer, and an old man, who against his will becomes her coach and doesn't have an idea that it will influence his life forever... and no matter how he denies it, it makes him a better person. Told by his assistant, Scrap (Morgan Freeman), this is an unbelievably beautiful movie about friendship, dreams and identity.",10,1,3,12 July 2005
Once Upon a Time in America," A fine story in the spirit of The Godfather and The Untouchables but yet different...
","It is impossible not being impressed or loving this movie completely. Robert De Niro is making one of his greatest roles, along with Taxi Driver and The Godfather, in this movie by playing David Aaronson, a Jewish gangster, who hangs out with his friends - Cockeye and Patsy among others - when he was a boy, when they said that they would die for each other... They shared their fortunes (which they earned by making some crime in the under world), their loves and their lives. When they grew to men, they shared a dream, a dream to skip poverty, which was their world, and rise to power. But they don't realize that it will cost them their friendship - that it will be built on greed, violence and betrayal for making the dream come true. Finally, their dream would end as a mystery that refuse to die. Except from De Niro, James Woods is making his maybe best role of Max, who becomes the leader of the gang of which De Niro is a member. It is a fine story by three and half a hour that tells the whole story by the beginning of David's escape from the justice after being accused of having betrayed his friends, and how he thirty years later came back to his youth, wanting to find an answer of his past, returning to his memories from his time in the gang, how he was in love with Deborah, how he was best friends with Max, how everything ended... the end that still is a mystery.It is a very thrilling drama movie, which the ending will be nothing you imagine, but of which you understand will happen by the last ten minutes until the fine story ends. The photography is beautifully filmed, the cinematography realistic, which make it feel like you are in the first half of the 20th century, when you aren't, and the actors all simply great as well as the characters and the story. It's one of the best storytelling movies, along with movies such like The Godfather and The Untouchables, that I've been watching... All simply, it's a great experience of a greater movie.",10,6,12,16 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Aw.. Too much visual effects and less a story.
","I didn't have high expectations of this movie, which didn't make me disappointed when I finally watched this movie. I expected it, anyways, even though Spielberg is a good director and has done many well-done movies in his past - E.T., Close Encounters, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List and Jurassic Park just to naming a few. This is just not a movie that even Peter Jackson would be able to make good. The problem is that War of the worlds was written in the end of the 19th century and when you will make a movie about it and change the time to the 21th century, then the story gets too simple and the visual effects take over too much. The beginning had deep, the rest is flat. I prefer the original War of the worlds, when everything had deep but the end was flat. Maybe there is a curse about War of the worlds being filmed. The story seems promising in the beginning, but gets too fast with the machines from outer space - they start to attack already after about ten minutes and don't finish until five minutes before the ending scene, which made it a pity to see the movie. The story is too simple - it is just about Tom Cruise and his two children escaping from or fighting the machines. But there are some deep scenes during the entire movie - the scenes between Tom Cruise's role as the father and his relation to his son, Robbie. And how he takes care of Rachel (Fanning). Those scenes are very deep, but it doesn't make the movie any better. Despite that fact, the visual effects are very spectacular but the sad truth is that visual effects can't make a movie good if there is no great story. And the ending is also too predictable, it becomes too Hollywoodish, excuse my saying this. Too much clichés. But anyway, like I said before, nobody could have made it any better than what Spielberg did (Jackson would probably have done it at least as good as him, but who knows? You can always be surprised) in this century. If you really want to see a good version of any of H G Wells's novels, see the original Time Machine from the '60s.",5,2,4,5 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Episode III - the best movie of the prequels
","Now the end of the saga of Star Wars is here and it awakes a lot of my memories from the old trilogy, the ones with Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. First, I want to thank George Lucas for having managed to create a spectacular movie when he failed to do that by episodes I and II, which lacked me. But this doesn't. It completely obsesses me. With cold breezes and applause, Episode III starts its beginning. The war in the space crash in full swing and it gets me to remember episode IV, which started just like that. First I want to tell you all episodes of Star Wars.1977 - Episode IV A New Hope. I was not even born then. But about six years old, in 1995, I did watch it the first time and I loved it completely. Everything was cool.1980 - Episode V Empire strikes back. Neither was I born then. I watched it with the same feeling of ANH, and I loved it yet more.1983 - Episode VI Return of the Jedi. I would watch that some years after Empire strikes back, and I was a bit disappointed. It didn't match my expectations of what I did watch in ESB and ANH. But I liked it anyways.1999 - Episode I The Phantom Menace. What a stupid title and what a stupid movie. I didn't like it at all, except from the scenes that told you how Anakin followed with the Jedi for being learnt to a Jedi. I was very disappointed.2002 - Episode II Attack of the clones. I didn't have great expectations of this movie, because of TPM, but I liked this better than episode I, because of the visual effects. The rest was OK, but doesn't deserve more attention than like that. Otherwise, it is an important part of Anakin's story - it gives you some ideas of why Anakin turns into Darth Vader. 2005 - Episode III Revenge of the Sith. OK, what a stupid title, but what a great movie. I had great expectations of this movie, as the trailer was very promising. And I was right. It is really a great movie. And now, my opinion of episode III:Actually, we know that Anakin will turn into Darth Vader and that Luke and Leia Skywalker are separated from birth, but we didn't know how and why. Upon Episode III, we are about to know everything. Episode III ties the whole saga of Star Wars and tells everything- how and why Anakin turns into Darth Vader, why Yoda is escaping from the Republic and why the twins Luke and Leia are separated from the birth. We just get to know everything. We also get to know why Obi-Wan hides himself from the Repbulic, and what happened with the other Jedi Knights.Anakin and the chancellor Palpatine's relationship is deepened in this movie, with all its consequences, meanwhile Obi Wan and the other Jedi Knights are trying to find general Grievous and put an ending of the war. Anakin also gets to know that Padmé's pregnant, but one night and another, he is having nightmares of Padmé dying while giving birth to their child. It is just the beginning of his way to the Sith side.Episode III is probably the best of the saga (definitively the best of episodes I-III), when I am considering that. Else, it's a movie that ties up the whole saga with a very exciting beginning, good story in the middle and fine ending that gets you to think of the beginning of the episode IV. It's, too, fun to meet Chewie again, and having experienced the fight of Obi-Wan and Anakin beat everything else. Though, I think the battle fencing are too fast comparing to the original trilogy when you could keep you up with the battles. Here, you can barely follow the battle, which is a pity. But except from that fact, the battle scenes are well done, the visual effects spectacular, more spectacular than episode II and the other Star Wars movies. Conslusion, the acting is excellent (in particular Hayden Christensen, who is much better in this movie than he was in episode II, and he really plays the changing of Anakin to Darth Vader so convincing that you get scared by the hell) and the dialog so forced, but it is what's the intention of Lucas's! In fact, I love the dialog in Star Wars - they just awake and raise your cold breezes! In fact, Episode III is in high speed from the very beginning to the very end, as it breaks only with dialogs and love moments between Padmé and Anakin. What I love with this movie is also all the zooming pictures of Anakin's turn to Darth Vader, his love to Padmé and Obi-Wan's love to him as a brother. You just can't help cry and get moved. It is that piece that you were missing in episode I and II. This movie is the darkest of all in the two trilogies, and it is probably what makes this movie so magnificent, so good and all simply amazing. This movie do you watch with a creepy feeling in the body, since there is references to earlier movies of Star Wars, in particular the original trilogy. Can't give this movie less than a 9/10, it just deserves that grade. I can't either give this movie a 10/10 when empire strikes back probably still is the best (in my point of view). But this movie deserves a 9.5/10 as it is so good in all ways.",9,2,6,22 May 2005
Fantastic Four," A great movie with a great mind of humor..
","Starring Ioan Gruffudd (Reed Richards), Jessica Alba (Sue Storm), Chris Evans (Johnny Storm) and Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm) who are turning into the fantastic four - part elastic, part invisible, part fire and part stone. They are astronauts and scientists who are teamed up with Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) who runs his million dollar concern and can afford the trip of a few days in the space just for Richards's discovery of a cosmic storm, which will cure sicknesses and that kind of stuff. But something goes wrong and the storm comes earlier than estimated. Back in Earth, Reed finds himself elastic, calling himself Mr Fantastic, Sue finds herself invisible, calling herself Invisible Girl, Johnny finds himself being able to burn, naming himself Human Torch, and Ben finds himself becoming the thing with a body of stone. The only who seems have survived the cosmic storm is Victor Von Doom - it seems that... But some event later get the fantastic four to change their minds and stop him before it's too late.Despite the stubborn beginning, it's a great movie with great visual effects, great and fun characters, great actors and a great story. It has also a lot of great mind of humor, that got me to burst into laughing a lot of times. Further, the photography is also smart, as well as the cinematography. Everything seem realistic or real like, anyways. The smart thing I think the director and the film company have done in this case, is to take quite unknown actors into this movie, because I think that if actors such like Charlize Theron (who has been talked about being the Invisible girl) or Nicolas Cage or another big star had gotten the roles instead of those unknown actors, it had been a bad movie... everything had not felt that good, then, I guess. Now when it is quite unknown actors (except from Alba and McMahonm, whom I knew before from Dark Angel and Nip/Tuck respectively) who have the roles in this movie it is easy to identify with the characters and feel a sympathy for them. In other ways, it's an amazing and pleasant movie, which yet can't strike Sin City from being the best movie I have seen this year yet.",5,1,2,15 July 2005
Sin City," Such a magnificent movie... all simply great and the best I've watched this year yet.
","It isn't that often I go out from the cinema with such a satisfying feeling for having watched such a great movie. This is surely one of the very few movies that has given me the credit to have such glorious and satisfying feeling. Probably the best movie I've watched this year and the year isn't ended yet. This movie is casted of surely almost all actors you know or recognize either their faces or names - names such like Mickey Rourke, Rutger Hauer, Nick Stahl, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Alexis Bledel, Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Michael Madsen and a few more. This movie is parted by a few histories that is tied to each other and make new ways to new stories and new mysteries. The first story is a young charming man (Josh Hartnett) who kills an unbeknown st woman who believes he loves her (it's how he gets to kill his victims). The second story is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who is the only last good cop left in the sin city. He is fixed by the mind of finding Nancy Callahan, 11, who is kidnapped by the town's senator's son (Nick Stahl) who later turns to be the yellow and disgusting man. He arrives in time, killing his assistants and, to last, shooting the ear and the cock off the kidnapper, saving the pretty and very scared girl. But he is betrayed by his friend, another cop, and is shot a few times. He finds himself waking up in the hospital, accused for having killed the other six girls and kidnapped this pretty girl Nancy who he actually saved. He gets into prison and eight years later, he is prepared for revenge. The third is about Marv (Mickey Rourke) who has a glorious night with Goldie, but finds her murdered besides him on the morning, making him looking for the murderer who did this, at any cost. It becomes a thrilling hunt that may finish a few lives, making a way to the person who is behind everything, the villain you never would ever imagine... or dream about. Also, another story is about Dwight (Clive Owen), who comes to the Old Town where the whores have their own laws and their own business. He is there for a business - because of Jackie (Benicio del toro) who has been with his last whore (Brittany Murphy). It turns about to be that the girls make the task of stopping him themselves - but what they don't know was that he was a cop, making the resting between the whores and the cops turning into a war... if not they are stopping it before it is too late.Sin City is no usual movie. The visual effects are very unlike the others you've seen - it's all based on comic book-like, making it feel that you are the audience behind the events into a comic book, when it actually is a movie you are watching. It feels real, so real, that you just keep your eyes on the movie, afraid of missing anything meaningful, anything interesting or anything great and magnificent, or afraid of missing any special character. The movie is all black and white except from the eyes that are colored (either blue, green, brown or whatever), the yellow man (Nick Stahl), the Goldie hairs of Goldie and a red dress. Blood can turn to be red sometimes.It is filmed in a real action way, a way that make this movie real, thrilling and bloody. I have never liked action movies that much before, but I really really like this movie, despite all violent scenes... it is despite everything a fine story of violence, fighting for your people against all others, finding your loving one, making murder for revenging your loving one's death, truth and corrupts. It is more bizarre than the reality but it is such a well-done movie gathered by all great actors into one and same movie and all great visual effects. The story ain't stupid either, and the characters are very different and cool. I enjoyed this movie fully, never being bored or missing anything even a second... Couldn't practically blink... was completely obsessed.",10,0,1,14 July 2005
Back to the Future," A great movie... memorable.
","I grew up loving this movie. I have surely been watching this movie some hundred times. The first time I was watching this movie was surely when I was about six years old. I knew Michael J. Fox - I just didn't know his name. I recognized him overall - in Spin City, The Frighteners etc. I had no good understanding of this movie when I was six years old, but hey, I was fascinated. Some five years later, I watched this again. With full understanding of this movie, I was not only fascinated - I completely loved it. Buying the DVD back in 2002, I watched this movie very regular in a period, pausing a while, trying to memorize everything. And it only raised my fascination and love for Back to the future.The plot? Marty McFly (J Fox) is an ordinary teenager in 1985 who usually meets his friend, the crazed doctor Brown (played by genial actor Christopher Lloyd), for some scientific researchs. But one night, he will find out what Dr Brown really is preparing - a time machine into a car. Surprised, but anyway fascinated, McFly loves the idea. But of an accident, McFly is going back to 30 years earlier his present date. And it is then he has to reunite his parents before everything goes weird - and if he doesn't replace everything as it was before, he risks to be unborn. Sounds crazy? Right. It does. But it is the point. Mixed with smart humor, well-done dialogs and fine ending, it is probably one of the best genre movies I've been watching. It's not only a science fiction movie. It is also a coming-of-age movie, mixed with action, comedy and drama. And all simply, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd, in particular his crazy Einstein-hair, make this movie great. Highly recommended for you who want a mix of everything a Friday night.",10,2,3,25 May 2005
