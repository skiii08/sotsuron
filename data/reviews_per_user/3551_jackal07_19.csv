United 93," Epic movie , disregard the conspiracy nut jobs
","It is funny reading the rightwing conspiracy nutjobs take on 911.... let me answer your concerns.... THIS IS A TRUE STORY IDIOTS!!!! People died in the towers and from flight 93... show a little class!!! This is a brilliant movie in every way, showing true heroism... Makes me proud to be an American... that when facing certain death, people ban together to try and take over the plane from the terrorists... epic!!",10,4,7,12 September 2019

","Absolutly amazing...,as a white guy, i am ashamed of my fellow ( white) americans of their treatment of one of the best players , anyone has ever seen",10,1,2,13 December 2018
Ready Player One," An absolute phenomenal movie!!!
","From every sense of the word, this movie is epic!!! For anyone of my generation ( pre millennials)... product of the 80s..... the easter eggs in this movie alone make the movie soo great.... everything from the gundham ( voltron)... to megagodzilla, to the war of the worlds ship, the delorean from back to the future, alien, and all the the 80s music ( jump from van halen)... this movie is incredible in every way... great great job mr speilburg... this movie absolutely rocks... i love it..",10,0,1,16 February 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Awful !!!
","How many times are they going to remake spiderman... im baffled by the high ratings... clearly the critics are biased and ignorant because this was really boring and we have seen this before... sorry, but their is one spiderman and his name is tobey maguire",1,6,8,27 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I wasn't expecting much, and that is pretty much what i got
","When Disney took over the franchise, they butchered it..... the Force awakens was a rip off of a new hope, the last jedi was rushed with too many plot holes, and this one, they tried way too hard, it was drawn out, and once again rushed.... now visually it was better than the other two but the storyline was very weak and made no sense.... even the name is off.. there was no rise of ANY SKYWALKER, it was the rise of palpatine..... Once again you have ships that can blow away planets ( aka another death star).... leia's death made no sense, as did the ending which showed the emperor ( who should not be alive in the first place), get his power back only to loose it to rey with a double saber.... come on now?? Why???? Im not surprised though, its just funny listening to these fan boys who think this the best thing since sliced bread..",2,29,48,22 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Why ?? Why ?? QT
","Seriously, i was soooooooo waiting for this to come out.... Only to find out that you used fake characters, saw manson for 2 seconds and changed history???? Arent you the same guy who showed use violent be headings in kill bill and a guy's head getting blown off in pulp fiction???? What the hell??? Maybe its time to hang it up Quentin..",5,9,13,31 July 2019
The Lion King," Really? Jon favreau???
","A complete rip off of the original!!! WHY WHY??? Just stick to iron man and rudy movies.... a complete dumpster fire, just pass on this!!! Great movie if you are black ( with an ALL BLACK CAST)... but no way does it even come close to the original!!!! Beyonce, please just stick to music cause u are awful in every way!!!!!!",1,3,5,22 September 2019
Back to the Future Part III," Should have been better
","I mean seriously.... when marty tears a hole in the gas tank... most people would rush and grab a can or a bottle and try and save the gas that's pouring out... thats just common sense... second.... if you needed gas, why could you just syphoned it from the delorean that was already there??? Or better yet... just use the second one to get back home.... 3rd.... when the girl is in trouble, and you have already made a point of not altering history in the first 2 movies, do you save clara... thus disruption of the space time continuum??? And lastly.... why do you have a 50 year old dc brown try to jump onto a speeding delorean going 60 miles an hour from a train when u have a 17 year old marty who is way more athletic and agile do it?? Makes no sense... than u have that cheesy ending with clara and the hoverboard??? Just let her fall into the gorge so it can be once again called clayton ravine.... they totally ruined this... it could have been way better, not to mention the one shot of whisky and im drunk.... geeze i have had at least 4 shots writting this and im right as rain.... bad script!!!",6,0,0,16 November 2019
1917," This WAS the BEST picture of 2019 !!!!!!!
","Hollywood and their artsy fartsy gay means can go straight to hell!!! They play favorites and pick whom they want, and rarely have the best movie win THE BEST PICTURE!!!! It's happened on numerous occasions and they still have not learned... But without question, this was the best movie of 2019..... It was brilliantly made and shows true courage.... and EVERYONE should watch this and enjoy this masterpiece!!!",9,2,7,11 February 2020

Avatar," Epic movie.... there is a reason why it is the highest grossing movie of all time
","James Cameron is the best director in Hollywood... HANDS DOWN!!!! This movie is original, visually spectacular, and keeps you on the edge of your feet..... Like i said, there is a reason why this is the highest grossing movie of all time!!! 2.8 billion cant all be wrong can they??? I am disgusted at the stupid trolls that just want to hate on this ground breaking masterpiece by saying its dances with wolves meets smurfs!!! No no no.... go away!!! If you truly want to see a movie that has everything!!! Watch this",10,1,2,23 December 2019
Titanic," Love the movie and James Cameron..... BUT!!!
","The one problem I have with the movie, is.... in Rose's recollection of the event, she said that she was the last one with the.diamond after she she told that Hockley put the jacket on her with the diamond in it... He knew she she had it!!!! The ending SHOULD have been rose making a trade for the diamond for her painting... which would have been equally viable... not rose throwing it into the sea so Britney Spears could find!!! Really????",10,0,4,15 April 2020
American Made," Double crossed was better!!!!
","And yes, nobody has mentioned the elephant in the room, so i will.... This has been done before!!!! It was called Double Crossed and it starred Dennis Hopper... It was made in 1991 and it Absolutely BLEW this movie out of the water... So all you who rated this high must go watch the original... such as life, the original will always be superior!!!",4,1,2,6 February 2020

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," DISNEY DUMPSTER FIRE !!!!! Run for the hills..
","Disney only cares about money, they dont give a good god damn about anything or anyone... That being said, the ABSOLUTE WORST thing G lucas could have done was sell the rights to them.... That being said, Disney has butchered the last 3 movies but this one is the absolute worst of the 3.... hands down... The ignorant Fan Boys ( mostly comprised of stupid millennials) will say this is the best , but what the hell do they know..... this whole movie is one big rip off of a new hope... and disney has lured the mindless sheep to come watch this garbage.... i mean seriously... terrible writing, with more holes than the Iraqi Navy, bad character choices with no development, a sith lord wannabe that wears a mask from gi joe ( and does not need to wear one).... has a temper tantrum like a millennial fan boy, another death star ( like we have already seen before), another desert planet ( aka tatoine), and they kill off han solo for no reason.... give me a break !!!! People, WAKE THE HELL UP!!! And just run far away from this movie... run for the hills!!!",1,10,12,26 December 2019
