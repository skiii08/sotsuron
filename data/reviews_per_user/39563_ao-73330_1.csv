Vertigo," What a waste of my time
","I've decided to watch 'greatest directors' films. I started with Fellini, Tarkovsky, Antonioni, Bergman. Now it was time for 'great Hitchcock'. But what a waste of 2 hours of my time it was watching this unbelievable story twists with terrible acting and fake drama. And it is considered to be his best movie.",3,1,3,17 April 2020
