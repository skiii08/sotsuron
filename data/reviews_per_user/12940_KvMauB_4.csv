Vertigo," The Ultimate San Francisco Movie
","My father took me to see Vertigo and I instantly LOVED this classic. It influenced me to settle in San Francisco, as it is indisputably the ultimate San Francisco movie, with Bullitt a very respectable second. I have personally visited almost every real location depicted in the movie, and I love to give my out of town visitors the Vertigo tour of the places that still exist. Vertigo is a great tour of some of the many beautiful spots in and around SF.I love Alfred Hitchcock films and though Rear Window is my favorite, I think Vertigo is his best and perhaps most personal. From the opening titles and wonderful Bernard Hermann music soundtrack to the haunting conclusion, Vertigo is a visually lush and grandly entertaining example of masterful storytelling. I cannot articulate enough how great this film is and do it justice in 1000 words. The viewer is drawn in voyeuristically with the Jimmy Stewart character as he feels the tension of escalating obsession and the just-out-of-reach frustration with an unobtainable illusion. The use of music is one of the best ever in film as it reflects the inward emotion perfectly. You can hear what Jimmy Stewart is feeling. First there is curiosity, then rising tension, rising hope, and then release and resolution. Vertigo has one of my favorite film shots in it too (possibly the first time it was ever used), the zoom-in-while-backward- tracking shot, later seen in films like Jaws. Oh! And Vertigo has one of the greatest on-screen kisses of all time too, so very passionate (and I think shot on a turntable). The way Alfred Hitchcock was able to imply such sexuality in Vertigo without showing even nudity, I think, made the situations even more sexually charged, as what one imagines is far better. This is a film that earns a rare but well deserved 10/10 in my book.",10,12,17,22 November 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Welcome to the Caribbean!
","What great fun this movie is! It is in this spirit of fun that I base my high esteem for this excellent, entertaining movie and consider it one of my favorites that I will watch over and over. It is funny, exciting, ahem, er.... sexy, and adventurous escapist fun! It is not meant to be authentic or seriously considered (against the likes of Master and Commander). Rather, it is grand art of a different sort. The key element in this film that made it superior to other pirate fantasy films is the casting. I thought both Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush were magnificent! It is their endlessly entertaining, outstanding performances that made Pirates of the Caribbean into an instant classic that is very repeatedly viewable. Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Jonathan Pryce and all the rest of the cast were all great also. When I was 8 my father took me to Disneyland for the first time. Although I was apprehensive at first (seeing the talking skull and dropping down through darkness into the caverns in a boat), I ended up loving the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and wanted to ride it again and again! This movie perfectly evoked that same feeling and reaction... creepy apprehension turning into fun adventure and humor... jolly family fun. The various references to the Disneyland ride in the movie just thrilled me. I wholeheartedly recommend it!",8,0,2,1 January 2005
Lost in Translation," Translated Well
","Lost in Translation is another favorite film of mine, which appealed to me and entertained me on many levels. First the film is an astute exposition on Japanese culture and how westerners might perceive or misunderstand it. Though much of the humor originated from this, Lost in Translation could almost be a documentary on modern Japanese city culture, I think. Also the film mirrored a very similar experience I had when I lived in Japan for a short time. I can totally identify with Scarlett Johanson's character, as I too wandered around in a jet lagged daze, marveling at the sometimes strange, sometimes more efficient, sometimes incomprehensible differences in the Japanese solutions, customs, and tastes. But my main reason for liking this film is that I think it truly showed an uncommonly realistic love story. It was a love story of a different sort with two married people that meet and connect intimately (seemingly more intimately than their respective spouses) without overt sexuality, despite a gulf of age, and, I think, maturely and honorably. To me the ending was apt and perfect.",9,0,2,13 December 2004
V for Vendetta," Um.... sorry, but... no
","I guess I felt compelled to chime in here because so many people (here) seem to think this is a great film, to the extent that they've even elevated into the top #250. I liked the film and could see how audiences might be inspired by the imagery (a man standing up for justice in a dystopian society) and stirring dialogue, but this is no '1984' or, IMO the more brilliant 'Brazil'. I felt that I must at least record my 2 cents here as a lone voice of dissent in the wilderness.It starts out very promising, I thought. I found the character of V interesting and charming, and the initial premise captivating (if not original). I was even willing to forgive a certain number of logical and/or technical lapses that inconveniently shattered my suspension of disbelief. But in the second half of the film, we are asked to accept so many strange, unrealistic reactions, logical flaws, and physical stretches that I was truly disappointed. It became a total fantasy to me by the end, and I no longer much cared what happened to these characters.(spoilers beyond this point) Sure I'll go along with some of the minor suspensions, like security in a totalitarian state is so easily bypassed around government ministers and buildings, that V with his mask on has great, non-fogging visibility in combat somehow, or that he is that deadly with knives only.But some of the larger suspensions that we are asked to accept: -I guess the big one is the Evey torture sequence, which was effective in conveying terror and humiliation. The inspiration of that beautiful letter was moving. But then, to find out it was all staged by V as a way to teach a lesson/to indoctrinate was... flabbergasting! Stockholm Syndrome aside, I don't think my reaction would be to sympathize with my torturer, when there were at least alternative methods that could have been tried (like simply asking for example).-After demonstrating to us how brutal and all controlling the government is, are we to believe that Evey's comedy talk show friend had no inkling that staging and broadcasting a show that so sharply parodies and mocks the government would have no real serious repercussions? A person with a house full of contraband at the very least drawing government attention to himself like that is illogical. And even if it was some suicidal final gesture, at least have the courtesy to warn your fugitive houseguest that stormtroopers might be bursting through the door at any moment! -Body armour and combat prowess aside, I could not after a while accept his continued 'bullet proofness' and/or great luck in avoiding bullets, and then his fantastic mobility in his body armor.-Let's not forget, after the totalitarian government is warned (a year in advance) of a specific target building, and all other security measures are taken to protect this target, that they would somehow overlook a railway tunnel that goes underneath the building! or if they did not forget it, then, somehow they missed the big railway car packed with explosives and fertilizer.phew! I feel better now. It's not a bad film, but I don't see it as a great film. Thank goodness there is no thought police that prevents me from saying this. I just wish that they had.... Oops! there's a knock at my door. I better go ch-- Aaarrrrrghh!!!",7,1,3,2 April 2006
