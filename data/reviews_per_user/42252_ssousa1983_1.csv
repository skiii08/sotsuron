The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Great movie, i loved it.
","I've been wanting to see this movie for a while and i just had the chance to see it today. Afterwards i felt compelled to write a review for a first time ever, i think is a beautiful and powerful movie with great acting, great script, great story telling. For those of us who were raised in the 90s will be like traveling back in time, it will bring you so many feelings back. Having said that i believe this movie can be appreciate it by anyone. Once again great acting, i loved them all and i would be looking forward to see more work in the future from Emma Watson. If is of any help i would recommend this movie for everyone, even buy it if you have the chance i'm sure i will. Greatings from Spain.",9,0,0,3 September 2013
