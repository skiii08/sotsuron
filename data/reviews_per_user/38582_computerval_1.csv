The Incredible Hulk," above average, kind like sequel of Ang Lee's Hulk
","I would give 5 if it's not for all those cheap computer animations. It does feels like a sequel to Ang Lee's Hulk because it begins exactly at the point where Ang Lee ended the last Hulk...He went to south America and keep telling people don't make him angry stuff. Plus it copied some parts from previous Hulk also. For example, the bullet bouncing skin, the magic underpants, the white hair white mustache warmonger general, going 1 on 1 with the military(again), even the animation character also look alike too. Many parts were like the remake of the previous Hulk movie. Also it took 'Mr. Gray' from Dreamcatcher(2003) and use it as Mr. Blue and Mr. Green. One part where Hulk sit with his girl on the cliff reminded me of King Kong somehow. The writers must saw that movie too.How about the story? The 2/3 part is like Jackie Chan movie where he was just being chasing around, except this time it's Mr. Bourne on Barry Bond's super steroid. The last 1/3 part of the movie made no sense at all. The bad guy just decided to ruin the town for no reason? Made no sense. I guess some people like it because of the big bang theory even it has no story at all.In summary I still like Ang Lee's Hulk better because it got more characters, more stories in it, not just endless bang bang crash crash. This movie really got no stories in it, it's just an cheap extended version of previous Hulk mixed with more computer animation actions and then added with an meaningless ending, probably the writers were out of ideas on how to end the movie.",6,2,6,19 June 2008
