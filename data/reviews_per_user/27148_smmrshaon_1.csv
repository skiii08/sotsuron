It," An adventure, not just a horror movie!
",I love the 80's setting of Stephen King. This movie reminds me of Stranger Things. I am not a big horror movie fan but this one is actually one of the top movies of my 2017 list. I used to read lots of detective stories in my youth which were based on a bunch of kids doing adventures. Not a lot of movies now a days are made entertaining that idea or setting. This one brings me back to that world of detective adventures.,9,3,5,23 September 2017
