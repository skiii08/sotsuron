Requiem for a Dream," The most disturbing portrait of addiction I've seen on film
","The title pretty much sums up it all. You'll remember the performances way after this film end. Most of films I've seen about addiction didn't show a portrait as raw as this film, it's almost psychological horror",9,1,1,3 September 2018

","Everything is well done, but the most remarkable thing, doubtlessly, is Ren√©e Falconetti's performance.",9,1,2,24 October 2018
