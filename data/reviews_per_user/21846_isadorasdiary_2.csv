The Legend of Bagger Vance," Glad I trusted Ebert on this one!
","I have a lot of faith in Will Smith and Matt Damon.  They seem to keep their integrity even through the worst settings (Smith in the *Fresh Prince of Belair* series and *Men in Black* and Damon in Spielberg's *Saving Private Ryan*).  So when I saw they were both in this movie, I had to see it.  Then I read some professional reviews from various magazines, etc., and heard almost nothing but that the movie was pretentious, slow, pointless, self-indulging, etc.  Thank God I happened upon Ebert's review amongst all these negative ones.  He nearly stood alone in judging it to be a movie with a lot to offer, and so I took the chance, and I think he was right. (If I were to do a review of movie reviewers, he'd get two thumbs up from me--very even-minded, not given to knee-jerks, even if I don't always agree with him.)Though a long movie, I didn't notice the length.  I have to admit, I stumbled through the choppy beginning as Charlize Theron struggled to hold up scenes on her own.  I began to fear that all the other reviewers were right, but when the golf got started, so did the movie.  It was a very nice movie about personal resolve and achieving excellence, and was wisely philosophical as well (through the mouth of Smith's Bagger Vance character). By the way, I don't know anything about golf, but I read another user commentator who swears the movie was 100% historically accurate in depicting the state of golf at the time, even if there didn't seem to be quite as much racial prejudice on and off the golf course as you would expect during the Depression.  The two golf competitors, played by Bruce McGill and Joel Gretsch, were both amazing supporting actors, making the golf competition that much more of a rich experience.  The movie also had it's share of humor: the entire scene with Damon's character, Junuh, playing cards with his black drinking buddies; and when Junuh turns to Vance during the tournament and declares, 'You're one hell of a caddy.'I'd probably only give the movie a 6, if I thought such unqualified ratings very valid, but if you go to movies to find at least a few great moments, as I do, this movie is sure to bring you out of the rough with a number of inspiring master strokes on director Robert Redford's part.",Null,0,1,28 February 2001
American Psycho," Reasons why AP is a good study of serial killers and why Kafka would be proud
","Sorry, some spoilers:My first reaction to the movie was that, though I personally found it very absorbing, I walked away not understanding why Patrick Bateman was a serial killer in the first place. I now think this is mainly because we get no peek into Bateman's child life, but I don't think that's necessary to the story and would have probably ruined it.  I came up with some reasons why Bateman is a believable serial killer.  Support from the movie is given with each reason:1/ Serial killers are notably superficial, though not often described this way.  This can be said especially of male serial killers, who typically kill randomly, without regard for any personal relationship with the victim.Bateman: A large part of the movie was showing how the superficiality of 80's corporate society and serial killing are strangely resonant.  One theorist of serial killers, thinking before *American Psycho,* uses a metaphor to understand their psyche: that they are basically a black hole. Once they get started killing, their personality just gets sucked into non-existence, into a sort of black hole.  Sometimes, they scramble to regain that personality, the memories, attitudes, experiences and personal relationships that made them unique and gave their life long term meaning, meaning beyond the next kill, but after the slayings pile up, this becomes quite difficult.  Reminds me of Bateman.2/ Serial killers often attack prostitutes, since they're easy nocturnal targets, and the killing is usually predominantly sexually motivated as well.Bateman killed hookers.3/ Serial killers are generally unable to explain why they do what they do. 
Bateman couldn't help doodling death scenes, so preoccupied was he.  Also, in his phone confession toward the end of the movie, Bateman realized how basically compulsive it was for him to kill, that he just keeps wanting to do it and does it, there being no other reason really that he could think of.4/ Though rarely able to explain their bloodthirsty desires and actions, Ted Bundy, when interviewed about it, came up with a 'possession' theory. Killing his young female victims was like the ultimate possession of them.Bateman displayed a marked obsession with possessions.  Major theme of the movie.5/ Ted Bundy was charismatic and smart, too, and even acted as his own defense attorney.So, it's not impossible that Bateman could be a serial killer with very, at least, surface social traits and also function in a corporate environment that places demands on one's intelligence and focus, while at the same time killing regularly.6/ Serial killers often feel like people are out to get them and/or feel superior to others.Bateman had these sorts of experience and attitudes within the corporate environment and acted on them lethally.7/ Serial killers are typically not 'insane,' which connotes that they can't in any way understand that what they're doing is wrong.  Rather, serial killers are typically 'psychopathic' and are prone to feelings of regret, even if they tend for the most part to feel justified.  Their conscience often returns most strongly, if it does, when the cops catch up.Bateman had a great need to confess after the cops chased him.
These are just a few reasons for believing *American Psycho* could be thought of as an accurate portrayal of the psychopathic serial killer.  I haven't read the book, but I suspect that the psychology would be even better explored there.  Even if Bateman is peculiarly different from past serial killers, each serial killer is different, and serial killers do evolve with society.  I think this movie goes beyond previous slasher films in psychological insight, maybe beyond Stone's *Natural Born Killers,* too.Final note on literary parallels (here's the real spoiler).  In the end, Bateman has the need to confess, but is unable to gain recognition for his guilt.  The satisfaction of confession is prevented because the level of superficiality is so high in his corporate subculture that no one is certain who's who anyway.  So, who's the killer?  And what's it mean to say, 'I am'? The meaningless, grotesque superficiality of the work place and the confusing misplacement of guilt and punishment are themes reminiscent of Kafka's work, say 'Metamorphosis' and *The Trial.*  If you asked, 'What's the point?' of Kafka's stuff, you're probably asking that about this movie too.",Null,2,4,28 February 2001
