Sucker Punch," Brilliant film
",This has to be one of the best films of all time. It is highly original and certainly nothing I have seen before. The action sequences are incredibly stylish and exhilarating with extremely well done special effects. The girls are gorgeous and dressed very sexily. It almost has a Japanese feel to it. I was expecting something pretty simple to follow but actually struggled to really understand what was going on. It was only by doing some research that I understood what it was about. That didn't spoil my enjoyment though of this amazing film. As for the predictable bad reviews I can only say what kind of film were you expecting? You must have seen the trailers and promo photos. If you want 'On Golden Pond' then why watch this? Very highly recommended. If you like the look of the cover you won't be disappointed!,10,5,12,18 June 2011
