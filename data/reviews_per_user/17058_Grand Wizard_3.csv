Requiem for a Dream," disappointment
","**spoilers within***I was disappointed in Requiem For a Dream.Just because the movie is original and has some cool directional effects does not mean it should shamelessly be branded 'genius'.  The user comment summary on the main 'Requiem For a Dream' page says:'Killer Performances by Ellen Burstyn...Darren Aronofsky, Stanley Kubrik has called for you to pull up a chair!'I mean, please, Stanley Kubrick, apart from being dead, has definitely not said anything about pulling up a chair. To lump Darren Aronofsky & RFAD with the unrivalled genius of Kubrick & The Shining/Eyes Wide Shut/Paths of Glory/Barry Lyndon... need I go on... is an unpardonable sin. Anyway, allow me to continue.The movie has to grip you on a deeper level than purely superficial which me, my bro & my mate all agree it does not.That does not mean I don't agree with the movies message, that addiction leads to a downward spiral of destruction, I just thought the movie wasn't that gripping or as interesting as I had hoped.  I also do not think this is a 'drugs are bad' movie per se, the movie is just impartially illustrating a case scenario of addictions on various levels.The movie loses momentum, and the continual intermissions of cocaine snorting, pot smoking and heroin injections disturb the flow of the movie after a while.  By the end of the movie rather than be shocked at how appaling the situation has become, I was just glad the predictable and inevitable ending was over.A word from the wizard: 'there's more to a good movie than original directing and shock stories'.Overall i was left disappointed by the movie, expecting more from it. 5/10.",Null,1,1,5 December 2001
American Psycho," very bad movie
","**SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN***i can't believe how monotonous this movie was. after seeing so many action - drama - thrillers... a movie is going to require more than just cutting someone up with an ax for no apparent reason to enjoy... that type of stuff is no big deal.needless to say, the movie did not offer any more... the 80s mundane setting alone is enough to want to go shoot yourself.... every scene is so bland, so boring, his (patrick batemans) apartment is so boring, so impersonal...
all the actors are boring impersonal greaseball yuppie schmucks with no personality and no life... you can't relate to this movie on any level... and the lead actor patrick bateman has a LISHP.... very annoying.on a positive note, i did like the business card scene when they all took out their business cards and compared.overall: 3/10. incredible waste of time.",3,0,2,6 August 2001
Dog Day Afternoon," what a crap movie, what a let-down
","*** spoilers contained within ***7.9/10. #206 on imdb.com all time rankings. al pacino. these elements certainly seemed to point to an awesome movie.  me and my mate spotted this movie at the local video shop and noted it for future reference, we hired it last night... and we were looking forward to a great movie.i guess it was a bad omen right from the start, the unprofessional manner in which al pacino clumsily ripped his shotgun from his gift-wrapped box... it was disappointing the pathetic manner in which they held up the bank, unprofessional and emotional, unable to get the job done.  lighting a fire in the bank? how stupid...
the actors were pretty crap, the fbi guy sheldon, and moretti too. at least the pizza guy offered some comic relief. another thing, we noticed that al pacino spoke different to usual, like a stereotypical gay guy... which was annoying.. when we found out he actually was gay, as was exemplified by a long boring phone call to his 'wife' Leon, the PENNY DROPPED. listen to the way al pacino says 'please put out that fire' near the start of the movie.. he sounds so pathetic. i did appreciate the bits where he manipulates the crowds .. when he steps outside etc, but overall i was disappointed in this movie.i guess it was a hit in the gay community. i dont see why else it is so rated... it is long and boring.also the dvd had no special features, and the picture quality left somewhat to be desired, with notable artefaction in the backgrounds.after the gruelling exercise of watching this 119 min movie, i immediately logged onto imdb.com and gave it a 1/10, feeling thorougly depressed after hoping to be in for a great watch.",1,15,58,26 August 2001
