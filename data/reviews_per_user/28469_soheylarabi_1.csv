Minority Report," a perfect from a perfect!
","I have not seen any bad film from this director (Spielberg), but this film is wonderful. The best science fiction film that I have ever seen. The action scenes are the best, You can not move until they end! Tom Cruise did one of his best in this movie. I don't remember him in any film like this. Of course he has some brilliant plays in other films ,but it is another thing! Keep on doing your best Steven! 'Minority Report' is a movie with a fantastic storyline, one of the best I've ever heard of. The actors are great, the directing is great, of course, it's Spielberg. Even the effects are great, they are done with ILM. Roger Ebert says that this movie 'reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place,' and I agree with him.",10,3,6,31 December 2007
