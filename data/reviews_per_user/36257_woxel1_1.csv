Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not for people who pretend they're intellectuals and post in message board-type settings to denounce works of art, present company excluded.
","Kill Bill Vol. 2, whether viewed separately or as a whole `Kill Bill' experience, needs to be seen through the prism of experience to ultimately determine its place in the history of cinema. However, as is - in the authors opinion - Kill Bill Vol. 2 is one of the most entertaining and rewarding experiences that can be enjoyed in the theaters (for the next few weeks).Like it or not, Quentin Tarantino is talented (albeit a talented horse's backside in the eyes of most people), but even if he made the same type of film over and over again, he would give it the much appreciated QT touch. In Kill Bill Vol. 2, he seems to have evolved as a filmmaker, not only populating his worlds with memorable characters and dialogue, but also justifying them in ways you wouldn't expect.Also, Kill Bill Vol. 2 gives the same level of action and tension you would expect, although such instances are on a much smaller scale than Vol. 1, which in ways make them more brutal (a comparison of the violence from Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 would be like the difference between a movie like The Matrix and Se7en). The action complements the dialogue expertly and the payoff provides moments of euphoric weightlessness on the part of the viewer.And hey, I might be wrong about all this, but I had a great time so I guess that's what counts, right?",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
