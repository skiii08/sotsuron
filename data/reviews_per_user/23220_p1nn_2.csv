The Hangover," Hilarious film
","I watched this film for the first time 2 weeks ago, have since at least watched this film end to end 5 times, have watched certain scenes a good 20 times and learnt Stu's song on the keyboard. So needless to say, I enjoyed this film very much and some might even call it a (slight) obsession. What I love the most are the ridiculous and exaggerated situations that the gang has to overcome. The cast did a fantastic job portraying their roller coaster of emotions as they try to trace their steps and figure out what happened during their wild night. The characters in the movie are well developed, with each having his or her own distinct personality. These personalities are clearly surfaced through the way each character responds both verbally and physically under different situations. The characters' strengths and weaknesses complement one another well and the cast had great chemistry. Overall, this movie is a must-watch!",9,1,1,15 February 2019
Aladdin," Stunning
","I watched it in IMAX and it is absolutely stunning. The visuals are so beautiful and the singing is good too. I especially love the new song speechless!Would have given it a 10 but I do feel that for the high notes in Speechless, Naomi's voice sounds a little weak, only a teeny bit but enough for me to feel like the power isn't quite there.",9,1,2,27 June 2019
