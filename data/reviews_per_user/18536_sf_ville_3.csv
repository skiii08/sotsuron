Angels & Demons," Much better than the DVC
","Ron Howard does much better in his second shot at Dan Brown's pulp history/sci-fi/conspiracy/religious thrillers. The scenes are paced much better while still including some great cinematographic shots of Rome and the Vatican. This might be due to trimming down some of the historical conspiracies and their meanings. While these historical ponderings were key to a good deal of the excitement and suspense that Brown created in his novels, I think they disrupted the pace of the action in the DVC.With a leaner story, A&D moves much better as a movie than the DVC. Purists may take some offense to this, but imho, movies should be made with a movie audience in mind. Trimming the story to make for a better movie is perfectly fine and quite a few other novel adaptations could / would have benefited from this deed (e.g. Harry Potter).",8,0,1,1 December 2010
Public Enemies," Meh...
","Stick around after the credits for the special ending, where they show all of 'Heat' to make up for this tragedy. Oh noes! Anyways... Public Enemies opens decently with a fairly exciting action scene, but the rest of the movie devolves into a soulless, lifeless, and style-less documentary of Dillinger vs the FBI. Billy Crudup does a great Hoover, but the rest of the characters are pretty forgettable. After having to sit through Miami Vice (the movie) and this bust, I'm gonna have to say that Michael Mann's lost it. But just like how I'll remember Michael Jackson for everything up through Bad, and Chuck Liddell for everything up through Wanderlei, I'll always remember the movie gold that Michael Mann gave us up through Collateral.",4,0,3,9 July 2009
Drag Me to Hell," As fun as it gets
","Yep, I'm gonna say it. This is Sam Raimi's best work yet. Stylewise, this is definitely a more jolting horror than Army of Darkness & the Evil Dead films. The jokes and gags don't come as often as they do in AoD, but he puts more into setting them up, so that when they do come, they're even more shockingly hilarious than the ones in AoD. Raimi invests more in character building in this film, leading us to both squirm and howl even more at all the punishment that Christine (the heroine) takes. I like the horror movie genre, but I'm sick of all the predictably bad schlock that the movie studios put out there just to make a quick buck. Thank god Raimi has returned some credibility to horror. If you like roller coasters, this is the maliciously fun movie for you.",10,2,6,9 July 2009
