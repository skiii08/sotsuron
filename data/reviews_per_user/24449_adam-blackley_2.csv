The Devil's Advocate," An incredible moral tale, powerful, engaging
","This is an amazing films for many reasons. Fistly the amazing performance from Pacino. He brings an unashamed, manic, crazed, chain-smoking quality to the Devil, and his portrayal is completely believable. Surprisingly, I found Keanu Reeves' performance fine, despite having disliked him in other films - he does the job that needs to be done - an ambitious lawyer, who for some reason (is it just because of his skill?) has never lost a case. Within the first few minutes, he comes across a moral dilemma (whether to continue fending a maths teacher who he knows is guilty of harassing a teenage girl), and he basically says to himself (without speaking, he checks his teeth in the mirror, as if to tell himself, 'look, I'm a layer, this is what I do - I'm going to defend him as best I can'). And wins the case. The story is an incredible moral tale, because in the end he does do the right thing, and defies the devil (although the closing shot is of Pacino and we know he might get to him again). Thoroughly enjoyable, striking, original film.",10,1,1,8 October 2005
American History X," I'm afraid I really did not enjoy this - and not for the reason you might think.
","I'm afraid I really did not enjoy this - and not for the reason you might think (I wasn't disturbed by the racism or the violence portrayed by the film). I am afraid that contrary to the seemingly endless praise given to this film and its director, Tony Kaye, and indeed recommendations from my friend that I should see this film, when I did I felt cheated and annoyed. There's no denying that what the film portrays is shocking and powerful, and that Edward Norton's performance is equally powerful, almost coming close in intensity to De Niro's Bickle, and the set-pieces are well made, but the inability for the filmmakers' to create a convincing story spoilt the whole film for me - the way we see in endless flashbacks (often the sign of a weak storyteller), Norton's firstly ordinary, sane, likable character's seemingly easy conversion to a Nazi maniac just by his dad uttering a few racist sentences at the dinner table is frankly ridiculous. Plus his seemingly easy conversion back from a Nazi maniac while in prison, just through speaking to a nice black guy. I'm sorry, but it just negates the whole film's power. Not to mention the endless flashy camera techniques used by former ad director Kaye, NOTE: slow motion close ups of a running shower tap does not a good film make. The film opens on a black and white shot of the ocean, for no apparent reason, leading to the conclusion that Kaye thought he could appear as a 'clever' and 'sophisticated' filmmaker by showing us an 'arty' opening sequence. This kind of pretencion is as irritating as the lack of convincing back story. Nope, sorry Mr Kaye, wasn't for me.",2,4,18,11 June 2005
