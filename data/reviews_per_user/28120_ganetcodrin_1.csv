Blade Runner 2049," what a complete pile of shit
","Most stupid and boring movie i've seen in a while, don't actually know the original one but this one lacks story, depth, music, effects.. and basically everything you would expect from a sci-fi title. imo the most interesting thing about this film was the ending.. couln't come sooner -_-",1,2,5,20 January 2018
