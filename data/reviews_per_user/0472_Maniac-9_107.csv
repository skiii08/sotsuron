Moneyball," Good story about behind the scenes of a baseball team
","This is a good movie if you want to know what it takes to put together a baseball team without having the advantage of having a big budget to spend on whatever you like to. Breaking down the stats of players to see which players you can get cheap but still have a lot of value. The analytic evaluation of players. Going deeper into the stats then just simply using the old batting average, home runs and runs batted in stats. Billy Beane played by Brad Pitt and Peter Brand played by Jonah Hill(Paul DePodesta in real life) are the guys behind this movement in baseball. This movie one of the main players they focused on was Scott Hatteberg who they converted from a Catcher to First Base since he couldn't throw that well anymore since he was injured, but they still thought his On Base Percentage stats would be a good addition to the team.",9,0,2,3 February 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A truly original movie
","This movie is great in that it mixes together so many different genres of movies with martial arts, revenge, spaghetti western and assassin.Quentin Tarantino gives us a movie that I doubt that any other writer/director would likely be able to put together as a film since most other directors don't have the same kind of originality and inspiration.Kill Bill Volume 2 is the better half of the Kill Bill movie, don't get me wrong I enjoyed Volume 1 also but Vol. 2 is the Substance while Volume 2 is the Style.Uma Thurman delivers what is probably the best performance of her career, even more so then her performance in Pulp Fiction.",10,1,3,25 January 2013
Scarface," Pacino is simply masterful
","Scarface wasn't quite the movie I was expecting to see, but that's not necessarily a bad thing either.  I had been watching all the Godfather movies a few days before I first saw Scarface so I was expecting a normal kind of mafia story.  It's a crime story and all but not a mafia story, I thought it was cool as hell.   Al Pacino is such a great actor, he does like a metabolic change in each role.  He doesn't even seem to be the same actor.  You actually believe he is Cuban refugee just as in Godfather you can believe he is an americanized son of a Sicilian mafia don.  Plus I don't think I have ever seen a movie with nearly as many cuss words as Scarface before.",10,0,0,6 August 1998
Miracle," Completely captured the 1980 miracle
","The 1980 United States Olympic win of the Gold Medal is one of the most pure and genuine accomplishments in sports history. This movie starring Kurt Russell was completely perfect as far as a believable and realistic portrayal of the events surrounding those games.Russia at the time was by far considered the dominant hockey team on a worldwide level, even beating All Star teams of NHL players. But Herb Brooks was able to put together a hockey team of primarily college players to pull off this gigantic upset.Most of the hockey players in this movie were played by actual hickey players to make the hockey games seem realistic and didn't have a bunch of fake hockey scenes played by actors with nothing more then a crash course in playing hockey.",10,1,1,2 February 2012
Ali," Moves like a butterfly, stings like a bee
","Best performance of Will Smith's career. Will Smith can be a really good actor capable of playing fully 3 dimensional characters instead of his normal wisecracking self if he actually tries to be. But he's more content to play it safe and just star in a bunch of sci-fi comedies instead of truly challenging himself.Jamie Foxx was really good in his supporting role, this is the role of Foxx's where people started to taking him seriously and stopped thinking of him as that idiot from Booty Call.Mario Van Peebles made a return to feature films after being stuck in direct to video oblivion playing Malcolm X.Jon Voight is absolutely brilliant as Howard Cosell.",10,0,1,7 February 2012
The Expendables 2," Great movie that doesn't try to be something it's not
",The Expendables 2 is a great movie because it gives the audience exactly what they're paying the price of their ticket for. They want a shoot 'em up movie with a collection of all their favorite action stars of the past united in the same movie. It's not rocket science you just want all your old favorites in good action scenes in a movie with an R Rating with a bunch of one liners and memorable death scenes for the characters that do die.You have bigger involvements in part 2 of the series from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger and that's an automatic bonus over the first movie in the series. Plus you also have some new action blood with someone like Liam Hemsworth added to the mix. Plus then you have the old favorites from the first movie in addition to adding names like Chuck Norris and Jean-Claud Van Damme,9,1,2,24 January 2013
In Bruges," Refreshing movie
","In Bruges is a fairly simple and straight forward movie but how they go about things is quite delightful.It's a movie about a couple of Irish hit men(Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Belgium while things settle down on a hit that went wrong. This is one of Farrell's best performances, he tends to do better in smaller budget movies then the huge blockbusters he does in Hollywood. He's quite funny as the bored and antsy younger guy. Gleeson plays the older and more calm veteran hit-man. Ralph Fiennes plays their boss Harry, Peter Dinklage the 4'5' dwarf from Games of Thrones shows up here and is absolutely hilarious in his role.The locations and scenery in the movie are absolutely enchanting.",9,0,4,12 February 2012
Friday Night Lights," Football movie done right
","Friday Night Lights is in my opinion the best football movie ever put on film. It has a realistic feel to it for anyone who's played high school football. It's especially realistic in the way in how it portrays how much high school football means to small towns in states like Texas. Everything about this movie rings true if you've been involved in the same circumstances.It has a great cast headed by Billy Bob Thornton, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, Tim McGraw and Connie Britton.All the football game action looks like you're watching real game footage from a high school football game. If you're a football fan, heck a movie fan in general I highly recommend this movie.",10,1,2,17 January 2013
Se7en," Great story
","An  extremely well written and directed movie starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey.  About a veteran homicide cop(Freeman) and his new partner(Pitt) who just transferred to the department.  The killer (Spacey) kills people for comitting the seven deadly sins.  Then would write the persons sin on the scene of the crime with the persons blood or some other item.   That's all I can give away, it's a really good movie that I advise you to go see.",8,0,0,5 August 1998
Star Trek," Saved the franchise
","Let's be honest here, if this movie wasn't successful it might have been the end of the Star Trek franchise. The Deep Space, Enterprise and Voyager TV series didn't have enough of a fan base to support a feature film series of films. The original Star Trek crew and The Next Generation crew are both too old to really compete with current blockbusters. Even though the actors from the original Star Trek series are too old now the characters themselves were still very popular in syndication and replay of their movies. So starting over with them with younger actors in the roles is really the best way to go. Plus with them doing it where it's more of an alternate history instead of a reboot they can do new stories with them without having to worry about ruining the original Star Trek's lineage and poking holes in their stories.",10,5,7,10 February 2012
Memento," Super Intelligent movie
",If you're tired of nothing but typical braindead cinema where the writers and directors are basically just insulting your intelligence then you won't get that here. This is one of the most well thought out and interesting movies made in recent years.The story is about Leonard who loses all of his short term memory after his wife is raped and killed. Leonard relies on taking polaroids with notes on back of them and getting tattoos of things he wants to remember in the solving of his wifes murder.The story unfolds in reverse to help make everything even more so confusing.,10,0,1,28 January 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Another Tarantino masterpiece
",Quentin Tarantino spawns his vision of what a World War 2 movie would be like. It's about a platoon of Jewish American soldiers who go on an Apachee Resistance in German occupied France killing as many nazi's and taking their scalps as can be. Brad Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine the leader of the platoon.Christoph Waltz gives an amazing performance as the German Colonel Hans Landa whose job is to hunt down and kill jews hiding out in France during this time.Tarantino in addition to introducing Waltz to American audiences also does the same thing for French actress Melanie Laurent who's absolutely gorgeous.Mike Myers even shows up in a cameo playing a British General for one scene.A long time favorite of mine is Til Schweiger who plays Hugo Stiglitz who was previously a German soldier who went around killing tons of German officers which gets him locked up by his own people before the Basterds break him out to help out with their cause.,10,0,1,18 January 2013
Lords of Dogtown," The lords of skateboarding
","Prior to the Z Boys skateboarding team in the Dogtown part of Santa Monica it wasn't even considered a sport with most of the tricks being more related towards gymnastics. The Z Boys one of the first teams to use polyurethane wheels which allowed them to take their skateboarding to a whole other level then anyone else. They were able to make skateboarding into more of a fast paced and daredevil artform that it's today. Being able to stay on their boards on more types of terrain then ever before. They invented skating empty swimming pools which eventually lead to vert skating being invented. All of the skateboarders of the 1980's like Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi, Mike McGill, Lance Mountain and s on wouldn't have been able to do what they did if it wasn't for Stacy Peralta, Jay Adams and Tony Alva. They were truly the forefathers of modern skateboarding.",8,5,5,3 March 2012
12 Monkeys," 5 billion dead
","The year is 2035 and almost everyone on earth is dead.  The few remaining survivors from a plague that wiped out most of the population are forced to live underground to be kept away from the germs.  They recruit James Cole (Bruce Willis) to go back to 1996 to find the antidote but he accidentally gets sent back to 1990 and winds up in a mental hospital.  Cole meets Jeffrey Goines(Brad Pitt), he accidentally mentions to Goines that the world gets wiped out and thinks he gave Goines the idea to wipe out the world.  With the help of his shrink Dr. Kathryn Railly(Madeleine Stowe) he tries to stop Goines and his army of 12 Monkeys.",9,0,0,13 August 1998
42," Well done movie about important subject matter
","42 is a great baseball movie and a great movie in general as how it relates to the civil rights movement of the mid 1900's. Before Rosa Parks refused to take a seat in the back of a bus there was Jackie Robinson. Jackie when he integrated baseball wasn't only integrating that sport but also taking the first step in ending of the Jim Crow laws which unfairly mistreated a whole race of people for no good reason.Amazing performance by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, Ford totally immerses himself in the role and you don't see Harrison Ford the guy known for being Han Solo, Indiana Jones or Jack Ryan but you see Branch Rickey. It was a very inspired casting choice going with Ford who wouldn't have been an obvious choice for the role.Chadwick Boseman definitely stepped up to the plate in his first leading role. Prior to this movie the only time I had seen Boseman in a movie was his one scene at the end of The Express playing Floyd Little.All of the game action and actors playing the ballplayers of that time were really authentic in their appearance.",9,0,0,1 May 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The movie that made Depp a box office superstar
","Prior to this movie Johnny Depp had a nice solid Hollywood career that was very well respected by peers and fans alike. But he was never really that much of a box office draw. He was always known for quirky, interesting and odd ball movies but never brought in the masses. It was this movie where he created one of the most hilarious characters with his Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp was able to take what was just a Disney park ride into a major movie franchise because of his charisma in the lead role. I don't think another actor could've pulled off this role and been taken seriously. Most other actors taking the character choices that Depp did here probably would've been laughed out of the theater but Depp just has that It Factor with this role that it was perfectly created for him that it just clicked.",10,0,1,9 March 2012
The Rocker," The Rocker, more like The Emoer
","I get the idea that the studios after the success of The School of Rock movie wanted to make their own version of a Rock N' Roll themed movie, but they obviously struck out here. First of all the band they chose to be the star of the movie is an Emo style band and they make the villainous evil popular band that you're supposed to hate a hard rock band. I'm sorry but if you go to a rock concert anywhere and you have the choice to listening to either an emo band play or a hard rock band the harder band is going to win out every time. And you can tell that the studio who greenlit this was hoping to have Jack Black play the lead role but when he turned them down they decided to go with Rainn Wilson instead. I like Wilson as Dwight Schrute but it's kind of hard to buy him as a rock n' roll musician.",5,0,2,15 March 2012
Public Enemies," Johnny Depp as depression era bank robber
","Johnny Depp plays the role of John Dillinger one of the most notorious of all the depression era bank robbers, his contemporaries being Baby Face Nelson(Stephen Graham) and Pretty Boy Floyd(Channing Tatum). Dillinger is hunted by the FBI Agent Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale), playing Dillinger's girlfriend is Marion Cotillard.The movie really transports you to the 1930's, you really feel like you're in that era. The writer of the movie seems to have really researches the era great since everything rings true of what it was like back then.The story also shows the birth of the FBI with J. Edgar Hoover as Purvis' boss and the overall boss of the organization.I highly recommend anyone check out this movie.",9,0,2,8 March 2012
That Thing You Do!," Stands the test of time
","The movie no matters how many times you've seen it always remains an enjoyable movie to watch with some great actors. Tom Hanks definitely makes a great showing in his directorial debut.The story focuses on a local Scranton, PA band that goes from obscurity to being a fast rising band. When the original drummer of the band hurts his hand before playing a gig they bring in Guy to replace him and his participation in the band changes the trajectory of the band. Eventually they get signed to Tom Hanks character who works for a big label called Playtone Records. Things are going good for a bit touring the country doing concerts. But then they get called to Hollywood and end up doing a bunch of pointless appearances. After awhile tension builds in the band and they end up breaking up, ultimately the band ends up being nothing more then a 1 hit wonder.",8,0,1,31 January 2012
500 Days of Summer," Very good performances by JGL and Zooey
",Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel both deliver excellent performances in the lead roles here. The movie blends the drama and comedy together quite well. The story is about Tom(JGL) and Summer(Zooey) who work together at a greeting card company. Over time Tom really starts getting feelings for Summer even though she is upfront with him telling him that she doesn't want a boyfriend. Tom pretends to be cool with this but it's pretty clear that he wants to be more friends with benefits which no matter what Tom does is all that she ever wants from him. After a while she quits her job at the greeting cards company and stops seeing him which leads him into a great depression.The movie which was an independent production is a sleeper hit. The movie is very clever and offbeat thing going for it.,9,1,1,10 March 2012
L.A. Confidential," Film noir done to perfection
","L.A. Confidential is a movie that all film noirs should aspire to be. It totally captures the feeling and perspective of things going on in the early 1950's. Tremendous cast with Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe in the lead roles with Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn in supporting roles. The movie even has a fake TV show called Badge of Honor which is very similar to the real life show Dragnet of that era.This is the movie that made Russell Crowe a star to the American filmgoing audience.How any self respecting legitimate movie fan voted for an over budgeted melodrama like Titanic over this great film should have their film voting credentials stripped ASAP.",10,2,4,16 January 2013
X-Men," The movies that started the current comic book movie craze
","The X-Men and Spider-Man movie series started the ball rolling on comic book movies being mega movie events like they are now. Prior to the 2000's there was comic book movies but they were more of a novelty then legitimate box office threats.The quality of the overall production of comic book movies is just drastically higher then ever before. You're getting some of the best actors, directors, writers, cinematographers and special effects people participating in the making of these movies now which wasn't always the case when you had Dolph Lundgren starring in The Punisher.This X-Men movie has a stellar cast with Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin and Bruce Davison.",10,1,2,31 January 2012
Fast & Furious 6," This is how fun movies should be
","The Fast and Furious movies are never going to be Oscar darlings but when you pay your money at the movie theater to see them you know what you're going to get and they deliver it for you. Not only are the F&F movies fun and great popcorn entertainment they don't insult your intelligence like the Transformers or Battleship type blockbusters do.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry together as the leads for the series. Great to see one of the original 4 characters of Michelle Rodriguez back in the fold. Her lack of presence was missing in Fast Five. Don't get me wrong Fast Five was a great movie even without her but the Brian, Dom, Mia and Letty characters make it feel like a true F&F movie. Without one of the 4 main characters it takes away from the F&F feel of the movie. That's probably why Tokyo Drift was the weakest of all the F&F movies.",10,7,14,28 May 2013
The Expendables," An action movie fans dream cast
","When sitting back as a kid being a fan of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and so on movies you always thought what would happen if they were all in the same movie. Well even though the showdown between the 3 mega Planet Hollywood partners is going to be saved for the sequels and they only had a quick non action scene in this movie it's still great to see Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke and so on share the screen with each other in kick butt fight scenes. If you don't like this movie then you should stick with your Glee DVDs and American Idol recordings on your DVR since I highly question if you're a real mans man.",10,1,3,25 February 2012
Horrible Bosses," Mildly entertaining but fairly forgettable
","Horrible Bosses isn't a terrible movie to watch if it's on HBO and you don't have anything better to watch but not exactly something that's going to rock your world from a fim making perspective. It's got Kevin Spacey wasting his talents in some dumb comedy when he needs to be in more serious movies and a total waste of his talents. Jason Bateman basically just plays the exact same character or at least the same persona for a character in every movie he's in. Probably the best thing about the whole movie is Jamie Foxx in his bit role, but he's only a few scenes. Don't get me wrong it could be a whole lot worse but a movies goal shouldn't be that it isn't as terrible as other movies, it should make a better effort to having a truly revolutionary film making experience.",6,2,4,20 January 2013
The Town," If there's anything that Ben Affleck knows...
","It would be writing/directing/producing movies that have to do with Boston and people who people in the Southie accent. Between The Town, Gone Baby Gone and Good Will Hunting you'd have to say it's safe to say he can relate to the type of characters in these movies. As the #2 lead Jeremy Renner is absolutely on his game as Jem his #2 guy in their crew. Blake Lively is very good in a far different type of character then you're used to seeing her in. Rebecca Hal, Jon Hamm, Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwiate also very good in their respective roles.Everything seems real about this movie whether it's the grittiness of the area they live in, the action choreography being spot on and just the overall characterization of the characters.",10,0,0,1 February 2012
Taxi Driver," DeNiro at the peak of acting excellence
","Robert DeNiro gives a tour de force of acting excellence in this movie. One of the best acting performances of all time. This is a period of DeNiro's career when he was consistently churning out Oscar calibre performances one after another. He had this movie, Godfather Part II, The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull all within the same basic time frame. When DeNiro and Scorsese were teaming up to make movies it was the best actor/director combinations in movie history. You had the best mind for movies in Scorsese working with the best on screen performer of his time.It's a study of a man who's completely alone in the world even when surrounded by other people. What DeNiro was able to do just looking into a mirror asking 'Are you talking to me' by himself is one of the best movie scenes in movie history.",10,11,15,17 January 2013
Lost in Translation," Watch if you enjoy staring into the camera
","This is the movie for you if you enjoy 2 hours of Bill Murray doing absolutely nothing but staring into the camera. Seriously there is nothing to see here. I get the whole being an outsider in a foreign land but that doesn't change the fact that there is nothing fun to watch about the movie. Are you really going to tell me that this movie has any replay value to you? I think I would rather watch paint dry then watch this movie again.I'm not a brain dead idiot who only enjoys Michael Bay movies either, but a movie has got to do something. You can't just use the lame excuse well it's art and you don't understand. I understand that I paid for a movie and instead I got Bill Murray bored out of his mind. Ought as well watch the weather channel if I wanted this level of excitement.",4,4,9,6 February 2012
Full Metal Jacket," Great war movie
",This is probably one of the best war movies I have ever seen.  The best part about the movie is when they go through basic training.  The only war movie I've seen were they show them in basic training before going off to fight. R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor basically steals the whole show.  I can't think of anyone pulling the role as perfectly as he does.,Null,0,0,3 August 1999
21 Jump Street," Not quite as bad as I thought it would be
","Considering that I'm only giving this movie a 5 rating when it went above my expectations of it just shows how little faith I had going into this movie. I guess it's better to be a entertainingly mediocre movie like this then to be a boring movie that's not as memorable. While there might be more middle of the pack movies that have slightly better acting then this a lot of them aren't as memorable.Channing Tatum is still someone who's still very much learning the craft of acting and Jonah Hill while slightly better then Tatum won't get confused for Daniel Day-Lewis any time soon. But light hearted comedies like this really play to their strengths. But Ice Cube as the Captain shows he hasn't evolved as an actor at all even though he's been acting since Boyz N the Hood, which was 20 years ago.",5,1,2,11 March 2013
The Godfather: Part II," Greater then great
","The first Godfather movie is one of the greatest movies ever made, bar none. But someone Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo are able to raise the bar even further with their follow up effort. The story of Michael Corleone, Vito Corleone and the rest of their crime family is expanded in this movie. There is 2 story lines going on at the same time. In what is supposed to be the present day you have Michael taking the family and it's interests to Nevada. In a flashback part of the movie you have Robert DeNiro taking over the Brando role as Don Vito from his roots in Sicily to when he came to America and then eventually rising in power as a young gangster in New York City. Al Pacino as Michael is one of the greatest on screen performances of all time.",10,0,2,23 January 2013
Rush," Best racing movie of all time?
","Ron Howard's Rush is by far the best auto racing movie I have ever seen. It really captures the feeling of what it feels like to be in the world of an auto racer. The previous auto racing movies like Days of Thunder, Talladega Nights and Driven just don't capture the feel of what it's really like to be a professional auto driver. Part of it is probably since it's based on a true story and not a fictional story with overally sappy or comedic moments that are totally unbelievable in comparison. The race scenes are very intense and totally captures your imagination.I like Chris Hemsworth in the Thor role but he was way more to sink into as an actor in this role. Daniel Bruhl is great also as the other lead character, both should get serious Academy Award consideration.",9,2,3,6 November 2013
Predator," Classic movie
","This is Arnold Schwarzeneggger in the prime of his career with some really good subject matter to work with. Great overall supporting cast to go with him in Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and others. Ventura is basically shooting out one liners with everything he says, for example 'I don't have the time to bleed'.Overall really well done movie from the special effects, the jungle setting, the design of the alien villain and so on. This is everything that a big budget action movie is supposed to be without insulting your intelligence. This movie has the sci fi storyline and a big army action style movie all wrapped up into 1.",9,1,2,2 February 2012
The Bourne Identity," The movie that put Matt Damon's career back on track
","Matt Damon had a huge splash on the Hollywood scene in 1997 with Good Will Hunting. But his followup movies like The Talented Mr. Ripley, All the Pretty Horses and The Legend of Bagger Vance failed to captivate both audiences and critics alike. It was this movie that not only made Damon an action movie start but a bankable star in general who started to get offered much better projects afterwards.The story is about a highly trained CIA assassin who while on a mission gets amnesia and then subsequently betrayed by his handlers.After Damon the stunts and the action scenes are the reasons this movie worked so well, along with a great supporting cast with Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, Franka Potente and Brian Cox.",9,3,3,9 February 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Peter Jackson creates a world that most thought would be impossible to put on screen
","Prior to Peter Jackson directing/producing The Lord of the Rings trilogy it was thought that these movies would be way to complex and hard to translate to film. But Jackson did the impossible and not only translated these books faithfully to film he made them one of the best series of movies of all times.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin played the two lead Hobbit characters with Viggot Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Orlando Bloom amongst others were all great in their own respective roles.This series of movies is actually two different trilogies with The Hobbit being the first movies in the series and The Lord of the Rings as the followup trilogy. Even though the LOTR movies were made first.",10,0,1,27 January 2013
American Beauty," Spacey at his best
","Kevin Spacey who is probably one of the best actors in the whole world gives what I think is the best role of his amazing career.  Which is no easy feat considering all the great roles he has already had L.A. Confidential, Glengarry Glen Ross, Seven, and The Usual Suspects. I usually am no big fan of Annette Bening but she also gives a great performance.  So do the young stars of the movie(Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley).  I was especially impressed with the young actors.  When you think of teenage actors you usually think of the wannabe actors on Dawson's Creek and stuff, but Birch, Suvari, and Bentley are real actors.",10,0,0,7 October 1999
Warrior," The battle of brothers
",I was blown away by the quality of this movie with overall great performances by everyone involved. They kept the real MMA fighters to limited roles with no dialogue where they didn't have to do much more then bring legitimacy of having real MMA fighters involved with the movie without bringing the movie down in the process of having to sit through their attempts at acting.The movie centers on 2 brothers who haven't seen each other in a long time. Tommy the former prodigy wrestler who went into the Marine Corps but has something to hide. Brendan the older brother who's a former UFC fighter and now currently a high school physics teacher. Both are fighting for the prize money but not for themselves. Tommy to help out his fellow Marine buddies family and Brendan to pay off his mortgage so he doesn't lose his house.The best part of this movie in comparison to other MMA movies it's about these brothers redemption and not about your cookie cutter MMA movie which just pits an evil promoter against your good guy which is lets be honest quite played out.,10,0,3,20 January 2012
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Groundbreaking movie for CGI
","Terminator 2 was a ground breaking movie as far as taking a gigantic jump forward in what you were capable of doing with CGI technology at the time. The entire T-1000 version of the Terminator would not have been able to take place without this new technology. The movie holds up so well even after being almost 20 years since it's release, the special effects don't like dated at all.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the Terminator franchise here only this time his character of the T-800 has been programmed to protect John Connor. Linda Hamilton is also back but she's no longer the scared and weak Sarah Connor but the hardened tough as nails version you see here in this movie. John Connor is added to the franchise here but with him being 12 years old he's still learning what it takes to be a leader, he's played by Edward Furlong in his debut film. Robert Patrick is the hunter in this movie as he plays the much more advanced Terminator the 1-100 who can shape shift and take on the appearance of other characters.",10,1,1,2 February 2012
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Wow
","Great film made by a great filmmaker in Francis Ford Coppola back in the prime of his career. A mesmerizing look at Vietnam and the rigors of it all. Coppola spent many months in Manila filming this Vietnam War masterpiece.Martin Sheen plays a Captain in the special operations sent on a mission to find Special Forces Colonel and then kill him. While on his way to finding the Colonel he stops at a USO show featuring Playboy Playmates amongst other things.The film has an absolutely amazing cast with Sheen, Marlon Brando, Albert Hall, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper and even a small appearance by R. Lee Ermey.",9,1,2,26 February 2012
The Patriot," The best Emmerich/Devin movie
","This movie is really rare for a movie that's a collaboration between Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, the movie has a lot of depth to it. It's not just your random mindless summer popcorn film.The story is about the Revolutionary War with Mel Gibson leading a regiment of militia into battle. Together he pieces together a group of local citizens and make them into a fighting squad trained in all kinds of guerrilla warfare.It's nice to see a Revolutionary War for a change when it seems like the Civil War and World War 2 gets way more movies for their stories. Let alone the fact for a Revolutionary War movie it's a nice change of pace to take place in the south when most movies for that war take place around Massachusetts or Pennsylvania.",8,1,6,31 January 2013
Spider-Man," Spidey!
","Sam Raimi was the absolute best choice to direct the Spider-Man movies since it takes a person who's a hardcore fan of the series to have the passion to properly do the franchise justice. The actors were perfectly cast in their respective roles with Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae & J.K. Simmons at J.J. Jameson. Even Randy Savage as Bonesaw McGraw and Bruce Campbell in his cameo as the ringside announcer was perfect.Very good choice to have the beginning of the movie be the entire first edition of the comic book.",10,0,1,31 January 2012
Bad Teacher," Totally shallow and vapid
",While the movie is far from boring it's basically nothing more then fluff. Very few of the characters are believable in their roles in the movie and most of the actors didn't have that much chemistry together. Hard to root for Cameron Diaz's character when she has no redeemable values whatsoever.Diaz's character makes no effort to teach the entire movie but suddenly she finds out that the teacher whose students score the highest on a state test gets a big bonus and she out of nowhere learns how to teach.It seems like the producers of this movie just liked the movie Bad Santa and decided to make the same movie just with a teacher in the place of Santa.This is most definitely a step in the wrong direction career wise for Cameron Diaz. She should fire her agent for signing onto this project.,4,3,7,29 January 2012
The Fast and the Furious," The beginning of it all
","This is the movie that created a brand new mega movie franchise. Generally when there's movie franchises they make movies in the form of trilogies. But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it. But somehow when these 2 guys get together in a movie about driving fast cars with hot girls it turns into a guilty pleasure.",8,7,8,18 January 2013
Goon," Great hockey movie
","Goon has to go up there with Youngblood, Slap Shot and Miracle as the best hockey movies ever made. The Mighty Duck movies were decent little family films but not really kick butt hockey movies like the afore mentioned movies. Best role that Seann William Scott has had in a long time. He plays a bouncer turned hockey goon named Doug Glatt who has to fight the great Ross Rhea at the end of the movie who's one of the legendary goons in hockey history.A true hockey fan will love this movie, heck even if you're just a fan of good fun movies then you'll love this movie. The movie pulls no punches(literally), you'll love this movie if you're a red blooded male.",9,0,0,29 March 2012
The Usual Suspects," Great mystery/suspense movie
","Such an underrated movie, I went into the movie expecting a good but not spectacular movie and I can tell you that the movie is a must see. Kevin Spacey totally rocks his character. Spacey plays Verbal Kint the only survivor of a heist gone wrong. He's being interrogated by Dave Kujan(played by Chazz Palminteri) and the story that Kint is telling so detailed you think that it must be correct. Why wouldn't you believe Kint he has immunity, why would he lie. But as it's too late you find out what he had been telling Kujan this whole time just might not be right. It's one of those movies you need to go back and watch more then 1 time to see what you missed the first time around.",9,0,0,12 February 2012
The Dirty Dozen," How can one movie contain so much awesomeness?
","The movie is basically a who's who of bad a$$es. You've got Lee Marvin as the leader of the team then Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Donald Sutherland, John Cassavetes, Ernest Borgnine and so on down the line. Basically the only thing the movie is missing is Chuck Norris and he didn't really even start doing movies regularly till the mid '70's so that's understandable.The movie is the ultimate men on a mission movie which is one of the movies that inspired Quentin Tarantino to make Inglourious Basterds. Marvin's Major Reisman assembles a team for what is essentially a suicide mission. The team is created from military prisoners who if they survive the mission will be granted a pardon.This is basically a real guys movie, if you don't like this movie they take away your man card.",9,0,3,18 January 2013
Batman Begins," Christopher Nolan saved the Batman franchise
","After Batman & Robin and to a lesser degree Batman Forever the Batman franchise in movies was looking it might become extinct. I think it's a foregone conclusion that the Joel Schumacher Batman movies were just downright terrible and Christopher Nolan took what was a declining franchise and pulled it from the ashes to make it profitable again. He got away with all the campy stuff that Schumacher was doing and made it much more like a graphic novel adaptation then a comic book.The series is far better off with Batman being a loner and stopping crime by himself then with lame characters like Robin or Batgirl.An all star cast rounds out the ensemble with Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanabe and Gary Oldman.",8,0,1,19 January 2012
Liar Liar," Carrey over the top performance but not too over the top
","This is Jim Carrey at his best in a over the top performance where he plays a very eccentric character but not so much that it's ridiculous like his characters in the Ace Ventura or The Mask movies. And at least his eccentric behavior is explained by him wanting to lie but not being able to do so for a 24 hour period of time.Carrey plays Fletcher Reed a lawyer who is a serial liar and is having a hard time handling the fact that for a 24 hour period of time he can't lie about anything because of a birthday wish his son made.The movie is probably right behind The Truman Show, Man in the Moon and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as the best work of his career.",8,1,1,9 March 2012
Bridesmaids," Not the movie that I was expecting
","The way that this movie was marketed and hyped up about I thought I was going to see the female version of The Hangover, which it's not even close to being. There's a few comedic points of the movie but for the most part it's a typical sappy love story. The movie wasn't bad mind you just not what I was hoping to get out of the movie going experience. They call the movie Bridesmaids but it ought as well have been titled The Bridesmaid since the whole movie is basically about Kristen Wiig's character Annie. The Helen character and the bride Lilly get a bit of time too but the other 2 bridesmaids are basically after thoughts. Like I said it wasn't a bad movie but at the same time I don't think it deserved the Best Picture nomination.",6,0,2,23 March 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Movie delivered
","The LOTR trilogy which came out in movie theaters 11 years ago is one of the best trilogies and most successful of them ever made. So to say that The Hobbit movies coming out has a little bit to live up to would be a very big understatement.I'm glad that Peter Jackson ended up being the director of the trilogy since his style of filmmaking is perfect for Middle Earth based stories. Guillermo del Toro would've done a fine job himself but PJ was basically born to make these movies. His style of being able to make movies with the action, fantasy, humor and story structure like this brings a certain style to this movie that other directors wouldn't have been able to pull off as well.And for the fans of LOTR who haven't read any of the books you get introduced to a bunch of new characters you haven't seen before but also get some returning characters from the LOTR trilogy like the characters played by Frodo, Bilbo, Smeagol, Elrond and Galadriel.",10,8,15,15 January 2013
Saving Private Ryan," How this didn't win Best Picture I have no idea
",Out of all the nominations for Best Picture in 1998 at the Academy Awards I'm still baffled how this one isn't the movie to take home the statue. Instead you have some lame Shakespeare in Love get that honor that no one in this century even remembers. You don't see SiL getting re-played on cable all the time like SPR does. You don't have a great half hour opening scene like in SPR with the Normandy scene which is one of the best scenes in motion picture history.Spielberg and Hanks with this and then followed up with the miniseries Band of Brothers and The Pacific basically reinvented what a depiction of war should look like on film.,10,2,3,21 January 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A proper modern day reboot of the Apes series
",I'm normally a big fan of Tim Burton's work but I really didn't care for his take on The Planet of the Apes. This was a far better way to start the series over with.A lot of great acting in this movie from James Franco and even Andy Serkis in his computer assisted performance as Caesar. Great storytelling all around by the writers and directors of this movie. And it had a nice twist scene at the end of the movie that made a lot of sense. When Tim Burton's movie ending with an Aperaham Lincoln monument made no sense at all to me.Can't wait to see what they do with a sequel since there's a ton of ways they can go with it and it all being fairly plausible.,10,1,2,27 January 2012
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Very majestic movie
","Excellent movie that mixes martial arts and fantasy. The movie is lead by Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. The sword fight between Yeoh and Zhang's characters is an amazing fight scene, definitely one of the best in a martial arts film involving only female actors. It was one of the first movies produced in Asia to be both a box office hit and a critical success at the same time. With the great visuals and cinematography it's one of the most beautiful movies on film IMO. The action doesn't lack in it's own regard either with the stunt team from The Matrix movies involved with this film. The movie was shot in Mandarin but even with having to read subtitles the movie is still very easy to follow.",10,1,1,31 January 2012
JFK," Oliver Stone's best work
","Oliver Stone has a cast of many great actors in this tale of educated speculation into what really happened to President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Stone's gripping drama unravels a lot of the mystery of what may have happened on that November afternoon. Pretty much shooting down the entire concept of the magic bullet theory. A lot of the speculation of why JFK was taken out was he intended on pulling out of Vietnam. The assassination of Kennedy will always go down as one of the horrific things to happen to the American people, only thing that goes beyond it would be 9/11. The movie shows just how corrupt the government was back then.",8,1,8,9 February 2012
Django Unchained," Tarantino pulls off another masterpiece
","Django Unchained which is Quentin Tarantino's attempt at a western or as he calls it, a Southern is quite an amazing venture into filmmaking. Such well developed and fully dimensional characters with great performances. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz are the main players in story and both deliver award nominate-able performances. Actually the whole cast is perfect for their roles to the point where you can't really see anyone else in those roles. Samuel L. Jackson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington all shine in their respective roles. The final shootout scene with Django and the remaining members of the Candie crew is really well done.",10,7,18,3 January 2013
Drive," Good art-house action flick
","Ryan Gosling stars in and delivers a great performance about a guy who's a Hollywood stunt driver who also moonlights as a wheelman. Gosling transforms himself over the course of the movie from a silent character to a stone cold killer.The filmmaking is top-notch throughout. There is an exquisite use of light, shadows, neon shadings, and arresting street level views of Los Angeles which make the visual appearance of the film quite spectacular. The use of the soundtrack is done very well and does a lot of interesting choices and not your usual macho balls to the wall style music you would expect from a movie like this.Albert Brooks, Carey Mulligan, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston and Christina Hendricks round out the very talented cast.",10,2,5,29 January 2012
Gran Torino," Clint still has it
","Even at this advanced age Clint Eastwood is still one of the top actors in movies, he can hang just fine with the current fleet of leading men just fine. On top of that he's one of the premier directors in Hollywood, churning out some of the most interesting and intelligent movies made.The story about a retired auto factory worker who's stuck in his ways. He's basically playing a much older version of Dirty Harry Callahan but living in Detroit(you get the idea). Not many other actors I can think of could've pulled off this role so effectively to be an actor of advanced age like Clint but still have the grit and tenacity that he's always had. Clint isn't going to let down to a bunch of neighborhood punk kids.",10,2,5,7 February 2012
The Hurt Locker," My favorite movie about the Iraq War
","The good thing about The Hurt Locker is it shows you a compelling story about the Iraq War without trying to get apolitical about it. It tells you the story without trying to tell you what to think about it.The shaky cam/documentary style of cinematography is used perfectly here without being distracting.The movie follows 3 members of Bravo Company's Explosive Ordanance Disposal (EOD) squad in the last several days of their tour in Iraq. Staff Sergeant William James is the adrenaline junkie and the thrill of diffusing a live bomb is what he lives for, Specialist Eldridge is overwhelmed with all the death around them and Sergeant Sanborn supports them the best he can.You have big name actors like David Morse, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fienees make brief but memorable appearances in the movie.When James is tasked with diffusing of the bombs they're some of the most intense nerve racking scenes as you'll see.",10,0,2,29 January 2012
Lincoln," DDL is a master craftsman and his craft is acting
","Just like any master woodworker who makes amazing sculptures out of wood or an ice sculpter out of ice and it being flawless, Daniel Day-Lewis does the same thing with his craft being acting. He doesn't just make you see DDL doing a good impersonation of Abraham Lincoln, he literally becomes the 16th President of the United States. You don't see any of the personality traits that DDL had in any of previous great performances such as Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood. The same man who awed you with his portrayal of Daniel Plainview will do the same thing here as Honest Abe.The supporting cast also has an A List cast of actors with such notables as Sally Field, David Strathairn, Tommy Lee Jones, Jackie Earl Haley, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and even Walton Goggins from Justified and The Shield fame.",10,3,10,1 December 2012
Donnie Brasco," Pacino a true chameleon
","Al Pacino is probably one of the best actors ever.  In movies like Donnie Brasco, Scarface, Godfather Trilogy, etc. he doesn't seem all that much the same.  In Scarface he is totally believable as a Cuban, just the same as an Italian-American in The Godfather movies, and a middle level gangster in Brasco.  In most of his movies he is the star but that doesn't change the fact that he is first and foremost a character actor instead of a movie star who just basically plays himself every single movie.  Plus movie stars are afraid of taking roles where they end up being a bad guy, scared of being disliked by the fans.",9,0,0,26 January 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino showing he can do more then just gangster films
",Prior to the Kill Bill movies being released Quentin Tarantino was known as a guy great at making modern gangster movies but this movie shows clearly him having a good grasp on other genres.In Kill Bill Tarantino is able to step into more genre type of movies and does it with a splash. Bringing together some of the best martial arts fight scenes outside of Hong Kong movies. A strong female lead who empowers women to be more then just a cute little thing on the arms of their men.Lucy Liu does a great job as one of the fellow assassins who eventually becomes the most powerful crime lord of the yakuza in Japan.Tarantino borrows a lot of stuff straight out of Bruce Lee movies to pay homage to him and other movies of that nature.,9,4,8,25 January 2013
Black Hawk Down," The Best non WW2 or Vietnam movie
","Black Hawk Down is a stellar war movie, the best movie not to involve the World War 2 or Vietnam movies. In 1993 123 elite U.S. Soldiers dropped into Somalia on what was supposed to be a routine mission, in and out in 20 minutes. After a few freak incidents like one of the soldiers falling out of a helicopter it ended up being an all day ordeal. The soldiers were made up mostly of the 75th Rangers and Delta Force, the best of the best.The cast is quite an outstanding group of actors with Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Zeljko Ivanek and many more.The movie is an exhilarating thrill ride of action.",10,1,3,19 February 2012
Rudy," Ultimate underdog story
","This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9' and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented.",10,0,0,5 February 2012
Major League," Best baseball movie
","I don't care what anyone says this is by far the best baseball movie ever made. Bull Durham was a bit too much of a chick flick to be a real baseball fans movie of choice.Major League isn't a movie that's going to solve world peace or anything but if you want a light hearted, entertaining film that is hysterically funny then you need to see this.Charlie Sheen being a former high school pitcher who was able to get 85 mph on his fastball, which isn't as fast as characters 100 mph. But close enough to with the way they film it to make it look believable as being a real flame thrower. If they had someone who didn't have a background in baseball they would've probably had to use a stunt double for his pitching scenes, which would've sucked.",10,11,15,3 February 2012
The Dark Knight," Going out in style
","The death of Heath Ledger was a terrible thing but if you were to go out at a young age as an actor at least he went out with a bang. He crafts a character with the Joker on a completely different plateau then any actor to ever play the role before. There's been tons of actors to play the Joker previously to him, most notably Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's 1989 version of Batman. But all of their performances were too comic book like and not a realistic portrayal of a character.Christian Bale brings another strong performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. The rest of the cast is quite stellar also. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes in her role and doesn't miss a beat.This movie probably went ahead of Memento as Christopher Nolan's best work so far in his career.",10,2,4,10 March 2012
Taken," Liam Neeson aka Bad A$$
",Liam Neeson plays the lead role in this movie as a former CIA operative who has to go back into action after his daughter gets abducted on a trip to Paris.In this movie Liam Neeson made himself into an action star with the best action movie since the Bourne series ended. There definitely needs to be some sequels made to continue on the Brian Mills character since they're just starting to stratch the surface of this character.From going from one bad guy to another to get that much closer to finding his daughter in an unflinching manner is what makes this movie great.,10,3,4,27 January 2012
Invictus," A powerful story
",This is the story of how South Africa came together. After the Apartheid and years in prison for roughly 20 years Nelson Mandela comes out then gets elected to President. But instead of trying to get payback against his enemies he puts the past in the past and tries to bring all the people of South Africa together as one. To do this he believes that having the Springbosk the nickname of the South Africa national rugby win the Rugby World Cup that was being hosted in their country that year.The rugby game scenes are truly well shot and put together scenes that really make you sit on the edge of your seat with anticipation of what'll happen next.,9,2,3,4 February 2012
Mission: Impossible," A very good and suspenseful movie starring Tom Cru...
",A very good and suspenseful movie starring Tom Cruise in one of his best roles.  You could be watching 40 minutes of the movie and think that you have only been watching about 10 minutes of the movie.  Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt the point man for an IMF team who gets ambushed on a mission and is only one of two remaining members of his team.  But is set up and accused of being a mole leaking information for money to someone known as Max.  He has to then clear his name with the other surviving team member and Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell character who has been disavowed by the CIA.,7,0,0,6 August 1998
Groundhog Day," Not just a comedy but a study of man nature
","The movie is a very funny movie but it also studies what would a person do if they had to keep on living the same day over and over again, the only catch is they're the only one that knows that this is going on and you remember everything that happens every day. No matter what you do or how you do it you're not accountable for your actions, since when you wake up after going to bed it's going to be a whole new day. Since everything is exactly the same in the surroundings around you can just rob a bank without anyone being the wiser or something along those lines.This is the type of comedy that's tailor made for Bill Murray where he can be a smart aleck but also being charismatic at the same time. In the movie Murray redeems himself and makes you get behind his rehabilitation into a better person who's no longer jaded by the world around him.",8,1,2,2 February 2013
Reservoir Dogs," A heist movie without the heist
",Reservoir Dogs is a movie about a crew of thieves and they're lead up and subsequent aftermath of them robbing a jewel store. But it only shows the before and after of the jewel heist. The details of the heist are explained in the aftermath and also by using your imagination of what happened. The movie begins with the crew going to a diner for breakfast before pulling off the job and a bunch of small talk ensues. Then cut to after the credits to where they're all showing up at the meet up place after the heist goes wrong and not everyone makes it back alive. Accusations towards each other about why things went wrong ensue with each other turning on each other.This was the first directorial performance by Quentin Tarantino of what would go onto to be many really interesting movies with his signature touch on them.,10,0,0,4 February 2012
Rocky," The ultimate underdog story
","The movie Rocky is about a club level boxer getting the opportunity of his lifetime to go against the world heavyweight champ Apollo Creed. Rocky works part time as a collector for a bookie. Rocky knowing that his chances aren't good against Creed hopes to just go the distance with him. That if he can survive the fight still standing that's an accomplishment in of itself. The relationship between Rocky and his trainer Mickey is something truly special.The movie is timeless classic that still holds true to this day.Sylvester Stallone when making the movie was just an actor who was having a hard time finding work. So he set out to write himself the role of a lifetime to really kick start his career. Selling the script to the studios was the easy part, the hard part was getting them to let him play the lead role. Stallone took a risk with getting less money for the script if it ensured he would get to star in the movie. Let's just say the gamble paid off for Stallone where he became one of the highest box office stars of all time.Rocky Balboa has his own statue in the city of Philadelphia just shows how iconic of a character that he is.",10,0,0,8 February 2012
Hoosiers," The perfect sports movie
","If you were going to make the absolute best possible movie a sports movie can be, this would be it. You have a great lead in Gene Hackman playing a high school basketball coach coming to a small town to turn around a bunch of sad sack losers into a championship team. Overcoming teams from much bigger schools with much bigger players on their rosters. The locations and the atmosphere of the movie was spot on, they had a very bar minimum gymnasium to play in. The emphasis they put on basketball in small town Indiana was perfect since it really is the most important thing to the towns people since a small town like that doesn't have any pro sports teams of their own so they have to latch onto their high school teams.",10,1,2,4 February 2012
Pulp Fiction," Most Innovative Film Ever
","Quentin Tarantino has proven to be the best director since Martin Scorsese came on the scene in the 1970's.  The movie stars some of today's biggest stars, e.g. John Travolta, Samuel L.

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Best as their is
","If you are a fan of Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, you have to go running to your local video store and get a copy of this great British movie.  Guy Ritchie is a director we will be hearing about a lot in the future.  It has some of the coolest characters in a movie in a long time.  All of them have cool names to Rory Breaker, Hatchet Harry the Pornking, Barry the Baptist, Nick the Greek, and others.  Plus a cool soundtrack that has Iggy Pop and others.",Null,0,0,21 January 2000
The Godfather: Part III," Sofia Coppola ruined what otherwise was a really good movie
","The Godfather Part III gets a bad rap it's actually a pretty good movie but people just focus on Sofia Coppola's terrible performance as Mary Corleone. While you still have great performances by Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Talia Shire, Eli Wallash and what not. Even with her bad performance if you actually pay attention to the movie it's a way better movie then your average gangster flick put out there. Andy Garcia puts on a great performance as the newest Don of the family. Vincent Mancini was a bastard child of Michael Corleone's older brother Sonny, so he didn't grow up with the Corleone name. But when he's ready to take over the head of the family when Michael's health starts to fail him he takes the last name Vincent Corleone.",7,0,2,23 January 2013
Die Hard," A perfect action movie
",This was truly a ground breaking movie and that's saying a lot since it's an action movie which are usually just mindless fun big explosions going off kind of cinema. Not that there is anything wrong with that mind you.But this is the first big action movie to where it wasn't about an army superman taking down the bad guys. It was about a regular everyday cop who while he also stops the bad guys does it in a fairly believable manner. No ridiculous stunts where you go 'yeah right'(that takes place in Live Free or Die Hard though).Bruce Willis plays the cop character John McClane which took him from being a TV actor to being a movie star. And not only does his character save the day but he does it while not even wearing shoes.,10,4,5,18 January 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Good special effects and action, bad comedy
","The Transformers themselves (other then twin ghetto ones) were perfectly fine but it was all the sophomoric humor that ruined the movie for me. What pot brownies have anything to do with a Transformers movie I will never know.The special effects and the action scenes were really well done. But the overall script for the movie was just terrible. The humor in the first movie was a bit much but still tolerable. In this movie the juvenile humor just went completely and totally overboard and if you found all that stupid humor to be funny then I seriously question your intelligence.The introduction of new Transformers in the movie is done with no back story at all, it's like here's a new character just accept him without knowing why I'm supposed to care about him.",5,1,6,7 February 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," A very well made movie
","Most of the action of the movie takes place at the end of the movie during the siege of Bin Laden's compound. Not counting the bombings of London and other places. But the story was able to keep great tension in the movie when it was about the CIA and it's efforts to hunt down UBL.Jessica Chastain does a great job in the lead role of this movie, probably will her career role IMO. Just as impressive but not given as much attention is the performance of Jason Clarke in what is the #2 lead of the film.Whether the movie is realistic which I believe it is as realistic as they feel to reveal. Nevertheless doesn't change the fact that the movie itself was highly well made and very captivating.",9,3,7,28 January 2013
Army of Darkness," Bruce Campbell in his prime
","Bruce Campbell is the absolute king of B Movies and in this movie he's in the absolute prime of his career. He's got such screen presence doing all the corny and off the wall jokes in what is the third movie of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy. The first movie was pretty much a straight up horror movie, then Evil Dead 2 while it still had a bit of true horror in it was very much a comedy film also, in Army of Darkness they go all out with the comedy. But the comedy is done tastefully and doesn't make the movie into a parody of the previous films like a lot of bad movies like Scary Movie do. Plus it doesn't hurt that they time travel back to medieval times instead of being a modern day cabin like the previous two movies were.Embeth Davidtz plays the female lead who is normally known for much more boring movies like The English Patient and what not shines in a much different role for her. Even Bridget Fonda has a cameo at the beginning of the movie.",10,16,18,27 January 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Best of the 3
",I like how the people in charge of this decided instead of just basically telling the same story of Lt. McClane in a building trying to stop the terrorists.  They open it up having him and Zeus(Samuel L. Jackson) go all over town figuring out his rhymes.  Plus the casting of Jackson and Jeremy Irons in their roles is absolutley ingenious.  They fit their roles to a T. Plus it is nice to see it not going on during Christmas for a change.,9,1,1,5 November 1998
American Gangster," Washington plays the bad guy so good
","With Denzel Washington's performance in American Gangster and also in Training Day and the upcoming Safe House his best performances are when he go the bad guy route. He's really good as the good guy like he's in Remember the Titans, Inside Man, Unstoppable and so on. But he really comes alive when he goes to the other side of the aisle.Russell Crowe is also very good in this movie as the detective who then also serves as the prosecutor is the one responsible for bringing down Washington's character of Frank Lucas who was one of the most powerful cocaine smugglers/king pins in US history. Frank took over the Harlem drug trade after legendary gangster Bumpy Johnson died.Josh Brolin plays a corrupt NYPD detective who tries to blackmail Lucas.",10,2,4,6 February 2012
The Green Mile," Fantasitc movie
","Frank Darabont and Tom Hanks bring one of the truly best movies of the late 1990's with this movie. Darabont is no stranger to adapting Stephen King books to movies with him previously doing The Shawshank Redemption and he does so again with this movie.This movie came out when Tom Hanks was in the prime of his career when he was cranking out great movie after great movie. Around this time he was doing other great movies like Apollo 13, Philadelphia, Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Cast Away. It was like you were guaranteed to get at least 1 and sometimes 2 great movies every year from Hanks.The late Michael Clarke Duncan gives the best performance of his career as the gentle giant John Coffey.I would list the rest of the great cast in this movie but it would be a ridiculously long list of great actors.",10,1,2,26 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the prequels
","After a really bad Phantom Menace and a slightly above average Attack of the Clones, George Lucas finally got it right with Episode III as far as the prequels go. The first time movies were basically setup and here was the payoff. You finally got to see the epic matchup between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. You finally got to see Chancellor Palpatine become the Emperor. They were able to tie up the loose ends of how Padme died and how Luke and Leia were split up.A few of the flaws of the movie though can be placed at George Lucas' less then great skill at writing dialogue. It definitely wouldn't have hurt him to bring in someone to clean up some of the bad dialogue in the Anakin and Padme scenes.",8,3,5,9 March 2012

","Defiance the movie starring Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell as 3 Jewish brothers in Belarus during World War 2 who start a rebellion against the Germans who come and invade their country. In the forest they build a base of operations with other jews trying to escape their nazi contingent who's occupying their country. The Germans who invade their country can easily be described as German Death Saquads.Their is a few slight inaccuracies to the true story but nothing that really changes the essence of the story or the people involved in it. It's an important story to be told about World War II and I highly suggest you check it out.",6,2,4,11 March 2012
Platoon," One of the two best Vietnam movies
","Platoon in my opinion is tied with Apocalypse Now as being the best Vietnam War movie of all time, with Born on the Fourth of July right behind them. And Casualties of War being extraordinarily behind all 3 of those.This was Oliver Stone in the prime of his career when he was cranking out this movie, Born on the Fourth of July, Wall Street, The Doors and JFK. Actually Stone makes a very good choice in using The Doors as the music for the movie.The movie has a fantastic cast with Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon and Keith David.",10,3,4,9 March 2012
Halloween," The best version of Halloween still
","I don't care for the new Halloween made by Rob Zombie that much, this movie is still a much better movie and the remake was completely unnecessary. Why do you want to know what Michael Myers motivations of why he's an insane serial killer? The fact that he's a mindless murdering machine without explanation adds a lot of mysticism to the character. I don't care about his childhood.The original Halloween the tension with the music score just made some honest to god moments where you're on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. You don't really get that in the remake as much.Jamie Lee Curtis will always be the one and only Laurie Strode IMO. Anyone else playing the role would be almost like someone other then Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lector or someone other then Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden.",10,0,1,2 March 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter = amazing
","Anthony Hopkins gives one of the absolute best movie performance ever as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, like he was born to play the role. Even though Brian Cox played the role earlier in Manhunter a prequel to Silence of the Lambs(which Hopkins later re-did in Red Dragon), but Hopkins just makes you think no else should've ever attempted to play this role other then me. Since no one else is ever going to do as good at the role so even trying to do so is a futile effort.Jodie Foster starred as young FBI agent Clarice Starling who goes to the facility that Lecter is being held to interview him to get help find another serial killer, Buffalo Bill.Silence of the Lambs is one of the few movies to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director(Jonathan Demme), Best Actor(Hopkins) and Best Actress(Foster).One of the best suspense movies ever made.",10,1,1,3 March 2012
X-Men: First Class," Got the X-Men franchise back on track
","After less then spectacular installments in the X-Men series with X-Men 3 and the Wolverine Origin story the First Class did a great job of showing you how the team started out from scratch. The movie is anchored by 2 great leads with Michael Fassbender as Mangeto and James McAvoy as Professor Xavier. In the other movies you see Xavier and Magneto on the other side but this is still when the both of them are still working together and shows you what lead them to picking opposite sides of the battle. The movie has a good supporting cast also with Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne, January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, Oliver Platt and others. Definitely recommend this movie for any comic book movie fans or just anyone who wants to see a good movie.",9,0,1,25 March 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Best comic movie trilogy ever
","The Dark Knight Rises capped off what is probably the best comic book related trilogy of movies of all time. Earlier in the series you had Batman Begins and The Dark Knight with this just being the perfect way to finish off the series.Since the last movie it's been 7 years and Batman has been in seclusion since then. Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. A new villain has emerged that being the menacing Bane played by the great Tom Hardy.The supporting cast has returning members like Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine in addition to new members like Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Anne Hathaway.The movie has a running time of about 2 hours and 45 minutes but it doesn't seem like it at all, the movie flows like a 2 hour movie.",10,41,53,19 January 2013
Iron Man," RDjr = Iron Man
","Iron Man from the outside looking in before the movie was made seemed like it would be one of the harder comic book movies to adapt to the screen. But Jon Favreau pulled it off without a hitch and actually delivered one of the best comic book movies made so far.Robert Downey, Jr. was perfectly cast as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He blends the swagger required to play the character and just the overall intensity of the character.They blend the back story of how Stark developed the Iron Man suit into the movie without bogging down the rest of the movie to accomplish that goal but also giving it plenty of time to develop in an organic way and not seem rushed.The roles of Terence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges are all great in their capacity given in the movie.",9,0,2,28 January 2012
X2: X-Men United," The best of the X-Men movies
","Not counting X-Men: First Class since that's a different lineage if you just count X-Men, X2: X-Men United, X-Men: The Last Stand and the Wolverine movie this is the best of that bunch. The first movie a big part of the story was just establishing all of the characters so this movie has the advantage over that in everything is already in a groove without having to spend a good chunk of the movie just explaining everyones character background. Last Stand had so many flaws there's not enough time to explain them.The movie having good additions to the cast with Brian Cox as William Stryker, Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike and Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler were both positive additions.",10,4,7,31 January 2012
Flight," Much Better then I expected
","I was expecting another Denzel Washington paint by the numbers starring vehicle like he had with Man on Fire, Fallen, Ricochet and a number of other films. But this movie almost reaches the same heights of his career as some of his best movies like American Gangster, Training Day, Malcolm X, Glory and so on. He always does his best performances when he plays flawed people and not just perfect do the right thing good guys.It didn't hurt that the actress who played Catalina in My Name is Earl prances around naked to start off the movie.Movie just had a very good overall cast with Kelly Reilly, John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Don Cheadle and Melissa Leo in support.",9,1,2,28 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have a great dynamic
","It's easy to say that LOTR: The Return of the King has the most interaction of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee of all the LOTR movies. A result of that is you get to really see the great chemistry exhibited by these two actors working together.This is the best of all the LOTR movies in my opinion, the way all the stories tie together just works to perfection. Finally you can see Aragorn taking his rightful place as the new king. When Frodo finally gets to Mordor and throws the ring into the pits of it is an extremely well done scene.This is probably the longest single movie not counting the Godfather movies I've ever seen but it entertains from start to finish.",10,0,1,31 January 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Slow build with big payoff
","The good thing about A Nightmare on Elm Street(the original) is that it doesn't shoot it's load by trying to do to much too early in the movie. The story builds at a steady rate with a few big moments early on but nothing where it shoots its load without leaving much to do at the end of the movie.Freddy Krueger is in the movie just a little bit, just enough to where it keeps the character interesting and make every one of his appearances that much more meaningful. Robert Englund IS the best actor to play Krueger and the idea that they decided to replace him in the sequel was a terrible terrible decision on the producers part.Some of the acting could've been better but really what did you expect from this, Sir Laurence Olivier?",7,1,1,2 February 2012
Casino," Gangsters in Vegas
","This is a kick ass movie, Robert DeNiro is great as a casino manager and Joe Pesci is exceptional as a maniac gangster.  It is a good change of pace from normal gangster movies with them all taking place in New York City running all there little scams.  Not that I have anything against GoodFellas or Donnie Brasco(actually I love them), but it is nice to see a new twist to the genre.  The scene with the cow prod is absolutely ingenious.",9,2,2,18 September 1998
Heat," DeNiro and Pacino are some of the best actors ever
","Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino once again prove why they two of the best actors to come along in a while. In each and every one of their movies you don't see them playing characters you actually think that are the characters. DeNiro in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, Godfather Part II, GoodFellas, and Heat doesn't even seem like the same guy in any of them, the same goes for Pacino in Heat, Scarface, The Godfather trilogy, Donnie Brasco, Dog Day Afternoon, and Serpico.  Forget all those big blockbuster stars these are the real stars.",9,0,0,15 November 1998
50_50," Not what the advertisements made it out to be, but so much more
","I went into 50/50 thinking it would be just a movie poking fun at cancer with him trying to use his cancer prognosis to pick up chicks but that's more or less just his friend trying to force him into that and not Joseph Gordon Levitt's character really into it at all. The story is about a young man in his 20's who gets unexpected news from his doctor that he has cancer. All the while he has a girlfriend who if it wasn't for the cancer news probably wouldn't have stayed with him so she's not really there for him and is a very selfish individual. He has to rely on his best friend played by Seth Rogen, his fellow patients getting their chemotherapy treatments and a young psychiatrist in training who he goes to deal with the issues of his situation.With this movie and other stuff like (500) Days of Summer and being one of the hottest in demand actors right now JGL is definitely turning out to be one of the best actors of his generation.",10,1,1,29 March 2012
The Replacements," Really good sports movie
","As far as football comedy movies go this is fairly high up on my list. It's most definitely a comedy but still had real moments for the characters with real issues to overcome. Not an exact match but I kind of view this as the football version of Major League. You can tell the characters have real chemistry together and could be actual teammates with how well they interact with each other. Really enjoyed hearing John Madden and Pat Summerall doing the commentary of the games, my favorite football announce team ever by the way.The story itself is your usual loser overcomes the odds sports movies but even with that I didn't care because of how funny the story was.",8,1,3,3 February 2012
Apollo 13," Tremendous film
","Ron Howard creates a great movie about the most successful failure that NASA has ever had. It's a failure in that they didn't accomplish their original objective. But the mission was a success in that it returned all the astronauts and the shuttle in one piece. If they had died in outer space with the shuttle just floating out there in space it probably would've killed the space program for at least the next 10 years.The filmmaking here was done expertly by Howard and his team. With the success of this movie then Howard, Tom Hanks and Brian Grazer all were able to make the great mini series From the Earth to the Moon which showed you the beginning of NASA to the end of the Apollo series of flights.The movie lists a who's who as far as its cast goes with Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon and many, many more.",10,0,0,1 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the original trilogy
","Out of the original Star Wars movies(Episodes IV,V,VI) this is by far the best of them. George Lucas had more of a hands off approach with this movie then he did with A New Hope. The movie has a much darker tone to it then ANH or Return of the Jedi were.This movie is the first movie to see the introduction of 2 significant characters in the Star Wars pantheon with Yoda and Emperor Palpatine.The movie has multiple different locations with the Hoth system(ice planet), Dagobah(tropical planet), asteroid and cloud city.The movie ends with a few gigantic cliffhangers like Darth Vader telling Luke that he's his father and Han Solo being frozen in carbonite.",10,0,0,2 February 2012
Sin City," Neo Noir masterpiece
","Robert Rodriguez adapts graphic novel series. The movie definitely has a Gothic noir feel to it. The movie is shot in black & white but selectively colors certain things in, sort of like how Schindler's List used colors. The movies conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter.Very interesting cast of actors with all of the actors being spot on in their roles especially Mickey Rourke as Marv and Bruce Willis as Hartigan. The performances of the actors are some of the best of their careers as you can tell they're just having a blast playing their roles. I definitely recommend this movie for everyone.",9,1,2,5 February 2012
Braveheart," One of the best epic movies of all time
","Braveheart is one of the best epic war movies ever put on film. The battle scenes in this movie are truly well made from a choreography and cinematography perspective.Mel Gibson who not only is the main star of the movie but also runs the whole show with being the director and one of the producers. William Wallace is probably the best role of his career. I like him in the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon movies also but this is where he truly shines as an actor.The movie also has a great supporting cast with Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, Catherine McCormack, Brendan Gleeson, Angus Macfadyen and Brian Cox.",10,1,4,23 February 2012
Back to the Future," Endless playback ability
","Back to the Future is just one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen every time you flip by it when channel surfing you always stop on that channel and watch it again. I've probably seen this movie a 100 times since I was a kid but if I stop on HBO and its playing I just can't help but at least watch a few minutes of it before returning to my channel surfing.Michael J. Fox was the absolute best actor to choose to star in this movie, he has great screen presence that whenever he's on TV he grabs your attention. It's such a shame the health problems he has had that such great skills are going to waste.The movie has so many great lines that I still quote to this day.",10,2,2,8 March 2012
Goodfellas," Fantastic gangster movie
","Goodfellas is a movie directed by Martin Scorsese based on a true story about Henry Hill who's a former gangster turned informant. The movie stars Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino.Hilarious interaction between all of the characters especially with Joe Pesci's character with the whole 'am I some kind of a comedian, here to entertain you' scene. The movie covers a crew of mobsters who pulled off some of the biggest heists in history ripping off the Idelewild airport among other things.The movie begins in 1955 when Henry was just a kid and originally started to make connections with the crime family run by Paul Sorvino's character and ended in 1980 when Hill was busted with Cocaine.",10,1,4,2 February 2012
Cinderella Man," Cinderella movie
","Cinderella movie is a movie about a boxer who was a top contender early in his career but then faced a serious downturn in his career. At first he was just fighting on small events in front of very little people but then he also broke his hand. The promoters decided to stop using him on their boxing cards so he had to start working as a longshoreman on the docks. The lowest blow to him was when he had to accept government assistant to keep the electricity on. Then when the promoters needed a guy on short notice to fight one of their top contenders when his opponent fell out they call Braddock figuring it would just be an easy win for that contender but next thing you know Braddock pulls off the upset. Then they keep giving him more fights and he eventually earns a title shot against the unbeatable champ of the day Max Baer who was a 10-1 favorite when they fought.This is a very uplifting movie about a man desperate to keep his family together and willing to do anything to accomplish this goal.Braddock when he did get more money in the bank decided to return his government assistance money, which is unheard of IMO.Ron Howard directed a classic movie with great performances by Russell Crowe, Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellweger.",9,0,0,7 February 2012
Valkyrie," Movie about Germans trying to kill Hitler
","Valkyrie is a very interesting story it tells the truth about a group of German military officers and politicians conspiring to kill the evil Adolf Hitler.The story is based on true events and they're able to keep it accurate to what really happened but also keep the screenplay interesting and flowing forward. Even though you know going into the movie that Valkyrie was never successful, it doesn't change the fact that the story was still very suspenseful and compelling.The film has quite a good cast with Tom Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson, you can't ask for a much better cast then that.",7,0,1,9 March 2012
The Godfather," The Godfather is so good that real life gangsters patterned themselves after the movie
","It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film.  Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen.",10,2,7,5 August 1998
