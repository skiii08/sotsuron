The Expendables 2," Expendable 2 is expendable.
","It goes without saying that Sly is one of the best action stars in the world. Having seen the trailer for expendables 2, I thought that I was gonna watch a real action movie.Nevertheless, it was a total disappointment. Considering the amazing cast, it didn't meet my expectations. What is the point of having Jet li in the movie, if there is not going to be a scene in which he can perform his martial art skills for which he is famous. The plot was so poor and not developed well.In addition to that, all the action scenes were at the beginning of the movie, there was almost no action till final sly- van damme fight scene.Although the cast was great, the plot didn't provide any chances for those great actors to show themselves. Most of the guys were just quest- stars.",5,1,4,9 March 2013
