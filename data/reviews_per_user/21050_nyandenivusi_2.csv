Hereditary," Class!
",Only reason it's 7.2 in here and almost a 10 with respected critics' sites is because the ending bummed people out. I get that. But make no mistake this movie is a 10 all the way from a neutral person's perspective who did his best not to get attached to the characters (near impossible given the class act that all of them are - OMG best example of perfect horror writing/production meets near perfect Oscar worthy actors). But hey don't take my word for it go watch it!!,10,0,1,16 June 2020
Burn After Reading," Cohen Bros' big f@ck you to cinema goers!
",This move is infuriating because the characters never find out the actual 'truth'! Still pretty good though lol,8,0,0,3 July 2020
