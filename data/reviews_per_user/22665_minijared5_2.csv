The Avengers," Not as good/bad as they say
","Let me start by saying that I did in fact enjoy this movie. However, 8.whatever is FARRRRRRRRRR from accurate. You're meaning to tell me this ranks up there with films like The Godfather and Shawshank Redemption? Come on now.There were some really good parts. There were some almost unbelievably bad parts.(First 10-20 min. was like watching another flick entirely) Acting was up and down, but overall it wasn't bad by any means. dialogue was spotty, but had some good lines and few laughs. LOADS of CGI but the action was intense AF. So at the end of the day, it's entertaining. I couldn't watch it 5-6 times, but none the less entertaining.Now for those who can't seem to understand how ratings work. Was it the best movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 10/10. Was it the worst movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 1/10. Simple. And for those expecting some original, new, fresh plot and amazingly moving dialogue. Seriously? Go somewhere else with that sh*t. What could they have possibly done that's creative with superheros? Especially ones that have been around for 60+ years.Sorry, ranting a bit. Conclusion: If you like superhero movies, you will likely enjoy this.",6,4,12,15 May 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Stuff and things
","I'm quite late to reviewing this. Clearly. Simply wanted to say a few things..... Firstly, anyone who would go to see the sequel of a movie that they didn't like, must be beyond idiotic. Also, comparing any incredibly influential director(i.e. Hitchcock, Welles, Kubrick etc.) to modern day directors is just plain ridiculous. I'm sick of hearing it. Really. To me, that's like comparing Alexander Graham Bell to Steve Jobs. In a way they are similar, but in many more ways they are not. Same thing goes for a classic cult film and a brand spankin' new cinematic blockbuster. Two different beasts. If you have expectations that an action movie would be nothing less than a masterpiece, especially one with fictional robots, then I would be overjoyed to know that you are disappointed. Just don't ruin it for most everyone else by giving low reviews, and justifying those reviews with nonsense. You don't go to McDonald's awaiting nutritious, healthy eats only to be surprised when they hand you a greasy cheeseburger and fries. Seriously people, just use your heads and form your own opinions. Don't like it, make your own film. peaceeeeeeeee",7,0,4,20 May 2011
