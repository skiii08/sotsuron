The Ring," Scariest Movie of this year
","The Ring is not the best picture of 2002.  It is, however, the most terrifying thing I have experienced in a movie theater, ever.  It's a good date movie if you like scaring the heck out of your date.  It's also a pretty good movie.I have a hard time giving this film better than 7 out of 10, but it's the case.  However, many more films that receive such a rating deserve less. This film is 70% satisfying as a film.  As a scary movie, it's a whopping 100% satisfaction rating.  So, that's good.Naomi Watts is too pretty for this movie.  So is her ex-boyfriend.  And her son's role is embarassingly similar to the kid in the Sixth Sense.  All those problems are still not enough to not be completely terrified by the premise of this film.  Watch the videotape and in seven days you DIE!Cheesy, sure, but scary anyway.  And all scary movies have an inherent cheesiness, no matter how classy they feign to be.  So this is the best kind of cheese.  This film is really scary.  By the way, did I say it was scary? And WHAT AN ENDING!!!",Null,0,0,30 November 2002
Memento," A Cinematic Miracle
","As soon as you leave the theatre, you'll begin to insist on knowing how on Earth a human being concocted such an enormously complex web of a story, translated it perfectly to film, and then had the gall to completely mess with the whole way time works.Memento is a lot like other 'Never Saw It Coming' twist-ending movies in that you will most definitely enjoy multiple viewings.  The odd part is that the twist should be a total give-away the whole time.  You'll feel fooled by the shock at the end and demand to know everything that you had just seen all over again.This is exactly why this premise works.  Instead of telling the story sequentially, Memento takes you through the bassackwards world of Lenny, learning for the first time things that have happened already.  It leads to some great moments, like when he is being chased/chasing Dodd.  Don't know what I mean?  Go see the movie!The ending is the story though, so it isn't like a gimmick, it is entirely essential.  The trick ending to the Sixth Sense could have not been and most of the entire plot would remain the same.  In Memento, the twist ending is the entire point of the movie, and all of the characters actually interact with this inevitability.So out of four stars I give it ****.  A perfect film.",10,0,1,7 May 2001
Shaun of the Dead," This is how to make a great film.
","Like a veritable color wheel of human emotions, Shaun of the Dead is a comedy that covers all the ground and then some. I was simply stunned how moved I was by a movie that made me laugh this hard. This is no over-hyped special edition DVD movie the guy at Blockbuster says changed film. This film shoots neither over your head nor under it. That isn't to say it's low-brow, it is sublimely clever. But it isn't smug and content with itself as a film, and yet it doesn't desperately attempt to entertain. It comes across not like watching Jim Carrey, who always tries to be everything to his audience, but instead is like Bill Cosby. Cosby could hold hundreds in an auditorium captive with laughter for hours, and you might find yourself in a similar state after watching Shaun.Am I over-hyping this film? What I've said above is like somebody saying 'Mozart was just a musician'. The absolute greatness of this film cannot be overstated. Is it gory? Hell yes. Is it bleak? At times. Is it British-style humor? Yes, and with a 'U' if you really want to be accurate! This movie is everything it wants to be and more. You may find yourself crying at this film, you may find yourself laughing uncontrollably. You may be frightened to your core. It is really, really, really good. Best ever? No. But guaranteed not to disappoint.**********(10/10 stars!!!)",10,3,7,7 October 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Landmark Classic...but it could have been so much more
","There are so many moments in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN where you wonder, doesn't anybody just cry it out once in a while? Having recently gone through a heart-wrenching long distance relationship, I know the anguish these men wore on their faces. It's no chore, probably even for utter homophobes, to get over the gay thing. The film deftly handles how they consummate their love, making it seem raw and tender and genuine, not flirty and flamboyant as gay men are so often portrayed in pop-culture. In fact, it doesn't really feel like a 'gay' film, it's just a plain old love story which is gut-wrenchingly sad. That said, I couldn't help but wonder if this could have been one for the ages. They're calling it the gay Gone With the Wind, but it's more emotionally spare than that. Heath Ledger is a force on screen. In a moment at the beginning, he has the look of a lost 5 year old boy. He's laconic not to be cool or tough, but because deep inside he trembles at the entire world. It's a simple look, probably unplanned, but he shows just a little the inner turmoil that he cannot let loose. He's not just a closeted homosexual, he's closeted about everything.This film might run away with the Best Picture Oscar and years from now people will remember a defining moment (perhaps) in the gay rights movement. This could be, in a way, the gay 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' Perhaps not a flawless masterpiece, but a humanizing look into the taboos of our times. Just like all classic screen lovers, you yearn for them to make it out together and happy, but the prejudices of others always seem to end that, don't they. Overall, an excellent film, certainly nothing too salacious for even your most staunch Republican conservative male. Surprising as it may sound to say it, this film was just a bit too chaste, but I suppose that's more an issue with our times.",9,9,11,10 January 2006
The Aviator," A Truly Underrated Oscar Nominee
","While most critics and Academy voters saw it fitting that The Aviator should receive a Best Pic and Best Director nod, it seems most of America's film-going public felt another way about it. 'Overblown' 'too long' and 'not perfect' were words I have heard used to describe it. In the Scorcese vs Eastwood debate, many claimed they'd rather see Marty win for a better film. But this is, without a doubt, one of Scorcese's finest. Though perhaps too similar in scale to the similarly dismissed 'Gangs of New York', this is one swift, cunning piece of directing on the part of Mr. Scorcese.Depicting those years where Howard Hughes teetered on the edge of sanity while achieving so much in so little time, the film's most touching moments are the quietest, when the camera and the actor and director all seem to try and calm down a minute, take a breath, regain control.Shot and edited like the way Hughes lived, it has a frenetic, implacable chemistry, jumping from extreme excitement to terrifying emotional scares. A credit to Leo DiCaprio as an actor, the sequence at the Coconut Grove bathroom is one of the film's finest, and sloppiest in a way. And that's the way the whole film plays. It almost feels improvised. It has the storytelling of a nine-year-old boy out of breath from a great adventure. And you can't help but connect it's hair-brained energy and logical flow to its anchor, Howard Hughes. And while I won't stay up too long lamenting Scorcese's fifth loss at the Oscars, I will note that he went down with another of his best films. Hopefully, someday very soon, he'll find the connection to his art that Clint Eastwood has found at age 74, and see there's so many more of his own stories to tell. But still, the Aviator is one of those too, and please look into it more closely before you blow it off.",9,1,1,27 February 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Sweetness Rules
","Disappointed by 'Wedding Crashers' lack of true comedy and lame attempt at a love story, I awaited '40 Year Old Virgin' with the same hopeful anxiety I attach to the Chicago Cubs, hoping for greatness but anticipating tragic levels of failure. I am pleased to report that this film is more like the Boston Red Sox, every time you think you've seen it all, it's finished, there's no hope left for sex-comedies, it will forever be an endless parade of fart jokes and catchphrases, out pops this gem. Don't get me wrong, this movie is crass, it is rude, it assails your sensibilities and outrages uptight Christians. But it bears a closer resemblance to 'There's Something About Mary' and not as much to 'American Pie', it's teenage counterpart. See, this film is produced, written, directed and acted by genuinely funny and intelligent people, and what results is a genuinely funny and intelligent film. It's imperfect, sure, but it aspires to achieve that which it achieves, and that's a lot.I can't think of a film that makes the non-virgins look sort of uncool too, unlike the equally virginity obsessed 'American Pie'. But this film is a film about four men growing to true sexual and emotional maturity, albeit through some particularly hilarious means. Steve Carell plays the affable Andy, a closet virgin who has tried over the years but just ended up blowing it (pardon the pun). He works at a low-wage electronics store job and is surrounded by other stunted youths. Their obsession with sex is his obsession with action figures; it's pleasurable and it's fun, but they don't realize that they don't get it. One of Andy's coworkers is a pensive dude who at first seems like the sanest one but soon comes off as the most confused. Then you have his black friend who is convinced he has to be a playa to not be a playa hater.And Paul Rudd portrays a sympathetic loner who obsesses over a girl he never earned and wishes he was still dating. Compared to these three, who gode Andy into sexual maturity, Andy seems relatively stable. But it takes some real shaking up for the four friends to realize that real sexuality is about more than 'getting lucky' with hot chicks. And then there's all those parts that are just hilarious. And that's the thing about this movie, it makes its point without sounding like a Republican senator or Pat Robertson. It's a bunch of hip dudes realizing that sexsexsexsexsex isn't all it's cracked up to be, and maybe we should all slow down and wait it out, be careful, see what happens. Andy learns the value of relationships and then is free to explore sex with a clean conscience, something we all would love no doubt, in hindsight after all.",10,3,6,30 August 2005
Batman Begins," Most Satisfying Film of 2005
","By far, BATMAN BEGINS is the movie to beat this year. I have not seen a better movie, and I couldn't have been more pleased to see it in its full opening night glory. The crowd cheered. This is what making movies is about. The film is about two wonderful things; real, human emotion and bodies in motion (these are THE primary elements of cinema). Some critics have criticized the film's lack of jokey entertainment (The film is joyously free of Schwarzenegger pointing skyward yelling 'Get the heroes!'). To critics who would have preferred a smart-allecky, warmer Batman story, I submit the entire lore of Batman as evidence that real Batman fans like their hero dark and disturbed. It's the age old debate; Superman is too invincible, he has no human interest; Batman is too emotionally distant, too far off base to identify. (Spider-Man is everyman who accidentally overtakes heroism and he's fine the way he is.) But Batman is the original hero to all the comic book boys (and lately girls too) who once fantasized about becoming Superman or Spiderman and realized that they would never fly, never spray web from their wrists. This is their movie, a chilling legend of intense self-searching and more than its fair share of legitimate thrills. Which leads me to the villains, of which there are many.The film opens with young Bruce Wayne falling down a well and being traumatized by a swarm of bats escaping upward. Later his idyllic father rappels down for him and continues teaching him simpleton wisdoms (the film, it seems, goes on to criticize even the most generous philanthropists, suggesting true heroism is more a matter of perspective, that good is more about common decency than spreading your own privilege.) Bruce is then found years later at what seems to be a North Korean prison where he is letter released after pledging to join a secret society of justice enforcers called the League of Shadows (I think). I won't go on into too much more detail, but the film takes it deliberate time showing exactly why anybody would think fighting crime with a huge cape and a bat costume is the most effective method possible (in the film, it seems downright logical).The secret will soon spread about the surprise character at the end, but I'd like to congratulate Christopher Nolan's specific interpretation of Scarecrow, one of the less popular Batman villains (who always seemed like a weirder version of the Joker). The sequences devoted to Scarecrow's fear-serum are legitimately frightening and yet contain excellent plot development. And that's the real trick of the film, with the exception of perhaps a few fleeting shots, this film moves, and that's no small task at 2 hours and 20 minutes. It clips along with the pace of a runaway train, quickly delivering its ultimate conflict in the best way possible. The cast is excellent and the action spot on. This is the first contender to take the place of Tim Burton's original from 1989. Fans for decades will debate both film's merits, and rightly so. Here lies the proof that in the hands of a truly avant-garde director, Batman can be both a viable market entity and a film that will outlast its marketing drive in the years to follow. Hopefully, Chris Nolan will return for a second and third, and complete a saga of a film series that started strong and lost its way when it changed captains. Here's hoping no returns to the campy, over-the-top-ness of the 90's Batman films. Bring on the darkness.",9,1,2,15 June 2005
Moulin Rouge!," Sloppy Masterpiece from the king of slopp masterpieces
","Sloppy?  Sure.  Over-edited?  Maybe.  Bad movie?  No way.First off, this film might have reestablished the movie musical as a bankable genre.  So kudos for that.  Why do I love this movie?  Because it nearly brought me to tears at the end.  There we see a director not afraid to allow a character cry.  In a lot of films, when somebody dies, there is a little reaction from the loved ones, and typically a montage of moments when the main character is saying goodbye.  You know, leaning on the railing of a bridge with that sad 'missing you' type face.Ewan just cries his eyes out.  And,I almost did too.Ok, enough about giving away the ending (which is told to you at the beginning anyway).  This film starts off on a weird foot, making it seem like art-house fare.  I thought, about ten minutes into it, that I was seeing the next Rocky Horror Picture Show.  When Ewan belts out Elton John's Your Song, the film proves it is gonna be around for a very long time in a very mass-appeal sort of way.Who could resist that song?  It is so good!  Then, we are immediately enchanted with the comic misunderstandings of the evil Duke, the penniless writer Ewan, and Nicole as the gorgeous courtesan.  This movies is really cool.  Nuff said, buy your own copy.  You won't regret it.",Null,1,2,4 March 2002
Pi," Stumbles on it's newborn feet
","Watching Pi, I was instantly reminded of every earnest, horror/sci-fi film I'd seen in film school.  That's meant as a criticism, and I found myself wondering how Pi was received by a 'mass' audience rather than as excellent student-film for Aranofsky's reel.Let's start with acting, since the most immediate part of any film about people is the people in the film.  The only character with dimension, intrigue, and screen charisma (not interpersonal charisma, but watch-a-bility) was the character performed by Ben Schenkman.  He was also one of the most minor characters.I was always aware of why somebody was cast or a character written in.  I feel, a lot of times, that a student film is trying to be longer than it deserves to be.  That there are moments where no narrative progression occurs, no exposition, just stuff to look at.  Remember the scene on Coney Island when Max needlessly washes his face in the ocean water, it's in slow-motion.  Why?  I feel because the director or the cinematographer really wanted to do some slow-motion work, to see if it would work.  This shows a lack of pre-production on their part.I also recall the pointless love-interest character, the Indian neighbor, and how every motivation on her face seemed to be suggestive of imprecise direction, not a genuine character trait.Pi is not a film without its merit, but I fealt it was overhyped.  I can never hold a director accountable for the success of his film despite itself, and I honestly believe Aranofsky is a talented film maker, but Pi is not a great film.  It is an eloquent film at times, but mostly, it is a clumsy student exercise.",Null,1,2,1 December 2003
Million Dollar Baby," One of the Best Best Pictures
","In recent memory, no Best Picture has deserved its honor more than Million Dollar Baby. Not Gladiator, not Chicago, not A Beautiful Mind, not even The Return of the King. All of those films were notable for certain wonderful aspects, but in some way or another, they just don't reach the zenith of cinema that is Million Dollar Baby. I'll confess, I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as a director. That alone, however, isn't enough for me when critiquing his films. I liked Mystic River, but its third act was (to put it very kindly) weak. Unforgiven is a masterpiece of a western, but no Clint Eastwood effort that I've yet seen tears open its heart so honestly and nakedly as this film. This film is all about the essence of life and living, and the debate raged by Michael Medved and other political hacks cannot detract from its impact on any viewer. Beating Saving Private Ryan, it's the closest a film has come to making me cry in a theater. I almost did, and it's my own fault for not letting in enough, but that's beside the point. The point here? Million Dollar Baby is an excellent film, rich with character, plot, and unspeakable heartache. You have to see it immediately, and try to hold back (like I did) when Eastwood visits his priest the last time. I won't give away any more than that.",10,3,6,9 March 2005
The Godfather: Part III," A lot like Fredo...unfortunately
","I have watched all three Godfather films in a row, and this final installment leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  It's almost amazing how it fails to emulate and of the strengths of the first two films.  The biggest strength of the first two films has always, in my opinion, been the characters and their relationships with each other.  Michael and Kay's moral battle, Fredo's battered ego in relation to his family of strong individuals, Connie's innocence and awareness of her family's business, Sonny's passion and those effected by it, Tom's honor among thieves, and Vito's protection of his family.  It was always intriguing to see how Michael reluctantly inherited his 'kingdom' from his flawed but honorable father, and how he wanted so thoroughly to give Kay a life she could be proud of.  This was great stuff, a tale of a family to rival the greatest of stories.Then Francis Ford Coppola moves on, forgets about his masterpieces, and so does everybody else.  Sure, we all wanted to know what happens after the somewhat ambiguous ending of the second film, so why not make a third? There's nothing wrong there.  Where Coppola, Puzo, and for that matter, Pacino, strayed was in the way they wrapped it up.Despite what people will tell you, Sophia Coppola and Talia Shire are not talented actresses.  They were in this film for one reason; They're in F F Coppola's family.  Suddenly Connie has a more potent role than ever before. When once she was a smaller character poorly performed, she suddenly becomes her brother's Consigliere!  Connie almost ruins this movie.  So does Andy Garcia, despite his best efforts, his character makes no sense, and is not very intelligent.  Robert Duval is sorely missed, replaced by a lesser acter playing his priest son, who is a needless character only present in scenes where family members are gathering.  In fact, not one character makes sense or has any depth.  Even Kay and Michael have dummy dialogue and no wit.  The whole thing really stinks of too many writers trying and not succeeding to write a good follow up to two of the greatest films ever made.",Null,1,2,15 January 2002
Mystic River," I Can't Leave This Film Behind
","I'm reminded of a favorite teacher's old saying; 'Great films start when the lights go up.'  I tend to believe in that theory, that a truly great film stays with you long after the final credit roll.  Mystic River is a great film, a truly, categorically, irretrievably great film.  It can't be less than it is.  The film seems to feel genuine pain, like it's a living thing, in that it can't be less than it is.  Some films strive to be more than they are, and there have been countless overblown dramas for centuries, most recently The Road to Perdition.  Other films delight in their greatness, accept and relish it, making it a part of their delivery.  But in Mystic River's case, it is a film in anguish, trying to make sense of its existence.  That is why I feel the main character of the film is Dave (Tim Robbins).I was drawn to Mystic River by two phenomena; seeing Unforgiven for the first time and being fully indoctrinated into the Clint-Eastwood-as-director fan club, and the other because of Stephen King's simple proclamation that there are few films that matter, really matter, and Mystic River matters.The film clocks in somewhere near 3 hours, and though I was immediately aware of how long it was, I was also immediately aware of precisely why it was so long.  There wasn't a single scene that didn't matter.  Not a single scene where the film lost momentum.  There were innumerable scenes which frustrated my companions of the evening, particularly the ending, but I was so enthralled I was not ready to leave this world.  You might weep when you last see Marcia Gay Harden's character.  I think about her, she's real to me now, and I want to help her.  I believe this is why the film wishes it were less.  I really think some people just won't be able to handle this film well, they'll wish it were dumber, shorter, more 'action' packed, because this film is packed with the kind of action you don't want to watch for too long.  But it won't let go of you, won't let you off the hook.  You're in the know, at the end, and it's like finding out you've been cheated on.  You can't have things go back to the way they were before, you just wish it had never happened.  Dave's abduction truly drives this story, these people, it's all about what it did to them.  But Dave's abduction is also a scape-goat, and you see it in the final frames, and you wish everything were OK.  But three lives are ruined, and the final thought, maybe, is that these lives were ruined in their own way, at their own time, and that led to Dave's destination at the end of the film.Tim Robbins, Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon all deserve Best Actor nods, and the same is true for Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney.  The young boyfriend also deserves Oscar attention.  And of course, Eastwood for director.  If Mystic River doesn't win Best Picture, it will be one of the greatest second-place finishers in the history of film, and it will go on for years, haunting more and more viewers, redefining their lives in true ways.",Null,0,0,1 December 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Will Be one of those Videos You Watch Repeatedly
","Anchorman has a funny effect on me. I remember laughing out loud through nearly the whole film when I first saw it, and yet I still chuckle, to myself, at the now familiar jokes and setups. Like (the Holy Grail of American comedy) 'Caddyshack' before it, Anchorman will live on in repeated lines for years to come. I don't pretend it's writing is more brilliant than 'Caddyshack', it isn't. It's over the top where Caddyshack is underplayed to perfection, but the two stand as staggering cinematic moments in comedy. I've heard the outtakes are as funny as the finished film, and that most of the movie was just the lead actor's riffing, but I have to hand it Adam McKay for directing a mostly 'riffed' film into a brilliant little piece. Of course, I love Will Ferrel's bluster (especially the outtake clips where he overreacts with so many 'Great - something's something').Still, the supporting cast is spot on, the performances always over-the-top and yet never over-the-line. Anchorman walks the tightrope and maintains a crazy energy the whole way through. It's also a very democratic film, every character receives a large share of the laughs. I struggle to think of characters on screen who are not being funny or adding to a joke. Accept the film for the big, ridiculous thing that it is and laugh your pants off.Also, the moment Roger Ebert criticized as out-of-sync, the 'Brawl', is just too funny on its own not to be there. Honestly, the last time you watched 'Caddyshack', you knew the Yacht Club scene was a little un-subtle, but you still chuckle at the filmmakers disregard for maintaining tone. It's touches like that that keep these frenetic films alive for years to come. In ten years, you'll ask your friends what they could have been thinking shooting this scene, but you'll laugh just as hard knowing that they actually did shoot it and put it out there.",9,0,2,28 July 2005
Munich," Woe be the third act (spoilers, kind of)
","I may be one of the few, but MUNICH shares more similarity to Spielberg's worst film (in my opinion) THE TERMINAL than it does to the MUNICH-compared films SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLER'S LIST. MUNICH starts as strong as any film this year, with a sequence that illuminates the historical realities of the 1970's; Americans (supposedly Olympic athletes) help the terrorists get over a fence into the Olympic compound. It's a possibly un-aware reference to America's bumbling foreign policy of 'helping' other countries out.Anyway, the action picks up quickly and major players are introduced in classic Spielbergian ease. The film may be ambiguous in its politics, but it's precise in its dialogue and character setups. Everyone has their dye cast early on, so you can see their developments ahead without giving away too much. What follows the fractured sequence involving the hostage crisis is a swiftly paced action story about the Mossad hit-squad put out on the terrorist's tails. As the assassins begin to see the humanity in their targets, the film begins to lose its way, until eventually the weight of Eric Bana's guilt derails the film into its frustratingly imprecise third act.The film is gaining praise around the world for its daring stance on an epic, historical struggle between the Jews and Islam. But where the film does attempt a more balanced look at the struggle, it misses its mark trying to defend its three hours, finished with a too-long 'you can't go home again' sequence.It's a noble effort, perhaps, but certainly far from the best Spielberg has done. Perhaps he was so aware at how controversial the film would be for its subject he never scrutinized its narrative arc. What starts as an action movie with a conscience ends with a boring denouement for Bana's Hero of Israel. He realizes he may have enjoyed killing just a bit too much. This has been done before in better films. I'm a huge Spielberg fan, but I won't defend this as greater than a 7, an earnest attempt but it misses its mark.",7,0,4,10 January 2006
