Scarface," ridiculously overrated
","I have to say that this movie was pretty damn awful.  Sure, Pacino was fantastic in his portrayal of a Cuban drug over lord, and he had some pretty classic lines, but these were the only redeeming virtues of an otherwise lousy flick.  The story line, directing, music (god the music was HORRIBLE!), and everything about this movie (other than Pacino of course) was just outright bad.  I really have no idea why this film is so highly regarded.  5/10 at best.",5,7,13,31 July 2003
Save the Last Dance," mediocre but entertaining
","Trying to hide its shoddy plot, mediocre acting and undeveloped characters behind a well-known, popular formula, this movie is just about exactly what you would expect from one of its class.  The dance sequences also do very little to save the film.  They are few and far between. And as dance sequences go, they are lacking in intensity and aren't all that much to look at.  Despite all this, it wasn't hard to sit back and enjoy the movie for what it had to offer.   It is an entertaining formula afterall.",Null,0,2,13 January 2001
Saw," wishes it were Sev7n but not nearly as clever
","This film was basically an expression of a writer's ability to come up with really twisted ways to kill people. There was little in the way of back plot, motive, or anything really substantial. It started to get deeper in the sense of character development but never really took that road anywhere.Overall Saw is just a poor imitation of Sev7n without much of the redeeming qualities. 'Saw' did have an interesting surprise twist at the end, however the more I thought about it, the more flaws and plot holes I found with it. Overall this film wasn't all that entertaining. While the suspense kept it going, its dependence on shock value as opposed to good writing and film making (some of the camera shots were ridiculous, e.g. a particular car chase) hurt it more than its twists helped. As a horror film I'd give this a 7/10. In general its a 5/10. Certainly not Silence of the Lambs, Sev7n, or The Ring caliber.",6,0,1,7 December 2004
