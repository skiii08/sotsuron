Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great but not perfect...
","After watching Kill Bill Volume 1 six month ago, I walked into the Kill Bill 2 with a dominating desire to see the absurd violence and bitchy banters that was so prevalence in the first installation. Walking out satisfy Kill Bill had quench these desires and more.  It was nice to see that the sequel stay to its campy theme yet at the same time it was also refreshing to see QT usage of different movie style for each subplot.  Although it does not have as much action as in Kill Bill 1, the thickened plot more than makes up for this void.  Don't be surprise to witnessing something entirely different from the first movie. Despite its deviation from its prequel, this movie duly deserve the adulations from movie goers everywhere.",10,0,1,20 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," An excellent movie!
","An unusual m√©lange of vintage Asian style martial arts movie and Tarantino's wit. After a seven year hiatus from directing, QT is back, but this time with a martial art thriller.  And by no mean does it disappoint his fan. Beware there is a lot of bloody scene, but if you are like me you watch it with gusto.",10,0,0,18 October 2003
