The Avengers," Avengers Assemble!!
","The Avengers is one of if not the best comic book movie ever! The buildup to it was worth the wait. The heroes from previous film (Iron Man 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America) are united to save the world from Thor's adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who gets in his possession the Tesseract, which has the power to teleport from one universe to another, Loki uses this power to transport war mongering aliens to earth to rule the world. The first part of the movie deals with getting all the Avengers to coexist with each other as they are constantly fighting on what is the best course of action. The second half is non stop action with our heroes working together to stop Loki and his army. With the exception of Ed Norton, all the stars from the previous films are here: Iron Man(the charismatic Robert Downy Jr.) Captain America(Chris Evans) Thor,(Chris Hemsworth) and new character Hawkeye(Oscar nominated Jeremy Renner)the Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow(the beautiful Scarlet Johannson). The Avengers is a wild and fun ride and make sure you stay after the credits are over for a funny scene. Assemble!",10,2,6,19 May 2012
United 93," They would not go down without a fight.
","United 93 is a fitting tribute to those who died on that plane during the September 11th hijackings. Flight 93 was the only plane of the four hijacked that day that didn't reach its target (possibly the Capitol or the White House) Director Paul Greengrass does an excellent job in this film that tells the true story of the plane and the brave passengers who decided to fight and try to take control from the terrorists. The movie has a 'real time' feel to it so it makes you feel as if your on board yourself, because of runway traffic, 93 was the last of the 4 jets to take off. The passengers on board find out about the World Trade Center and Pentagon from their cell phones when they talk to their family and friends and they realize its a suicide mission so they decide to try and stop the terrorists. The actors in the movie are virtual unknowns and a majority of the ground control (particularly FAA commander Bob Sliney) play themselves which is fitting because they saw the tragedy up close. The hardest part of the film is watching these heroes as they say goodbye to their loved ones on their phones before they try to take over the plane. United 93 is a emotional and powerful story of what happened that awful day and the true story of the men and women who would not go down without a fight.",10,1,5,29 April 2006
Spider-Man 2," Get caught in a second web of fun.
","The Sequel to the Box office hit movie of 2002 is perhaps the best sequel to a comic book movie, and In many ways is even better than the first. The special effects are better this time around and the plot is more defined. The returning cast is just as good this time around with Tobey Maguire playing the web slinger, along with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. J.K. Simmons who plays J.Jonah Jameson has more screen time this time and he makes the most of it with hilarious one liners that make you laugh. If there was such a thing as perfect casting, It would have to be Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavius (Doc Ock). Molina and his four mechanical arms make him a better villain than Willem Dafoe's  Green Goblin.(No offense to Dafoe, who did an awesome job). The fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are choreographed beautifully from begining to end. Whatever mistakes director Sam Raimi made in the first movie he fixed them with this sequel. Because of his love for the Spider-Man characters he puts his heart and soul into the movie so it would be a crime if the Studios choose to film another sequel with a different director. Spider-Man 2 ranks up there with the best comic book movies ever. Get caught in a second web of fun.",10,0,0,8 July 2004
Spotlight," An important film during a dark time
","Spotlight, the movie that won the academy award for best picture at The Oscars is an important film that focuses on a subject that needed to be addressed, The sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. Based on a true story, the movie is about the Boston Globe newspaper's 'Spotlight' team that broke the news story about the sex abuse scandal in the Boston Archdiocese. Since the story broke in 2002 the investigation led to the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston as well as leading to reform in not only Boston, but the entire Catholic church as well. The actors in this film are first rate, led by Michael Keaton as editor Walter 'Robby' Robertson, the story centers on the reporters working through sources and talking to abuse survivors. In an Ironic twist, the reporters investigating the story are catholic themselves and are disgusted by the story. One performance I really enjoyed was Mark Ruffalo as Mike Rezendes, Mark delivers a powerful performance and even though he was nominated for best supporting actor for the role, he tragically didn't win. Spotlight is a powerful movie. The true story not only exposed the scandal, but led to new standards in the church to reporting Priest abusers and new rules to protecting children. It was a dark time in the city of Boston but it was a story that needed to be told and here is hoping the Catholic church see to it that this never happens again 10/10 stars.",9,0,0,6 March 2016
Spider-Man," Simply Amazing
","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man ranks up there between Richard Donner's Superman and Tim Burton's Batman. What sets it apart from other superhero movies is it's heart. Raimi was a smart choice to direct because of his love for this character and his determination to make it more than just a two dimensional action movie. Spider-Man, (created in 1962 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko) was the first comic book hero to have real problems and the movie centers that around all the action. He worrys about money, dates, and all the problems a normal teenager suffers, which is why the characters popularity rivals that of Superman or Batman. When Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire who was the right choice) becomes Spider-Man he uses his new found powers not to fight evil, but to make money. After being stiffed by the promoter of a wrestling match, he heads toward the elevator at the same moment a crook is running down the hall chased by a cop yelling at Peter to stop him..He does not, thinking it's not his problem. That same crook would then go on and kill his beloved Uncle Ben in a carjacking incident. Peter is beside himself with guilt knowing he could have stopped the crook, but did'nt. The movie then moves in a very fast pace which is typical of Raimi's movies, The action scenes are exciting to watch from the battles with Spider and the Green Goblin.Willem Dafoe is one of the best onscreen comic book villians since Jack Nicholson's Joker, his scenes alone are worth the price of admission, Kirsten Dunst also does a good job as Peter's love interest as Mary Jane Watson. The one problem I do have with the movie is the Green Goblin costume, It looks like something out of Power Rangers!! J.K. Simmons small part as Daily Bugle publisher J.Jonah Jameson is also hilarious. Spider-Man delivers big time!!",10,0,0,3 May 2002
Man on the Moon," Flawed film but Carrey's best performance ever.
","The Problem with Man on the Moon is that it recreates too much oftelevision events in Andys career rather than focus on his upbringingand his personal life. Regardless Jim Carrey should have been nominated for an oscar for his role in this movie but due to low box office andthe politics of the academy board. (half the time they don't know who tonominate.) Jim got snubbed again. HE IS ANDY KAUFMAN!!. If Andy wasalive he'd be proud, or is he dead? 5 out of 10 s",Null,0,0,4 January 2001
Frozen," Unexpected Disney Classic
","When this movie came out in 2013 it reminded me in a way of Star Wars back in 1977 because no one expected Star Wars to become the pop culture icon like it did and the same can be said for Frozen. The movie is very enjoyable. It is loosely based on the Hans Christian Anderson story The Snow Queen. It centers around two girls Elsa and her sister Anna. Elsa was born with the power to create ice and snow and because of this the girls get to play and create snowmen but during one recent romp Anna is injured by Elsa's power. Their Parents decide that Elsa's powers must be made a secret and kept under control. A few years later and its Elsa's Coronation but she gets into an argument with Anna when she asks Elsa for her blessing to marry a Prince she just met on the same day. Elsa loses control and her powers are exposed to everybody, As a result the entire Kingdom is engulfed in Winter. Elsa runs away to the mountains and Anna with help from an iceman named Kristoff and his pet deer Sven go after her to bring her back so she can use her powers to break the winter spell and bring summer back. The voice acting is first rate with Kristen Bell as Anna and the amazing singer Idina Menzel as Elsa. What sets Frozen apart from other Disney movies is its soundtrack which features the Academy award wining song 'Let it Go' by Idina Menzel. (The film would go on to win the Academy award for best animated movie) another thing that's unique is the focus of the relationship between the two sisters witch is original in a Disney film. One character that's a scene stealer is Olaf the snowman who was created by Elsa as a little girl but comes to life to help Anna find her sister (He likes warm hugs). All in all Frozen is good movie that's not to dark or sad and can be enjoyed by the whole family.",7,5,11,12 April 2015
Transformers," Transform and roll out!
","If I can sum up my feelings on this movie in one word, it would be awesome! Based on the popular 1980's toy and cartoon Transformers is a wild ride from beginning to end. The story is about alien robots who are searching the planet Earth for the Allspark which has the power to turn any type of machine into a transformer robot. A race between the noble Autobots and the evil Decepticons to find it, the main human character Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebouf) is the key to finding it as he has in his possession a pair of eyeglasses which belonged to his great-grandfather that have a map burned into one of the lenses that shows the location of the Allspark. The Decepticons under their leader Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) want to use it to take over the universe while the Autobots led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen gives the voice he made famous on the 80's cartoon show) want to find it to protect it from the evil robots. The computer and special effects are first rate and the action sequences make you jump for joy. The acting which boasts Academy award winner Jon Voight is right on the money as well. Transformers is one of the best summer movies to come out in a long time, roll out!",10,3,7,4 July 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A great story about revenge.
","Quentin Tarantino has a very unusual way of directing a movie. Relying on Inspirations from Martial Art/Bruce Lee movies and other classic Japanese films. But he does know how to borrow this genre and work it in his films. Kill Bill Volume 1 is a good example. Uma Thurman, who became a star after Pulp Fiction (another Tarantino film) Plays a character known simply as the Bride, (You have to see Vol. 2 to find out her real name.) She plays a hired assassin and is a member of the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad. (D.I.V.A.S.) Get it? The Bride finds out she is pregnant and decides to give up the lifestyle of being an assassin and now wants to live a normal life. But during her wedding, her boss Bill and the other members of the D.I.V.A.S. crash the ceremony, kill everyone in the church and leave the Bride for dead. a few years later she wakes from her coma and begins her quest for vengeance by going after her boss Bill and the rest of the Assassins. The movie tends to go over the top in terms of violence that in some occasions it's comical. The actors though are first rate: David Carradine, (of the hit show Kung Fu.) Lucy Lui, Vivica A. Fox, and Daryl Hannah. But the film belongs to Thurman, who I believe gives her best performance since Pulp Fiction. Kill Bill has some terrific action sequences and terrific camera work (one final note, this movie is rated R for good reasons so kids should not see this.) I give it an A.",9,0,2,30 April 2004
Life Is Beautiful," Life truly is beautiful
","This is a movie that will make you laugh while you are crying. Roberto Begnini deserved the oscar for best actor for this film by portraying a father who does everything in his power to keep his son thinking it's all a game for his birthday, and not the terrible truth of the horrors of the holocaust. Nicoletta Braschi also does a terrific job and the little boy is so adorable you just want to adopt him. Hopefully this movie will propel Begnini to greater heights on the US Market. After you see this movie you will truly believe Life is Beautiful.",10,2,4,31 December 2000
Detroit Rock City," KISS Rocks the city
","Detroit Rock City is a fun adventure comedy that tells the story of 4 friends who will stop at nothing to get into a KISS concert. Trip, Lex, Hawk, and Jam are ready to take a trip to the concert in Detroit, but Jam's fanatically religious and chain-smoking mother (Lin Shaye in an incredible performance) discovers the tickets and burns them in front of him. Undeterred, the boys still travel to Detroit running into trouble along the way and doing whatever it takes to get tickets, from stripping to attempted mugging and so forth. Do the boys get into the concert? You'll have to see the movie to find out. Detroit Rock City is a fun movie and you don't have to be a KISS fan to enjoy it. Lets Rock!!",8,0,0,18 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The force is with this one.
","George Lucas goes all out in the third and final chapter of the Star wars prequels, We finally get to see Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the greatest movie villain of all time: Darth Vader. The movie is non-stop action from start to finish culminating between the best lightsaber fight of all the six movies. Ewan McGregor is wonderful as Obi-Wan Kenobi as well as the rest of the cast, specifically Ian McDermaid as the emperor. The story takes place near the end of the clone wars when Anakin and Obi-Wan battle the separatist droids who are under the leadership of Count Dooku and new character, the cyborg General Grevious. Anakin continues to have horribles nightmares of his wife Padme who is now pregnant, and is willing to do anything to try to prevent his dream coming true. It is that weakness that Senator Palpatine uses to convince Anakin to join the dark side of the force. Watching him turn to the dark side you can't help but feel sympathy even though has done horrible things because he feels what he's doing is right. The climax of the movie is of Anakin and Obi-Wan lightsaber duel witch has disastrous consequences. Sith has more than one lightsaber fight in the film among various characters such as Yoda, Mace Windu, and even General Grievous who is trained in the Jedi Arts by Count Dooku. ROTS is quite possibly the best of the entire six movies and is a fitting ending for George Lucas Star Wars Saga. (or is it the end?) It has action, drama and seeing Vader is perhaps the most chilling moment. What a thrill!",9,1,2,19 May 2005
Despicable Me," Despicably Cute.
","Despicable Me is a cute and funny movie that can show that even the baddest of people can still have a heart. Gru (Steve Carell) is an evil villain who lives in a suburban neighborhood, when a villain steals the Pyramid of Giza, Gru wants to top it by achieving the greatest crime of all:Stealing the Moon, but in order to do that he must steal a shrink ray in order to shrink the Moon, but a new villain named Vector (Jason Segel) steals the ray from Gru so he can steal the Moon so now the device is in Vector's house so he can't get it so what does he do? Gru then adopts three little girls from an orphanage so he can use them to trick Vector in order to get the ray back, but before that happens Gru has to look after the girls and over time even the villain's heart starts to melt. The movie has a fair share of laughs most of them come from Gru's minions (adorable Twinkie-like little people who talk in their own language.) The voice cast is spot on with Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Russell Brand and Julie Andrews (who voices Gru's mother) round out the cast, Despicable me is funny and although the animation is not as good as a Pixar movie, it still stands on its own. This movie will tug at your heartstrings and I highly recommend it.",8,4,7,10 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is back!
","I have been a Star Wars fan from the very beginning and while I was happy that the Walt Disney Company would make another trilogy of films I was somewhat reserved because while I thought the prequels (Episodes 1, 2, 3,)were good I felt they could have been better, but JJ Abrams take on the Star Wars mythology reminded me how much I loved the original trinity. The Force awakens takes place 32 years after Return of the Jedi, During that time Luke Skywalker attempts to restore the Jedi order by training padawans the way of the force. But one of his students has turned to the dark side and takes the name of Kylo Ren. Luke Skywalker then disappears and the majority of the movie is spent trying to find him by Ren and the first order (an offshoot of the Galactic Empire that was defeated in episode 6). The movie is action packed but it also has a great storyline unlike the prequels. Old favorites return such as Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C3PO,and R2D2, but the movie introduces us to 3 new characters that in a way are being passed the torch by the original cast. Rey, a female scavenger played by the enchanting Daisy Ridley, Poe, an experienced X-Wing pilot played by Oscar Isaac, and Finn, a rebel stormtrooper played by John Boyega. While the main villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is impressive, he doesn't come close to matching Vader, but Vader does play a key role in Kylo's mission. The Force awakens is a breath of fresh air in the Star Wars universe and I cant wait for episode 8 in 2017! May the force be with you!",10,21,58,21 December 2015
