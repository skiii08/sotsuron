The Mask," Carrey's best film
","Don't get me wrong; Carrey's an excellent comic. However, he has made a habit of appearing in terrible movies and almost saving them. This is the exception.The Mask is a comic book movie, something many people are unaware of. Carrey was perfectly cast as the main character: a boring no-name who discovers a magical mask that makes him invulnerable and extremely extroverted. Most of the jokes are directed at teenagers; this is a really funny film for about age 14-25 or so, plus other people who remember the horror of puberty. The humour tends to focus on Ipkiss' attempts to reintegrate the extroverted character into his own life, while trying to clean up the mess that the Mask character tends to leave lying around, and avoid getting killed.If you're a Carrey fan, watch this movie. If you're not, maybe you should anyway. If you passionately hate him, including his standup, then avoid it like the plague.",Null,0,0,16 October 2002
