10 Cloverfield Lane," Good first half than falls off a cliff
","The first half contained mystery. Is Howard a monster who kidnapping Michelle for his own twisted reasons or is he an awkward good guy who is saving her and emmit's life out of human compassion.. It's an engaging question because weirdness does not equate to badness and maybe Howard will end up being a nuanced character, who despite his many pathologies is a good person inside and need some time and trust to show it. The surprise is there a door number 3. He's a nut and he's saving her. i liked the movie up until that point. Then the movie seems to lose interest in itself. The dialogue becomes loose, cheesy and the characters become horror tropes. the end barely makes sense and you get the feeling it's been rewritten 30 times and they desperately want to wrap it all up in something that is semi plausible. I'll watch just about anything with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She can sit at a chair and table eating baked beans and I'm in. She was perfect. John Goodman was effective especially in the first half.. The second I saw Emmit i knew he was DOA. They were trying too hard to make him endearing and lovable and he was the barrier between Howard's and Michelle's alone time that the movie definitely was going to make happen. It's disappointing that a movie with so much promise would fail this hard as it went on. If you're bored and want a thriller slightly better than a B movie there are worse things to watch.",6,1,2,20 July 2018
Lone Survivor," Good war flick but also huh?
","I don't know why critics hate this movie so much. The action scenes are tense and done incredibly well. It reminded me of Black Hawk Down, which is in my top twenty best war dramas in the past 20 years.I did not understand the dilemma they faced. They did not have three choices, kill the prisoners, set them free or tie them up. The other option was to find a way to slow the prisoners up so they had time to be evacuated. The OBVIOUS answer was to bring them to the rendezvous point and let them loose when they were on the helicopter. But there were many other possible ways to go. They could have gagged them and bound them loosely so they would be able to go back the the Taliban base but it would have taken much longer. To just let them run full speed away is well- not that smart.",6,3,5,23 August 2019
Us," This is not a good movie
","Peele cares more about piling on bread crumbs and extraneous symbolism than making a cohesive story. 'Get Out' was great because it worked on many levels: social commentary, impactful, precise symbolism or just a basic horror flick. This movie makes no literal sense. Yes, it's a landfill of symbolism about consumer culture. I don't care about bible verse bread crumbs nor various potential meanings of rabbits. I want to watch a movie not google search for clues to a puzzle. The symbolism is contrived and overdone. The story makes no sense. How can doppelgangers, the tethered, commit mass slaughter with scissors??? Americans have guns. What's with the hands across American thing? The military would bomb them once they saw them as a threat. Why did she just live in the tunnels when there was a gateway outside? Why didn't they at least go thru the gateway to get some food? Why does she decide to go to Mexico when she knows her tethered thinks like her? Let her husband make the decision since his double was dead. Or maybe use a flicker of intelligence and do it by chance. Pick five options and pull them out of a hat.",2,2,3,8 June 2020
Creed," Surprisingly terrible
","It was a very formulaic movie. Michael B. Jordan has the same scowl on his face during the entire movie. His trash talk in the ring 99 % of the time is 'come on' and he beats his chest and tries too hard to look pumped. Sylvester Stallone looks like he has 5 heart beats per minute and manages to say a depressed sentence now and then. Creed's relationship with his gf, Bianca, feels completely tacked on to appeal to a female audience and because a movie just has to have a love interest but she is a clich√©. She gets dramatic over nothing and they never seem to connect. One reason is because Jordan can't improvise or do anything beyond that anguished scowl and their conversations are awkward mutterings between strangers. His mom is there to generate more contrived drama thru really cringe worthy emoting. I hated this movie. What made the other rocky's great were the villains. Rocky was us facing these larger than life comic book super bad guys. From appollo, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago... Pretty Ricky isn't introduced really until the latter middle of the movie. He's utterly forgettable. I don't get the love for this movie and I very much wanted to.",1,9,14,25 December 2016
Bird Box," Read the book
",The tragedy of this movie is people will not read the excellent novel Bird Box because the movie version for some reason decided to alter most of it and ruined it. Important characters from the book are never seen. Context is missing. Whole plot points are removed. None of it is necessary. The book is all about a fast moving plot. The book is as much of a mystery as it is a drama and it speaks not only to our will to survive in impossible circumstances but how we can make life meaningful when everything is hollowed out of it. It about courage and the need for connection but beyond all the the book is tense and fun. Somehow the movie is bloated. tacky and dumb. What a missed opportunity,1,6,9,12 May 2019
Get Out," Reality is the horror
","There are a lot of movies that describe the black experience in America well. There are none that make you feel it viscerally as effectively as Get Out does. Don't just watch this as a horror movie. It's not what is intended. There is social commentary throughout. What you think are plot holes is your lack of movie comprehension. The movie makes you feel how hyper-aware we are when around groups of white people. The hypnosis is the cultural remains of living in a country where our roots are servitude and oppression - not just oppression of our body but our ego. The sunken place is emotional wound that get passed on from generation to generation. We feel less than, we feel immobilized, it is the culture that has done this to us. Get Out touches on the ugly way casual racism objectifies African Americans. How it otherizes us. When we are the other, what kind of treatment towards us is possible? When we are seen as sexual or athletic props, will we be treated with human dignity? Get Out comments on how white people have used us as parts in their system, in the movie very literally, to better their position but stealing our lives. Beyond all of the on point commentary, it's a beautifully and poignantly shot movie. The deer he hits with his car serves not only to make him flash back to his mother's death but him relating himself as the hunted who he empathizes with but his gf doesn't have the capacity to care about. She wants to jut drive on.",10,1,7,27 May 2019
Heat," The Ending made no sense
","The whole movie Neil says his unbreakable rule is not to make any commitments he can't run out on in 30 seconds. So he breaks this rule for Eady. It's a sweet sentiment and rings true. Meeting her makes him get in touch with how lonely he is and how empty his life would be even if he had more money he could ever spend. Awesome. he's all ready to make good on this epiphany and then finds out where Waingro is staying. Instead of leaving, like his philosophy has been his whole career would commit him to doing, he turns the car around and seeks out Waingro. For what? Waingro didn't kill his best friend. The men who died were coworkers who even he said knew what they were going into. He didn't do it because of his addiction to the job. This wasn't his job. This was a grudge and one I don't buy Neil would act on.Otherwise, it's a great movie. Yeah the pacing isn't what I'm used to. There is a lot of soulful staring into space. It does have the best shootout scene I've ever seen and that classic diner scene with Pacino and De Niro where they are so similar it feels like they are giving therapy to themselves. I didn't like the foreshadowing. It was too obvious and made the movie predictable",7,0,2,16 January 2019
