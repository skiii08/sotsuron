Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Terrific acting
","I liked Michael Parks as the 80 year old retired pimp Esteban best of all here.The guy can act. His motions, his accent, the movements of his head were worth seeing many times over.Carradine's acting, voice were also very good.Michael Madsen had his role of a lifetime in Donny Brasco. He was good here as a laidback, failing character.To me the actress playing Kiddo is a tall skinny girl with a less than beautiful face. But she does her part well.The only jarring note in the acting would be Samuel Jackson's overdone, campy attempt at acting in a bit part.Am I wrong or is the movie about men 'disciplining' their women?1---Bill shoots Kiddo in the head because she dumped him.2---Esteban says he doesn't agree with that and says Bill should have 'cut her face.' Then he calls over a girl of his with a face disfigured in such a way so Kiddo can see her.3---The martial arts master (almost all the posters here are so clueless when it comes to martial arts they don't know there is much to be learned from those scenes) runs a non-stop disciplining of Kiddo.There are two somewhat lengthy scenes involving food prepartion:1--Bud prepares the drinks for himself and Elle.2--Bill prepares the sandwich.",9,1,4,9 February 2007
Spartacus," I found the music abrasive
","I found the accompanying musical score to be offensive at many points.In the many scenes with large numbers of people moving across the countryside, the composer used too much brass. Brass instruments tire the ear very quickly.His use of syncopation seemed repetitive as the movie went along, like he was working according to tired, very predictable formulas.After a while, my thought was, 'Oh, no. Not another scene shot from a distance of people moving across the countryside, with this grating, intrusive, too noticeable brass instrumentation and trite, too obvious use of syncopation.' Worst of all was the composer's inability to write longer melodic lines. Everything was made of short (one measure or less) motives, which he then repeated endlessly to fill out a group of four or eight bars.As for the movie, Ustinov and Laughton were great. As was Woody Strode. Probably the most effective acting in the entire movie was Strode sitting in the pen before he and Spartacus went out to fight.One thing I did not understand was when Spartacus' men took the Roman camp in the first battle. Was my copy missing something? I saw them approaching the camp, then the next thing was their burning the camp and dragging out the Roman commander. But I saw no fighting with the Romans there. Could that have been cut because of the very oppressive censors of the time? Jean Simmons is a very good actress. She had two scenes that stood out: 1-with Spartacus the first time, and 2--her scene with Olivier in his home near the end.I was glad to see John Ireland get a mildly prominent role.Some of the dialogue was embarrassingly bad. Specifically, scenes in the middle of the movie where Douglas repeats the same words or short sentences for no effect except to make me wonder why they had him say the same thing three times, four times.Meanwhile the dialogue involving Ustinov, Olivier and Laughton was top level.The starting section of the movie done by director Mann was excellent.All in all a top level movie, despite my having to turn down the sound repeatedly to avoid the abrasive, interminable brass.",Null,0,3,8 November 2008
Lifeboat," Great America Triumphs movie
","What a group of actors -- in one boat ! Tallulah Bankhead stole the show from all of them.It is interesting to see the amount of antagonism toward the US this movie elicits from some of the posters here.I have one question for you, DCBruton: If the Germans were so superior and 'logical' (yes Hitler was 'logical' and not insane at all, wasn't he) and the Americans so illogical and depraved, then how did the US beat your beloved Germans so thoroughly in WWII? We would all be speaking German in the US is you were right, wouldn't we.LOL.",Null,1,11,20 February 2007
The Godfather: Part II," Godfather II Stunk
","Godfather Two is Coppola's movie---and he had no instincts for the mafia. The Godfather author, Mario Puzo, objected to having Michael kill his own brother, but finally gave in to keep his share of the Hollywood millions.Godfather Two has lightweights as heavies: the drunken New York mob guy and Hyman Roth can't compare to Barzini, Sollozo, and the other heavyweight bad guys of the original Godfather written by Puzo.Godfather Two loses the atmosphere of the mob while it meanders lengthily into Cuba.The main point that makes Godfather Two inferior is that it does not contain a single sympathetic character.The endless scenes in the Lake Tahoe home of Michael's are tiresome, dreary after a while, and lack interest as compared to the original Puzo story.This movie shows a deterioration from the original, just as the mob has deteriorated in recent years.Coppola had no right to think he could write his own Godfather, and his inferiority to Puzo when it comes to dealing with the mob shows up here in technicolor.Meanwhile, poor Mario Puzo watched his story being degraded by the instinctless Coppola, objected at first, and then gave in. Pathetic.The only scenes that actually ring true here are from the original Puzo book (the earlier life of Vito Corleone).The contrast between the dreary Coppola script of Godfather Two and its dreary characters is brought home strongly by the final (flashback) scene where Sonny Corleone and the others are around the table. As soon as Sonny appears, everything comes to life.",4,29,67,4 July 2007
