Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar jar stinks. Terrible CGI and wooden acting. A complete waste of good actors.
","This film is so bad its funny. 90 percent of the film is a mix of bad cgi, unconvinving acting and bad humour. However there is a good story in there and Darth Maul was cool.",4,3,8,21 December 2019
Joker," Ignore the negative reviews. Joker is the film of the decade.
",Ignore the negative reviews this film is incredible. After i left the cinema i was speechless for a full 20 minutes because of how much of a deep effect it had on me. It linked into The Dark Knight (one of my favourite films) beautifully and Waqouim Pheonix's performance was simply phenomenal and i would be suprised he does not win an oscar for his outsatnding acting. He fit the role perfectly. I would rate this film 8.8 stars out of 10 and want to see it on imdb's top rated list.,9,1,1,7 October 2019
