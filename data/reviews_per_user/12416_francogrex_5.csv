Hereditary," Extremely poor
","This movie is a sham. I strongly suspect the reviews and the positive rating is fake. This is a mess it starts slowly and then I believe the writers did not know how to end this properly so they just wrote down whatever came to mind, plus add some blood and spirits and heads... and here you go, a movie. I pity those who genuinely rate this laughable travesty of a movie positively. I especially pity a person who wrote a review with 10/10 'Seen it twice and I now got it - a brilliant movie '. I think he became dumb with age hence his appreciation of the movie the second viewing, one needs to have a low IQ to be able to enjoy this.",1,1,1,14 April 2020
500 Days of Summer," Why this movie isn't good
","I always wondered why this movie was highly rated. It is a movie about unrequited love and it is all that this movie is about! it is not exceptional in any way that a movie is not about love but it's about the absence of love. This happens in real life more often than anything else. Unrequited love is prevalent especially among teenagers. To make a whole movie about it, is like watching somebody having constipation for one hour and a half: we know it happens frequently but it's not really what we want to go to the movies for. We want to get out of our reality and be transported into something else. Hence this movie completely misses the objective. It is a failure.",1,4,6,9 March 2019
Bird Box," best watch it blindfolded
","Seeing this film made me want to kill myself. i should have watched it blindfolded and with the sound off too, maybe i would have enjoyed or at least not suffered such boredom.",1,2,3,9 November 2019
Peaceful Warrior," Great message, poor storyline
","Note: This review does not reveal specific details, but it may reveal the overall storyline and especially the way the movie may end. I am confused as to where I should place this movie: it has a great message embedded in the teachings of the 'Socrates' character and in the interactions between the protagonist and Socrates, but the storyline is poor, predictable and 'americanized' in the sense that the actions of the protagonist, especially towards how the plot develops towards the end goes against the core of the teaching and the message it is trying to convey. It's as if they hijacked a noble message and twisted it enough to apply it in a wrong way to a poor purpose and a mediocre ending. Therefore I will give it a 6. Another related point, in the recommendations of IMDb 'People who liked this also liked...' they provide suggestions for other movies like 'The Notebook' and 'Pride and Prejudice'... what do those movies have in common? I advise IMDb to revise and make amendments to this program because it is quite flawed overall (not just for this movie). There are much better algorithms to enable finding similar movies, the one used now is quite useless. I honestly prefer to view the lists the other users have written (when they are available) to get good recommendations.",6,2,3,13 April 2014
A Quiet Place," Repulsive family
","The people, that family was so disgustly annoying that I was hoping the monsters would kill them all. The idiot got pregnant knowing fully well it was dangerous. Go monster aliens!",1,5,9,14 November 2019
