Casablanca," Untouchable
","Casablanca is a prime example of classic Hollywood. With your stars like Bogie and Bergmann, along with great writing, directing, and unforgettable lines, it makes for a movie that none other can compare to. This movie does not need big money effects or action sequences. The acting along will make you fall in love with this classic. It's a story of fate and romance, with a classic ending to die for. I may have been born many many years after, but it's a film that any generation can relate to. If there was ever a list of the top 10 movies never to be considered for a remake, Casablance would be there. Watch this film if you're a fan of the good old days and love a great production and don't forget, 'Here's looking at you, kid'.",10,2,3,9 November 2009
Terminator Salvation," Watch it as it's own
","Before viewing the film 'Terminator:Salvation', there are a few things that you need to take into consideration(especially big fans). One of them being that this may be considered the fourth in the franchise, but its really its own movie. This movie has been bad mouthed from day one. It seems that so many films produced today are remakes, based off books, or taken from older franchises. So why does this one take more of the cake than others. I saw this movie in theaters and enjoyed it very much, and yes I am a fan of the series. McG deserves much more credit than what he got. This is not the best and not the worst, it is what it is. A fun, load, and rip roaring flick.P.S- You want bad, go watch the Twilight series. That movie makes money off of selling sex(Have some goofy looking kid play Edward and see how ya' do, just saying).",10,13,18,20 November 2009
