Requiem for a Dream," Innovative, Disturbing and Brilliant
","Not what I expected at all, it was so much more than a 'drugs are bad' movie, taking the disturbingly similar journeys of mother and son through the short lived highs and crushing lows of both their lives .
The performance of from Ellyn Burstyn as the loving but deeply troubled mother was absolutely mesmerising - deserving of the oscar nomination and in my view really should have won.
The cinematography and editing were were quite brilliant with a stunning soundtrack complimenting perfectly the mood and emotions on show.
A very dark and disturbing movie but also an absolute must see.",9,2,2,8 March 2020
Train to Busan," Best, Scariest Zombies + story with heart = Brilliant movie
","Really enjoyed this, most amazing, scary physcho zombies I've ever seen combined with wonderful core characters all wrapped up in a tragic but heartfelt multilayer morality tale.
Superb movie, just see it!",9,1,3,26 January 2020
Aquaman," Absolutely terrible, please don't waste your time
","Incredibly bad movie, script woeful, acting even worse. The big budget cgi made it look like a computer game rather than a movie - it's like a mashup of avatar and power rangers.
Don't waste your time.",1,40,84,22 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Self indulgent and just plain DULL!
","I am a huge fan but Tarantino looks like he made this purely for his own entertainment and show off just how much of a movie nerd he is to his mates and forgot about everything else.
For the majority of the rest of his audience looking to be entertained by the normal Tarantino excellence containing wit, crackling dialogue, fast pace, action, twists, stellar soundtrack and fantastic visuals - this is not that movie.
I gave it a very generous 4 only because there are few moments of genuine class and the final 25mins is fun. Other than that, dire.",4,17,27,23 August 2019
Joker," Amazing performance but light on depth and substance
","Amazing and thought provoking movie with a remarkable performance from Joaquin Phoenix, I was completely transfixed at certain points.
The absolute tragedy and spiral to the depths of despair of the main character were portrayed brilliantly leaving me overwhelmed with sadness and even empathy despite knowing I 'should' despise him.
The movie is beautifully shot, with a brilliant soundtrack - a real feast for the eyes and ears.
The De Niro casting was inspired, with many nods to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy.
The issues for me were around lack of development and depth of the supporting characters and plot from a fairly weak screenplay for the first hour or so.
It seemed the directors goal was often about setting up set pieces for Pheonix's (amazing) performance but that came at the expense of the overall breadth and depth of the narrative.
Definitely worth seeing, I left feeling astonished and impressed at what I had witnessed but ultimately slightly less than fulfilled.",8,2,3,5 October 2019
