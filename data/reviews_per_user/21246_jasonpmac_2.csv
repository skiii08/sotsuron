Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark, should be in IMDb's top 3 all time
","A truly great Movie. Has it all and should be in IMDb's top 3. Flawless direction, brilliant characterizations, and unbelievable score. something for everyone in this great classic: thrills, chills, action, adventure, romance and comedy, all of which is top-notch in every department, and all in one dense, exhilarating two hour experience. Ford's subtle performance isn't the only understated quality that makes Raiders such a different kind of action flick. It's also incredibly funny throughout, often side-splittingly hilarious. There is a droll sense of humor that underlies most scenes, so small, it's almost imperceptible, but you'll find yourself laughing more often than most comedies, even the classics. The humor is never obvious, almost seeming unscripted (many of the film's biggest laughs are ad-libbed), but what makes everything so humorous is that, even though the cast is colorful and somewhat grandiose, they are very well-rounded in surprisingly complex detail.",10,0,1,23 February 2011
