The Ring," WOW!The most awful waste of time I've had since Freddy got fingered
","I can not believe I paid $7.00 to see that poor excuse of ascary movie.  Where do I even begin? I realize it is just amovie, but none of it makes sense, obviously...and also neverwants to end.  It just keeps on explaining it self over and over to The point where I just started laughing.  I know it's just a typical scary movie.  I think the reason I am still mad about it is that somany people encouraged me to go see it and it has made way too much money for the quality. Maybe if I was a girl in junior high or something, I MIGHT like it then.  Too slow, too ridiculous, and too annoying for me.  My fellow IMDB voters- I know the only reason this is getting such a high voting is b/c of blurred vision and people who don't know movies like 'we veteran' movie goers do.  To all of the 'amateurs' who also probably liked kung pao of supernova:  stop voting- you are ruining the prestige and honor of IMDB and the rest of the 'casablanca' top of the class movie guru's.Thank You...I feel so much better now.",1,0,2,26 November 2002
