The Avengers," It CAN be done!
","I want to try to keep this brief because I feel there is need for three separate reviews for this movie, so without further ado;Kids - you'll love it!Now leave the room and let me talk to the adults...Next, comic book geeks - why am I even sharing this with you? You saw the movie over half a year before I did. But then what if you were like me and wanted the hype to die down first or your expectations were feeling a little... strained?Well in case you haven't seen this movie, The Avengers dances provocatively between two different Marvel Universe molds, namely 616 and the Ultimate Universe. No reason, just because somebody said 'Sam Jackson could totally be the black Nick Fury!'In all, without having everybody dressed as they should be - in their original respective battle uniforms - everybody pretty much is as they should be. But the three characters you're going to appreciate the most are Iron Man, Thor and Hulk/Banner. They're just so much better portrayed and their parts are so much more intriguing than Fury, Black Widow and Hawkeye (who in recent years has actually been one of the more interesting characters, no matter what universe we're talking!You will get to see your favourite characters kick ass and interact the way they most likely would and there are a hell of a lot of in-jokes and references to appreciate.Now please leave the room...Okay movie fans and fellow snobs, if you're anything like me, too much noise and activity makes you sleepy rather than lively, especially when they try to make superheroes act and fight as humanly realistically as possible before just deciding 'aaah feck it' and turning them into Mortal Kombat character animations.In fact you know what? Feck it!Pros:1.) Joss Whedon directed marvellously and gave us his best 2.) Character interplay is at many times very fun to watch 3.) The film does not rush from scene to scene like Phantom Menace trying to pretend right in front of your eyes that it is not in fact happening 4.) The backing cast is superb 5.) There is a hell of a lot of bang for your buck and it is mostly excellently executedCons:1.) Hawkeye, Fury and Black Widow seem largely useless 2.) You can tell the actors know it 3.) Captain America comes across as a bloody weakling and spends more time doing acrobatics and being depressed than he does take charge and kick ass 4.) The population of New York City are mindless sheep with no presence, heart or meaning and therefore have no reason for us to care that the Avengers are rescuing them from an alien invasion 5.) The alien invaders didn't have enough time to prove how big a threat they really were before Avengers started stomping them wholesale. This kind of defeats the object of them being a threat.This film however has the potential and I know that Joss Whedon is a perfectionist that will improve with every sequel. I look forward to the next film!P.s - Mark Ruffalo; best actor and best portrayal of Banner there has ever been!",7,1,6,19 March 2013
Sucker Punch," The sole survivor of two abused sisters uses her impenetrable imagination to plot her escape from an insane asylum!
","Director Zack Snyder has been compared to a lot of classic filmmakers since his steady rise to the top of the Hollywood list. His most memorable blockbusters up until now, as you will most likely remember are the 2003 'Dawn of the Dead' remake, Spartan war fantasy '300' and the all comic-book movie shaming 'Watchmen.' Yes, I am a fan of his work but no I do not argue the man's genius in every case.'Dawn,' I felt was a hastily put-together feature that failed to capitalise where modern filmmaking methods could have improved the original version and the only similarity was that both films had a shopping mall. Still, I like it. What he did improve was the sense of excitement, even though the story had been drastically simplified as an apparently necessary sacrifice.'300' was not a great film in my eyes and I hated the use of almost two-dimensional looking CGI to portray a historic tale although he had his reasons for making it that way, particularly the influence of comic-book legend Frank Miller. After being treated to Troy, Kingdom of Heaven and the likes, I was left feeling sold short.Then came 'Watchmen' and Snyder's true colours shone; a true talent for storytelling, a big appetite for character and plot twists and a gift for transferring a sense of sentimentality from studio to audience. In my eyes, this last title was a perfect display of lessons well-learned and skills well-matured.'Sucker Punch' is literally a return to original form for the director and with all his perfected skills and impeccable eye for detail in tow. Here he tells a seemingly simple escape story, one that allows the audience's imagination to overstep the mark as the film unravels into an immensely complex trip through the daydreams of a tragically oppressed mind.Baby Doll and her sister are child victims to an abusive step-father until one night, he crosses the line. So afraid for her sister, Baby Doll escapes imprisonment to rescue her sister only to find her dead. Refusing to take out violent revenge, the step-father blames her for her sister's death and has her imprisoned in an insane asylum. She immediately begins to withdraw into the limitless depths of her imagination to escape her grim reality, destined for the lobotomists operating chair, and hopefully to escape in reality.But she recedes so far that she suddenly finds herself imprisoned in another reality where she is taken in by a group of captive women also looking for a way out. With the aid of a mysterious mentor (portrayed by legend film veteran Scott Glenn) they set about finding the means to escape their captors and tormentors through mind-blowing ventures into fantasy wars where the band of women fight with all the rage they've ever known.Spending a lot of time entering these dream worlds and fighting side by side to go on with their secret plans, the film occasionally comes back to the second reality where the seemingly primary plot and narrative unfold bit by bit. But it is only towards the end that the story crashes back to reality so abruptly that, with all the plot points in place, we are dragged back to the feature's very title and literally sucker punched over and over again. This review needs no spoiler, it does what it says on the box, yet it generously offers so much more to the open mind and the sympathetic heart.Snyder's 'Sucker Punch' is so many things at one time yet these things work harmoniously. It's a psychological drama and a chick-flick set inside a man-boy's video game.Visually, you are inside a video-game of the highest calibre, in fact a mix of the very best there has ever been. But the drama within and around the octane-soaked action scenes and all this leading up to the jaw-dropping conclusion is enough to make even the most emotionally devoid man shed even a single tear. Try to figure out what it all means after you've seen it once or twice and the possibilities keep jumping in your face long after.Zack Snyder has plenty years of cutting edge filmmaking left in him before he joins the distant-minded and long-past glorious Hollywood crowd but if he can ever top this one with something even more mind-blowing, I'll have to lobotomise myself just to be able to cope.Accept no imitations!",Null,3,5,14 October 2011
The Expendables 2," The team returns with a bang but when one of their own is murdered, they set out for brutal revenge
","Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Li, Couture and Cruz. Check! Schwarzenegger and Willis in tow. Check! Also starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as the villain and with a special guest; CHUCK NORRIS!!! Judging by the first film, I expected this to be the film that delivered more of what I expected the first time around - a bigger budget, a bigger adventure, more hardcore fights and an better script. And that is what I got.It seems that Stallone has gone back to the start for real since his final Rocky outing - doing everything on a more independent level. He did the same with the final Rambo instalment too and then with Expendables. I'm guessing that Hollywood doesn't want to touch him so much now because of his age but that is what this film is about in many respects. Especially with Chuck Norris now over the age of 70, these veterans are proving - like Danny Trejo is now doing in his late 60's - that they can do what any young action star can do, if not more, with their experience and attitude towards hard work. And this sequel goes to show just how much hard work they were all willing to input.Every single action star included in Expendables 2 puts in more than they did the last time, including Schwarzenegger and Willis. And then Jean Claude Van Damme has proved that he can still fight just as hard as he did in Kickboxer and Bloodsport.Not only that but those that didn't get so much dialogue to prove themselves, Lundgren and Crews especially, get to lighten the tone a lot more. The addition of Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid was a welcome offering of young blood also but the camaraderie between all the mercenaries is so evident this time that it is more fun to watch when there is no action fill. It is easily noticeable that Stallone had well-known trivia about his cast written into the dialogue as an injoke between characters; spot them if you can.I would welcome a third and final instalment. There is no end to the possibilities that await but I would be happy to see a few more action legends pulling merc or villain duty.E.g. Danny Trejo, Michael Biehn, Thomas Jane, Lance Henriksen, Michael Jai White... just sayin'...",8,3,5,22 December 2012
Fury," Bleak and Gutsy Exploitation
","So I bought Fury on DVD to catch up on my David Ayer leading up to Suicide Squad. I'm in two minds about him so far. The jury may still be out because of his box office gambling habits. In essence I'd describe him as a visually effective renaissance director with a habit of cutting corners! Luckily with Fury that mostly works in its favour, but comparing it to Saving Private Ryan because it's bleak and wintery was a bad sales pitch. If anything, Fury is the younger brother of Enemy at the Gates and its daddy Iron Cross, despite it not being based around Russia. It has that undeniable element of exploitation to it that I feel makes up for everything Inglorious Basterds wasn't.Fury's strength is in the overwhelming theme of seeking an end or seeking salvation where there is none to be found and it paints a picture of the parts of WWII that have been so rarely depicted. The Yanks are animals in this movie and they are aware of just how desperate the situation is getting to be.Enter Logan Lerman's army typist Norman Ellison who is jettisoned to the war effort during the occupation of Nazi Germany and is he in over his head or what?! You really need to see the non-stop gore to get the drift...The crew of Fury, the titular sherman tank, are way beyond the douchiest people you could ever know, because the war has destroyed their souls and they know in their hearts that the chances of making it home are impossible, so when the film focuses on the importance of Ellison learning how to keep his crew alive in the slimmest odds.Sent on a slew of what can only be described as suicide missions, Fury leads the battallion's only remaining tanks into battle only for them to start falling one by one and leading to an inevitable battle to the death against Tiger tanks and a full SS regiment.Visually Fury mostly hits the spot but then some action scenes seemed a little more than rushed and not in the name of an overall sharp editing style. It just cuts corners here and there like I expect and where some scenes build great suspense felt it had greater potential.In regards to character, the ensemble cast nails it... mostly! Half the time I couldn't penetrate the impossible accents they were putting on. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal were especially difficult but still I got the basics.The action and violence are also pure exploitation but heaped on top of the rising tension as we realise the theme of the movie - one that is ultimately the fear of death and having to face up to the consequences of one's actions - the resulting product is a horror movie based in the Second World War and that suits me down to the ground.Or, you know; it's Jaws but with tanks instead of boats and SS Waffen instead of sharks!",8,5,10,4 June 2015
Dawn of the Dead," 28 Dawns Later???
","I've not been fair with Zack Snyder's remake of George A. Romero's epic horror film over the years, simply because even though I initially loved it enough at the cinema to see it twice, the original was 'the original' and best.I cannot deny that the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake was, and still is, possibly the best zombie film since the original (actually I'm a huge fan of Day), even though it made some daft mistakes.'Dawn of the Dead' (2004) did for the ailing American horror movie what '28 Days Later' did for the then recently revived British horror movie and Snyder may have been late but he was right on the coat-tails of Alex Garland and Danny Boyle's reinventing of the classic zombie apocalypse. Running zombies are just silly outside of the Left 4 Dead game series, in my opinion.As hot new property cutting his teeth on the movie industry, Snyder's approach was to provide entertainment that both airheads and connoisseurs could agree on and the standard was simply to be innovative. In this movie, the times have changed, as have the rules and the people that abide by them. And so has most of Romero's original script, for that matter, re-written by none other than James Gunn, who at least has a wicked sense of humour.As opposed to the original, this zombie apocalypse is more explosive in its delivery and yet there is no fighting to liberate the mall our characters stumble across. In fact, unlike the original, this version hardly fancies the idea of fighting a bunch of runner zombies until they absolutely have to and when they do, it's fleeting.Saying that, Snyder's use of realism is the first element to set itself apart from the original, as is his favouritism of pace over suspense. Whereas in the original there were four characters finding their own way to overcome the threats of a world suddenly invaded by the flesh-eating dead, this version sees a collective of irritating modern day American civilians forced to cope with each other as their greatest threat behind locked doors becomes the stereotypes they must overcome.My personal favourites are Ving Rhames, Michael Kelly and Jake Weber. The rest are pretty redundant most of the time, which makes me wonder why they needed more than the original four. But then Tucker, the truck driver, is great because he's useless.The choice in actors does make for a pretty good drama with some good comedy moments, though, and also some pretty good action scenes. The characters range from genuine hard-cases and big talkers to scared or stupid air-polluters. I was left cold by some of the effects and zombie prosthetic make-up and gore. The brain exploding gun shots, though sparing, were amazing. But the looks of the zombies was a little too picture perfect to come across as grisly or frightening and in this film, they don't eat people, they just bite and scramble and clamber around like monkeys. That's my only problem. 28 Days Later is not a zombie film, so why can zombies run and climb and why do they just bite you and that's it? It takes away the visceral horror of the zombie hordes if they're not even going to eat you. Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' is the complete opposite of George Romero's original, but still manages to entertain greatly as a standalone film. And in a way, I suppose I'm glad that Snyder didn't out-do the original because he was capable even then!",Null,1,2,16 October 2011
Argo," Should be retitled 'Arkin!'
","As an equal opportunities film viewer (and one that basically has to watch loads to review them for a magazine) I watched Argo out of intrigue for how far Ben Affleck had come since the last hundred times he was either laughed or screamed out of a theatre or awards ceremony.The man has lived a varied and colourful life, from his beginnings under Richard Linklater and Kevin Smith, to his creative partnership with Matt Damon and then... Daredevil...People slag off Arnie for his Austrian accent. People slag off Steven Seagal because... well it's Steven Seagal... people slag off Kirsten Stewart because she can't act and she's additionally miserable.Me, I've slagged off Ben Affleck because in the two decades he's been making the rounds, he's had a grande total of about three different hairstyles AND the most used one, the one he wears in films where he's a douche trying to be popular - The Bouffant - is usually when he is at his most unlikeable.So, Argo! He plays a CIA agent in the early 80's that looks like the guy that tries to sell out John McClaine in Die Hard only to have his brains blown out into a glass of Coca-Cola AND the guy put a large dose of his creativity, political knowledge and creative power into a factual docu-drama about how the CIA extracted hidden US citizens from Iran after the invasion of their US Embassy.One thing I really appreciate other than a drama that catches the emotion and atmosphere of a pretty devastating moment in history is one that looks and feels like the era it was set in and Argo successfully delivers on that level, taking me back to some classic cinema.Argo, the title of the film, lends itself from the name of the fictional movie production devised by the CIA and cheap and cheerful movie producer Lester Siegel (played by Alan Arkin) in order to legally and safely get into Iran and extract the US citizens with false IDs before they are captured and executed.I really liked Argo and that came down to Affleck's untypically laid back and sombre performance, along with strong supports from favourites John Goodman and Bryan Cranston. But as I say, not to discredit the good work on behalf of all involved, it is Alan Arkin - the old rogue that brought us Catch 22 - that really steals the show AND carries it for much of the film.Aside from some breathtaking suspenseful moments, I only have two/three problems with this movie. One and two, it's a bit of a mixed bag that doesn't always stay on track and without some pretty unnecessary scenes, it could have been half an hour shorter.My only other problem is that I didn't give a flying hoot about the US citizens hidden away in Iran. Clea Duvall, Tate Donovan and Scoot McNairy are three actors I can safely say have never done anything for me, with exception to McNairy's turn in this year's Killing Them Softly (which only worked because you're not supposed to like him).I feel that this film is praised more for the fact that it deals with a past political situation that is relevant today more than ever after 911 and otherwise it wouldn't have had such critical acclaim.And as well-made as I can accept this film is, it's worth it for the acting alone, but maybe now Ben Affleck will stop trying to seek critical acclaim and just get on with making movies that won't make him look like a bushy headed yuppie.Thumbs up, overall, Affleck. But without Arkin, this film wouldn't have been enjoyable at all!",8,0,2,27 July 2013
Ted," Finally, a real kids film for adults!
","First of all let me state that I'm voting Ted a 9 out of 10 not simply because I think it's a great film, but because how often can you seriously rate a comedy? It deserves the 9 for how well planned and produced it is before the content steals the show.Seth Macfarlane, creator, writer, director and voice-over artist of such animated shows as 'Family Guy' 'The Cleveland Show' and 'American Dad' proves in his feature movie debut that, not only does his own unique and hilarious comedy sketch brand of childish comedy make a successful transfer from cartoon to reality - low and behold, the man can tell a story and make it stand apart from the crowd.Ted is the perfect mix of all the things a decent comedy should contain and whereas it might occasionally rely on offensive over the top comedy and stereotyping, even if you've never really been a regular to the cartoon series' he produces you still appreciate it because just when you think it couldn't be any more far fetched, it weighs down like an anchor and grounds itself in reality.It's a stoner comedy, a childish fantasy of epic proportions and dare I say it; its reliance on the odd sexist and racist observations make for the type of uncomfortable laughter you can actually appreciate. Often more suggestive than 'balls out' offensive, it relies on your sick humour rather than insists that you learn to appreciate it.Ted also boasts a great cast aside from Wahlberg and Kunis. Patrick Warburton (Family Guy's Joe Swanson) is hilarious as Guy. Patrick Stewart narrates and Ryan Reynolds provides some of his greatest acting EVER! Sam J. Jones' cameo as himself is off the wall and back to the character of Ted himself, MacFarlane has me in stitches so often.Overall, Ted ought to be a classic and I think it will stand the test of time providing it doesn't rely on a sequel!",9,1,5,27 July 2013
Suicide Squad," Still better than Fant4stic lol
","In five or ten years the next generation will no doubt appreciate this much more than we did, although I'm not dismissing it. Suicide Squad has plenty enjoyable qualities and enough to keep your attention. It's not a terrible film as long as you're not a film connoisseur or a comic book fan. For the most part it enjoys a superb production, albeit inconsistent at times. Saying that, I've never met a fan of the source material; not even over the great expanse of the Internet!A rarity these days is that I managed to watch the movie from beginning to end, whilst paying attention. Saying that, I've done the same with Punisher War Zone and Freddy Got Fingered. I have a high threshold for good trash. I have a low threshold for vapid, soulless trash. They made some pretty uninteresting characters work for the screen, but desperately diminished others, such as Harley Quinn in regard to her notorious qualities and back story; no doubt to handle the audience with kid gloves.Will Smith's character is possibly the strongest in the whole film, even though his Deadshot is also light on authenticity. But he works at it while the likes of Killer Croc just snarls and skulks and Katana just serves as a token Asian with a fancy sword.Jay Hernandez's El Diablo is the underdog for me in terms of redemption and likability and Cara Delavigne does a great job switching character, but is given little else to do other than look impressive. Joel Kinnaman is wooden at times, as always, but has come a long way.But Jared Leto's Joker? I went in without expectation. I came out with 'Feminist Trans 4Chan Toad doing a Scarface impression whilst sounding very much like Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow after dental surgery...' He is horrendous but girls will like him anyway, because, 'Jared Leto!'Scott Eastwood and Adam Beach are also massively wasted, and I'd feel sorry for Jai Courtenay, but he chose to audition for a character called Captain Boomerang so exactly what was he expecting to have to work with? Dumb dialogue? Poor humour and action? Check!Otherwise it's full of spectacle that looks good for the most part and it creates a tone I'd expect of a movie based around comic villains, minus the romanticised Joker/Harley thread which I feel was the weakest link. But if this was the version the studio wanted me to see, I want to see Ayer's Director's Cut.Damn it, DC, have some faith in your audience. I'm a Marvel fan and I'm still rooting for you!",6,0,1,21 October 2016
The Thing," The skeleton crew of an Antarctic base are terrorised by an unearthed alien life-form!
","Very few horror films remain locked under cult favourite status while at the same time being hailed by critics and widespread audiences as possibly the greatest horror film of all time.While it has been pointed out by movie legends such as George Romero and Stephen King that people love being scared by a good horror movie, it is not specifically the case with majority audiences. Films such as The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween may be classed as the best of all time, they have also proved too much for the mainstream, who like their horror slightly more psychological, less physical and most often promising a happy ending.This may explain why master filmmaker John Carpenter's 1982 powerhouse science-fiction horror 'The Thing' did so poorly at the cinema box office, besides the unfortunate fact that the darling of Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, had released E.T: The Extra Terrestrial at the same time.The film is cold, dark, uncompromising, you can cut the paranoid and petrified atmosphere with a knife, but you'd do better to incinerate it with a flamethrower just to feel that little bit safer before you go to bed. There are no warm and endearing characters to care for, every moment this mysterious but absurdly terrifying Thing from another world strikes, you are left with goosebumps, your imagination running scared and out of control and in the end... have you made up your mind how the end will come? An American Scientific Research base isolated in the Antarctic finds itself witness to an incident where the members of a not too distant Norwegian base have seemingly gone mad. The Norwegians are killed in regrettable circumstances. leaving no answers as to their actions leaving chronically drunk and depressed helicopter pilot MacReady with no choice but to fly a couple of the concerned scientists over to the Norwegian base where they discover a horrific aftermath of grisly death and destruction. The remains of a mutated and seemingly inhuman corpse is found within the cinders of a burned out bonfire and very quickly the tone is set and the scientists' reality turned upside down.Aliens are amongst us! Very quickly, shock and disgust turn to fear, fear gives birth to anger and paranoia sets in deep as the remaining life-form next targets the American base and secretly multiplies within their ranks in the hopes of outnumbering the remaining humans before it is discovered and destroyed.Hopes of containing the alien life-form, before it is discovered that it is not only an intelligent life-form but also a very contagious one, fade very quickly as the whiskey and sleep deprived R.J. MacReady - played with literal ice cold awesomeness by the one and only Kurt Russell - and the few men he feels he can trust begin to fall apart under the strain of fear and isolation, setting themselves apart from those they feel will only lessen their chances of survival.As time grows short and the numbers die off, it becomes clear that nobody can be trusted and the only way of stopping this nightmare is by effectively ending their very own chances of survival.Carpenter writes possibly his best ever script, the scenes setting the way for a nightmarish Cold War paranoia tale where the fate of the world could very well be put at risk by the fears of a handful of men. There is nowhere to run and hide. Outside, Antarctic Winter is setting in and deadly sub-zero temperatures make it impossible to escape. Where safety in numbers ought to make a man feel safe, the danger is multiplied and to sit alone in the dark is practically suicide. The dog pound is a slaughterhouse, the medical bay is contaminated, people are losing their minds and cabin fever is setting in and the Thing never sleeps...An eerie theme by musical genius Ennio Morricone sets the tone; dark, depressed, suspenseful and doom-inspired. Master of animatronic special-effects Rick Bottin provides the most ghastly practical horrors ever devoted to film and a craftily untypical and notably mature ensemble cast (Kurt Russell, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Thomas G. Waites and Wilford Brimley) provide a sense of reality that no kid that wants to make yet another slasher/zombie flick could ever hope to.If you haven't seen this film before and for some reason you have an intolerance to anything outside of CGI, pop music soundtracks, laugh a minute characters and damsels in distress in any shape or form then I dare you to see what a real horror film is and watch this. Call it an education because there is not a director out there who will ever rival John Carpenter or make a film as cold and creepy as The Thing!",Null,4,5,5 October 2011
Cross of Iron," Outside The Box
","One of the all-time classics of western cinema, Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs, Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid) proved a huge feat of filmmaking strength with this gruelling and sadistic wartime drama pitting Nazi Germany against Russia on the Eastern Front! No stranger to controversy, Peckinpah masterfully handled both beasts on the frontline while coaxing an almost Shakespearean feel out of the story pitting not only army versus army but a Captain against his Lieutenant.The hard-nosed but effective Lt. Steiner (James Coburn), commands a loyal unit of rogues against a marauding enemy as Germany inevitably fails to occupy the East. He not only has the respect and friendship of the men he fights with, but even the Colonel (James Mason) believes that his kind may be Germany's only hope.His new commanding officer, Captain Stransky (Maximillian Schell) however - a highly educated and proud officer with the kind of superiority complex that one could associate only with a Nazi officer - quickly puts the situation further at odds with his dislike of Steiner.As the barrage of infantry and artillery against the German line intensifies and costs more than any man is able to take, their rivalry comes to a head through an epic war in every sense.Cross of Iron is first and foremost very gory and one of the first true war movies of its kind to swap paintball grade bullet wounds for explosive exit wounds and authentic wartime injuries, to the point where it could almost be considered Grindhouse; considering its production values.Coburn takes the classic antihero archetype beyond Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin, giving us a dirtier, more damaged frontman than had been seen before (and for some time after). Whereas Schell is deliberately cold, proper and clean cut as the kind of German we really love to hate. But he too goes beyond the stereotypical.The support cast is brilliant and not just James Mason and David Warner as one would expect. Cross of Iron sports actual Germans playing Germans and are committed to creating stand-out characters that we do grow attached to.What we end up with may be somewhat expected, but there is plenty you won't see coming and Cross of Iron sports anti-war messages of a different nature to that of what you may be used to. In fact, despite it's dated production values, it's totally on target.Cross of Iron is one of the essentials of war film!",9,1,2,11 June 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," To be with the girl of his dreams, shy and insecure bass guitarist Scott Pilgrim must defeat her seven evil ex boyfriends!
","The writer and director of classic television series 'Spaced' and comedy features 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Hot Fuzz' and 'Paul', Edgar Wright, has come a long way before making what is undeniably his first 100% original feature film.I'm a fickle creature these days when it comes to mainstream film. It worries me when a film gets so much hype in America because so many average films get made out to be the biggest, bestest thing ever and then I regret parting with the remains of my own hard earned minimum-wage funding because I found it contrived, unsurprising and bland. So I usually wait a year or two, waiting for the noise to die down and then I watch it without preconceptions of what it's supposed to be.'Scott Pilgrim...' is a curious creation. It's more original than anything I've seen come from across the Atlantic in a long time, yet as is typical of Wright, he immerses his vision in modern pop culture and the clichés that come with it, only more so than he's ever done before. The film is chock full of classic references though so it will keep mum and dad happy.For those that don't know by now, Edgar Wright is English, yet this film is so American, I now understand why so many Edgar Wright fans were dismayed. But then so many more raved about it and I'm more inclined towards the latter since I do love American film when it's original.'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is a confident and clever comedy boasting both conventional comedy perfected to a tee and unconventional and original comedy and storytelling. It's a clash of reality and fantasy based in the life of a shy, inexperienced and somewhat insecure bass guitarist only the rules of reality outside of the rules of conventional human drama are changed to that of side-scrolling and beat-em-up video games.Suburban Toronto, Canada based Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year old seeing a potential psychotic stalker Chinese schoolgirl by the name of Knives Chau, without knowing exactly why, when he happens upon the girl of his dreams. Literally; he meets a girl in real life that he recognises from a dream he had the night before. Infatuated with her to the point of stalking her, the somehow legendary Ramona Flowers agrees to date Scott and they quickly warm to each other but then he finds out why so many of his friends know her name.Scott Pilgrim is soon forced to fight for Ramona Flowers' honour when one by one, her seven super-powered evil exes challenge him to a duel and only if he defeats them all will he get to keep dating the literal girl of his dreams. The story gradually takes on a concept all too familiar with fans of classic games such as Tekken, Street Fighter, Rock Band and even Super Mario as Pilgrim nears closer to his destiny but the strain of such new-found popularity and infamy by the side of his new girlfriend - especially since he hasn't officially dumped Knives for her - begins to put distance between the couple.My greatest joy upon watching this film for the first time was its spontaneity and unpredictability. Just as soon as you think you're in the familiar territory of the situational American (I know the film's Canadian-based, just shut up) teen rom-com, you're proved wrong by some absurdly funny moments that get out of control, much to the viewer's by then deliriously tickled delight.The seven evil exes are a fantastic group of characters, especially the cocky but dim action movie star played by Chris Evans and the spiritually superpowered egotistical vegan bass player played by ex-Superman Brandon Routh.Not only that but there are some awesome cameo scenes provided by the likes of Thomas Jane and Clifton Gonzales. But the best support character has to be Scott's best/worst friend played by Kieran Culkin (yes, brother of Macauley), whose comedic delivery is just unexpectedly amazing.Michael Cera is on top form as a lead actor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead just oozes character like so few young actresses, let alone the has-beens that refuse to leave Hollywood. And she still manages to be hot with the most bizarre hairstyle I've ever seen on a woman. How she does it is anyone's guess.I'm pretty sure that Edgar Wright will remain a comedy-drama writer and director in future but I'll regardless state in confidence that he'll be up there with the likes of Zack Snyder in a few years time if he continues to show the world just how lazy the majority of A-List producers and directors have truly become.",9,1,4,20 January 2012
Drive," Driven by creative brilliance!!!
","Two years after this movie is released, I sit down to watch it, for the first time, in the early evening with the false impression that I'm watching a kind of remake of Walter Hill's late-seventies cult classic 'The Driver'.Now that I know it's based on a 2005 novel, I can safely say that it's more a most unabashed tribute, bearing similarities in characters and filmmaking style. Nicholas Winding-Refn, you have done a fantastic job, not just in bringing a classic to a new audience, but by also making one of the most quality thrillers I have seen.This is also the first Ryan Gosling film I have been able to appreciate and good god, does he deliver. It's not just that he had the element of surprise over me, Gosling and Winding-Refn seem to have a legendary working relationship in the making. Film and actor direction are a tight unit in Drive and a testament to conveyance of character psychology.Drive is the story of a Hollywood stunt driver and garage mechanic by day and a getaway driver for hire by night. The mysterious and somewhat lonely 'Driver' finds himself enchanted by the arrival of a mother and young son until their husband/father gets out of jail and brings trouble with him.Throw in a shaky deal by Driver's manager (Bryan Cranston) and the local mob bosses (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman) and a robbery set up with disastrous consequences, and Driver is thrust into a deadly face-off with the LA mob, in his efforts to protect the young family he has become so attached to.What's brilliant about Drive is how it's sold to the audience. It's a neat, colourful and musical package that could easily come off as a Grand Theft Auto movie based in the 80's and yet we do not expect the level of thrills, drama, quality action, violent extremity and sheer psychotic shocks.If you're one for a good psychological thriller cleverly sugar-coated in pretty pink romance, and you're most likely to be delighted by how demented a movie can become, see this! It easily could be Walter Hill, but it could also be Alfred Hitchcock also. The support cast is brilliant, and combined with the retro style and comic book storytelling, all of these things work to create a movie you feel like you've seen before even though you're likely to be shocked and surprised.We really could do with more of this, and with a budget of $15,000,000, its formula really does threaten to kerb stomp the poor competition of recent blockbusters.Thank you!",9,2,7,10 August 2013
Event Horizon," This is Techno Horror!
","Event Horizon is a perfect ensemble collaboration of talent, which takes the basic elements of separate genre legends such as Aliens and The Shining. Essentially it's a clash of religion and science and I suppose what might have happened had they merged Aliens with The Shining.Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil) and writer Philip Eisner (The Mutant Chronicles) made their finest ever film with Event Horizon, the story of a rescue and salvage ship crew employed by Dr Weir, the first scientist to create inter-dimensional space travel, whose titular spaceship sent out a distress call before disappearing into oblivion.The ship has returned and is floating dead in space just outside of Jupiter's atmosphere, its crew has vanished. Captain Miller (Lawrence Fishburne) and his crew, board the ship only to discover the remains of the doomed Event Horizon's crew and to begin salvaging disturbing evidence that the ship - which itself begins to show signs of life - may have traveled to someplace beyond just another dimension.Firstly, I was surprised over time to learn of the writer and director's separate careers. According to IMDb, Philip Eisner hasn't worked since The Mutant Chronicles and I'm not surprised. It was awful. I only watched it because I generally like Thomas Jane's films and it seemed like a good watch just by the trailer.The only other film I really liked from Anderson meanwhile was Death Race. I wish he'd just let Resident Evil die and not come back like the retarded zombies it's all about. Bullet to the head and bye-bye, baby!What makes their first effort work here is the minimalist attitude towards the horror element and the amount of work put into the element of suspense and character building. Otherwise it's down to the clean and safely used CGI and set-pieces and overall, the actors.Lawrence Fishburne who hadn't made a great film up until then since King of New York was a great choice for Captain Miller. He assumes control with ease and just gets the job done like every plain and ordinary working man's boss does, rather than try to shine.Sam Neill as Dr Weir takes the reins of the troubled genius like a true theatre legend, showing why he has been one of the industry's consistently best actors since his re-emergence as a mature actor in psycho thriller Dead Calm. Here he really busts out the dramatic and hams it up to good effect when necessary, making him very much the main event, which I suppose he was meant to be.The backing cast also consisted of some very admirable talent including fellow Brits Joely Richardson as the cold hearted and sensible Ripley-alike second in command, Jason Isaacs as the ship's medic and psychologist and genre legend Sean Pertwee as the typically English grease monkey mechanic. The Yanks gave us legend Kathleen Quinlan as the resident med tech and Richard T. Jones and Jack Noseworthy as the salvage crew. Far from retiring to their characters' stereotypes, the actors play on it well but still develop a good rapport with each other.As I remember one of the most impressive and surprising appearances was of the techno-punk band The Prodigy, who supplied the disturbed twisted metal connoting soundtrack. This served well in the film's overall theme and the filler tracks are suspenseful and heavily suggesting of just how crazy the film gets as it progresses.Since Event Horizon there have been a number of similar themed runaway successes from mainstream and B-Movies alike but rather than giving the opinion that Event Horizon had followed on where genre creator Alien had given it the inspiration, Event has managed to create a genre of its own. If you haven't seen it and you have a budding horror and sci-fi classics DVD collection, this needs to be a part of it!",8,2,3,6 April 2012
Thor," The God of Thunder (and Rock n Roll)!
","As a reader of comic books, I am impressed with this instalment in the Marvel Universe's current run of films over most others. A while back, I said that DC's Green Lantern was possibly the best superhero film since Christopher Reeve stepped into Superman's boots over 30 years ago. Sorry folks, you're good but you're not the best. Being a fan of Marvel's main events when it comes to comics, story arcs such as Civil War, Dark Reign and Fear Itself prove Thor to be one of the company's most bankable frontmen in comics. Not like he came across as Hulk's best friend in the Lou Ferrigno days. And now they have made him one of the most successful cross-overs in recent years with this fantastical and heavyweight slice of entertainment.The arrogant, cocky, fearsome warrior Thor is one of two sons belonging to Asgaard's great king Odin. He is much loved and respected amongst his family, friends and his father's people. Growing up being told stories of their realm's war with the ice giants, Thor believes that his greatness as potential future king will lay in his conquest of the ice giants once again.As Thor is about to become king, the ice giants manage to breach the security of Asgard and Thor goes against his father's advice in seeking them out and beginning a war where his father left off. Odin intervenes to keep the peace, just in time...As a result, Thor is exiled to earth and removed of his powers, where he discovers that life is not so simple. Seeking the warhammer Mjolnir, to regain his powers, Thor finds himself up against SHIELD, the national security bureau (that will one day be responsible for the assembly of the Avengers) and must count on the help of scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig.But what he has yet to learn is that while he begins to grow fond of life on earth, treachery is abound as his jealous brother Loki is appointed king in the wake of his father's unexpected sudden illness. Loki has also made a deal with the ice giants upon discovering a certain 'home truth' as to his own origin.Discovering that all is not right, Thor's friends 'The Warriors Three' and lady warrior Sif commit treason in seeking Thor before Loki brings about his demise.Thor is an enjoyable adventure featuring a great cast, a great director, plenty of laugh aloud humour and boasting great visual effects that go beyond the expected death and destruction. It is literally an adventure of cosmic proportions that could stand alone without the Avengers.Chris Hemsworth rocks the viking look and yet enjoys making fun of himself in the role of the god. It is refreshingly well executed as well when he begins to discover that Earth is not a place to be so cocky and arrogant.Natalie Portman was also a surprise, switching off the heavy acting and seemingly just enjoying herself in a role that required comedy and flirtation and the same goes for Stellan Skarsgaard, who has always had a reputation for playing either dangerous sociopaths, stuck up snobs or dangerously stuck up sociopaths.The Warriors Three were a totally necessary addition and I think Ray Stevenson was so spot on with his portrayal of the jolly but gluttonous Volstag.Tom Hiddleston was also great as Loki, despite my reservations for such a slight and straight-faced actor to play a viking god. He really can deliver the goods and his calm exterior is not to be believed for too long - what can I say about Anthony Hopkins that you don't yet know? He rocks the god king armour! A well executed action adventure of depth, humour and compassion that takes me back to the days when fantasy/sword and sorcery/myth-based movies ruled. It even reminded me of classic Spielberg at times. I look forward to the sequel but I'm a little peeved that they haven't brought back Brannagh.",8,1,3,25 December 2012
Defiance," A Different Breed of War Film
","What with all the stories told from every faction of WWII and how everybody trounced those pesky Nazi Germans, things can get a bit formulaic! Defiance is a war era drama that takes a different stance, in fact it takes two; standing with one foot in the campgrounds of the Russian Partisans and the other in the camps of the Jews who dared to escape into the woods of Belorussia and Poland to survive the Holocaust.It sports some finely crafted drama, though not perfect. It just does the best with what it has and thankfully it has authenticity and great acting on its side, despite some shortcomings and incidences of overstepping the mark.Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber play the two older brothers of a slain Jewish Belorussian family who flee with their younger siblings into the woods, chased not only by Nazis but the police forces of their own communities who have sided with the enemy.One brother goes on to lead the growing number of escaping Jews while the other - ostracised after rising tensions - joins the Partisans.The story is sometimes sporadic in its delivery of drama and incidence, meaning that one theme is sometimes forgotten for the sake of a bit of action. Don't get me wrong, some of the action is superbly done, but I felt that there were some rushed scenes.While all very well executed, I feel that Defiance suffered an occasional conflict in direction and style, but most viewers might not even notice this.Craig and Schreiber's Russian is spot on and at times even seems playfully competitive, which adds much needed chemistry to such an ambitious tale of family. Jamie Bell is also on form.Overall a fine effort, even though I felt it might actually have had more impact were it half an hour shorter.",7,1,2,11 June 2016
Platoon," A young man volunteering for Vietnam witnesses his fellow troops being corrupted by inner conflict!
","In my eyes the best film Oliver Stone ever made, Platoon mirrors his own experiences as a GI serving time in Vietnam.The story is told from the point of view of runt Chris Taylor, an educated boy who volunteers to serve in the war, who discovers that patrolling the jungles around Cambodia not only drastically raises the mortality rate, it renders him completely worthless in the eyes of those who've served any amount of time longer than he has.Quickly outliving his fellow runts, Taylor sees a line in the sand drawn between the laid back and sympathetic Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe in a very emotionally memorable role) and his pot smoking troops and the hard-edged Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger in an equally powerful but darker role) and his beer and whiskey drinking ass-kickers. He immediately chooses to side with Elias' squad, just wanting to make it through the war with his mind in tact but that hope doesn't last so long as the deeper into the jungle they roam, and the more horrors they witness, the powers that be and their backers become corrupted by hatred towards the Vietnamese and one another.Soon enough, the conflict rages out of control and when the enemy launches a massive offensive, the platoon is barely able to fight their way out after communication between them has completely broken down.Platoon boasts possibly the largest number of relatively fresh stars launched into movie stardom and legend status for any film in history although there were some familiar faces that had featured in successful titles some years before such as Keith David (The Thing) and Tom Berenger (Dogs of War). Other names include Charlie Sheen (Two And A Half Men), Forest Whittaker (Phenomenon), Tony Todd (Candyman), Kevin Dillon (Entourage), John C. McGinley (Scrubs), Johnny Depp (who???) and the list goes on.'Platoon' boasts a massive multi-strand narrative telling not only the story of the war and the overbearing in-fighting between Elias and Barnes, but also the individual stories of soldiers destined to either go home or just fill another black rubber bag. It's touching even to see someone we don't like very much spouting obscenities like a broken record player one moment and then their bloody lifeless body being thrown on the pile the next moment and that imagery sums up the war for so many people; kids just working themselves into bad habits, watching their best friends die and knowing deep down that they are going to die too. It makes every tiny little indiscretion worth fighting for and that's why they all end up jumping at each others' throats, acting more like a lynch-mob than a platoon.It also boasts the most organic scenery ever used in a film of its kind and, of course, the now legendary 'Adagio For Strings' theme by Samuel Barber, which was made so memorable in its many scenes imprinted on the impressionable human mind.The perfect mix of drama and action, comedy and tragedy, feel-good factor and depression any war film could hope for, Platoon reaches a conclusion that not only hits you like a bullet between the eyes, it leaves you wondering what happened to all those left behind, the ones that survived up until the final credits!",9,1,2,8 October 2011
Prometheus," Ignore the haters! New age in sci-fi horror, same old atmospheric terror!
","First and foremost, when you intend to see Prometheus, what do you expect? This is a prequel to the greatest science fiction horror franchise of all time; picked up by its original writers, producers and director and given a new spin to include the new generations. And if something is going to be continued/rebooted then why not at the hands of the people that gave it you to begin with? Prometheus is an origin tale that deals with the discovery of the alien Engineers that created the Xenomorph (the creatures of the Aliens movies) and the horror that naturally ensues. Simple? No, it is much more than that. In true Ridley Scott fashion, everything is richly multi-layered, the film has an intelligent culture all of its own, it has a broad multi-narrative provided by a vast array of characters and despite the fact that the prequel is now way more advanced than the sequel in terms of technology inside and outside of this fictional universe, it has the exact same atmosphere I remember feeling while watching Alien as a kid.Prometheus cleverly puts the more famous character actors in the background and gives prime time to the lesser familiar faces (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) in order to establish the story and then the brutal and sometimes gutwrenching horror.But what it also does most cleverly is take its sweet ol' time getting to the meat beneath the surface. The story telling is fantastic, the setting is dark and heavy despite there being a lot of daylight and the horror delivers a whole lot more than I expected. But you need to know that, as Ridley Scott is a master of suspense, this means that the stuff you want to see this film for does not come full on, yet escalates just slowly enough at times to make your skin crawl.By the end of Prometheus, if you are not satisfied that you have just seen a true first class sci-fi horror worthy of the original, you've just joined the growing legions of the 'nothing-is-ever-good-enough-for-me' undead! Sci-fi, horror, huge story, subtexts, sub-plots and huge lashings of originality; what's not to like?",10,9,22,15 March 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Gotham City and an aged, injured and tormented Bruce Wayne face their final reckoning
","Despite IMDb labelling 10 out of 10 as excellent, I've always rated excellent films a 9 just because I know that once in a while there will be that one film that blows them all away. So does that mean I should be able to rate this film 11? The latest Batman films have all been accepted widely, not just as the great action films that they are, nor as the brooding, darkly dramatic features that they have striven to be, but as a testament to the hard work Nolan, his crew and cast have given to these films, they are the films each and every one of us wanted our own favourite comic book movies to resemble.So when 'The Dark Knight Rises' was released, it should have been obvious to the naysayers and premature critics worldwide that the final instalment would at least deliver the mother of all Batman movies if it did not simply silence those that wanted it to fail. And in the end, '...Rises' both silenced the critics and created the Batman movie to end all Batman movies, this much is true.Based 8 years after the previous sequel, the city of Gotham has come to rest. All the most dangerous criminals are safely locked away and it seems that the city is peaceful. But beneath the surface, Commissioner Gordon struggles to live with the lies that sent the Batman into exile for the murder of Harvey Dent aka Two-Face.He is not alone in his turmoil either, a broken and tormented Bruce Wayne has become reclusive and has given up on his life after his final battle and the resulting loss of the love of his life, Rachel Dawes. Not even Alfred can seem to bring him out of his shell and this has proved quite the opportunity for some.So when an encounter with a certain cat-burglar and the arrival of mysterious terrorist mercenary Bane threatens the city, he puts himself through rehabilitation, steps back into the battle suit and goes out to face off against the monster, only to discover not only that he has far more enemies than he anticipated, but that he is no match for this superpowered villain.As Batman lies broken and defeated in an unreachable dark place, who will save Gotham from this new tyranny which threatens to obliterate everything Wayne once fought to protect? As masterfully as Nolan constructs the establishing scenes and executes key moments in the final Dark Knight instalment, he concocts a most daring and brilliant plot not only to redeem the Batman and those he trusts most, but to redeem the soul of Bruce Wayne, a man of few choices; to either let his dark past destroy him or to lay his memories to rest and choose to go on with his life! Thanks to the negative feedback on the film long before its release, I couldn't help but be apprehensive for the final part of the trilogy, even though deep down I was confident. Having followed the comic book history of Batman, I was well aware that Nolan was one of very few director/producers to do things very differently while defining the character in all honesty.It was the character Bane that I was worried about, and Catwoman, but here they are portrayed so cleverly and either with menace or with great irony, but both of them with respect and discipline. Although I couldn't help but hear Bane as Patrick Stewart might have sounded as Darth Vader, you can't take that so seriously anyway. Tom Hardy is massive, brutal and cold blooded as the disgraced 'League of Shadows' veteran, yet his character is also intelligent, secretly compassionate and yet he is something of a chess-piece. This, I enjoyed figuring out for myself, the kind of thing you can't often discuss with your friends.Also I was apprehensive of the film being majorly based in daylight when the Batman's modus operandi is within the shadows of night but overall it would have removed us from the harsh light of day and the reality that this was essentially a siege situation that the city was under.But finally, bless you Christopher Nolan, for Blake and for the massive finale. I got a hint of 'Inception', how cunning it was, and although it wasn't exactly a cliffhanger, since this one was final you have created an original trilogy in your own right and one that will go on to have its own mythology.Hopefully there will be no more Batman movies from other producers. Especially since there will never be another Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Christian Bale or Gary Oldman.What a way to lay a legend to rest!",10,5,11,22 December 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Very Flawed But Highly Underrated
","The movie I anticipated highly and over the already formulated and tired Marvel factory, I sadly never thought I'd have the patience to watch Batman V Superman a second time!Name your own reasons, but: -Jesse Eisenberg's terrible Lex Luthor. -That silly Flash post-dream sequence, which should have led to more. -A bloated and unnecessary run time of two and a half hours featuring scenes the film didn't need. -Awful dialogue unfitting of key characters. -Key characters who don't even seem to fit in. -Zack Snyder's Michael Bay-esque love of pointless slow motion. -Scenes with potential completely wasted (Robin's vandalised armour). -Hans Zimmer's uninspired soundtrack and Junkie XL's seeming absence.You'd almost think Snyder was trying to mimic Joss Whedon!But rather than throw my comics out of the pram, I felt that there was just too much to take on board in one sitting, as has always been the case with Snyder. Despite the darkness and pessimism - Batman now having no qualms about putting gun toting henchmen out of his misery, and Superman using the fact that he killed Zod to offer fair warning - I see where Snyder is going and I'm alright with it.Justice League is set to go up against world-destroying enemies. Their own personal enemies have all been murderous psychopaths, too, so maybe it's time to get real and to put more of a permanent solution to saving the world. Why the hell not?And it's pretty clear at this point that as the meta-humans rise to the occasion, many key characters are set to fall by the wayside.You also may not agree with deconstructing main characters, but this is the age we live in where everyone's a critic. BVS's pessimism teaches this lesson. These are dangerous times and all we can do is turn on each other through anger and helplessness; when our best is not good enough by the standards of others.BVS's strongest points therefore are its analogies of present day terrorism, social justice and political correctness putting power into the wrong hands; and then the sheer effort put into action, brawling and some really tasty effects to get your teeth into.Batman/Bruce Wayne rightly carries most of it until even he realises how out of his depth he really is, despite being able to go toe to toe with the Son of Krypton. And even though he's pretty helpless himself in some scenes, this serves to show the true power of meta-humans and monsters.Again, the fight scenes are befitting of the kind of DC video game cinematics that led the way for the past half a decade (DC Universe Online & Injustice) and this is the perfect vision to rival Marvel's more cartoony Transformers feel. In all, yes, there are lots of reasons to criticise BVS. But as time goes by you may find that you greatly appreciate where it does succeed and without being held back by bias or bitterness.",7,1,5,21 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," WTF Max: Holy Freakin' Crap Road
","I'm only going to make sense on this if I lay it out short and in bullet points:-The ultimate gladiator arena of car chase movies. -The ultimate circus of post-apocalyptic villainy. -Great story, generally well paced. -Not the big bad feminist plot that was rumoured. -Absolute ridiculous carnage. -Completely insane stunts. -Great little references and concepts e.g. blood bag. -Great characters reminiscent of the originals. -Charlize Theron was made for this franchise. -Tom Hardy is the best Max that couldn't have been Mel. -Max could have had more dialogue, but I get it. -More likely to be a one-watch affair for many, due to the amount of spectacle over substance, but it has both and is breathtaking on the first watch. -I just dropped my block of Comte on the floor. -It now has dust and pubes all over it. -Luckily, I'd eaten most of it before I dropped it. -I'll be seeing the sequel.",8,4,9,13 October 2015
13 Hours," Action Packed Documentarian Butt Clencher
","I'm shocked that this is a Michael Bay movie. Everything I don't like about his directorial efforts (excessive slow motion cuts, glossy over the top music video production, corny action scenes) is missing from this movie. I went in without any knowledge or expectations and came out thrilled! 13 Hours is, if anything, a mercenary take (or if you prefer, private security contractor) on Black Hawk Down, immersing us into an escalating situation between the CIA and the extremist factions of Benghazi after the death of Muammar Gaddafi.Although there is a little corniness, as I have come to expect from modern warfare biopic action thrillers (Act of Valor) it's not distracting to me and there's only ever enough to drive up emotional investment in the lead characters, which are mostly very easy to like regardless.The cast is a minor stroke of genius. James Badge Dale clearly enjoys portraying military characters since his lead role in The Pacific and delivers yet again. John Krasinsky makes a phenomenal change from the role he's best known for - Jim Halpert in the The Office (USA).And Max Martini lends solid support yet again after apparently having learned to bench press bulldozers or something. But the biggest surprise and character investment of all comes down to 'Tanto' portrayed by Pablo Schreiber, who was by far my favourite and had me on the edge of my seat a fair few times.13 Hours, thanks to the writing of Chuck Hogan (The Strain) and Bay's much sharper pacing, doesn't try to glorify either the politics or the violence. It sets up a disaster in the making with dramatic precision and provides just enough light relief for you to know that things are going to go from bad to worse.And it does raise politics, in fact, and polarises viewers, because it isn't here to take sides. It was made to tell a true life story as it happened and why. And I do love that the CIA took a boot to the arse as a result.Very impressive. Watch it with Lone Survivor and Black Hawk Down.",8,1,6,11 June 2016
