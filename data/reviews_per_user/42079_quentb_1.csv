Your Name.," My least favorite movie of all time
","I could talk for hours about why I hate this film, but seeing as I don't want to sound pretentious, I'll just say that the story and flow of the movie just feels like they are just going through the beats and not like its an actual adventure or story. The writing is atrocious, the jokes aren't funny, and the characters are dreadful and unlikable. Thank GOD the animation is beautiful, the voice acting is fine, and the music is good. But over all, you know you messed up when you make your audience scream at there phone while watching it.",1,5,22,31 October 2019
