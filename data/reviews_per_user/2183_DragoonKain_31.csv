Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Good Film that Fails to Meet Expectations
","The title to this review may be the understatement of the century, but it's truer than what many other reviewers will tell you. When I first reviewed this film, I gave it a 9 out of 10. I recognized the film had some flaws, but I loved it so much that I overlooked them and focused on what I loved about the movie and Star Wars in general. But, watching the movie now, as an adult, it's clear that it hasn't held up that well. My mind is not as clouded by my love of all things Star Wars, and I think I'm able to give it a more level headed review.I grew up in the 80s, and like many boys my age, I lived and breathed Star Wars. For me and many like me, this was the most anticipated movie of my life. I was only 3 when Return of Jedi came out, and didn't get the opportunity to see it in theaters, so for me, this movie was a very big deal in 1999. And it was very exciting. I loved it, it was probably the only time I clapped or cheered in a movie theater. It was a great experience. I actually saw the film a few times afterwords, but unlike the older Star Wars movies, I started to like it less and less each time I saw it. I still loved it, but it didn't have the same greatness the older ones had.Part of the problem was the messy plot. It's difficult to tell what exactly is at stake for our protagonists in this movie, because you're not sure what the bad guys' plans are, and exactly what or why they're doing what they're doing. There are many plodding moments in this movie in which the plot seems to lose focus. It seems to go off on tangents that, at times, get rather dull. The dialog and acting is weak at times and the weaker moments stick out more upon repeated viewings.Also, the characterization is a little weak. There's no clear protagonist that the viewer can relate to. You have the Jedi, Obi Wan and Qui Gon, who seem to know a lot more than the audience and so make poor protagonists. Then there's Queen Amidala and her handmaiden, whose identities are often confusing and it's not clear what the audience is supposed to know about their relationship to each other. There's also Jar Jar Binks the alien quirky comic relief. As ridiculous as he is, he's probably the easiest to relate to because he's the most clueless one of them all. A lot of people hated Jar Jar because of his quirky way of speaking and cartoony design. Personally, I didn't mind him and found him quite funny at times. But I can see why people were annoyed by him, since he, the quirky comic relief, was the only one the audience could relate to early on and he therefore seemed to get a lot of screen time.Finally there's Anakin, who is the closest thing to a main protagonist we get. But he's not introduced until 45 minutes into the movie. Perhaps this is not such a bad thing as his acting is quite weak, but he's a 9 year old kid so he gets a little leeway. This is probably the most kid friendly of the Star Wars movies. Although there is some mild violence, it is definitely less intense than some of the other movies. Plus the young character of Anakin is someone that a child can relate to. Jar Jar is also quite popular with kids, as his slapstick brand of humor is something that I found got them laughing pretty hard in the theater. But just because it is kid friendly doesn't mean that there isn't something for adults to enjoy as well.There are enough great moments in this movie to make it worth watching at least once. The visuals and action are spectacular and the John Williams Score is fantastic as always. There are some really strong emotional moments too, especially with Anakin's mother, and between Obi Wan and Qui Gon towards the end. Many believe that this film is a waste because there's no point in seeing Anakin as a kid. While I can see their point, I have to disagree. Seeing Anakin as an innocent kind hearted boy makes his overall character arc later in the saga all the more tragic. In this aspect this film accomplishes what it needs to accomplish. It sets the stage for the Star Wars Saga and introduces Anakin, the Saga's main character, as he was before he became a Jedi and before he lost his innocence.Though probably the weakest film in the saga, it's still a very good one to see. But it doesn't hold up too well on repeated viewings. If I were to introduce Star Wars to someone I probably would not start with this film, unless they were a child. Start them with the original 1977 film, Episode IV: A New Hope. This is the classic that started it all, and it still holds up as a great film. The characters are much stronger and the protagonists are easier for older audiences to relate to. This makes it the best way to be introduced to the world of Star Wars.If they like the original Star Wars movie (and who wouldn't), show them Episode V, 1980's Empire Strikes Back, arguably the best of the films. After that, show them this film. After seeing Empire they will have a deeper understanding of the world of Star Wars going in and will appreciate the back-story more. Plus, it's only natural that, due to the loose ends left open at the end, someone who has just seen Empire Strikes Back will have a million questions about the back-story and will want to see the prequels at that point.",7,14,23,13 August 2010
Spider-Man 3," I think they tried to do too much.
","This was a very good film. Spider-Man 3 stays true to the comic with it's depiction of the villains. But I think it tries to cram too much into one film. At two and a half hours, it seems very rushed. And this one film seemed to cover over a decades work of the comic book story arc into one film.First problem. There are too many villains. You have the second Green Goblin, whose story is pretty much set up for us by the first two films, so we have room for one more. They decided on The Sandman, who is probably the best part of this film, both in it's impressive cgi use, and the great acting of Church. Lastly is Venom, who, in my opinion, deserves a film all to himself. He's pretty quintessential. While the set up for him as accurate, I still feel like they didn't have enough time to really develop how he goes from seemingly normal guy to crazed psychotic supervillan.I have a distinct feeling that a lot of necessary scenes wound up on the cutting room floor, and probably would have benefited from having more scenes with Eddie Brock, and less with the Mary Jane story arc, which is nice, but at this point it's treading a lot of the same ground from the previous movies.Nevertheless, it seems to come together pretty well. This is also probably the funniest of the three Spider movies, with some really laugh at loud funny scenes. It also has some pretty strong heartfelt moments, particularly towards the end. Raimi is great at shifting emotions on a whim with this film, which is a sign of a truly good director. I just wish he included more witty banter during the fights. I know he wants the audience to be on the edge of their seat during the action scenes, but come on, it's Spider-Man. He needs more one liners, especially when he's fighting Venom, who usually had the best comebacks.",8,3,4,4 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," They did the best they could with what they had to work with.
","First let me say that, like all Star Wars movies, I enjoyed this movie while watching it and was on my Star Wars high immediately after seeing it. 'Star Wars High' is that great feeling you get after watching a Star Wars movie that allows you to ignore all the 'fridge logic' that will make you question whether the movie was actually good or not after seeing it. If you don't know what 'fridge logic' is, just google the term, you'll laugh. Star Wars movies have always had a lot of fridge logic, but episodes 8 and 9 were particularly bad when it came to plot holes, unanswered questions and things that just didn't make sense.This trilogy had the same problem Lost did. JJ Abrams wrote the beginning and the end but let other writers take over for the middle and the ending didn't fit anymore, but it was still awkwardly tacked on. The biggest problem this film had was that it had to continue the story where episode 8 left off. Rian Johnson didn't leave JJ Abrams with much to work with. Episode 8 ended on a dead end, not a cliff hanger. Johnson had written the trilogy into a corner and Abrams had the unenviable task of undoing a lot of what Johnson had written so that he could conclude the story in a satisfying way. He wasn't entirely successful unfortunately, and as a result it seemed more like two movies crammed into one. It was so fast paced that it was hard to follow the plot, and what I was able to follow just seemed like a retelling of 'Return of the Jedi' with different characters. But this was the problem I had with all the movies in this trilogy. Ep7 was basically an inferior remake of Ep4, Ep8 an inferior remake of Ep 5 and this one an inferior remake of Ep6. Could they have made something more original and satisfying? Let's examine how this trilogy could have been improved.There was that great moment in Ep8 where Rey was about to join with Kylo. This was the best moment of that film, and I think if they had the balls to have her join with him it would have saved that movie. It would have truly been 'subverting expectations'. Rey could have become a powerful villain who continued being tempted by the dark side and then in this film they could have had Kylo save her from the Dark Side. This would have made these movies a lot better ... but I'm not sure it's enough to make it a great trilogy.The root of the problem goes back to Ep7. The worst part of Ep7 wasn't so much that it was a total rehash of Ep4, it was the fact that everything the good guys accomplished in the original trilogy had been undone by the start of Ep7. The Empire had risen again as The First Order and had more powerful weapons than before. The 'New Republic' was in ashes and was reduced to an even weaker resistance than the earlier rebellion. As much as it tried to honor the OT, it took a dump on it.The Empire was basically the Third Reich in space. Like the nazis, they lost the big war and were forever seen as a force of pure evil. Neo-nazis are a joke today and anyone who tries to revive their hateful ideology is pretty much universally shunned. The idea that Neo-Nazis could rise again to the same level the actual Nazis had, a la The First Order, just isn't realistic. BUT, it is a lot more likely that a different group could unknowingly become just as fascist even while claiming that they are fighting fascism.Perhaps what they should have done is, instead of a First Order that tries to continue where the Empire left off, there should have been a separatist faction that split off because they felt the New Republic was becoming just as totalitarian as the Empire. Meanwhile, the New Republic sees the separatists as fascist and under control of a Palpatine like figure that is misleading them. Both sides see each other as evil and under control of the dark side, and perhaps it turns out both are correct (Palpatine is leading both sides to war with each other behind the scenes, like he did in the prequels).It would have been more similar to the prequels in this regard, yes, but the one good thing about the prequels was that the overall story and themes were very good, original, and an excellent allegory to what is going on today even if the execution was poor. They would have retold a story that needed to be retold in an improved way, not one that was already done to near perfection.Perhaps I am wrong and these changes would have made things worse. After all, I did enjoy these films while watching them. But in order for new Star Wars movies to have a lasting impact in the same way the original trilogy did, they need to have a strong story in addition to great execution. This trilogy delivered, for the most part, on the latter, but not so much on the former ... sort of the opposite of the prequel trilogy that had a great overall story, but missed the mark in many regards on the execution.",7,0,3,23 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Mixed Bag, But Mostly Good
","The Star Wars Prequels are an interesting phenomenon. Never before has an expansion to a franchise divided fans so intensely. Fans started to become disenfranchised with 1999's Episode I - The Phantom Menace (although some would argue it started earlier, with the special editions, or even with the appearance of the first Ewok in Return of the Jedi). But I think it was this movie that truly made the rift irreparable.On the one hand, you had the Prequel Zealots, or Lucas Apologists, those who loved anything with the title 'Star Wars'. They would not dare give this film anything less than a 10. On the other hand, you had the Prequel Haters, or Lucas Bashers, who felt that the prequels were abominations and tainted the sacredness of the holy trilogy. The civil war between these Star Wars fans has been ongoing ever since, with flame wars still popping up on internet forums to this day. It's comical how easy it is to compare this Star Wars fan civil war to the Galactic Civil War portrayed in the films.My stance has always been somewhere in the middle, but I think I leaned more towards the Lucas Apologists' side. I enjoyed the prequels for what they were. I initially reviewed this film when it came out, and my rating was a 9, much higher than the film deserves. But at the time, I had just come off from seeing it for the first time, and I was still on my Star Wars high. Seeing a Star Wars movie for the first time is always very exciting, especially for a fan, and it's easy to overlook a film's flaws while on such a high. But after seeing this film again recently, I've noticed that it hasn't held up as well as I remembered, and I think it deserves a more level headed review.The biggest problem with this movie is the dialog. Sometimes it's good, but often it's atrocious. There are scenes where it's difficult not to cringe. One of the central themes to this film is the love story between Anakin (played by Hayden Christenson) and Padme (played by the beautiful Natalie Portman). There really is no chemistry between these two characters during most of these scenes. The dialog is cringe-worthy at times and really brings the film to a screeching halt.Intercut with these scenes is Obi Wan's plot, which is much more interesting, and Star Wars fans will be given plenty of fan service as he tries to solve the mystery of the Queen's attempted assassin. Ewan McGreggor does an amazing job portraying a young Obi Wan Kenobi, and it's clear that has fit himself into the role nicely since The Phantom Menace. Christopher Lee also does a nice job portraying the mysterious Count Dooku and his scenes with McGreggor are a treat.The film gets better and better as it progresses, and even Anakin's and Padme's scenes start to become much more interesting. There is one scene with Anakin and Padme on Tatooine that is very emotionally powerful and nearly makes up for the previous weak scenes between them. This scene redeemed Christenson for me, who, until that point, I felt was not well suited for the role.All of this eventually culminates to a giant battle at the end that probably is a little bit too giant for its own good. It goes on a little too long, and involves too much special effects and cgi that kind of detaches the audience a little bit. Still, it looks quite impressive (especially at the time it was released), and it is cool to see a large scale war in Star Wars once again.This movie's a little darker than the other Star Wars movies and there are some scenes of violence that may not be good for kids. I would wait until they're a little older to show them this, maybe 8 or 9. Also, the love story may be hard for them to stomach, but then, it was pretty hard for me to stomach as an adult as well.Overall, there's good and there's bad in this movie, but mostly, I enjoyed it. And I still enjoy it, but, like Episode I and unlike the original trilogy, it doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings.",7,6,10,13 August 2010
Watchmen," The Ultimate Edition is A Lot Better
","I first reviewed this movie after having seen it in theaters in March of 2009 when it was first released. I had a mixed reaction to it. On the one hand, I loved how faithful Snyder was to the source material. But on the other, in trying to squeeze all 12 issues of the comic book series into a single movie, the film felt strangely paced, and seemed to lose a lot of viewers who weren't already familiar with the source material.Since that time, three different versions of this film have been released on DVD and Bluray. The theatrical cut, which is the shortest version, and by shortest I mean 2 hours and 40 minutes. This is the version shown in theaters, and the version most people reviewed. At the same time, they also released a 3 hour long Director's Cut. The Director's Cut added a few nice scenes that improve the movie somewhat, but don't really improve the pacing, which still has the problem of feeling like an episodic story told awkwardly as a single film.Several months later, however, a third cut of the film was released. This one, called the Ultimate Cut, is over 3 and a half hours long and includes an animated version of the graphic novel's comic within a comic 'Tales of the Black Freighter', a pirate comic that mirrors the struggle of the main characters of The Watchmen. Ironically the addition of these animated segments, that periodically interrupt the flow of the main storyline, actually improve the pacing the film.Whereas the previous cuts felt more like slow plodding action movies that often lost itself in its exposition, the Ultimate cut doesn't feel like an action movie at all, and instead feels more like a philosophical deconstruction of our own moralities and commonly held beliefs. This is closer to what Alan Moore had in mind when he wrote the series, and the Ultimate Cut captures this essence, where the original theatrical version and Director's Cut fell short.The movie is brilliant, mainly because the graphic novel is brilliant. Moore's writing, influenced by Nietzsche's ideas of existentialism, is beautifully worded, and Snyder was wise to stay as close to the source material as he did. There are a few minor flaws, mainly the scenes with the Silk Spectre, whose acting was good, but did not measure up to the task. Also, I didn't like the vomiting scene cutting into the beautiful 'Sound of Silence' funeral procession. But these are minor nitpicks that are more than made up for by a brilliantly crafted and well paced film.I have to give this a 10/10, a great improvement over my initial reaction to the theatrical cut. It's too bad this wasn't the version released in theaters, it may have gotten a better critical reception. But then again, I'm not sure many would have been able to sit through a 3 and a half hour movie.",10,1,3,20 August 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I expected it to be great, and it was better
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Well, what can I say, other than I've pretty much been waiting all my life for this movie.  I fell in love with Middle Earth when I was but a toddler seeing the Hobbit cartoon for the first time and have been a fantasy geek ever since.  As soon as I heard they were making this movie, I was a little wary.  It's a huge story, and I never thought the big screen could do it justice, but as soon as I heard it was going to be 3 hours each, and found out they were making them all at the same time, I knew it was going to be great.Not only was it great, it was fantastic (literally).  Everything I had hoped for and more.  Yes there were changes, but they were all acceptable and many made the story flow better.  Yes there were omissions, but it was made up for by the many great things added in this movie.  What can I say, Jackson, the cast, the crew, everyone did a great job in this movie, and the 3 hours flew so fast I felt the need to reread the two towers all over again just to get to the next part of the story.For those who are skeptical of any changes made, here they are:spoiler alertFirstly, To Bombadil was left out.  I think Jackson felt the need to speed up the early part of the journey and get to Bree quicker, so this as well as Frodo and company's encounter with the elves in the woods near the Shire was left out.  Unfortunately this also means that the conflict with the Whites on the Barrow downs was also cut out since there was no Tom Bombadil to save them.  Although I kind of missed these scenes, there removal was understandable.  The book starts out quite slowly and doesn't really start grabbing you until Strider is introduced at the Prancing Pony, and it probably would have been a little too sluggish in a movie.  Hopefully we'll see these scenes on the DVD (if they even made it to the cutting room floor).Bill the pony actually is in this movie, although he is only meantioned when Sam says goodbye to him.  Glorfindel, however, is not in this movie.  His scenes are replaced by Arwen.  At first I wasn't too sure if I liked this or not, but realised, it is probably a good change for the movies since it better develops her character.  In the books, she really didn't have a major role until the last book.  With this scene, we get to know her a little more rather than just a passing introduction in Rivendel.Minor omissions aside, everything else was pretty much intact.  He really did a good job staying true to the book.  I can't wait for the next movie. I guess we got Episode II this summer to fill the void.",10,0,0,22 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Like all great classics, it's worth everyone's while to see these films
","I tend to find that the people who have not seen these films yet are people that assume they will not like it, or feel intimidated by its epic scale, running time, and/or feel turned off by the fantasy genre in general.Do not let this deter you from seeing these films, they are definitely worth your time for one viewing as they are great movies, and destined to be classics.  I would go as far to say that they are the best book adaptations to film, but this is, of course, all a matter of opinion.  (And as a long time fan of the books, I'm a bit biased).First of all, I highly reccomend seeing the extended editions of these films as opposed to the theatrical versions.  You may want to wait for the EE of RotK to come out on DVD before watching these films.  The Extended Editions are simply far superior versions because it more closely captures the pacing, and feel of the books.  There is also more depth of character and development introduced in the Extended Editions lacking from the shorter theatrical versions.  Whereas the theatrical versions are simple, but good action/special effect movies, the Extended Editions are grand epic adventures that have far more depth and intelligence to them.Secondly, unless you are watching them for the first at a LotR buttnumbathon type party, I do not reccomend watching them all at once.  All together, these films clock in at about 12 hours not including breaks.  Your rear will probably be hating its existence by the time you get to Return of the King.Instead, I reccomend watching it small doses.  The Extended DVD Editions split the films over 2 discs and are perfectly designed for 6 90-120 minute episodic viewings.  This is the length of an average film, and allow for much less of a time commitment.  Still, I reccomend you not wait too long before seeing the next part, as these films essentially are one story with many characters, place names, and plot lines that can be easily forgotten. It's best to watch one DVD per night over 6 nights.  Treat it like a really good TV mini-series that you don't want to miss each night.Lastly, turn off the lights, pump up the volume, and TURN ON THE SUBTITLES. There are many strange words in these films, and it helps if you can see them written in front of you.  The films are pretty easy to follow, but the plot is also complex and deep.  You will enjoy the films more if you understand as much as you can, as one of the main appeals of Tolkien's story is its attention to detail.I can guarantee you that if you give these films a chance and take my reccomendations to heart you will not be disappointed. Enjoy.",10,0,2,25 August 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Great, but not perfect
","I was thoroughly satisfied with Matrix Revolutions.  It didn't blow me away like the first one, but it didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth like the second one did.  In fact the way it resolved made the second one a better movie overall.  It was the way the story had to end, and it ended well.  The special effects were the best yet, the story was good, and the battles were intense.  This was the battle I was waiting for since I saw the end of the first one.  It did not disappoint at all.  But it wasn't perfect.  There weren't as many great moments as the first.  Great little moments, like the little conversation with Mouse at dinner, or great big moments, like Neo awakening for the first time, or when he realises he is the One.  There were a few great big moments, but it's not as rewatchable as the first.  Also, I miss the original oracle.  The new actress does a decent enough job, but it just wasn't the same.  Still that's no ones fault, but a shame nonetheless.
spoiler Most importantly they did not cop out and take the whole 'Real World is part of the matrix' route, which was hinted at in the second one.  That would have ruined the whole story.  Instead they chose to end it the way it should have ended, with some interesting twists to boot.  But I'll let you see it for yourself.  Great movie, go see it.",8,0,0,7 November 2003
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The X-Men movie franchise is still alive, and better than ever
","It's very rare that you get to see a film franchise make it to its seventh installment and still have the ability to impress fans and critics alike. But never before has a film franchise made it to its seventh installment and actually topped all of its previous efforts.However, when I say seventh installment, I suppose I should include an asterisk. First this includes the two Wolverine films, the second of which didn't even have X-Men in the title. And secondly, The X-Men movie series, like the comics, is a bit of a convoluted mess, and it's sometimes difficult to figure which films are part of the 'official canon' and which aren't. The comics have the excuse of being around for over 50 years with dozens of spin-offs and thousands of comics/graphic novels between them. That's a lot of story continuity, so it's understandable that things will become convoluted after awhile.The movies don't have that excuse, and the cracks in continuity began to show as early as the fourth film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Indeed, some would argue that the previous film, X-Men: The Last Stand, was the beginning of the end. Those two films, though entertaining, were definitely a dark period for the X-Men films, and many of us were beginning to think the franchise would end with the disappointing fourth installment.But if Fox failed to make another X-Men movie in a timely manner, they would lose the rights to the franchise and Marvel Studios would take the reigns. For awhile I was hoping this would happen. X-Men would then be able to exist in the same universe as the Avengers, a team that has close ties with X-Men in the comics, and has shared more than a few members (one of whom, Quicksilver, actually does appear in both this X-Men movie and the upcoming Avengers film).But then fox released X-Men: First Class. At first I thought it was a reboot since it seemed to ignore most of the continuity of the last four films. But no, it turns out it was a prequel, and a fantastic one at that. It's very rare that prequels turn out to be better than the originals they are meant to precede, but First Class managed to do this, and it even managed to do it without the star character, Wolverine, who only made a brief cameo appearance.It seemed that the writers had learned that the key to a good X- Men movie wasn't Wolverine, it wasn't the action or even the mutant powers. It's the deeper competing philosophies that X-Men puts forward as exhibited by the two most important characters: Professor X and Magneto. The originals had these two amazing characters portrayed by Shakespearean stage play veterans Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. But it was fascinating seeing their younger selves as portrayed by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Both pairs nailed their respective parts to perfection.This film, using one of my favorite science fiction plot devices: time travel, manages to bring both pairs together in the same film to brilliant effect. It's wonderful seeing the older and wiser Prof X and Magneto contrasted with their younger, more passionate selves. Peter Dinklage, playing the fanatical Bolivar Trask, manages to paint a sympathetic picture of the villain. If one thing X-Men does right, it's in its portrayals of villains. Very few of them are actually 'comic book evil'. They're just people, usually with deep convictions, who believe they are doing the right thing. The deeper themes of fanaticism, the horrors of war and genocide and how the road to hell is paved with good intentions is brilliantly adapted from the source material.I remember reading the 'Days of Future Passed' comic book double issue as a teenager and it had a deep impression on me. Many people have accused this film of ripping off The Terminator, but what they probably don't realize is that the original story-line was written in 1981 by Chris Claremont. If anything, The Terminator ripped off Days of Future Passed.That being said, aside from the premise, this film is quite different from the original 1981 comic book story arc. But those changes were necessary since the movie franchise exists in a very different universe than the comic book franchise. Still, major themes and the heart of the story is preserved, and that's really all that matters.So did this movie 'fix' the plot-holes and continuity issues of the previous six installments? Well, it's hard to say. Once you introduce multiple time-lines into the equation, I guess any plot-hole or inconsistency can be explained away simply by saying 'this movie exists on a different time-line where things happened differently'. It doesn't exactly explain why Professor X is suddenly alive again at the beginning of this film, but I guess it doesn't require an explanation either. It's not perfect, but I try not to let it bother me. At the end of the day the film stands on its own as an excellent bit of cinema. If you're looking for plot-holes, you're going to find them. But fortunately, the movie is so good that you forget to look for them.",10,2,5,5 June 2014
Alien vs. Predator," One of the better movies based on a game
","But that's not saying much.  While Alien vs Predator was a fine video game, it seemed unlikely that it would ever be made into a film.  First of all, franchise crossovers, while common in comic books, are extremely uncommon in movies, save for Japanese monster movies.  Also, the total lack of humans in the AvP game made it even more unlikely to be turned into a film.  I don't think film studios are brave enough to make a movie without any human beings in it.So, predictably but probably wisely, they took the Zerg vs Protoss route. For those that haven't played Starcraft it means it focused on a battle between Aliens (Zerg) and Predators (Protoss) with the humans caught in the middle serving as mainly hosts for the Aliens.  Predictable or not, it made for a fun movie with good fight scenes, decent acting, and an okay back story.But, on the downside, it pretty much played it completely safe.  Nothing really that major happened, and nothing really came as a surprise.  However, save for Alien 1, none of the previous movies had many serious surprises, so I guess it's no real loss.This movie was good enough to warrant a sequel, and I think this may be one of the few franchises where the sequel outdoes the original.  More big stuff needs to happen though.  7/10",7,1,1,13 August 2004
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Peter, Fran and Philippa's formula for adapting Tolkien's books
","I saw the Hobbit DoS last night. Incredible movie! Very fast paced and action heavy, as I've come to expect.If I have one gripe it'd be that the action in the two latest hobbit films are too over the top crazy and unrealistic. The action in LOTR was grittier and felt more real, even though it was still fantasy. You actually felt like the characters could die or get seriously wounded in the fights. But in The Hobbit, everyone's just either super lucky or just god mode powerful. Someone mentioned it's like playing a video game on easy mode. LOTR is hard mode. I agree with that assessment. Still, the films are great fun and I found them very entertaining.Peter, Fran and Philippa tend to follow a predictable formula when adapting Tolkien's books: 1. Cut out as much exposition as possible, and for the exposition that is necessary, tell it through flashbacks if time allows for it. Some Examples: -the intros to the movies are always flashbacks, and there are several flashbacks within the story. -the council of elrond is greatly shortened -lines of dialogue are always a lot more brief in the films than they are in the books: 'I am no man' vs. 'But no mortal man am I, for you look upon a woman ...' 2. If there are quiet moments in the book, cut it out, or greatly shorten it. Some Examples: -a lot of the down time at lake town, the elven king's halls, and Rivendell is shortened to the point where they seem more like very brief stays, rather than the weeks that were spent there in the books. -Nearly 20 years pass between Frodo receiving the ring from Bilbo, and him finally setting out on his journey in the books. In the film, it seems like it's the next day. -The scenes with Radagast, Gandalf and the white council investigating the necromancer of Dol Guldur, and the corruption of mirkwood occurs over the course of thousands of years in the books. In the film, it all seems to happen within the same week. -The time spent worrying about how much food they have, or how tired and hungry they are on the journey. Worrying about where they're going to sleep, and other serious problems that one would run into while going on a long journey. Bad guys trying to kill you aren't the only thing the dwarfs and bilbo had to worry about on their quest. -Journeys last months in the books, in the movies it feels like only a couple of weeks. -Moments of rest and peace, minor conversations, and minor character moments. 3. Cut out anything that may seem a bit too goofy. Keep children storybook humor and whimsy to a minimum. Some Examples: -Tom Bombadil -The wacky way Gandalf introduces the dwarfs to Beorn -The anthropomorphic dogs and many of the talking animals (and wallets) -Many of the songs are cut. 4. Greatly expand on any and all action that's presented in the book, even if it's just one sentence. Some Examples: -The sentence, 'They ran down the stairs and across the bridge.' is adapted to a major 15 minute action scene in FOTR when they're running from the Balrog -The expansion of Azog's role in the story (keeping him alive after Moria), as well as expanding Bolg's role. The orcs attack them much more often in the films than they do in the books. -They added a lot more action to the barrel riding scene than was in the books. -The confrontation of Thorin and the dwarfs against Smaug on the Lonely Mountain was a very brief passage in the book. In the film, it's nearly 45 minutes. 5. Expand the roles of the female characters. -Arwen's role is much bigger in LOTR and she even replaces Glorfindel in her introduction. -Galadriel gets more screen time than she gets in the books, though her role in the story is true to the way Tolkien wrote it. -The Elf King's chief prison guard in The Hobbit was a nameless elf with a very small role, but in the film she's a female Sylvan Elf named Tauriel who has a much bigger role and even a romance subplot. The Extended cuts are paced more slowly, and are closer in feel to the books. A lot of the exposition and quiet character moments are put back in, as well as some of goofy humor and whimsical moments that may have been cut. The extended editions are how the films should truly be seen, IMO.",9,10,19,13 December 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Great execution, but we've seen this movie before
","I just saw this movie today and I have to say that it was quite good, but not great. It's basically a retelling of 1972's 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes', but whereas 'Conquest of' had an great premise with a weak execution, this movie has excellent execution with a bland and overdone premise. The premise was nothing new or original so it didn't leave an impression on me like that those original five movies did.Still, the execution was superb. Andy Serkis's CGI Caesar in particular was impressive and even outdid even Roddy McDowell's excellent performance as Caesar in 'Conquest of'. The plot was also more plausible. In 'Conquest of' we're expected to believe that Apes evolved into their human-like form in less than 20 years. I'm forgiving of the older film because they didn't have the budget or technology to make the Apes more realistic back in 1972, but still, their appearance could have been explained by the arrival of the Apes who traveled back in time in the previous movie, 'Escape From the Planet of the Apes'.In terms of execution, this film was miles ahead of the older films. It also had some great emotional moments, in particular when Caesar is imprisoned and has to endure abuse by his keepers and his fellow chimps. I also liked the Alzheimer's plot, which was heart wrenching and well executed. It managed to capture both the bleak atmosphere of 'Conquest of' while still retaining the hopeful spirit of 'Battle For The Planet of the Apes'. The only moment I felt taken out of this movie was when Caesar said 'No' for the first time. It just seemed a little forced and out of place. Obviously it was done as a nod to the older films. 'No' is the word that humans are forbidden to speak, and also the first word Caesar is heard saying when he starts his rebellion in 'Conquest'. Nevertheless, I felt that when he spoke for the first time, the movie had jumped the shark, but it got good again really quick.The biggest weakness of this film was its bland premise. Scientists try to play god and Evil corporation gets to greedy and we all pay the price. Meanwhile a subjugated group rebels and overcomes its oppressors. Don't interfere with nature ... Blah Blah Blah. It was basically retelling of the 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' movie without the whole 'self fulfilling prophecy' angle that made those earlier films so interesting. In a way, one could view this as a prequel to the first two films as long as they act as though the backward time traveling events in 'Escape From' never happened. This is how things could have happened had Cornelius and Zira not gone back in time and changed the course of history. So this resides on a different time-line, or is completely removed from the events of those last three sequels. And though it borrows from the ideas and main premise of 'Conquest Of', it's more or less a retelling of that story but has no connection to the actual events of that story.Either way, it could serve as both a reboot, or a prequel to the first two films since it doesn't contradict anything in 1968's 'Planet of the Apes' or 1970's 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes'. I'm sure, however, if they continue with sequels, it will eventually forge its own plot to replace these as well. But, at this point, one could still interpret this as a prequel. It's kind of reminiscent of X-Men First Class, which could work as a prequel to the first two X-Men films, but, depending on the direction they go with the sequels, could also be used as a reboot. It's actually quite smart to do this, and viewing this film as an alternate time-line is thought provoking in itself. Of course, this theme is never explored in the movie, so it's kind of a moot point. Without offering anything new or original to the premise, the film lacks the impression that the original five movies made when they first hit theaters and suffers as a result.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Too short
","This movie was too short. While I'm happy it included many new X-Men, a few of which deserved to be in the first two movies, the length of the movie doesn't allow for much character development. The movie is only 100 minutes long, and it really needed to be well over 2 hours. I realise that action movies can't spend too much time on character development, but I really think this movie needed more of it.Cyclops' character, in particular, suffered greatly in this respect. Having been marginalized in the last movie, this movie seemed to not care much about him at all. I don't understand how such a major and important character in the comics can be marginalized so. Don't let Cyclops' portrayal in the movie and cartoons turn you off to him. Trust me he's a much better character in the comics.Nevertheless, the story is good. I could complain about some of the twists and major deviations from the comics. But let's face it. You can't accurately adapt a comic book series that has been running since 1963 with several spinoffs and hundreds of major characters into three movies.The story very loosely mixes the legacy virus story lines with the dark phoenix story. And when I say loosely, I mean it's a completely different story, which, in many ways, is a good thing.One complaint I have about the story is that the Phoenix saga in the comics took years to simmer before eventually boiling over into a massively destructive climax. While I understand you can't have that slow progression of Phoenix's character from good to evil in the movies, I felt this one lost a lot of its effect without the slow buildup. And the lack of Cyclops' presence, who had a major role in the story, hurt it in some ways.But still, if one were to forget about the comics, and view these movies as their own story, it's actually a great trilogy on its own. But this is not the best film in that trilogy, sadly.",7,0,1,27 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Like all great classics, it's worth everyone's while to see these films
","I tend to find that the people who have not seen these films yet are people that assume they will not like it, or feel intimidated by its epic scale, running time, and/or feel turned off by the fantasy genre in general.Do not let this deter you from seeing these films, they are definitely worth your time for one viewing as they are great movies, and destined to be classics.  I would go as far to say that they are the best book adaptations to film, but this is, of course, all a matter of opinion.  (And as a long time fan of the books, I'm a bit biased).First of all, I highly reccomend seeing the extended editions of these films as opposed to the theatrical versions.  You may want to wait for the EE of RotK to come out on DVD before watching these films.  The Extended Editions are simply far superior versions because it more closely captures the pacing, and feel of the books.  There is also more depth of character and development introduced in the Extended Editions lacking from the shorter theatrical versions.  Whereas the theatrical versions are simple, but good action/special effect movies, the Extended Editions are grand epic adventures that have far more depth and intelligence to them.Secondly, unless you are watching them for the first at a LotR buttnumbathon type party, I do not reccomend watching them all at once.  All together, these films clock in at about 12 hours not including breaks.  Your rear will probably be hating its existence by the time you get to Return of the King.Instead, I reccomend watching it small doses.  The Extended DVD Editions split the films over 2 discs and are perfectly designed for 6 90-120 minute episodic viewings.  This is the length of an average film, and allow for much less of a time commitment.  Still, I reccomend you not wait too long before seeing the next part, as these films essentially are one story with many characters, place names, and plot lines that can be easily forgotten. It's best to watch one DVD per night over 6 nights.  Treat it like a really good TV mini-series that you don't want to miss each night.Lastly, turn off the lights, pump up the volume, and TURN ON THE SUBTITLES. There are many strange words in these films, and it helps if you can see them written in front of you.  The films are pretty easy to follow, but the plot is also complex and deep.  You will enjoy the films more if you understand as much as you can, as one of the main appeals of Tolkien's story is its attention to detail.I can guarantee you that if you give these films a chance and take my reccomendations to heart you will not be disappointed. Enjoy.",10,1,1,25 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Okay, now it's a ten
","After seeing the extended version of this movie, I'm going to have to change my vote for this movie from a 9 to a 10 (pretty much what happened with the first one).  They fixed everything I found wrong with the first.  The theatrical was a great thrill ride.  It was fast paced, and you could really feel the doom upon all the good guys.  But the extended was an epic of biblical proportions on its own.  Jackson expands the depth of every character in the movie, often going beyond what even Tolkien depicted.  The most important thing is that Faramir's character is completely redeemed. Although still not quite the same character he was portrayed in the book, he is depicted as a much more similar character to the one in the book in the extended cut than he is depicted in the theatrical cut.  He is a much more sympathetic character, and it is now understandable why it took him so long to make the right decision.  We now know more about the ents, (and the entwives), and we get more Gandalf, which I can't get enough of.  We also get more of an end to this movie.  I always thought the theatrical version ended prematurely.  After all it left nearly half the book untold.  This one still doesn't make it to the end of the book, but it doesn't leave much left, and it ends on a much more satisfying note, although still a brilliant cliffhanger.  If you have the option and the extra 40 minutes, definitely see the Extended edition instead of the theatrical version.",10,0,0,18 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," As good as the first, and oh so dark
","Having seen the second part of my favorite epic novel, it once again blew me away.  A word of warning: this one is dark.  The book, like the movie, takes a very dark and violent turn in this second part.  I love that sort of thing, so I was very happy, but be wary if you're taking kids to see this one.
Spoiler WarningRather than seperate the journey of Frodo and Sam from the rest of the story, they interlaced them together, and a lot of changes were made. Many of them for the better, but like before there were a few changes I did not like.  First the bad stuff.Most of the changes I did not like were simply the things left out of the story.  The Ents, for instance, could have been more developed on.  We didn't get to hear much of their philosophy and lifestyle, which was a very enjoyable part of the book (no meantion of Entwives).  And they made the Ents seem less intelligent then they are portrayed in the books.  Also, there didn't seem to be enough Gandalf in this one.  In the book, he had a much larger role.  It would have been nice to see the events leading up to Gandalf's Battle on the Peak, and I think more explanation was needed as to Gandalf's return as Gandalf the White.  Those that didn't read the book wouldn't know how he wound up in Fangorn forest.  Then again, I really didn't fully understand what happened to him until I read the Silmarillion so I guess a little mystery was Tolkien's intention.  But I think they just left a little too much unexplained here.  I could have done without the whole Aragorn being thought dead part.  Not really a bad part as we get to see more of the story of Arwen and Aragorn, but kind of unnecessary.  The Siege of Isengard was just as cool as I had hoped, but was a bit short. In fact, this movie actually was too short.  It ends quite a bit early in comparison to the book, probably a good choice pacing-wise since you can't top that climax.  But, I hope they make up for those lost chapters in the next movie.Still, I had simliar feelings about the stuff they left out of the Fellowship, and they made up for it perfectly in the Extended Edition, which is definitely the most flawless movie I have ever seen.  Hopefully it will be the same when the EE comes out for this one.  Pretty much everything else in this movie was perfect.The battle of helms deep (a favorite chapter of mine) is every bit I could have hoped for and more.  This was the mother of all battles in the book (second only to the battle of the Pelennor Fields in Return of the King), and they really hit the nail on the head for this one.  They didn't change the course of the battle too much from the book, but the additions they made to it were great.  I especially love the addition of the lothlorien elves to the battle.  The look, special effects, score, fight scenes and acting were wonderful.  The performance of Gollum/Smeagol was right on.  Another great addition was the story of Arwen and Aragorn, an appendix to the book I was afraid they were going to leave out.  Although they leave out most of their history, we do get to know enough about their past, and in the process learn a little more about the elves.  Another cool addition was the whole fight with the Warg riders.  We get introduced to Wargs in the hobbit but don't see much of them in The Lord of the Rings novel.  Definitely a cool fight scene (gotta love Gimli).  Gimli was probably my favorite character for this movie.  In the book, Gimli and Legolas were very well developed characters. Two warriors who start off hating each other, then wind up best friends. Peter Jackson, thankfully, managed to develop them well.  Gimli kind of takes a back seat to Legolas in the first one, but in this one he really shines.  He is the comic releif in this one, as he is in the book, and Peter Jackson nailed it.  We definitely needed the comic relief among all this doom.  My favorite bits of Tolkien dialog are the ones between Legolas and Gimli during the battle of helms deep.  They're both pretty much doomed to die, but all they can do in between cleaving orcs is joke around and place bets on the number of kills they can get.  I was very happy to see that this is one of the few bits of Tolkien dialog PJ left unchanged.This was definitely a wonderful film, go see it, and see the extended edition as well.  10/10",10,0,0,18 December 2002
X-Men: Apocalypse," Such high hopes ...
","This was the X-Men movie I was waiting for. Apocalypse has always been my favorite X-Men villain. I've been waiting to see them do one with this Xavier and Magneto, but introducing the real X-Men team (namely Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, Archangel and Psyclocke among others). This one looked epic. Xavier with his signature bald head, a real powerful villain like Apocalypse. They had rebooted the time-line so they could really do it right. It looked like everything was falling into place for the perfect X-Men movie. So where did it all go wrong?Was it just that Apocalypse makes a bad cinematic villain? He was always my favorite ever since I was 8 years old and I first started reading X-Men comics. Maybe he just doesn't fit into the Singer universe. I admit he may be the most 'cartoon evil' of the x-men villains. And some argue he's way too overpowered. But he's also really interesting. Being the first mutant, he's very old. His Darwinist philosophy takes Magneto's Malcolm Xish ultra leftism to such an extreme that it becomes ultra right. This is why you would never see Magneto join with Apocalypse. It's horseshoe theory at its finest. Singer missed an opportunity with that. I don't think he really understood Apocalypse. As soon as he learned all there was about modern humanity by touching the TV I knew I was in for a rough two hours.But I don't think Apocalypse was the primary problem. There were many issues I had with this film. It really seemed like they tried to squeeze too much in to please everyone. Too many characters especially. The sad thing was that these were the characters I was waiting for. Cyclops was always a favorite of mine and none of the films (or cartoons for that matter) had done his character justice. I was really hoping that maybe this time they'd finally get him right. And while I admit they did do a better job with him than before, he's still not the Cyclops I know and love from the comics. Making him the younger brother of Alex was their first mistake. And making it that his powers originated one day in high school and not in a plane crash was their second. Cyclops is a mutant born of tragedy. There's a reason he's so haunted.Psylocke was the worst of all. She looked good, but she was basically just a costume with a psychic sword. No character to her at all. And what was with Archangel? I don't know who that metalhead was, but that was not Warren Worthington III. It's as if Singer didn't know the characters' histories, just how they looked on the covers to the comics.The other characters weren't as bad, but still off. Storm was acted well but seemed way out of character. Nightcrawler was overpowered, but okay. And I don't want to get into too much detail without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say if they're going to retry the Phoenix saga and this time get it right, I think they already messed it up in this film because, once again, Brian Singer doesn't understand where the Phoenix power comes from.But I can forgive them for changing the characters as long as they manage to still make a good film. But I still can't get behind it. Why? Well one more thing that bothered me was how no one aged in the 20 years since First Class. They could have at least put some gray in their hair. They could have had Professor X go bald naturally. Instead he goes bald because of some weird scifi reason that's never explained or even acknowledged. It just seemed like a very minimal amount of effort was put into details like that. Jennifer Lawrence rarely wore her blue skin. Beast rarely ever was Beast. It just felt like they didn't care all that much. Things like that I can't forgive.All the negativity aside, there were some good moments to this film. I really liked the Quicksilver scene. Fassbender and McAvoy had great performances as usual, even given the weak script. There were also some great scenes with the younger X-Men. It reminded me how great it would be to have an X-Men TV show centered around the school. And Apocalypse, though they didn't get him right, still makes for a cool villain regardless. I enjoyed parts of this film. But overall ... not good. I think the main reason was stated in my first paragraph. The bar was set way too high. First Class and Days of Future Passed were great movies and they were setting us up for the X-Men film we all were waiting for. And ultimately, they couldn't deliver it. It was a huge letdown.With the right planning, an Apocalypse film could have worked. Marvel Studios could have pulled it off. But Marvel Studios knows their heroes. They may take liberties with the plot, but they stay true to the characters. A villain like Apocalypse is something you build up to. And a team like the X-Men has as rich a history as the Avengers and requires just as much build up and planning. This is why the Deadpool film was so good. It focused on one character while introducing only a few other X-Men. You can't introduce too many new X-Men at once. You need to introduce them slowly in separate films, THEN bring them together in one big one. Marvel Studios knows how to make a superhero team movie, Brian Singer, take note. If you try to throw it all at us at once, you get a film like this, or like X-Men United.The best line in the film was one Jean Grey said while the younger X-Men were walking out of Return of the Jedi 'The third one's always the worst'. How sad but true.",4,2,10,18 June 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," great Intestinal eviceration dismemberment fun
","This is a funny, intense, and wild movie.  It's pretty much a revenge story loaded with gory cartoon violence, great fun music, and incredible effects. Tarantino is clearly having a lot of fun with making this movie, and he's employed several techniques for the action sequences.  He loves playing with the mood and tells the story in many different ways.  Unfortunately this movie doesn't have an ending, but the plot is pretty predictable so it isn't really that much of a cliffhanger.  Still, it's great fun to watch.  When the DVD comes there will be plenty of fun with slow motion.  If you don't like gory cartoon violence (namely itchy and scratchy/Monty type violence but more brutal and realistic), don't watch this movie.  But if you're a guy, watch it.  It's fun.",8,0,1,11 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Not as good as the first, but then how can it be?
","Originally I didn't want to review this movie until I saw Revolutions, the third part of the trilogy.  The reason: Depending on how they resolve this cliffhanger I could either love or hate this movie.  The way they left it though, it looks like a bit of cop out, but I'll tell you no more.  Instead, I will review on its own merits, ignoring the cliffhanger.This movie had better action scenes, and better special effects, but other than that, the first one was better.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a great action movie, but as an SF movie it is rather average.  But then again, once the premise is laid out with such perfection, how can this one be better than the first?  In other words, the whole premise is told, and the conclusion will be told in the next movie, this one is all middle.  So what we have in this one is great action scenes.  There is a lot of philosophical talk in this one too, some of it is thought provoking, but it is not on the level of excellent Science Fiction.  We also get to see the city of Zion, an impressive piece of work I might add.  We learn more about human society, and about some of the rogue programs that never got deleted. We also get quite possibly the best car chase in cinematic history.  This movie is like a great a ride that seems to keep going a little too far past its welcome.  Everything's good until the last 15 minutes.  The cliffhanger ruined it a bit for me.  7/10",8,0,0,16 October 2003
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Unfinished Edition
","It's funny, because each year that there's a Peter Jackson Middle Earth film released, I find myself less excited by the new December theatrical release, and more excited by the November Extended Edition release. That has never more been the case with these new Hobbit films. The second film, The Desolation of Smaug, while enjoyable in theaters, felt like tiresome action schlock that cut out some of the best parts of the book in favor of exhausting nonstop action. The extended edition bluray released last November rectified and fixed pretty much every major issue I had with the theatrical version of the film.So, when the less than stellar reviews for The third and final installment of The Hobbit came out, a part of me wondered if it was even worth seeing it in theaters at all. Should I just wait for the extended edition next November? Well, curiosity got the better of me and I went out and saw it and ... yeah you're probably better off waiting for the extended edition. Let's just call this the Unfinished Edition.It's no secret that there was a lot difficulty getting these Hobbit films made. First there was all the difficulty getting the rights to the film, then there was the New Zealand actors strike, then Del Toro's departure during pre-production leaving Peter Jackson holding the boat, and lastly, there was the last minute decision to turn this from a duology into a trilogy. Keep in mind also Peter Jackson had 3 years of pre-production time on the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy. On The Hobbit, he had less than one year. When you watch all the behind the scenes footage on the appendices of the Extended Editions, you can see that they really are working themselves to the nub right up until the very last minute to get everything done in time for release.As a result, The Hobbit movies just don't measure up in comparison to the Lord of the Rings movies. They look and feel rushed. They rely a lot more on CGI, and just don't have that polished finish. I think the decision to go 3D was a mistake too, because it forced Peter Jackson to abandon a lot of his practical effects techniques to get his forced perspective shots since he had to use two cameras in all scenes. This resulted in green screens in nearly every scene.The Battle of Five Armies, in particular, feels the most like a CGI cartoon or video game cutscene. Billy Connolly's character, Dain Ironfoot, looks entirely CGI in some scenes. Maybe he wasn't available for reshoots or something. Again, more evidence that the film was rushed.But the biggest problem with the film was in what was left out. They focused on the battle, which is actually just one chapter in the book, but left out pretty much all of the aftermath of the battle, which is actually a pretty large chunk of the book. I was surprised by this because I thought that if they were going to devote a whole movie on the last quarter of the book, you'd think they devote more time to more than just a couple of chapters. I suppose Peter Jackson didn't want people complaining about 'too many endings' like they did in Return of the King. But without those resolutions, the movie really feels incomplete, and truly does feel unfinished. There are too many loose ends.All that negativity aside, I actually do think this is a really good movie and I did enjoy it quite a bit. There were a lot of great moments. When Peter Jackson stayed true to the source material, he nailed it. There were some great duels in the battle itself, some of the action sequences were stunning, although I could have done with a few less Alfrid hijinks and a bit more Master of Laketown's hijinks (he was a better character and his character's hijinks actually WERE in the book, whereas Alfrid was made up for the film).I also am happy he adapted parts of the appendices of Lord of the Rings for these movies. The Dol Goldur scenes were a welcome addition and I was really happy to see them. It was great seeing Saruman (Christopher Lee) in action with the White Council.Overall, yeah, I enjoyed it, but there were a lot of things that bugged me. I'm holding out hope that the Extended Edition will fix a lot of the problems I had with it. Since they have 11 months to tinker with the film before it comes out, maybe they'll have time to properly finish it.",7,1,4,4 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best of the Prequels
","It's not perfect, but it's a really good film. By the time this movie was released, Star Wars fans were so divided that it was hard to get a level headed review out of anyone. When I initially reviewed this, I gave it a perfect 10. This film does not deserve a perfect 10, but you have to understand, I had just come off from seeing it and was so excited that I had overlooked the flaws and only reported the things I loved about this movie.And there is plenty to love. This is the prequel we had all been waiting for. It is the movie that depicts the fall of Anakin Skywalker as he succumbs to the Dark Side. Long time fans of Star Wars had speculated the details of the plot for 25 years before this film was even released, but now we were actually going to see it. Could it possibly live up to our own theories and speculation?For many, it didn't. A lot of Star Wars fans would have preferred a more gradual decline to the dark side, one that took place across all three films, and one that showed him hunting down and destroying the Jedi over a longer period of time. This is how many fans pictured it in their heads. But Lucas had messed things up by starting episode I with Anakin as a little kid. Now he only had one more film to show his transformation to Darth Varder. How was Lucas going to do this in one movie?The simple answer is that he didn't. Anakin's fall was actually, in many ways, anti-climactic, as was the destruction of the Jedi. This further divided the already divided fans, with many crying foul and calling this the final nail in the Star Wars coffin. And while I sympathize with their frustration, I found this unexpected final twist to be quite compelling.Anakin's fall was more of an emotional one. He did not gradually become the unstoppable battle hardened monster after years of fighting in the Clone Wars. He was a troubled, sensitive, fearful, and somewhat whiny young man who simply was afraid to lose the people and things he loved. And in his desperate attempt to hold on, he lost everything. Anakin weeps, he whines, he moans. Yes, he is a powerful Jedi, he is a great warrior, he is brave on the battlefield. But he is also a pathetic man, a fearful man. He is unable to let go. He is emotionally weak. And this is what leads him to the Dark Side. This is what brings about his downfall.Also interesting is the downfall of the Jedi Order itself. The Jedi Order is as much to blame for their downfall as Anakin is. They had grown complacent, arrogant, and insensitive to the needs of the more troubled members of their order, like Anakin. They had the opportunity to save Anakin's mother in the ten years after bringing him into their order, yet they did nothing. Their rules on forbidding attachment are also questionable, and may have led to more problems than it was meant to prevent.All of these themes were compelling and helped deepen and enrich the story. There were many great emotional moments in this movie that almost brought me to tears. And, of course, the action, visuals, and score are top notch and truly Star Wars in quality. This is, by far, the best of the prequels, and it almost lives up to the quality of the original trilogy.Still there are some flaws that I cannot look passed. The biggest is the dialog. While some of it is good, there are a lot of really awkward and downright bad lines in this movie. Star Wars was never known for its great dialog, but it was rarely as embarrassing as some of the lines in this movie. Often, a good actor can make a bad line sound good. Alec Guinness and Harrison Ford could pull this off in the old movies, but, unfortunately, Hayden Christenson and Natalie Portman are not their equals. I do have to say, though, that Ewan McGreggor was excellent in his portrayal of young Obi Wan Kenobi, and he was probably the only one of the protagonists that could make bad lines sound good. And then you had veterans like Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee, who always pull off a great performance. McDiarmid in particular was great in this in his role as Chancellor Palpatine.This is the most action heavy Star Wars movie ever made, and it gets exhausting. There's a lightsaber dual on a Volcanic planet near then end that goes on for five minutes too long and loses the audience at certain times. A lot of the cgi seems superfluous, and it detaches the audience from the action. Unfortunately a lot of action movies have since had the same problem and it's a trend that I hope will reverse itself soon. Mindless action that goes on for twenty minutes does not make a film more exciting.This is also the darkest of the Star Wars movies, which is not a bad thing. I'm glad that Lucas wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty and even allowed this film to get a PG-13 rating, the only Star Wars movie to have such a rating. There are some very violent scenes in this movie, and it's not recommended that young children see this. Wait until they're 11 or 12. Kids will love this movie regardless though.Overall, this is a great movie that has its flaws, but is definitely worth seeing. The flaws do kind of stick out the more you see it, but I actually don't mind re-watching it as much as I do the other two prequels. It still doesn't quite hold up as well as the originals, but then, very few movies do.",9,4,7,14 August 2010
Inception," Good premise, but when you break it down it doesn't make much sense.
","Inception is a good scifi action movie with a complicated plot that, at times, doesn't seem to make much sense. The Acting was great, the characters were all likable and well portrayed. The look of the film was great, the sets, special effects, action, direction ... all top notch. The premise was also quite intriguing and original. The story focuses around a group of 'dream invaders' who specialize in constructing dreams for people for the purpose of stealing or implanting information and ideas from them from within the dream. At times it's hard to tell when they're in a dream or in the real world and I admit, in the beginning, the film was a bit baffling. But the viewer who pays close attention is rewarded for his attentiveness when it starts to make more sense a quarter of the way through this film.A lot of people have compared this movie to the Matrix because it explores the idea of the 'real world' verses an artificially created 'dream world'. And in that respect they are very similar. But whereas The Matrix focused more on a conflict between man and machine, Inception focuses on the conflict between a man and his difficulty with letting go. The true strength of this film is in its characterization. Both the protagonist, Cobb, and the antagonist, Fischer, are very well written and portrayed characters that you feel genuine empathy for, especially towards the end. But where Inception surpasses The Matrix in terms of characterization, it falls short of the Matrix in its success at making a consistent plot.In science fiction or fantasy, it is not required to remain consistent to the laws of science, but it is required to remain consistent to ones own constructed rules. This film constructs a set of rules for itself that, when held under scrutiny, don't make much sense. Indeed, the confusing narrative often breaks its own rules in order to suit the plot. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if not for the fact that much of the tension of the film revolves around the fact that the characters' lives are in danger due to these often contradicting rules.It is no surprise that one of the biggest complaints heard from people walking out of this film was that it was too confusing. Some may argue that these viewers did not pay close enough attention to the film, and some may even be elitist enough to assume that they were simply not intelligent enough to follow the plot. While this may be the case, I try to reserve such judgments when I can. But it cannot be denied that much of the fault lies with the plot of the film itself.Much of the mechanics of the dream world levels and architecture are poorly explained at times, and there are fundamental contradictions with some of the rules it lays out for us. Often times we're left wondering what exactly is at stake for our characters, and why we should care whether or not they succeed. The somewhat purposefully unclear ending may account for some of these inconsistencies and on repeated viewings the mechanics may make more sense. But the lack of tension during the more climactic scenes due to the ambiguous nature of what's at stake is still a major problem with this film.These problems aside, it is a film worth seeing probably more than once. But I think the hype machine may have given this one a little more credit than it deserves.",7,2,5,4 August 2010
Prometheus," Great 3D experience
","Prometheus is an entertaining and thrilling Ridley Scott feature in the vein of Alien (1979). Indeed, it's so similar to Alien that it may or may not serve as a prequel. It's not sold as a prequel, though, since the film is good enough to stand on its own, and serves more as an updated retelling of the 1979 thriller with a few new twists and superb CG special effects. The 3D trend in recent years has been met with mixed reactions. In some films it works well, in others not so much. This film definitely lies in the former category. The 3D effects are excellent, and at least on par with 2010's Avatar.But, ignoring the effects, how is the movie itself? Honestly there is nothing bad I can say about this movie except that a lot of it you've probably seen before. It follows the same formula as past Alien films. A ship full of people wake up from stasis, arrive on a planet, explore a bit too deeply, and wake up a sleeping monster that picks them off one at a time. Unlike Alien (1979), it's pretty easy to predict who will be the last one standing. It's not completely predictable though. There are a few surprises here and there, particularly towards the end, that will stand out in your mind. There are also some very memorable and tense scenes that you haven't seen anything like before. There's one claustrophobic scene, in particular, that really stands out as tense and horrifically cringe inducing, particularly if you've had surgery before. This scene is probably the best part of the movie, as I don't think anything like it has been done before. At least not done this well.The film is more or less well written and well acted. The characters aren't particularly great, but they aren't bad either. The overall premise isn't particularly original, but there's enough new elements to keep it interesting. It's a competent film, but the biggest problem with it is that the story really didn't go far enough. While there weren't any noticeable plot-holes, I still felt that some things were missing. Perhaps they had planned more that never made it to the final cut. For example, Guy Pearce's character is a very old man. While the make-up job is good, It's not too difficult to tell that it's a young man in old man make-up. I had thought, the whole time, that we'd eventually see him as a young man at some point. We didn't, which led me to question the reason why they didn't just hire an old actor. Still, the ending left room for a sequel, so perhaps there's more to that story to come.But the idea of the sequel brings up another point. If this is a prequel, than wouldn't the original Alien film already be a sequel. Is this film a prequel, reboot or standalone film? The answer is yes. It is all of those things. A standalone prequel may sound like an oxymoron but all it means is that it works as both a standalone movie and a prequel to the original 1979 film. This seems to be the trend in recent years. Instead of making full-on prequels like Star Wars, filmmakers prefer to avoid the baggage and go halfway between prequel/reboot or completely standalone movie. X-Men First Class, Star Trek and Rise of the Planet of the Apes are examples of this. This trend started with video games, in particular the constant string Zelda prequels/reboots dating back to 1991's A Link to the Past. It allows the writers to expand a franchise without having to be limited by the continuity of that franchise. They also have the benefit of drawing in fans of the franchise and attracting a new audience that may or may not have seen the older films. In essence, it's like having your cake and eating it too. The downside to this approach is that it makes the actual canon of the franchise very subjective and ambiguous and causes all sorts of exhausting internet arguments among the continuity nerds.Overall I give it an 7/10 and recommend it to people who are fans of the horror/thriller/slasher/science fiction genres. It's got a good amount of gore, so don't take small children. And, if you like 3D, see it in 3D, this one's worth the extra few bucks. Just don't expect anything ground breaking.",7,0,0,8 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," Really Good, but please make up your mind about the movie continuity, Marvel
","This might have been the best X-Men movie yet. I say might, because there are some serious problems with the continuity of this movie series that has been bothering me since X-Men Origins:Wolverine came out.It seems that Marvel can't make up its mind whether it wants to reboot the franchise, or establish an episodic series of movies with their prequels (a la Star Wars). I can see why they're struggling with this decision, because there are benefits and drawbacks to both. The benefit to a true prequel, is that the narrative of the story remains intact across all movies, and you could watch them in order and experience a complete story. Comic book fans love this type of story telling, and for X-Men, which is, first and foremost, a comic book series with a rich history going all the way back to 1963, this is the most obvious and sensible way to tell the story.But prequels are very difficult to pull off successfully. Unless the whole storyline is pre-written before anything gets released, it's very difficult to retro-actively tell a backstory without running into continuity errors. Since the ending of the story is already written in stone, you are writing yourself into a corner every time you try to tell a prequel story. And since films are limited by a number of other factors (running time, budget, actor availability, etc.), the difficulty of pulling this off increases. Often the quality of the story is sacrificed in the name of continuity, which can lead to some very convoluted story lines that would turn off any new viewer immediately.Because of these difficulties, a reboot is often preferred when doing a movie that's supposed to take place before the events in the already established series. Batman Begins did this and they had a lot of success with it. The writer and director has a lot more freedom with a reboot, and can tell the story they want to tell without being constrained by what was already released.But Marvel can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to reboot their franchises or tell a true prequel. I first had inklings of this when they released the Incredible Hulk in 2008, which seemed to ignore the previous 2005 Hulk movie, yet at the same time sort of continued the story. Then in 2009 with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which was supposed to be a prequel, it was clear they were ignoring some aspects of the original X-Men films. One particular inconsitency was Tyler Maine's Sabretooth, who never recognized Wolverine in X-Men 1 (2000), but with X-Men Origins:Wolverine we're supposed to believe that Lieve Schreiber's Sabretooth was Wolverine's brother and closest friend for nearly 100 years. So was it a reboot? Or was it just a mistake? Most likely it was neither. They wanted to tell the story they wanted to tell and purposely ignored the fact that it conflicted with what was established before so they simply retconned some aspects. It's the middle ground approach, and comic book fans know that it's sloppy storytelling.Without spoiling anything I'll just say that X-Men:First Class has similar problems with it's continuity with the other films. You're never sure if it's supposed to be a reboot or a prequel. It's a retcon, pure and simple. Now, the anal retentive aspect of my nature is infuriated by this. With comic books that have been going on for decades, like the X-Men, some retcons are forgiven. They're necessary evils when you have hundreds of issues or episodes to keep track of. But I'm less forgiving with this movie series. There have only been four movies before this one. It's not like the X-Men movie series is so vast that they need to retcon it as much as they do. They were already retconning after the third film. It's lazy, and the inconsistencies are so obvious that you don't have to be a fan to notice it. Just watch each of the movies one time and you'll spot them.But, at the same time, the less anal half of my nature is more forgiving of X-Men: First Class. Why? Because it was actually a really good movie. Honestly, the story was excellent and entertaining and the characters well portrayed. I was loving James McAvoy's portrayal of Xavier in particular. And, most of all, it was true to the heart and soul of X-Men, a comic book series I have fond memories of reading as a kid. I was less forgiving of the Wolverine movie, since it was not as good and had just as many continuity problems.X-Men:First Class was really good. But it could have been great. If they had done a true reboot they could have made a better film. For one, they could have used the original X-Men team (Cyclops, Angel, Beast, Iceman, Marvel Girl). Cyclops, in particular, I felt should have been one of the first students. In the comics, his role is iconic as the leader and most loyal and longstanding member of the X-Men. I don't feel any of the films did his character justice. Instead with the exception of Beast, we got a bunch of minor X-Men characters, many of whom were never actually X-Men members (some were villains) to represent the first X-Men team. A few of them I didn't even recognize as ever having been in the comics. It still works, but for fans of X-Men, it just seems ... off. And since they pretty much rewrote the history they established in the other movies with all of the retconning they did, it simply wasn't necessary. It could have been a great reboot. But as it stands it's just a really good film.",8,0,1,10 June 2011
X2: X-Men United," And so it Begins ...
","The first X-Men film was a good movie, no doubt, but it was a very safe movie too.  Essential characters were introduced, the general premise was dealt out, and a little battle ensued at the end.  Now that we know the basics, it's time to really start the story.At least I hope that's what they plan to do.  For those new to it all: X-Men began in 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  Back then comics were simpler, geared more towards kids.  Story lines took place over multiple comic books infrequently, and things generally set itself right by the end of the issue. In other words, for the most part, it was episodic.  But when Chris Claremont took over as writer in 1975, things really started to get interesting, and, I must admit, complicated.  I often wonder how much he had planned out in advance.  Suffice it to say, by the time the Pheonix Saga got underway in the late 70's, there was no turning back.  X-Men became a soap opera.  A very complex science fiction soap opera at that.  And it seemed to grow in complexity as it went on.  The stakes got higher, more and more characters came in replacing old ones, more X-issues were spun off eventually climaxing in what is possibly one of the best superhero comic arcs out there: The Age of Apocalypse (1995ish).  It probably should have ended after that, but it didn't.  But what a great 20 years of comic book writing that was.  I would have never thought it possible to capture its epicness on film.But with X-Men 2, it is clear that they have indeed upped the stakes.  The story is much bigger, the movie's much longer, there are many more characters, many more mini-plots, **spoiler **
and it ends with a cliffhanger!  (If you don't know what I mean, let me just say I think I saw a Pheonix rising right before the credits ran).  Needless to say I was thrilled, but also nervous.  Are they actually attempting the Pheonix Saga?  How far will they take it?  Will they actually have the wisdom to stop when it ends?  And more importantly, where will it end?  Most of the loose ends weren't tied up until 20 years (240 issues) later.
** end spoiler **The X-Men movies could be the greatest long running movie series in history, a pretty good trilogy, or a terrible disappointment.  If they manage to write a good long term story arc loosely based on the comics, and have the wisdom to stop the series when the story finishes, I'm sure Singer and most of the cast will see it through to its end.  To Hollywood I say the audience is hooked, our attention spans will last, don't worry about that.  Just don't give up the enthusiasm, and don't give up on these movies to soon.  I don't want this series to fade into mediocrity like Batman and Superman did.This movie had great action, great special effects, great characters, great character development, and an incredible plot.  But a plot that is only great in the context of its sequels and prequel.  This is a good thing. Many would consider this a bad thing, but those are probably people that didn't like 'The Two Towers' because it didn't stand on its own.  The epicness of the story arc is what got me hooked on the comics in the first place.  We have longer attention spans than you think, hollywood.  I think 3 more movies should be enough.  And don't be afraid to surprise us comic fans either.Looking forward to X-Men 3.  Go see this movie!",10,0,0,2 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best of the 3, and the most faithful of the 3
","I've already given the other two movies in this trilogy a 10, and since you can't go any higher, this one deserves at least a 10 as well.  The difference being that, originally, I didn't give the other movies a 10, Fellowship got an 8, and Two Towers got a 9.  But after seeing the Extended editions of both movies, I had to give them both tens.  The Extended versions were such big improvements that they actually fixed every original problem I had with the theatrical versions.But this one gets a 10 right from the start.  I can immediately tell you that this was the most faithful adaptation of a Tolkien book.  There are many omissions (that I expect to see put back in the Extended edition), and a few minor changes, but on the whole, this is the book brought to screen. And it's breathtakingly good.  Everything great about the previous movies gets multiplied by 10 in this one.  I don't want to go into too many details because I don't want to spoil anything, but In my opinion, this is the single greatest movie ever made.It had only one flaw, and that was that Saruman was not in the movie. Normally I wouldn't give this a pass, how could Jackson leave such an important plot point dangling?  It almost made me want to drop a point from my rating, but the movie was so incredible that I couldn't dare.  I'm also comforted to know that doubtless Saruman will be in the Extended Edition, which I expect will be over 4 hours long.  I suspect, that after seeing the extended edition, I'm going to have to give this film an 11.  These films require that extra umph on the scale.  They go up to 11.",10,0,0,17 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Like all Great Classics, it's worth everyone's while to see these films.
","I tend to find that the people who have not seen these films yet are people that assume they will not like it, or feel intimidated by its epic scale, running time, and/or feel turned off by the fantasy genre in general.Do not let this deter you from seeing these films, they are definitely worth your time for one viewing as they are great movies, and destined to be classics.  I would go as far to say that they are the best book adaptations to film, but this is, of course, all a matter of opinion.  (And as a long time fan of the books, I'm a bit biased).First of all, I highly reccomend seeing the extended editions of these films as opposed to the theatrical versions.  You may want to wait for the EE of RotK to come out on DVD before watching these films.  The Extended Editions are simply far superior versions because it more closely captures the pacing, and feel of the books.  There is also more depth of character and development introduced in the Extended Editions lacking from the shorter theatrical versions.  Whereas the theatrical versions are simple, but good action/special effect movies, the Extended Editions are grand epic adventures that have far more depth and intelligence to them.Secondly, unless you are watching them for the first at a LotR buttnumbathon type party, I do not reccomend watching them all at once.  All together, these films clock in at about 12 hours not including breaks.  Your rear will probably be hating its existence by the time you get to Return of the King.Instead, I reccomend watching it small doses.  The Extended DVD Editions split the films over 2 discs and are perfectly designed for 6 90-120 minute episodic viewings.  This is the length of an average film, and allow for much less of a time commitment.  Still, I reccomend you not wait too long before seeing the next part, as these films essentially are one story with many characters, place names, and plot lines that can be easily forgotten. It's best to watch one DVD per night over 6 nights.  Treat it like a really good TV mini-series that you don't want to miss each night.Lastly, turn off the lights, pump up the volume, and TURN ON THE SUBTITLES. There are many strange words in these films, and it helps if you can see them written in front of you.  The films are pretty easy to follow, but the plot is also complex and deep.  You will enjoy the films more if you understand as much as you can, as one of the main appeals of Tolkien's story is its attention to detail.I can guarantee you that if you give these films a chance and take my reccomendations to heart you will not be disappointed. Enjoy.",10,1,5,25 August 2004
The Matrix," Science Fiction at its best, and great action too
","For those of you Science Fiction fans who have not yet seen the matrix: For God's sake why?  I was lucky enough to catch this in theaters opening night. I had no idea what to expect.  What I got was by far the best SF movie of 90's.  And the best part was, it was the best action movie too.This movie is very loosely based on a Harlan Ellison short story titled 'I have no mouth and I must scream', considered by many to be one of the classic SF stories.  The characters and plot are completely different, but the basic theme is essentially the same.  Why does the world not seem real? What is real?  Is this all a dream?  This is certainly not the first time movies have tackled this theme, but it is certainly the first time the theme was handled in this way.  This movie is a very original piece of work.  It's influence will be felt for decades.This movie has a very strong story, great characters, good acting, great special effects, incredible fight scenes, and incredible all around execution.  See it even you're not into SF or action.",10,0,1,16 October 2003
Cloud Atlas," A Potentially Great Film Ruined By Poor Structure
","I never read the book, but was intrigued by this movie because I had heard the book was very good. I don't have as much time to read as I used to, so I watched it, sort of liked it but found it kind of tedious to get through due to all the jumping around from story to story. Seeing the different actors as different characters was more distracting than anything, and the film was paced too quickly allow the average viewer to pick up all the complexities and themes the author was likely trying to convey.In the end, I found that it had a couple of good and original story- lines (particularly the Escape from the Nursing home plot, and the gay composer plot was good) but I found the other stories to be of the mostly bland and formulaic sort we've seen many times before (ie. guy finds out slavery is bad, investigative reporter uncovers a plot by an evil corporation, bladerunner/soilent green hybrid plot, and a fairly standard post-apocalyptic adventure story plot). While all of the story lines were entertaining, you never have enough time to become invested in each story or characters because the movie constantly jumped around between the six different plots. Yes, there are six different plots in this two and half hour movie, and therein lies there problem.After having watched the movie, I looked up the plot of the book because I was curious to see how the author handled the story. According to Wikipedia, In the book:'Each tale is revealed to be a story that is read (or observed) by the main character in the next. The first five stories are interrupted at a key moment. After the sixth story, the other five stories are returned to and closed, in reverse chronological order, and each ends with the main character reading or observing the chronologically previous work in the chain. Eventually, readers end where they started, with Adam Ewing in the nineteenth century South Pacific. Each story contains a document, movie or tradition that also appears in a previous story. It shows how history not only repeats itself, but also connects to people in all time periods and places.'For the life of me, I can't figure out why the directors didn't structure the movie this way. It would have worked far better. The audience would have been able to become more immersed in each story- line, and the connections between each plot would have been more apparent. As it stands, upon one viewing, it seems more like a mess that tries too hard to be clever. So then you might say 'you have to watch it more than once to 'get it''. I don't want to have to watch a film more than once 'get it'. I paid close attention the first time. I'd rather spend my time doing something other than watching an average movie more than once. It's a sign of poor story telling if you make it so that you have to watch a film more than once in order to 'get it'.This film could have been so much better if it was structured like the book and took its time to actually tell the stories and develop the characters. Instead it was paced like an action movie. I felt like I was watching Inception at times (another annoying film that you 'had to watch more than once in order to 'get it''). Perhaps it was structured this way due to a limited running time. But why even attempt to merge six completely different stories into a single movie in the first place? It would lend itself much better to a mini-series. Game of Thrones is the perfect example of a book adaptation that proved to be an immense success when told at a television show's pace. I feel like this movie would have benefited greatly if it was separated episodically like that.Before you respond to this with elitist statements like: 'I got it first watch, you're just too dumb to understand catch all the intricacies,' or 'the average viewer is a moron, that's why they need all the themes and messages spoon fed to them. This film treats the audience like it has intelligence and allows to viewer to draw their own conclusions.' I just want to pre-emptively say 'no you're wrong'. The reason I think this film was a disappointment was precisely because it treated the audience like morons who just wanted to see fast paced action with no deep exploration of the themes or characters. It didn't give the audience a chance to think about any of the themes because it was too busy rapidly jumping between story-lines focusing more on action scenes rather than any sort character development. Supposedly the Tom Hanks soul goes through a whole redemption arc that I never caught because the film never actually focused on it. I haven't even read the book, yet, on first viewing, it felt like none of the major themes of the book were explored with any sort of depth. It's a shame because it seems like the book is a good one worth reading. I'm probably not going to read it now though since the movie spoiled the plots for me.That being said, I would say this film is worth a redbox rental at least. It has some good acting and some nice cinematography and special effects. It looks very pretty. The action is also quite good, although I wish there was a little less focus on the action, and more of a focus on the philosophical themes and characters.",6,28,40,18 May 2013

Warcraft," You'll like it if you're already familiar with the Lore
","Movies based on video games tend to not be so good, Warcraft might be an exception. Nevertheless it seems to have gotten a lot of bad press. I noticed that most of the critics who gave the film negative reviews were people who have never played, or were were not familiar with the games.I've been a long-time fan of the Warcraft series since the second game came out in 1996. Since then I've played through all of the Warcraft RTS games, and was a World of Warcraft subscriber for several years. I was one of the few WoW players to earn the achievement 'lore master' for completing all of the quests in the primary zones vanilla WoW (and the first few expansions). So I'm pretty well versed on the story.I did get kind of burned out on World of Warcraft after Wrath of the Lich King. I canceled my subscription soon after reaching the level cap. I would resubscribe for brief periods here and there just to see what's going on, but for the most part I was done with WoW. Still, I'm a fan of the game and lore, so I guess I'm probably the target demographic for this film.The film was pretty faithful to the lore of the games (and the lore of the games has, itself changed over time since the original warcraft ms-dos that came out in 1994). The film is basically about the first war from that first game Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, focusing on the characters from the first game: Garona, Lothar (probably the main characters), Medhiv, King Llane, and Blackhand. Now if they limited themselves to focusing on just these characters and limited themselves to sticking to just the story of the first game, the film, while being pretty simple, would have probably worked better for those new to the story of warcraft. There would have been fewer characters. Fewer simultaneous plots, and they would have been able to focus on developing the stories and characters and easing people into the fantasy via more relatable protagonists.But there's one major problem with doing it this way. The story of the first game was very human-centric. The POV of the orcs was told entirely from the half-orc, Garona in the instruction booklet that came with the first game, and it didn't portray the orcs in a very good light at all. On the contrary, it portrayed the orcs as evil warlike savages with almost no redeeming qualities. You actually don't get a deeper understanding of the orcs until Warcraft 2 when we are introduced Gul'Dan, Ogrim Doomhammer and Kil'Jaeden. And it's not until Warcraft 3 that we actually start to view the orcs in a more sympathetic light with the introduction of the orcs Gromm Hellscream and, of course, the warchief Thrall, son of Durotan, a character who was not introduced until World of Warcraft (and plays a major role in the most recent expansion). In the film, Durotan is, in fact, one of the main protagonists.So, to make a long story short, the problem with this film is exactly that, they're trying to make a long, complicated and lore rich story with a lot of characters, into a short two hour film. Perhaps if it was split into two films, one that told the story from the humans POV, and another that told the story from the Orcs POV it would have worked better, after all that's how the story was told in the original game. It split the story up into two separate narratives. And, in the end, isn't that always what war comes down to? Two opposing narratives competing for dominance. This movie tries to to be sympathetic to both sides of the conflict at the same time. And as result the audience can't get as invested in any of the characters or the conflicts they are engaged in. It loses the sense of urgency and drama. When you try to please everyone, you please no one.Well ... that's not true. The film did please me. I enjoyed seeing the lore I've grown up with over the passed 20 years come to life on the screen. I did enjoy the spectacle and the special effects as well. It was a cool movie all things considered. But I understand why people who weren't familiar with the games walked away from this one disappointed.",7,0,3,17 June 2016
