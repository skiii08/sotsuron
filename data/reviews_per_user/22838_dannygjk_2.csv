Antz," goof goof
","Actually the so-called goof is not a goof. Ants will drown in water in about the same time as a person will. When I was a kid I studied insects, etc. Also I performed the experiment for myself on several ants for varying times using a watch. The person who said ants can survive for weeks under water is wrong.btw, why is it essential that I supply at least 10 lines of text!? That is a strange arbitrary requirement. lol, I feel like I am completing an assignment in school. I may as well supply another fact to satisfy the 10 line requirement. Spiders are not insects, as insects have 6 legs-spiders have 8.ps. that is stated in the factual errors and should be corrected :)",Null,0,0,27 July 2008
Inglourious Basterds," spelling
","I can't believe all the sites have repeated someone's misspelling. Unless I'm wrong and it's deliberately misspelled? If so, why!? I guess I'm just too rigid and we should spell all words however we want. LOL, but imagine trying to read a newspaper if there are 10 acceptable spellings for every word! Hmmm, I'm sometimes guilty of deliberate misspelling, but normally only to try to do an accent in text, eg. 'You bastid!'. (Breaking up soapbox and throwing the pieces, pieces, peaces, pisces, on a fire) ;POnce upon a time a comment needed more lines. Sooooo, Danny added more lines and everyone lived happily ever after, lol.",Null,1,13,20 August 2009
