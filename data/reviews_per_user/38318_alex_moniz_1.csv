Ali," Great Movie, exactly what I expected
",I thought 'Ali' was a great movie.  Will Smith is awesome as Ali.  This movie was meant to take a biography style.  Anyone who went and expected actions and twisting plot is a COMPLETE IDIOT.  The trailer should have shown enough about the movie and how it is meant to give the audience a better perspective of the life behind the boxer.  The only problem I had with the movie was there was no dates to tell us when these events happened and how far apart each one was.  I know Ali didn't fight for 3 years but the movie didn't seem to give me that impression.  It seem there was no break in time between events.,Null,0,0,30 December 2001
