The New World," Boooring
","I rented this movie, and before doing so, I went on IMDb, 7.6 ! Not bad ! I wish I read the 1 vote comments before, because all the ones I read after I pout it back was sooooo true. Yes, it can be poetic, but this new-age kind of wavy moves, it's so unreal. Like when Poc shoes the eyes, or water or whatever, if you try to describe something like she does, I can tell you that Capt. Smith is VERY intelligent to understand what she means. When you want to learn a language, you usually show the thing, not describe it sophistically (I don't find the right word, I'm not English speaking) That makes no sense. So we didn't even look at ti till the end. We stopped after 45 min. Like someone else said, if you don't like action movie, just go and look at this one.",1,12,21,20 May 2006
The Good Shepherd," too Long, slow, boring
","I wouldn't say that it is a bad film, but De Niro is better when he is on the other side of the camera. This film is way to long, with the same kind of scenes all along ( camera on somebody - still - no dialog - we are waiting - what's gonna happen next ? oh ! just a phrase with 3 words...) and besides, it's hard to understand what's going on with all the flashbacks coming and going. You must have a paper and pencil to record all the dates and times to remember when things happened.And saying that this film is a thriller..... well, depends of course of the definition of thriller. A positive point is that I think it depicts quite well the atmosphere of the time, suspicion everywhere, even your parents, always look behind you.I'm glad I didn't go to the movies to see it.Question : what's Joe Pesci doing in this film ??????",4,1,4,9 April 2007
