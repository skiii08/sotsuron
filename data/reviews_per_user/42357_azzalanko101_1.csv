Captain Phillips," What a journey...
","Wow, this film takes you on an amazing journey as you experience many emotions throughout it such as happiness, terror, thrill, sadness and shock. The film has such good acting done by the actors, especially Tom Hanks. He makes you feel what he is feeling through his voice, actions and expressions. I really didn't think he would pull it off like he did. The film was very intense and terrifying and this was captured perfectly with the music and camera angles, sending your heart rate through the roof. The intense moments where the right length but the drama was a bit dragged out as the story continued.As the film progressed the feeling of helplessness became so clear to the viewer as they were in the middle of the ocean with little help available. This feeling added to the thrill and terror, and i have no idea how the crew would have been feeling during this experience as it was scary watching it.The camera at the beginning of the film was very unstable and quite dizzying to view, I'm not sure if this is what the director was intending or they didn't realize it was an issue.This film is an excellent film and one of the most thrilling films i have ever viewed and it kept you on the edge of your seat. If you are after a journey that is full of emotions and suspense, this is the film for you! - 9/10",9,4,8,21 October 2013
