The Rock," *yawn*
","I hope i won't be cursed for this comment. You may find what you may call 'Profanity, obscenities, or spiteful remarks', ;-P and here they are: This one is ultra-pathetic Hollywood-bullsh!t as seen so many times before. I didn't even like the car-races (seen Blues Brothers, the first and only?), and the plot itself is just - ridiculous. Teenagers might like this one for its undoubted action-factor, but you have to leave your brain outside the cinema or inside the Videodrome. Lots of explosions, running countdowns and weird pathetic moral mixed with a bunch of Kitsch doesn't do a good movie, imho.",4,20,36,29 January 2002
