Antz," A Modern Classic
",This one will go down in history as the 'Citizen Kane' of computer-generated movies.  It will sit on the shelf between 'Casablanca' and 'The Godfather.' Flawless.  ANYBODY can watch this movie and be thoroughly entertained.,10,0,0,7 October 2000
Citizen Kane," A Classic's Classic.
",What can I say about Citizen Kane?  It's the ultimate classic film of all time.  It rivals Citizen Kane as the greatest movie ever made.  Wait... it **IS** Citizen Kane... there is no rival!!!  You have to see this one on the big screen to truly appreciate it.,10,0,1,7 October 2000
Annie Hall," Classic Woody
","What can I say about the original, ultimate Woody movie?  It's a classic. You must have this movie in your top ten list or people give you that strange 'what-no-annie-hall-in-your-top-ten-list?' look.  Or the 'what-a-caveman--must-be-a-jerry-springer-fan' look.  Or they just walk away and stop looking at you completely.",10,0,1,7 October 2000
