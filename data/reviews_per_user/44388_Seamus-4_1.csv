The Blair Witch Project," Perhaps I'm too jaded, but I was largely disappointed
","I saw this film last night based on the recommendation of a co-worker and Roger Ebert's four star rating.I wasn't impressed, frightened, or absorbed with the movie at all.  Perhaps I am too filled with other frightening movies (I still get the creeps watching the original Frankenstein) or maybe it is all the hype surrounding this movie that had raised my expectations to an impossible level, but I just felt flat at the end.  When the credits came up a voice in the row of high school kids behind me said 'That's it?'Go with no expectations and some dramamine and you may be entertained.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
