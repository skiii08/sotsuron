Hereditary," A medium movie with nothing to give.
","This movie left me bad impressions with the low acting skills of the actors, the slow action and the pointless ,boring dialogues. Toni Collette's overacting did matters worse and as for Alex Wolff watching him cry was so annoying and fake you couldn't stop wanting him to be killed in this movie. Some good jump scares but a very long film that could have been half an hour shorter with better cast.",4,0,3,31 August 2018
It Chapter Two," Boooo
","This movie was horrible with nothing to offer to the viewer. Not speaking about a very bad written script, a crazy cinematography, mediocre acting I want to emphasize on the very bad CGI. I think it is sad such an expensive project to have so bad CGI. Poorly done. I have watched thousands of movies and I am among the 1000 top imdb voters. This movie (this crap) is definitely one of the worst I have ever seen.",1,1,1,14 February 2020
