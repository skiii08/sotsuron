Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Very funny
","WFRR is a very funny film, cleverly mixing live action with cartoon animation.Unfortunately though, time has not been that kind on the animation - its looking dated and not very detailed, with not very accurate lip-syncing.The live action parts are great though - Bob Hoskins is great, being able to create a straight face all the way though. Christopher Lloyd is also great as the mad baddie.Over all, a great film that could do with being re-made, with CGI animation (which is the way forward).",Null,0,1,5 September 2004
Hot Fuzz," Great
","Its a very funny comedy film, with quite a few gory bits in. Having never seen Shaun of the Dead, I didn't know what to expect, but if you aren't squeamish, you should like it.Its got plenty of action - there are very few boring bits, where not much happens. Unfortunately, the main problem with this film is the camera work - once the action gets going, the final shoot-out contains lots of fast framed shots, which makes it hard to understand whats happening.The ending bucks the usual trend for baddies being killed, which is good to see. It could be seem as somewhat more realistic.",8,1,2,30 April 2007
Cloverfield," Just about bearable
","The first thing to note is the 'Shakey-cam' filming is very off-putting. Most users of hand-held recorders to tend to make sure that what they film can be viewed without the viewers deciding that the contents of their stomach's need to be examine by the floor. This does make it hard to see what is supposed to be going on.Next thing is that the the characters aren't particularly interesting. Nor are they particularly bright : Trying to use a lift in a badly damaged build ? Stopping under a bridge when there is a slightly miffed monster around ? These are the actions of Homer Simpson, and hopefully not the average American, although saying that... One good thing about the person using the camcorder becoming a monster sandwich : The camera work is a bit more steady.I didn't find it particularly frightening, nor interesting. There was too much talk and not enough action, particularly around the monster. I only saw it to the end to see what the monster looked like.Its a film to watch once and then forget all about - or perhaps buy it for someone you don't like.",4,2,3,7 June 2010
Alien vs. Predator," Pretty good film
","I was expecting a lot worse, but it is pretty good, although does suffer from being made a 15 instead of an 18 - a lot of the gory detail was missed.Aside from one major battle half-way through the film, which was very corny, the action was pretty good and quite intense. The final battle at the end was especially good.Some of the fight scenes were a bit too blurry, resulting in you wondering what was going on. Bullet-time also makes a single appearance too...The CGI was good, especially the Predators ship.I certainly would like to see a sequel, especially if the proper rating of 18 is used.",Null,1,2,8 November 2004
Happy Feet," Good film
","This isn't always an easy film to watch - at the start, the harsh living conditions of penguins is shown and then later attacks by seals and whales (who have very nasty open wounds), is joined by Mumbles inability to fit into the colony of penguins and at a low ebb when put in a zoo along with various other penguins who have lost their mind through boredom (one penguin talks in the same non-emotional way like the computer from 2001 - 'Try the water, Dave! Its real').Aside from the many bleak and downcast times there are some pretty funny moments including the dancing, a small penguin Guru (being choked by the plastic from a 6 pack) and 5 other smaller penguins (probably Snares) who befriend Mumble and admire his tap-dancing abilities.The animation, was very good. However, the 'camera' work leaved a bit to be desired - it had a tendency to jump around a lot, with an inability to stay fixed on one point of view.Humans at the end (in the zoo and when the main UN discussion meeting takes place) were either live action or very good computer generated ones - it was hard to tell.So, its certainly worth seeing (as long as the people your going with aren't under 6 or so - contrary to what the BBFC say - as its not really suitable for young people). Just don't expect a constant feel-good film - there is little of it present.",8,0,0,11 January 2007
Evil Dead II," Very funny
","A very funny 'horror' film - whether the intention was to be funny is unknown, but the poor special effects and acting leads me to that belief. And don't watch it to be frightened, its low budget and quality certainly wont make you jump...Bruce himself is not too bad occasionally, but aside from the odd bit here and there, he either over acts or doesn't at all.The special effects are poor, the best best bit being the vortex at the end. It was made cheaply and certainly appears so.The ending is a fair surprise and was certainly designed to allow a sequel to be made.",7,0,0,14 February 2005
