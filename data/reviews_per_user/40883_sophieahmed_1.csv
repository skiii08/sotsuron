Skyfall," Brilliant return to Bond's roots
","Totally disagree with the negative reviews. If you look for all the technical inconsistencies/unlikely elements of any film of this type, you will find plenty. Skyfall concentrates on the complex relationship between Bond and M and goes back to Bond's family roots in Scotland - there are plenty of action scenes also - but that for me is what makes it so interesting. The final sequence in Glencoe is spectacular but also very moving. Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are outstanding and there is strong support from a great cast including a very menacing Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Rory Kinnear plus a great theme song. Naomie Harris may not have the strongest storyline but she is a strong attractive Moneypenny and the femme fatale is extremely beautiful. I believe it is one of the best of the whole series.",9,2,6,27 December 2016
