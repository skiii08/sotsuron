The Blair Witch Project," a chilling movie
","When I went to see this movie I didnt think that it would be  that scary, but when I saw it I didnt know what to think but when I started to think about it I was so scared.It was like it got under my skin. If you want to be scared you have to watch and listen everything. There is this image in my head from the end of the movie that I cant erase from my mind. I cant say what it is but when yuo see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about.Belive me I will never go camping in the woods again!!!!",8,1,2,18 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," teen flick for 99
",This the best teen flick of 99. It's soooo funny. It has a little of that There's Something About Mary humor. Go see it even if you are old cause there were these old people sitting in front of me and they were laughing so hard.,10,0,0,8 July 1999
American Pie," a great teen flick
",This movie is so funny.At the beginning you start to giggle and as the movie goes you start to laugh so hard. My fave character is Jason Biggs father. He trys to help his son with sex life and its so funny.GO SEE THE DAMN MOVIE(BUT ITS NOT A 1st DATE MOVIE!!!!!!),9,0,0,22 July 1999
Footloose," a very cute movie
","I am ashame to say this, but I liked this movie. Even that it was made one year later after I was born. I like some of the songs and the dancing even that are way cheesy.",10,1,3,19 August 1999
Edward Scissorhands," The greatest love story ever told
",This is my favorite movie. I love the way that director made the movie with his view of American life.....with blue and green houses etc. I also love the way you don't know what year is it.,Null,0,0,5 June 1999
54," a waste of time
","1st of all I didnt want to see this movie but my friend forced me cause she is crazy about Ryan Phillippie. The story line is boring, the acting is bad. I even went to the bathroom, and belive me I never go to the bathroom during a movie cause I hate to miss anything. The only good thing about this bad movie is that Phillippie is half naked most of the movie.",2,1,5,10 August 1999
Empire Records," a very cool movie
","This movie rocks!! Its so funny , and asomly written. Well I think that that is one of the reasons why is so good. Because its a teen movie written for adults.I mean in the sense that when a teen movie is written its written by the the 50 year old fat man who needs money. But this movie is written by some one who is a teen or a person who not too long a go went through it. Its funny, dramatic and most importantly , real.
I give this movie ********* out of **********. This is because its funny , very good actor, and 3 very cute guys, plus its making fun of my moms generation.",Null,0,1,3 December 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," read the book
",To kill a mockingbird is one of the few books I read in my young life. And its the first book that I liked better then the movie. The book has more detail and more character change. I guess that is why so many people read books. So if you want to see this movie I suggest to you to read the book first.,6,2,6,27 August 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," it deserved an oscar
","This is one of my fave movies because its so beautiful. The acting , the story and the filmmaking. This is how all movies should be made...with heart. The story is so simple but its shaped and made a master piece.If you have not seen this movie, and you are 15 or 55 years old,I'm telling you that you are missing a lot.I give it ********** out of ********** because it moved me so much, the way its showing the human nature, the good and the ugly side of it.",Null,0,0,18 December 1999
Before Sunrise," wrong era
","This movie is so good. The acting ,the story, the directing its all excellent.Its like a movie from the 40s was shoot in the 90s. There are no special effects and monsters. There are these two talented actors acting two people in love.I never before have seen a movie who talks about life as I see it.I think that both Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke did an excellent job because there were times when I forgot I was watching a movie.",10,3,5,31 August 1999
