Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Look deeper, non-believers
","Okay folks, here it is in its entirety.  For all of you weirdos who didn't like this movie, let me tell you something...LOOK DEEPER.  Sure, you have to pay attention to the movie, and see it multiple times, but you should get it.  You should also have a pretty good intellect regarding E4-E6.  Keep looking, and you should find it, and when you do...you'll be like .... WHOAAA.  I know that everyone uses that it's a kids movie as an excuse, which is really a load of crap, because if you can tie this in with the existing trilogy, the circle will be complete.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
American Pie," Can You Say...I Laughed My Ass Off
","First off, this was one of those movies like Something About Mary...Mainly filed with gross-out, sex-related humor...THE BEST KIND!!  Around every corner, this movie surprised the hell out of me...I found myself hooked after the opening sequence...It was so damn funny and embarrassing.  One other point that I would like to make about this movie, is that you see growth in all of the 4 main characters....the most in the jock, Oz...then Jim, the dork...then Shit-Break, Finch...then the only one w/a girlfriend. This movie wasn't all humor, and eventually showed you that sex isn't everything.  At that point you're kinda like wow...neat, and it seems that the movie is over....but then it goes back to the hilarious, laughing your ass of humor.  I was fortunate enough to see an early version of this movie, and can't wait to see it at theaters, to see if they changed anything...good luck, and you haaaaaave to see this movie!!",10,0,0,29 June 1999
