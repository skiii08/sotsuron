National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Enjoyable and recommendable
","It was a good movie but not as good as the first one. I think that its just the same story as the first one with very little changes. Treasure hunter Ben Gates tries to clean its name by looking for an ancient treasure. The first half of the movie is kinda slow and even tiresome, too much talking and very little action. But it gets better on the second part towards to the end. The cast is excellent, Nicolas Cage in a role he knows very well, Jon Voight as Cage fathers is very convincing, Ed Harris is the bad guy that the only thing he wants is to find the treasure and keep it to himself, Harvey Keitel as an FBI agent wit a brief but convincing performance and Helen Mirren as Nicola's mother with a good and even funny performance. Although this movie isn't the greatest thing, it is very enjoyable and entertaining, perfect to spend some time with the family.",7,48,77,1 January 2008
Angels & Demons," Better than The DaVinci Code
","Angels and Demons is the adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Dan Brown , the same person that wrote The DaVinci Code and as well as he DaVinci Code it is directed by Ron Howard and with Tom Hanks in the leading role. This one is way better the the previous one but it isn't that great to impress. Angels and Demons is a very well structure thriller with lots of action, adventure and suspense. It has a fast rhythm, a convincing and interesting story, although I think it has some holes that if you're not paying attention you will get bore very easy.The digital effects are extraordinary that in some way compensates the lack of story. The locations are excellent, maybe the best of the movie. Watching every street, every corner and every church of Vatican City is really impressive and interesting. The cast is really good. Tom Hanks repeating in the role of Robert Langdon, in this second movie he is more an action hero than a respectable scientist but still a very good performance. Ewan McGregor was excellent as Camerlengo McKenna, it was a very powerful performance and Ayelet Zurer was good but with very little presence. In conclusion, Angels and Demons is a decent thriller you will enjoy.",8,0,2,13 June 2009
Changeling," A heart - breaking movie
","Changeling tells the story based on actual events about a mother's prayer for her kidnapped son to return home is answered, though it doesn't take long for her to suspect the boy who comes back is not hers. This is a heart breaking drama directed by Clint Eastwood, he manages to transmit the desperation of a mother without being corny or sensationalist. The plot is interesting, convincing and very well developed. It is perfectly set on the late 20's and the early 30's with a very good costume design. The cast is good, Angelina Jolie forgetting for a moment all her sexiness and performing as a desperate mother trying to find her son, she is really good in this role, you can really feel all her sorrow throughout the film and John Malkovich as reverend Gustav Briegleb is very convincing. In conclusion, Changeling is a movie that will take you on a ride of emotions such as sadness and anger. Totally worthy and fully recommendable.",9,5,7,14 March 2009
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk incredible movie
","The incredible Hulk opens its way as one of the best action movies of the season. With a completely new adaptation of the movie combining parts from the comic and parts from the 70's T.V. series, the film comes full of action and adventure, a good story of love and even some humor moments. It was like an adrenaline shot right to the heart. The CGI and special effects are really great. We can see a more realistic, more human Hulk, of course that they still can make it better. The movie is full of references of the Marvel Universe like the brief appearance of Tony Stark talking about The Avengers. The cast is awesome, all-star actors and actresses like Edward Norton with a flawless performance, it's like he was born to be Bruce Banner, the character really fits him, Liv Tyler in the role of Betty Ross is great so sweet and cute. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky a.k.a Abomination was the perfect villain and William Hurt give a convincing performance as General Ross. the brief cameos of Robert Downey Jr. Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee were a great add to the movie. In conclusion, this is by far a better Hulk movie than the one of 2003. Enjoyable, entertaining. One of the best movies of the season.",9,2,4,14 June 2008
3:10 to Yuma," A great western, destined to be a classic
","It is a great idea from the movie studios to bring back western movies, its been a long but a very long tie since I watched a good and decent western until today that I saw 3:10 to Yuma, a remake from a 1957 movie with the same name. This movie keeps the same formula of old time westerns but wit a whole new look. A very interesting story about a rancher who decides to escort an outlaw to the train station so he could take the 3:10 train to Yuma. The plot convince me a 100%, it is very well developed. Its a film with lots of action and adventure, some involuntary humor. The time line is perfectly portrayed on the landscapes, the scenery and the costume design. The direction from John Mangold is excellent, it has a very good rhythm, thing that makes the movie very enjoyable. It has a wonderful cast, Russell Crowe gives one of his best performances as the legendary outlaw Ben Wade, Christian Bale is also amazing in his role of rancher Dan Evans. A great revelation was young actor Logan Lerman in his role as Dan's older son William, it was a really good performance. In the supporting roles we have to mention Ben Foster as Charlie Prince and Peter Fonda as Byron McElroy, their acting were pretty impressive. To conclude, this was a very enjoyable and entertaining movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very recommendable.",10,2,4,29 October 2007
The Expendables 2," The Expendables review
","Entertaining, enjoyable. A 2012 movie but with an 80's taste. No CGI , no computers, just old-fashioned special FX and a bunch of 40, 50, 60 and even 70 years old actors who still can do action movies, believe it or not. This group of old geezers make fun of all their previous movies, The action sequences are very well made. Of course that the plot is as simple as A B C but as you all know The Expendables 2 is a movie not intended to make you think, its only intention is to make people spend a good time with a spectacular and adrenaline-pumping action-packed extravaganza and that's just the way this movie should be seen. In conclusion, The Expendables 2 is an enjoyable movie with good old-fashioned, entertaining and mindless violence.",8,3,5,25 August 2012
The Hangover," The best comedy of the year
","Usually when people talk about hangovers they usually meant about the day after drinking a lot. In this case The Hangover is the most ingenious comedy I've seen in the year.

I'm Not There," Great movie, great actors, simply perfect
","I'm not there shows as it is said in the movie the many lives of Bob Dylan. Six different faces portraying various aspects of of the life of this famous artist. They have been made a lot of biopics of singers, actors and others throughout the years, some are good some others bad but I'm sure that this one is one of the best all-time. Directed by Todd Haynes, the movie has a slow rhythm but it never gets tired, the photography is excellent, the music is wonderful each story has a different Bob Dylan song that reflects perfectly ans space where the movie is. The cast is amazing, six actors characterized as Bob Dylan (Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw, Christian Bale, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere and Cate Blanchett) everyone with flawless performances, specially Blanchett who earned an Oscar nomination for this role and in my opinion she deserved to win. The secondary roles like the ones of Jullianne Moore and Charlotte Gainsbourg give very good support performances. In conclusion, this movie is for true Bob Dylan fans, if you're not one of them well anyway go and see it because you could learn some facts about his life.",9,0,0,18 April 2008
Star Trek," An exciting journey. Thank you J.J. Abrams
","All the trekkers in the world are pleased because finally Star Trek is on the movie theaters everywhere. Personally I can't consider a big Star Trek fan although I know some of its history. Now the movie is perhaps the biggest release of the summer and they are right. The movie is full of action from the very first minute. It is like and adrenaline shot to the heart and it will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Inglourious Basterds," Another masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino
","What can I say. Tarantino always finds new ways to amaze the viewer. This was the opportunity of Inglorious Basterds, a movie full of action, drama and a little bit of black humor that we're used to watch in all Tarantino's movies. It is perfectly narrated and with an excellent rhythm, yeah it maybe a little bloody but its never gross, its like I like say entertaining and justified violence. The story is excellent, set in WW II, a group of Jewish soldiers named 'the basterds' travel throughout the Nazi occupied Europe killing German soldiers as an act of revenge, and the plot is perfectly written full of twists and with an unexpected ending. The cast is awesome, Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Christoph Waltz, Til Schweiger and even Mike Myers in a very short appearance were astonishing perfect. To conclude, Inglorious Basterds is the best movie from Quentin Tarantino maybe since Pulp Fiction, fully recommended and totally worthy.",10,2,9,23 November 2009
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 is Totally Worth it.
","Iron Man 2 left me a very pleasant taste. Maybe it doesn't have the same amount of action than the first one but it is compensated with better CGI, a better developed plot and a more interesting story. Billionaire Tony Stark must contend with deadly issues involving the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies due to his superhero alter ego Iron Man. As I say before, this sequel isn't full of action like the first one but in my opinion it has enough to leave you satisfied and entertained. It also has good moments of humor specially from Robert Downey Jr. The cast is excellent, and practically the same of the first one with the addition of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Black Widow and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vankov/Whiplash and the substitution of Terence Howard with Don Cheadle as Rhodey, in fact I think that with Cheadle the movie gains in acting . Downey is again perfect as Tony Stark/Iron Man, it is a role made for him. Gwyneth Paltrow is good enough as Pepper Potts and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Nick Fury. In conclusion, Iron Man isn't as exciting as the first one but it has everything to be a total summer blockbuster and pleased the viewer. Oh and one more thing be sure to stay at the end of the final credits to watch a very good surprise.",9,4,6,24 July 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Nothing spectacular
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall follows the same formula than 40 yr old Virgin, Knocked up and Super Cool but to be honest I didn't feel the same impact that the other movies had. Yeah it may have some funny moments but in general the jokes aren't that funny. The story isn't that original and the plot is kinda predictable. The cast is good, Jason Segel made a decent and funny performance but for God's sake keep your clothes on. Mila Kunis proving that she can act and be funny at the same time. Kristen Bell was good, doing the necessary and Russell Brand was very funny. Maybe the best of this movie was the photography, the landscapes from Hawaii were beautiful. In conclusion, if your are a Judd Apatow fan this movie is for you if not then you can watch it just to waste your time",7,0,5,25 September 2008
12 Monkeys," A real masterpiece
","There's not enough words to describe this movie. Its intriguing, original, interesting, breathtaking, shocking and authentic. With a very peculiar story that involves time travel and some concepts of life and with a 100% convincing and very well developed plot. The cast was simply magnificent. Bruce Willis as James Cole is flawless, Brad Pitt acting is superb, one of his best ever, Madeleine Stowe helps very much in her supporting role as a psychiatrist that helps Willis character. Terry Gilliam's direction is perfect, his style and personality is everywhere in this movie. To conclude, this already can be consider a modern masterpiece of the film industry.",9,2,3,13 October 2007
Public Enemies," Interesting and enjoyable
","Public Enemies tells the story of the life of John Dillinger and his brief but well known fame as a bank robber. It is an almost 2 hour and a half movie but its length doesn't make it tiresome, in fact it is a very interesting drama full of action that will catch you from the very first minute and will keep you on the edge of your seat. the story is very interesting and the plot very well developed. The movie is perfectly set in the 1930's with an excellent costume design from that age. The cast is awesome. Johnny Depp is the perfect John Dillinger, a role that fits him very well, his performance was great, Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis is almost perfect and Marion Cotillard although her role wasn't that big, she made very important for the movie. In conclusion, Public Enemies made a very good impression on me, it is a enjoyable and interesting movie.",8,1,2,28 July 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Where's the epic adventure

Prince of Persia tries to be an epic adventure full of action, some moments of humor, romance and fantasy. What it really is just an adventure with some decent action, a little of humor and cheesy moments. But not everything is bad, its special effects are quite awesome. The cast is pretty good, their performances not really, Jake Gyllenhaal is good but I think that the role of hero didn't fit him very well, Gemma Arterton was decent enough in her role of Tamina, Sir Ben Kingsley is Nizam, the villain, his performance was maybe the most convincing of all along with Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, he contribute with the funniest situations of the movie. In conclusion, what promise to be a big epic adventure destined to be a summer blockbuster, ended as a disappointing movie leaving us wanting for more..",6,0,1,31 July 2010

Liv Schreiber was excellent as Sabretooth/Victor, he manages the character to the perfection. Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Kitsch were great as Deadpool/Wade and Gambit/Remy respectively although I would like to see more screen time from this two characters. In conclusion, this Wolverine movie is enjoyable and entertaining enough. I think it will fulfill all the expectations.",9,8,13,7 June 2009

With a fresh, original and interesting story about a 16 y.o teen who gets pregnant and from that point, she begins to think what to do with the baby she is expecting.

The cast is very good, Ellen Page with a terrific performance as Juno, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Gardner are also very good as the couple that are going to adopt Juno's baby and J.K Simmons with a great supporting role as Juno's father. Director Jason Reitman accomplished a excellent work, he gives us a very natural point of view of a pregnant teenager without being corny. People definitely will loved the soundtrack.

Milk," Milk: Another Van Sant great film
","Milk tells the real story of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be voted into public office in America. It is an inspirational drama, directed by Gus Van Sant, that reflects the intolerance and the lack of respect to gay people on the 70's decade. It is a film full of drama with some moments of maybe involuntary humor. The locations in San Francisco and the real footage makes the movie more realistic along with the very good costume design. The cast is wonderful, Sean Penn in the leading role as Harvey Milk delivers a flawless and powerful performance, he totally earned that Oscar. Josh Brolin as supervisor Dan White is excellent, no wonder why he got an Oscar nomination for supporting role.

Cloverfield," It was good enough for me
","I didn't going to watch this movie,I really wasn't interested, but I got some free tickets and said, why not, let's give it a chance. The movie was good, it will keep you on the edge of your seat but it isn't the greatest film as I've heard in other places. The story about a monster trying to destroy a big city isn't new, but this one is different because of the special effects and the ending that in my opinion wasn't the best. It also left me many questions like What is that monster? Where did he come from? Why is he attacking New York City? The camcorder style gives you the feeling of being there but as time passes by, you can get tired and even dizzy with it. The cast doesn't have any known name, thing that makes the movie a little more credible and the performances are convincing enough.",7,2,3,5 February 2008

This film full of action and adventure is like a tribute to all those 80's and 90's action movies, first because all the representatives of those movies appear here (Bruce Willis, Sylsvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger). The story is predictable and the plot is a little weak. The cast is interesting, formed by actors (Stallone, Li, Statham, Lundgren, Rourke) and wrestlers (Austin and Couture) everyone doing the best they can and with the special appearances of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger parodying themselves the movie is quite enjoyable. In conclusion, you most take The Expewndables for what it is, a movie which only purpose is to entertain the viewer and I think it achieve it pretty well.",8,2,4,5 January 2011
Knocked Up," Entertaining, enjoyable, Intelligent
","Before the beginning of the movie I thought that this was going to be another meaningless, corny chick flick. But I was wrong, first of all its not the typical romantic comedy, also although it has tons of sexual and scatological humor, it isn't entirely based by this. Its in fact a very intelligent and original comedy movie with a very decent and convincing plot and a story with a very strong message. The film is about a woman that wants to be a E!

A very good acting from everyone from the cast, Katherine Heigl besides looking beautiful, delivers us a great performance, Seth Rogen is so hilarious in his role as Ben Stone, he is a really good comedian. The secondary roles of Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd gives the necessary support to Heigl and Rogen.

It is a frenetic, mind blowing film full of action, adventure, suspense and some nice black humor. Directed by Zack Snyder, the also director of 300 made a very good job with the adaptation along with writers David Hayter and Alex Tse. The movie is long, maybe I would cut some unnecessary parts and at the beginning it has a slow rhythm but the second part runs a little more fluid. The soundtrack is excellent, each song selected to in every scene fits to the perfection. Another thing that was quite good and interesting was the references made of people or some event of each decade shown in the movie for example Ozymandias outside the Studio 54 with a person supposed to be David Bowie. The special effects are so stunning you'll get with you mouth wide open. The cast is very good, each actor delivers and outstanding performance specially Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. In conclusion, Watchmen is so astonishing that it can be consider one of the best movie of the year.",9,1,3,16 March 2009
21," Worth to watch
","21 is a movie that will catch you from the very beginning, in my opinion it has everything a movie needs to enjoy and entertain. Its a very well developed drama with some moments of adventure and with the necessary amount of humor. It has a really quick rhythm causing the movie to never fall down and get tiresome. With a very interesting and original story based on actual events, about Ben Campbell is a shy, brilliant M.I.T. student who--needing to pay school tuition--finds the answers in the cards. He is recruited to join a group of the school's most gifted students that heads to Vegas every weekend armed with fake identities and the know-how to turn the odds at blackjack in their favor. It has a very good cast, beginning with Kevin Spacey in the role of Micky Rosa, an ironic and greedy math professor, his performance is almost brilliant, Lawrence Fishburne as the casino's guard is excellent as always in his acting, Jim Sturgess is convincing enough, he really makes you to believe him in this role and Kate Bosworth was also very good. In conclusion, this is a movie worth to watch and very recommendable.",8,1,2,3 July 2008
The Orphanage," The Orphanage review
","Between a bunch of bad horror remakes and some new but not so good stories, we must be thankful for this movie. Maybe its not the most original but it is very interesting, it has a lot of suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat, it has that kind of psychological terror that will make you jump when you least expect it. Although it isn't directed by Guillermo Del Toro, its clearly that his style is all over this film. It has a slow rhythm but the movie never turns tiresome. Its dark and creepy setting fits really good. The performances from the cast are wonderful, Belen Rueda's is excellent and convincing, you really can feel her desperation and Geraldine Chaplin deserves a mention apart for her special appearance.

Also it is a non-stop laughing for an hour and a half with some very funny references from other movies. The cast of voices is great. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer repeating their roles as Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are again so funny and amusing.

Shrek Forever After," A very decent ending for Shrek
","Shrek 4 or Shrek Forever After is the latest and final chapter of this Shrek's series. In this one, we found a Shrek bored with his present life, no one fears him anymore, that's why he makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to have at least one day of the life he had but with catastrophic consequences and realizing that he already had all he wants in life.

Tropic Thunder," Funniest comedy of the year
","I must say that Tropic Thunder is by far the funniest comedy of the year. It is that kind of movie that at first sight you say that it is some other stupid spoof movie, The difference with this one is that it has an original story, and interesting plot and an all-star cast. It has lots of action and adventure and you will laugh for almost two hours.

In conclusion, a entertaining movie that you will enjoy, very recommendable for everyone.",9,2,7,1 September 2008
Enchanted," Enjoyable, entertaining. Pure Disney magic
","OK, how do I start. This movie is corny, in fact it takes the word corny to a whole new level, It is also kinda predictable, from the very beginning you kinda know with whom she's gonna end. But I don't know if its the holiday season or what but I really enjoy this movie. It is a very fine parody of all Disney movies with a princess as a main character. The story is good and entertaining. Giselle a young girl who is waiting for his prince for the first love kiss and live happily ever after when the evil queen/witch send her to an unknown place to her, New York city. It has its funny moments and some musical ones like in all Disney movies. The fx are very good, specially when Susan Sarandon's character turns into a dragon. The cast is very good, Amy Adams in a cute and tender role that you will finish loving her or hating her, James Marsden as the typical and innocent fairy tale prince, Susan Sarandon is excellent as the evil queen/witch and women will love Patrick Dempsey with this performance that fits him really well. In conclusion, If you don't like this type of movies you will get annoyed very soon, if you are the corny type of people, you definitely will love it. For me, yes it was corny and kinda foolish but also I think its worthy to give it a chance to watch it with the family and spend an enjoyable and entertaining moment.",9,1,2,15 December 2007

Twilight," A vampire love chick flick
","Twilight fans from all around the world will hate me for this review. Twilight is very far from being a good movie why, for the reason that it is focused mainly for the female viewer. The movie is about a teenager that leaves Phoenix to to leave with his dad in a little town in Washington and falls in love with fancy and stylish vampire risking her life for this relation in my opinion is kinda corny. If you take the vampire theme out, it is just another love movie and a chick flick. The only good part from the movie is the baseball game scene its maybe the only enjoyable part. The movie is so slow that it may turn tiresome to the viewer. The special effects are lame. The cast formed mainly by new, young actors delivers barely decent performances some of them are even ridiculous. But not everything in the movie is bad, the landscapes from the locations are beautiful and the music is pretty cool. In conclusion, the movie is worthy on for those who are real fans, they will enjoy every part of it. If you're not one of them you might think it twice before seeing it.",5,1,4,26 November 2008

The story is interesting, the plot is very well developed, it is very good set on the 50's era. It has a slow paced rhythm, you have to focus and have patience or you'll get bored. The cast is very good. In the leading roles we have Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Frank and April Wheeler respectively, both deliver very good performances specially Winslet, DiCaprio was a little overacted for my taste. Kathy Bates as Helen Givings gives us an excellent work and Michael Shannon as John Givings was so convincing that he earned himself an Academy award nomination.",9,1,1,2 March 2009

The cast of voices is very good featuring John Travolta as Bolt and Miley Cyrus as Penny. The characters are very funny, specially Rhino the hamster and all the bunch of pigeons that appear throughout the movie.

I Am Legend," A movie that didn't fulfill my expectations
","It was a good movie, it has very good action, the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat. It has a lot of similarities with 28 Days Later. The effects are good but the cgi for the infected was a little poor, I mean why do all of them have the same appearance. The story about a man who supposedly is the only survivor of a deadly virus that left a deserted New York City, tries to find a cure for those who survived and are infected and transformed to a strange kind of zombies, is good and interesting, although it left me some doubts. Will Smith's performance is very good, he has a lot of mood changes, he can be funny one moment and immediately he turns serious and then he turns sad, he is a very versatile actor. To conclude, it is enjoyable and entertaining. This movie has everything to become a blockbuster although it isn't the greatest movie.",7,1,4,20 January 2008

","It has action, it has adventure. At first I couldn't believe Justin Timberlake as the action hero but as the movie moves along he convince me. Amanda Seyfried as beautiful she is, she looks kinda weird with that red-hair look and his performance was a little weak and not very credible. Also I would wish more from Olivia Wilde, her performance was way too short. A good surprise was watching Johnny Galecki in a role completely different And Cillian Murphy as the corrupted cop Raymond Leon was good, that role fits him really well. The movie rhythm is way too slow and repetitive. Resuming, the idea of the film is quite interesting and original, but poorly developed by director Andrew Niccol.

The story about a family on the run from a natural crisis that presents a large-scale threat to humanity seems to be very interesting and original but very bad developed, what I mean is that the movie begins directly from the conflict, there's never an introduction and there's no closure or conclusion either, it ends exactly the way it begins. The cast is very good but their performances lack of intensity. Mark Wahlberg I a good actor but in this movie wasn't good at all, he tries to be funny in some scenes but he just can't do it. Zooey Deschanel, she is pretty but I feel her acting just plain and empty and John Leguizamo well maybe he was the best one. Maybe the only good thing in the movie was the music, it just makes you feel a little bit of tension and mystery In conclusion, I feel a little disappointed and if you want to watch it, you better wait for the DVD.",6,0,3,25 June 2008
Zombieland," An entertaining movie to enjoy
","Zombieland is a movie that combines horror (although it doesn't scares), comedy, with a lot of black humor, action and adventure. The story focuses on two men who have found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies. Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies. It doesn't shows us anything new and it is a little predictable but at the same time it is funny and entertaining. It never gets tiresome because of it fast paced rhythm. The music is excellent and the make up design is very convincing. The cast is good. Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee makes a good performance, he is very funny, Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus is quite decent, Emma stone is Wichita and Abigail Breslin is Little Rock, they are also very convincing but the best one of all was Bill Murray in his short appearance as himself, the 15 minutes he is in the movie are hilarious and they really worth it. As a conclusion, Zombieland is a movie which only purpose was to entertain and make people enjoy and spend a really good time and I think it accomplishes it in a very good way.",7,0,0,26 January 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Exactly what I expected
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the biggest box office blockbusters of the summer. From the very beginning of the movie you are surround by big explosions, spectacular persecution and tons of special effects. The story doesn't contribute with many innovations, in fact I feel that it follows the same plot as the first one, The Auto-bots and the Decepticons in their eternal war and the humans in between with Sam Witwicky and his girlfriend Mikaela trying to save the world. Maybe the only novelty in the film is the new robots like 'The Fallen', the twins and others. The special effects are awesome and the CGI is amazing. The cast is really good, Shia LaBeouf repeating as Sam Witwicky was good, in this movie he is more like an action hero. Megan Fox looking extremely hot and with a decent performance. John Turturro was very funny. In conclusion, this sequel of Transformers is quite entertaining and surely it will be a blast in the box-office.",8,11,19,9 July 2009

","This is one of the best movies I've seen in this present year. So powerful, so breathtaking and full of action and drama. Based on true, The story about the rise and fall of Harlem's drug kingpin Frank Lucas, its so interesting.

Hancock," Enjoyable, entertaining. Definitely worthy
","Hancock is a very entertaining movie. It has action and adventure, comedy and even drama. Hancock is a different type of hero because he doesn't feel the necessity of helping people. He is kinda lazy, he drinks , he likes women he swears and has a lot of bad temper. The story is pretty good and the plot about A hard-living superhero (Smith) who has fallen out of favor with the public enters into a questionable relationship with the wife (Theron) of the public relations professional (Bateman) who's trying to repair his image is interesting but I feel it isn't fully developed. The special effects are really good and it has a really good rhythm which makes the movie enjoyable and it never bores you down. The cast is pretty good. Will Smith in a role that fits him perfectly, his performance is really funny and convincing.

Atonement," An epic movie, a real Oscar Contender
","Good movie, with lots of drama. Its the typical romantic film with betrayal, passion and tears. It also has some moments of mystery. The story is set around a forbidden romance, and how one lie from a young girl who misunderstands a series of situations not meant for her perception result in incomprehensible tragedy for three lives. The first hour of the movie is quite interesting, with a good rhythm, the next half hour turns to be a little slow almost to tiresome for my taste until the last half hour when all the issues begin to resolve. The movie set is amazingly recreated in its first part in the England of the late 30's and then in the early 40's on WWII. The cast is wonderful, Keira Knightley with an outstanding performance as Cecilia Tallis, James McAvoy also with a great acting job and Saoirse Ronan on an excellent role that deserve her a Oscar nomination. Definitely a good and interesting movie worth to see.",8,3,4,21 February 2008
Semi-Pro," Unbelievable but it was good enough for me
","Semi Pro's maybe not the best movie of Will Ferrell or even not in his top 5 but believe it or not it worked for me. Yeah it could be better directed and produced, it could be funnier or maybe being a basketball related movie on the 70's decade, they could invite some pro players of the era so it could be more realistic but I think that the movie couldn't give up for more. The movie has the typical Will Ferrell humor, with lots of physical comedy and sex jokes, not all the jokes and gags are funny but it has some moments like the one with the bear fight and when they're performing the halftime show that takes you off a real and sincere laugh. The cast is good, Will Ferrell funny as always although its not his best performance, Woody Harrelson is convincing enough but I just felt him a little forced, Maura Tierney was good but not great and Andre Benjamin as Clarence delivers a very good acting job. In conclusion, this movie only purpose is to entertain and I think he barely accomplishes it. So if you wanna see this movie turn off your brain, relax and enjoy.",7,1,3,15 September 2008
