The Ring," This is honestly one of the best mystery/horror movies I've ever seen!!
","the ring... where do i begin. well its about a journalist who's niece died mysteriously. she hears about this urban legend that theres this tape and it is someones nightmare on it. but after you see it, you die exactly 7 days later. so rachel (the journalist) tracks down the tape and watches it. the legend is becoming a reality and she now only has 7 days to unravel the mystery of the ring. #1 the script alone is brilliant. it makes you think and you really dont understand the movie completely until you've seen it 2 or 3 times, which i loved. it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it isn't gruesomly gory or scary, which i also loved about it. the suspense is what really scares you, and this one ending scene really creeps you out. #2 the acting is great and the understand the meaning of there characters greatly. i jus totaly loved the entire piece and i praise the writer of the ring who origanally started it all because he is a brilliant man. i definatly recommend this thriller to anyone who likes these kinds of movies. let me tell you... its full of twists and will keep you guessing and trembling long after you see it!!   9/10",Null,1,1,9 May 2003
Jaws," Defines Horror Genre
","This movie was made many years ago, yet still so many people are frightened to go in the water. This movie is directed so greatly that I don't think anyone could have done a better job. The plot is that a killer shark has been feeding on local islanders on Amity Island. So, the Chief of Police, a scientist, and a fisherman set out to kill it. The suspense that the movie builds up is incredible. This movie doesn't compare to anything from the past decade. You don't see movies like JAWS made today. The acting is done greatly. Richard Dryfuss definatly stands out in this movie. This was the highlight of Steven Spielburg's career also. This is a 10/10 movie. I will be seeing JAWS 2 in the next week or so, followed by JAWS 3, and JAWS 4, but I don't think any of them will compare even close to JAWS.** A MUST SEE",Null,0,2,20 October 2003
