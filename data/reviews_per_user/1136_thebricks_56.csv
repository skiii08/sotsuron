Ford v Ferrari," Bad movie, the documentary was far superior
","Really low effort, made-by-committee fare with no soul here, sorry.Absolutely hated Christian Bale's character and his family. Bale played a Brit loudmouth with a temper, his wife and kid played stereotypical posh Brits with a heart of gold and zero personality. They all came across as phony. Every character in this movie seemed like they were playing their modern day selves, just on a sixties set with sixties clothing.Matt Damon basically plays himself, almost like he walked off the Bourne set and put a cowboy hat on. Bam, that' was the extent of his attempt to play Carol Shelby. Total joke, I wouldn't have paid him a dollar to play this role. They really could have found someone better.The movie was an hour too long. It was dumbed down for the Thanksgiving Dinner crowd. If you didn't see the documentary, you wouldn't know what was going on. There really was nothing about the engineering that went on with making the car. It was all about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.Things about the movie were just weird. One character had a bubble jacket that I don't think would have been around back then. Matt Damon's character goes to meet Ken Miles' wife after a certain event, doesn't go speak to her...also, in spite of a tragic event recently happening, she and the kid act like nothing is wrong and life is great. It's really bizarre and lazy directing.I can't recommend the movie, it was terrible, sorry. The documentary is far superior. This was just bad.",1,48,134,17 November 2019
First Man," Competently made film with one huge flaw
","I will get this out of the way: I do not believe America landed on the moon. This movie only reinforces my conclusion about this. The moon hoaxer crowd makes a lot of great arguments about this. Also, since the Apollo missions in the early seventies, no other country or private space entity has ever gone to the moon. That's a bit suspicious.The movie is a great watch. It does come off as propaganda at times, but it tells the story and does it to the point. I won't say the acting was outstanding because it really wasn't. The directing and cinematography were; it's what I've come to expect from Damian Chazelle. One egregious omission was leaving out the planting of the US flag on the moon. That was just ridiculous. You have a movie here that could be shown in schools everywhere and they ruined it by omitting that scene. What were they thinking? That's pretty historical. I could see a lot of history teachers refusing to show this movie because of that and it's a shame. It's history. If it had anything to do with the international box office, I'm sorry, if you go to see this movie overseas, you will know what you're getting into beforehand.",8,3,20,14 October 2018
Hereditary," Ending really ruined the movie, showed the writer had nothing all along
","Very, very creepy movie, but the end was total trash. I mean, it was an award winning film until the end. The acting was great, the pacing and direction were amazing, and then the end was the writer's way of saying 'eff you, I had nothing all along!'This was just someone's very dark thoughts made into a movie with a contrived ending. I don't really want to trash the film though but end it with about 10 or 20 minutes left and you should be good.",6,2,4,25 August 2018
Rocketman," Taron Edgerton is an actor while better ones starve
","Watched about thirty minutes. It was just bad. I didn't see Elton John, I saw Taron Edgerton. The movie just didn't make sense. With so much better things to watch out there, I cut my losses.Kingsman is a great movie, but he was always the worst thing about it. I know there is a prequel coming out, and supposedly a third is on the way, but I can't help but think that maybe they're trying to reboot and write him out of the franchise. I hope they do.I can't recommend this movie, sorry.",1,8,15,23 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Lady Gaga is the ugly duckling in a movie full of great performances
","Just an absolutely terrible movie. Only positive is just about everyone's acting other than Lady Gaga's. She was awful. She wasn't even convincing as a pop star, which I found to be totally crazy. I really have to admit, whoever her music producers were did a really great job of disguising the fact that she can't sing with the elaborate get-ups and wacky songs in real life. I think the movie would have been dramatically improved by casting someone else in her part., either an actress or another pop star. Her rough, trashy Jersey attitude just came through in every scene and it made the character incredibly unlikable. She lacked chemistry with Bradley Cooper. Jackson Maine was a compelling character by himself. It's Bradley Cooper's best role yet. I just didn't like the story arc of the film and what happened at the end. It was dumb. The majority of the audience that is working class is not going to find the character sympathetic or believable. Here is this guy, a country legend who has to be worth hundreds of millions, and we're supposed to feel sorry for him? Not happening, sorry. His career may have been ending, but come on, he can quit tomorrow and sit on an estate in the islands for the rest of his life; the rest of us can't. Cry me a river.Also, when did being a drunk ever ruin a country star's career? If anything, I've felt it makes them more popular!This movie needed a lot of work, unfortunately. I think Taylor Swift or Katy Perry would have been a much better fit, and just more compatible with Cooper. This was just a mess and I can't recommend it. The last hour was totally unnecessary and dragged on. I felt this was a 'woe is me' piece for entertainment stars, but the rest of us won't relate or care, and why should we?",1,19,58,7 October 2018
Wind River," Very bad, not worth your time.
","Heard a lot of raves about this movie. Sorry to say, it was really bad and emotionally manipulative. Even actors that normally give very strong performances come off as extremely clich√© and phony. By the time we got to the final scene by the trailer, I was lost. This was just terrible movie-making, complete with an odd, dated soundtrack. It almost felt like I was watching some religious video from the 90's.I do not recommend.",1,29,76,30 September 2017
Darkest Hour," Propaganda that wrongly gives Britain and the US credit for winning World War II
","This is just another movie that they will show in schools showing that all it took to win World War 2 was Winston Churchill and his bravado along with the United States. It's absolutely paint by numbers, with portrayals of British politicians as perfect, uncorrupted individuals with a few minor personal flaws. Give me a break.Study up on the Eastern Front. That is where the real war was fought. After Stalingrad, US and British history conveniently ignores almost everything that happened there, even portrays the Russians as brutes coat tailing on the success of the US and British in the Western Front and eventually becoming the bad guys after Berlin was sacked.Truth is, without the Russians, the war on the Western Front would have been much, much worse. The Germans were basically sending the scraps of their forces to fight the Allies on the Western Front. By the time the US and British got to France and Italy, the Russians wiped the floor with the Germans and the war was pretty much over. It's like playing Risk with a good opponent on one front and a scrub on the other. You can't win.It's 2018, it's time for Hollywood to stop pushing garbage like this and tell the truth about World War 2.",1,17,40,2 February 2018
Amistad," Nineties schlock with dishonest history
","Having a degree in history and real world life experience, most people with a general education who watches Hollywood movies would believe slave trading and slavery ended because some people had a heart and thought it was wrong. That simply is not true. The United States refused to allow the importation of slaves around 1807. Look at what happened three years prior to this; the Haitian Revolution ended and their independence was declared. The French lost their colony and other colonial nations saw the writing on the wall and realized they were next unless something was done.Which leads us to the Civil War. The North did not want the slaves freed out of the goodness of their hearts. They looked at the number of slaves compared to freed men there, rising number of slave rebellions and knew if it continued, it was only going to get worse, possibly leading to a loss of states and war. Of course, if you're the South and own plantations, you're going to milk this as long as you can because supporting emancipation will probably lead to your bankruptcy. This was why the Civil War was really fought, to preserve the Union, one way or the other.So yes, this movie is childish and inaccurate. Would really love to see a Hollywood movie that portrays slavery issues accurately. The Saturday Morning Cartoon quality nonsense is lame and outdated.",5,3,7,3 January 2019
Captain Marvel," One of the worst superhero debut films Marvel has ever made
","Brie Larson was tragically miscast in this movie. She was appallingly bad in the amateurish film. Something was just very off with this movie. Larson seems incredibly uncomfortable playing her role, just acting in general. She just isn't a charismatic leading lady. Her enthusiasm and smiles are forced. Several of her lines came off as duds. She's no Robert Downey Jr. It doesn't help that Larson is basically Supergirl and has nothing to fear from any enemy. Superheroes with no flaws or weaknesses usually result in very boring movies. Sure enough, Captain Marvel plows through everyone and saves the day. Not really a spoiler because everyone can figure this out!Making matters worse is the feminist-left wing agenda that is absolutely try-hard and shoved in your face. You're not a white supremacist, racist, bigot or a troll for pointing this out, it was needlessly written into a movie with no reason for it to be there at all. The one thing I loved about Blade was that his race or cultural heritage never had to constantly be put out there the entire film. He was just Blade. Spawn was just Spawn. Marvel's movies with minority superheroes seem to just have to hit the audience in the face over and over reminding them of what the backgrounds of their characters are and why white men are so bad. I mean, at points, the movie tries to make this point that girls can do everything men can do and if you don't agree with that, you're a bigot. That's ridiculous, this is scientifically proven!!! No woman is going to be winning a fight in UFC anytime soon against a man. Among other things, don't want to get into it, but there is some movement determined to prove everyone is equal and it's ridiculously stupid and wrong. We're not and it's time people got over it. Towards the end when it's revealed an alien race is trying to look for a new home, it got very clear that this movie was written around a SJW agenda and that for me deserved a one-star rating. You write superhero movies to entertain, not to spread propaganda on a tangent.The Aussie Skrull character also did a lot to take me out of the movie. I didn't understand why he had an accent. It was never explained. I kind of rolled my eyes, haven't spent a month in Australia, it just came across as really cheesy and forced to make the character likable. I would have preferred Ben Mendelsson do a more standard accent and drop that act that made me think I was watching some kid's movie.I don't think Brie Larson was thrilled to do this movie and she should not bother to return. I really have zero interest in ever seeing this character again, even if she was recast. I really hope Marvel ditches the Z-list characters and focuses on the X-Men world and Spiderman for the next decade. This just isn't cutting it.EDIT: The NY Times's Cara Buckley now says I am a bigot for not liking this movie and its SJW propaganda. I apologize profusely, how dare we offend the NY Times and dislike their ideology's propaganda. I thought we were in the United States, my bad.",1,30,49,9 March 2019
Knives Out," Terrible movie
","What could have been a good movie is ruined by the political nonsense. The trailers don't show you this, but it influences the movie in a big way to the point of being incredibly preachy and annoying like Terminator Dark Fate. If this bothers you, don't see it.",1,72,155,29 November 2019
The Irishman," Great movie, probably not for anyone with ADD though
","It tells a story. I appreciated that story in light of some of the things that show Sheeran may not have been a trustworthy source. It's kind of like old-school film making that's been forgotten today with the Marvel movies. Another movie, The Goldfinch, is better made but generally scorned by today's critics because it tries to actually tell a story and develop the characters. Today's reviewers just despise that.It's a shame. I appreciated the film for the story it told. Maybe when some of the reviewers that hated the movie get older, they will appreciate this too.",8,4,8,4 December 2019
Home Alone," Great movie, but kind of stupid if you watch as an adult
","Very enjoyable movie that plays on every kid's worst fears of getting robbed, especially while you're at home. The real truth is, most robbers will usually run if they see anyone is home. It's not worth the kidnapping and murder charges carrying out the robbery. Also, in a neighborhood like this, someone is most certainly going to be nosy and call the cops if they see anything unusual happen.I used to think Kevin defending his home as a kid was a matter of life or death. In truth, I didn't realize how much money his mom was paying for that trip. Flying a group of family members to Paris, four in first class at early nineties prices is a ton of cash, plus hotel rooms and excursions. Someone like that would probably use robbery as an excuse to renovate their mansion.Factoring in how expensive it would have been to fix the house, some estimates put it at $220K, Kevin probably would have been better off opening the door and letting them take what they wanted.But it's a fun movie for kids, so I'll leave it at that.",7,0,4,28 December 2019
Aquaman," Felt like watching high school kids make a superhero movie
","What can I say? Pretty mediocre movie from start to finish. Everyone is just here to pick up a paycheck. The lead, Jason Momoa, is too busy trying to channel nineties metal rockstars instead of trying to play Aquaman. It's disturbing at times to see alcoholism being glorified onscreen. What's up with that? Everyone onscreen is going through the motions because they're being asked to play a part in a movie that's already been done a few dozen times before or more that's been done to death. I'm honestly surprised no one has done a parody of superhero movies yet. So many of them follow the same formula.The end was the worst part of the movie. Nothing was convincing about it. Amber Heard just looked embarrassed. She can't act. It's tragic. She totally knew she was on a set, doing a movie role for a quick buck. She put no effort into convincing the audience of who she was playing onscreen.Watch in IMAX if you can, some of the cinematography is just gorgeous. Yahya Abdul-Mateen deserves some recognition for his part. I felt this movie may have been a lot better with him as Aquaman. Jason Momoa can't act, I mean, if this was the best you could do, at least just cast Yahya as the lead. He deserves much better and was the one good thing about this film.",5,2,4,23 December 2018
Deadpool 2," David Leitch from John Wick ruined this movie
","I already pre-ordered my tickets and would have backed out had I realized who was directing this movie. David Leitch is on my blacklist because he is, plain and simple, a hack director. I know Chad Stahelski co-directed John Wick with him, but given that 2 was better without Leitch and Atomic Blonde was terrible with just him, I'm going to guess he's the guy to blame.The word was this movie was a mess when shown to test audiences and subjected to reshoots. I can see how it was a lot worse before the reshoots. Deadpool is a shadow of his former self. He's way too serious, the plot is way too serious, he actually cares about people. Some scenes go on way too long to the point where you're just like, ok, we get it, move on. Worst of all, Deadpool is simply upstaged by everyone in the film. Zazie Beatz and Josh Brolin were fantastic, as was the New Zealand kid playing Russell. Juggernaut was amazing and left me wanting more, definitely did the character justice. It definitely made the movie worth it just to see him.Hopefully the movie gets a better director next time and recovers from this mistake.",6,1,8,19 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Had a lot of issues with this film's presentation and marketing
","First of all, it was very obvious the director was a no-name beginner they took a gamble on. It was hard to take the movie seriously because it never took itself seriously. I like humor in my movies, but every scene tried to shoe in situational joke after joke to the point of absurdity. The blue rock man was the worst. I presume he was voiced by that annoying actor from Flight of the Conchords, Jerome whatever. The director got so obsessed with his jokes that the plot of the movie got lost in it all and it was hard to take Hela seriously.As for Hela, I could never buy her as a serious villain. Cate Blanchett did a good job, but she was an afterthought in this movie. You knew she was the bad guy, and that was that. Her story arc was as generic, boring and non-threatening as it gets. I mean, Thor has known his dad for what, thousands of years, but he never bothered to tell him about her? Really? No one else in Asgard told Thor and Loki about her? Not even the Frost Giant king? Come on. She comes and goes in the film barely registering an impression other than looking attractive. Karl Urban is totally wasted in the Marvel universe as a lame henchman when he's totally capable of much, much more. That was the biggest tragedy of the whole film.Marvel keeps pulling this stunt where a character's weapon, home or whatever gets destroyed, leaving the viewer wondering how the character will deal with this in the sequel. We all know what's going to happen, they're just going to have said weapon, home or equipment magically respawn and never explain what happened. They've done this with Iron Man's suits, Captain America's shield, Asgard's bifrost and now, Thor's hammer. You will see Thor get his hammer back in Infinity War without any sort of explanation. It's just bad storytelling.Last but not least, the trailers completely ruined the movie. It would have been a much better film without all the ads thrown in your face everywhere, revealing the Hulk's appearance in the movie and Hela destroying the hammer. There were no surprises. Dr. Strange could have easily been cut out without anything lost, why not spam the trailers with his scenes? There were plenty of other action scenes that would have spiced up the trailers just as well. I feel that the director of this film got boned as badly as the one who directed Terminator Genisys, who ironically, was the same guy who directed the last Thor! What are these studio exec fools thinking?The best thing about this movie was Tessa Thompson playing Valkyrie. She was another actress totally wasted on a lame sidekick role. Why not make her Captain Marvel? She's far more believable as a leading lady superhero than Brie Larson! What a WASTE. I'm going to presume they're going to make her the female Thor? Please don't do this, for the love of God.",4,17,31,3 November 2017
Ready Player One," The Chinese food of movies, highly forgettable after an hour
","Didn't think it was very good. It was very kiddy and predictable. Doubt I will ever watch it again. This movie was dying for a twist. It was just too predictable. In a way, it shared some elements of Black Panther that were particularly ridiculous, namely the part about handing over control to a lucrative MMO world to some random person who figures out some games? Really? And the guy in charge of IOI hires all these scholars and goons to figure out the founder of this game's puzzle and gets outsmarted by one kid? It's a ridiculous plot, just ridiculous. At times, I wanted to get my money back. The plot holes were numerous and ludicrous. Maybe it was just rushed. Ready Player One is worth a night out at the movies, but don't expect much from it, quality wise.",5,13,36,1 April 2018
Molly's Game," Dumbed down; the book was much better
","It was sad to see how much this movie was dumbed down from the book. There was lots of great material in the book. The main focus should have been on how Molly organized the games and who was involved. However, the director felt that adding Kevin Costner and Idris Elba's characters and the skiing subplot was more important than actually telling the story faithfully. There was so much detail about what went into setting up the games and they totally ignored it and actually invented other things. Like for example, I do not think the drug problem was even in the book, and if it was, it didn't mess her up that badly. It's like the actual games and the celebrities involved were an afterthought. Without the names of the celebrities involved, the story had less of an impact. They were just Hollywood C-List actors and extras. Tobey Maguire also got a total pass, they went light on him in the movie; I can't believe they didn't even include the Shufflemaster debacle and worse yet, the time he demanded she bark like a seal for a tip.A friend of mine that's big into film raved about the film because other people have, but as someone that read the book, I just thought it was awful. I can't recommend it.",4,58,102,6 January 2018
The Beach," Probably one of my HBO diamonds in the rough films
","I did not have high hopes for this film. Coming off of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio was typecast as a teen heartthrob and everything about this film's marketing screamed that. I must have been watching something on HBO like a TV show and decided to watch this just to see how long I could put up with it. The first thing you realize, around the scene with Daffy, is that this definitely wasn't a teen movie. It's a very deep, complex film with a great story, a coming of age film that's...very realistic. I think after some years in college, I started to understand exactly the type of people who were on the island, because I went to college with a lot of people like that. The movie basically is a gigantic criticism of the sort of affluent trustafarians who backpack and go around the world frolicking and partying. The trustafarians are living in a bubble away from the natives, who are struggling to support their families. One scene in particular points out who the real bad guys in the movie were, and it's probably one of the most depressing in the history of film. It's hard for me to get people to take me seriously to watch this film. Many saw the marketing for the film when it was released, the movie posters and won't give it a chance. It probably is one of my Top Ten movies, simply because of the many messages of the film. Many of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's early works are exceptional like this movie. Highly recommended.",10,2,4,11 August 2017
Suicide Squad," One scene absolutely ruined this movie for me
","Let's be honest, it was just a bad movie. Jared Leto's Joker may have been the worst ever. How do you screw this role up? He played the Joker as some scummy wannabe rapper. Unbelievable stuff. This is the sort of thing that had to come out of a corporate focus group.Much of the production, action scenes and stunts were terrible and dated. It was like watching a 90's movie. How awful is David Ayer at film making? Seriously. It's like going back in time, watching the sets in this film. It looks like one of those old Universal theme park rides from back in the day.But let's get to the one scene that just made me want to walk out. It's when Amanda Waller kills the FBI agents in the Tact Ops office. One reason I hated it is because it's classic David Ayer. He HATES authority and thinks everyone in power is working for the devil. Look at all of his movies. There's a theme. Maybe he met one dirty cop in his life. Who knows? This is how he portrays ANYONE who works for the government, as the right hand of Satan. It's juvenile.Secondly, the reaction of everyone to the massacre was one big joke. Rick Flagg is supposed to be the Boy Scout Special Ops soldier and he's rather 'oh well' about it. Will Smith is impressed and thinks it's cool. It's messed up and contradicts the writer's development of these characters. I couldn't take it seriously anymore. I found it unbelievable that Waller could get away with that, nor could I see WHY she did it, considering the cat was out of the bag about everything, anyways! Also, wouldn't you think, 'Hey, maybe she'll do this to me very soon?'I will never see another film Ayer makes, ever again.",1,5,8,18 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Hollywood version of a C-grade effort in every way
","So glad I didn't pay to see this. This was the dictionary definition of mediocre effort. When a Star Wars show on your streaming network kicks the pants off your blockbuster movie, there is a problem. Too much time was spent on copying the original trilogy instead of making something original. This just isn't a movie worthy of being in the theaters. I was just bored. There were no surprises.To me, this new trilogy just reminded me of those awful sequels Disney makes to cash in. It's like Home Alone 3, Matrix Revolutions, just sequels no one asked for.This movie doesn't deserve to do well. It needs to flop. No one should pay good money to see this in a theater and waste their time. This is some garbage that should be free on Crackle.Very sad and tragic to people expecting something more.",1,65,133,21 December 2019
Baby Driver," Bad movie
","Wrote a big write-up, but unfortunately, this stupid site somehow ate my comment, so I'll just summarize and say, Lily James did a great job, I hated Ansel Elgort, I hated the writing, I hated most of the other performances, there were numerous plot holes and that Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx's roles got incredibly annoying and unbelievable as the film went on. This was also another film where you can tell the writer grew up rich and does not understand how working class people behave. One part in the movie, Baby works off his debt and just walks away to become a pizza delivery driver and Doc never says anything like, 'You excited to make real money now?' There was just a lot about Baby that reminded me more of a trust fund kid than a real lower-class person struggling to make it.I just can't recommend this movie until it comes out on DVD. You'll thank me around the last third of the movie.",1,68,137,2 July 2017
Justice League," Joss Whedon definitely improved this movie a ton from Snyder
","Very impressed. You can see how Joss Whedon transformed this movie from a Zack Snyder hackfest to something actually watchable. I thought this was much better than Thor Ragnarok. My only qualm lay with Steppenwulf, one of the worst villains of all-time, absolutely boring. His CGI rendering is totally ugly too. You can see that this film was edited quite a bit, but it's definitely a positive improvement from what we've seen before. Just replace Batman, try again with Whedon completely in control and see what happens.I don't even blame the failure of Avengers 2 on Whedon. It was Disney that interfered and ruined it.Well done. Improve Wonder Woman too, maybe hire a real director?",8,0,4,22 November 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Just awful, a meandering mess led by an unlikable Miles Morales
","Saw this today thanks to AMC's A-List. It was truly awful. I fell asleep and when I woke up, Miles formed some sort of Spiderman team with some Japanese girl in a suit, Spiderman Noir(?), Spider Pig, who I actually remembered from the nineties and some other characters. This was just absolutely weird. This movie was just all over the place, I don't think Marvel could possibly have had anything to do with this mess unlike Spiderman Homecoming. I'm at a loss as to why Sony has problems making a decent Spiderman/Venom movie. Yes, I know Venom did well, but let's be honest, people only went because Homecoming was so good, so they thought Venom would be as well. They didn't know Marvel wasn't allowed to have any say on that film though, sadly.Thanks for wasting 2 hours of my time. Don't waste yours.",1,47,174,19 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," So many blatant plugs for companies, hilarious
","Take a notepad and start accounting for every company and brand name you see. The amount of ads in this movie are mind-blowing. They even plugged a military cargo jet by Airbus, that's how shameless this film was.This really is the Mission Impossible that showed they have run out of ideas. It's probably time to reboot with a new lead . It's for the best. This was hard to get through, it really was.",1,2,12,18 July 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Felt like the beginning of the end of the movie theater
","There probably will be nothing that tops Avengers Endgame at the movie theaters ever again. All signs indicate the movie theater industry is dying. Very few films can open well anymore. I realized after watching Triple Frontier on Netflix at home that honestly, there really is no need to go to a movie theater anymore. My 4K TV that is 55 inches cost $250 at Best Buy. That is the entry level for big screen watching at home now. Buy a projector and you can watch on an even bigger screen for a bit more effort and expense although with roll-up TVs and short-throw projectors getting more popular, entertainment in a box will soon be a very real possibility. And that's not even mentioning cellphones, laptops and tablets.So as for Endgame, sad to say, instead of this Avengers being split into two to tell one cohesive story, unfortunately, the Russos took a more pretentious route and decided to tell two stories instead. It becomes clear after an incredibly dull, and I'm not exaggerating here, hour and a half, the movie finally picks up and gets more interesting. It may take a while for the fanboys to admit it, but this was a really, really subpar movie. I mean, it felt like the Russos made Infinity War as a complete movie, only to have Disney hack off the last thirty minutes to finish it off and tell the Russos they have four hours to write Endgame to make as a separate movie. These guys are definitely talented directors, no doubt, but this was a really, really bad movie motivated by profit-making. It showed. The plot holes are YUGE.I kind of liked where the story went when this movie picked up around the halfway point. The problem is, it could easily have been done in the last movie. If they could make a cut condensing both movies into one and cut out the BS, it would be incredible. I will probably never watch Endgame again, just being honest. It's a bad movie. The beginning almost invalidates everything that happened in Infinity. It just should not have happened, period. It makes Thanos look stupid.And oh yeah Marvel, any reasonably intelligent person can see the end was an out for the stunts pulled in the movie. It was the screenwriter's equivalent of a blank check. In one other pivotal scene, the answer to the dilemma was literally staring the characters in the face but they were too dumb to realize it. Never trust comic books or the movies. Logan pulled a similar stunt too; if you watched the first Wolverine movie, you'd spot the trick they pulled easily too.I couldn't honestly recommend seeing this in theaters. Trust me on this. It felt almost like a cheesy half-baked expansion pack of a videogame.",5,7,17,27 April 2019
The Favourite," One of the best period pieces ever made
","I had to drive ninety miles to see this in an art theater in a wealthy part of a city, but it was well worth it. I absolutely loved this movie, from start to finish. It's a period piece the director took seriously. Lighting during the day and night seems authentic, characters try to speak as they did back in the early 1700s as well as carry on with the mannerisms. Actors are all solid, the studio didn't force the director to cast actors that can't act and fit in with the time period. Think of the egregious casting of Channing Tatum in 'The Eagle', set in Ancient Rome. That was so close to being a great movie. It was tragic. Everyone around him tried to play the part, except Channing, who probably never had even heard of Ancient Rome when he first showed up on set. Sets are all detailed and gorgeous to take in, the music is authentic, nothing modern to be heard at any point.It's an British movie that isn't stuffy. It's set among the rich and powerful yet gritty and realistic. Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman definitely should be considered for Oscars for their performances. Emma Stone, Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn also do a stupendous job that should warrant recognition.My one complaint lies with the trailer. That's why I took one star off. AMC advertised this movie constantly for months. Initially, I thought it was awful and that I would never see it because it was so weird and offbeat. Then it grew on me, literally around the 6th time I saw it. I guess I was brainwashed. Sad to say, they took all of the funniest, wittiest parts, pivotal scenes and put it in the trailers and clips released online. The scenes are not out of context either, it plays out in the movie exactly like it was edited into the trailer. What on Earth were the people behind the trailer thinking? It's not like this movie lacked filler scenes that would have sold the film just as well! So beware, if you have not seen the trailer but are interested in the film, do not watch it. The last trailer that was about as bad and revealing was the infamous Terminator Genisys trailer. Hollywood, please stop doing this!",9,13,33,16 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," The summer movie season is starting off great this year
","Definitely a return to form for Marvel with Infinity War, but I predict the next movie will be a bit of a letdown as the conflict with Thanos has to be resolved. If you've read the comic, you probably have an idea what will happen, and I think it will probably end up being lame. Still, it was a well-made movie.I'm just getting sick of Black Panther and Wakanda though. Here you have an black superhero and his nation, which supposedly is some sort of breakthrough for black moviemaking and black comic book superheroes(laughably not true) yet the world of Wakanda is chock full of insulting, backwards stereotypes of African people in spite of the fact their society is so advanced, an alien race can't even break through its force field. Seeing the Wakandans use spears, dressed in tribal gear, just makes my eyes roll as well. Shuri is also the smartest person in Wakanda, dare I say, the only person in Wakanda who seems to be smart enough to engineer anything in spite of the fact their society was technologically advanced for decades, if not centuries. The stupidity of Wakanda is just infuriating and juvenile and I wish they would clean it up in future movies. I just refuse to watch any more Black Panther movies if they are made because I cannot stand anything about it.Also, the balance of power between characters just isn't logical. You will have one character like Hulk get the snot beat out of them, yet Captain America or Iron Man will easily go toe to toe with Thanos and his goons and put up a good fight. The one fight scene in Scotland was really bad; Vision and Scarlet Witch get the snot beat out of them, yet Black Widow, Captain America and Falcon easily make short work of Thanos's goons and run them off? This could have used some work but wasn't enough to ruin the film.I highly recommend this movie. It is a bit long though, but I never checked my watch.",9,5,13,29 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not for Fast and Furious and Transformers fans
","If you start heading for the exits if a movie goes five minutes without a car chase or an explosion and subtitles immediately turn you off from a movie, don't see this film. You know who I'm talking about.This is a true time traveler movie. The audience is taken back in time to 1969 Hollywood to spend time with the lead actor and stuntman Richard Dalton and Cliff Booth. It's quite incredible, would love to see someone do this with Las Vegas in the past, I go there a lot and the history of the place is fascinating. I enjoy movies in which the director takes time and care trying to recreate the past. I view it as kind of a sport. If you want to see a production that absolutely failed at reproducing the eighties, watch the first season of Narcos and play spot the historical anachronisms. It's brutal. It's better if you were born around that time. People born in the nineties and 2000s don't understand. They've lived with cellphones their whole life. That and the internet pretty much changed the world significantly.I appreciated the movie. It's classic Tarantino. I'd have to say that it's his best since Django Unchained, which was his best since Jackie Brown. Kill Bill and Inglorious were awful. I don't care. Django was good but I was worried he was starting to enjoy the violence in his films too much. Once Upon in Hollywood has convinced me he can make a good movie without relying on that nonsense. The violence is there but it's few and far between. Not sure if Tarantino was worried it was costing him work but he did a great job controlling himself here.Definitely must-see unless you're the sort of person that pre-orders Michael Bay and Vin Diesel movie tickets.",10,44,67,28 July 2019
Aladdin," Disney's 'Woke' Nonsense starting to affect the quality of their movies
","The live action adaptations of the Disney movies are a great idea being ruined by the social justice warriors running the company now. Beauty and the Beast was set in the 18th century and featured minorities all over France in the town Belle lived in, some even in high-ranking posts they had no chance of realistically holding in those days. Princess Jasmine all of a sudden has her eyes on becoming a Sultan and even has a 'girl power' musical number? Really guys?Now, you would think that Disney would follow the formula in Beauty and the Beast and cast all sorts of races as the townspeople in Agrabah, right? Nope, everyone is either Middle Eastern or black, which is believable for Arabia in the Middle Ages. So why get so militant about blatantly misrepresenting 18th century Parisian town demographics and history but then faithfully cast Agrabah with historically accurate demographics? Practice what you preach because you're hypocrites.The Jasmine 'girl power' nonsense didn't sit right with me either. I wanted to walk out. It was so obnoxoius. It may be a good reason the box office as well as the reviews for this movie suffered. It was just incredibly stupid and unrealistic. If Disney continues in this direction, I will not watch their movies anymore. I'm not paying money to be lectured by liberals.I felt Will Smith was miscast. I love him but this wasn't right for him. Mena Massoud as Aladdin did a great job, Naomi Scott was upstaged as Jasmine by Nasim Pedrad, her handmaiden. That's not supposed to happen! Nasim was a far more believable Jasmine than Naomi. total miscast! The rest of the casting was spot on aside from Disney's hypocrisy with casting the townspeople. If you're going to set the tone that it's a fantasy and people of all races can be anywhere, do it in all of your movies or you will look foolish, thanks.",6,0,4,13 June 2019
The Lion King," The 1994 movie was perfection; this is second-rate B-movie knockoff trash
","It looks like someone made this and uploaded it to Youtube. Everything is off. Absolutely no effort was put into this movie. They can't claim the CGI didn't allow the animals to have emotion, someone cheaped out on that in production.You can look at the voice actors and see how bad this film was going to be. Instead of talent, they went with actors connected to the right people in the industry. It's a joke.",1,2,3,19 October 2019
A Quiet Place," Worth it for a fun night out but the script was terrible
","This movie had so many plot holes, it's ridiculous. I'll just run down my thoughts in a list of spoilers.
1. The monsters are clearly ripped off from the Dead Space and/or Resident Evil videogame, only they rely on hearing to hunt.
2. There's no way you could live life not making any noises, but the script conveniently stayed away from explaining things like snoring, talking during sleep, sex, bodily functions, etc. At least make the house a safe zone and claim the monsters can't hear you in there.3. It's shown that the monsters are easily defeated with guns. I mean, there's no way the military ever figured this out to their advantage? The local people around never figured it out? Set the egg timer out, have it go off, blast away! End of movie! That would be too easy though. Their attraction to sound is their major weakness! In America, there's no excuse for their survival all this time. 4. How was this guy powering all his electronic gear? He seemed to have some mystery source of power that was never explained. If it was a diesel generator, there wouldn't have been a movie!5. Of course, everyone in this movie has to do absolutely stupid things for the plot to advance. It got to be aggravating and contrived after a while.6. I thought going to an island would have been smart. Someone else said they should have gone underground. I presume if there is a sequel, we'll find out people were in a bunker or something.I'd say this movie was worth the watch, but it was badly written to the point of just being stupid. It would have been amazing on Netflix, but just ok in theaters.",6,4,7,6 May 2018
1917," Should have been titled 'One Shot: The Movie' instead
","Very good movie, will have to admit. Wanted to see it on Christmas Day but the studio pulled the rug out from under everyone and released it this weekend, presumably to escape Star Wars. My main reason for going to see this movie was because Sam Mendes directed, so I know what to expect from him. It attracted the usual war movie crowd, some of whom tend to rub me the wrong way, if you know what I mean, but nevertheless, almost every seat in the theater was full and very few people ever got up for any reason.The one shot theme in this movie does an excellent job of illustrating what the trenches were like and almost feels like it's putting you in the shoes of the characters. I wouldn't say it's the best movie out there, too many characters are doing foolish things that probably wouldn't happen in real life. It is a movie, if this didn't happen, it would be boring. There were a lot of times that characters did things that I assume they wouldn't because of training and protocol.I liked seeing Sikh and black soldiers serving with the British in the movie. Quite often in war movies such as World War I and II, you see minority soldiers ignored even though they served. At first, it looks like some sort of revisionist history, but these men were there, thankfully depicted as they were, not serving as generals or something.There will be some complaints from the audience. I've heard that it felt soulless. I blame the one shot them employed in the entire movie. If you are familiar with the film fanboy discussions on Daredevil, you will have heard about the one shot take fad. So I understood what was going on, but other people won't. There also isn't much action or fighting. I almost want to say that it's not really a war movie. If you're looking for more action and fighting, watch Gallipolli, the TV miniseries, it's on certain subscription streaming sites. This will be well worth your time, highly recommended!",9,0,1,12 January 2020
Black Hawk Down," Movie was total garbage, absolutely sanitized
","The book was horrifying and haunting; the movie was downright sanitized and omitted showing US soldiers shooting Somali civilians in all sorts of horrific ways to survive. That was what the author was talking about when he said 'modern warfare.' Neglecting to show this in the movie is simply unacceptable and does a disservice to anyone who believes this was a true story. Some of the things I read in the book, I will never forget.Also, Delta Force in the books were written to be just highly trained, experienced infantry with some unorthodox methods; they were still very human, not ninjas or anything. About the only thing the movie seemed to get right was the two Delta guys being sent down to guard the chopper pilots. Everything else in this movie was garbage, if not downright propaganda.Terrible movie, no stars from me.",1,1,14,25 August 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Unnecessarily pretentious for a mindless blockbuster
","The script was a major dog in this movie. Upon rewatching the film, it's clear these are different characters, not the same ones in the first. There's too much babble in this movie about topics only drugged out college kids and professors would discuss, not real people. It gets absolutely ridiculous after a while. Also, Marvel is hurting their movies having the superheroes be worried about every single innocent person. These heroes would be thanked in real life for their service, not chastised and condemned. Civilians condemn the Avengers for the lives of a few people dying in spite of the fact the villains were either trying to take over the entire world and kill a lot more or outright destroy it completely. It's ridiculous. The humans have no ability to control these superheroes either; they are Gods. They would answer to them, not the other way around. Like most babble from college types, it's just not grounded in reality, but more the result of ultra-privileged, sheltered lives and a lack of a willingness to understand how the average person operates.The CGI model of Ultron was incredibly bad and made it hard to take him seriously. It was cartoonish, a total hack job. There's a reason they largely kept him out of the trailers. Not sure who was responsible for that, corporate hacks or whatever, but it really hurt the film.",3,3,5,3 March 2018
Hotel Mumbai," Great but another movie that makes India look really, really bad
","Watched this movie this weekend and frankly, it was more of an indictment of Indian society than anything else. Just like Michael Mann has movies set in the same location that seem like they are part of the same universe, Hotel Mumbai seems to be set in the same sort of universe as Slumdog Millionaire, which Dev Patel also was in. The audience sees the crushing poverty India's working class lives in, how they are treated by their superiors who are kind of still living in the past going above and beyond obsessing over their staff's appearance and treating every guest, and they said it, like a God.One thing that made my head turn, even do research, was the fact that Mumbai didn't have a SWAT team and needed to procure one from New Delhi hours away. How incompetent does your government have to be to not have a team like that in Mumbai of all places? One of the world's largest cities! Did crime not exist until 2008 there or something? I have to imagine that at some point they had a crisis that warranted trained SWAT officers with modern equipment. No one ever watched a movie and thought 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have guys like this on the local police force?'I do have some criticism of the leads. For starters, Hollywood needs to stop hiring Dev Patel whenever they need an Indian actor. He was born in England and just exudes that London schoolboy snobbery in every role he's in. He can't act! I can never sympathize with him. The other Westerners in the movie were also insufferable, especially Nazanin Boniadi. Armie Hammer feels absolutely wasted in a bit role in this film. He seems to make a nasty habit of taking stupid, pointless roles that don't help his career and it's baffling.Pretty sure they won't be showing this movie on flights to India. Well done film, better casting would have put it over the top.",9,6,28,10 June 2019
The Dark Knight," Not a good movie compared to the other two in the trilogy
","I have finally decided that it's ok to not like this movie. It's very flawed. I liked Heath Ledger's performance, but part of me doesn't buy that it's his voice, because I've never seen Heath Ledger do anything like this. He's just not capable of it, watch his other movies.The Joker is easily the worst thing about this movie, and I will list the reasons why. He comes across as a nihilistic goth teen instead of a crime kingpin. You can't take him seriously with the messy hair. He's more serial killer than alpha gang leader. He's not intelligent. You compare the Joker from the comics and the cartoon, even the old TV show, and this just isn't him. He paints himself into a corner.There's something about the film that comes off as unfinished, numerous awkward scenes, particularly the Gambol killing scene. Others, like the Joker meeting the other mob bosses doesn't feel like everyone was in the same room filming. It's just weird, like they changed the actor for the Joker and had to reshoot. Other scenes feel just as disconnected. In the last fight, the Joker says something like, 'he wouldn't risk the battle for Gotham in a fist fight with (Batman).' Did he really mean 'We did reshoots and can't actually stage a full-on fight'? The scene with Lau in Hong Kong is less janky than the Joker scenes. After watching this film quite a few times, there's something off about this movie that you don't see in other Nolan films that is strange. You could see a similar effect in 'All The Money In The World' with the reshoots that eliminated Kevin Spacey.It's a shame the new Justice League effort isn't working because it really could be time to do a proper Joker movie, but I don't think that's going to happen, even if the rumor Joker standalone film happens. I'm just not a fan of this movie anymore. Debating selling my 4K Bluray, but I just am not impressed with the film anymore.",5,1,5,1 March 2018
The King," Total trash, ludicrously historically inaccurate, terrible casting
","Timothee Chalamet has to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Nothing about his performance is convincing as a king, nor does he have any personality. All he tries to do is put on a practiced expression learned in a modeling cast. Whenever his mouth is opened, it betrays his lack of competency as an actor. His pre-battle speech at Agincourt is absolutely underwhelming and lame. He and other actors in the film are clean-shaven and pretty but in spite of what untrustworthy commenters claim, you can see that many men in paintings had beards at the time. The film tries to be a jack of all trades to attract girls to watch a movie that they're most likely to not have any interest in. It's ridiculous.It's absolutely historically inaccurate and lacking in charm. Last year's Robert The Bruce movie was really historically inaccurate too, but at least it was enjoyable. This one is just bad. What, in one scene, Henry V is walking point at the head of a column into an unknown village? Seriously guys? That would never happen, sorry! There is one scene at the end of the battle where a prominent ruler is killed that is absolutely ludicrous because he would have been worth a fortune in ransom. It's akin to the Joker burning the mob's pile of money in The Dark Knight!Save yourself the time. The presentation is great, the actual substance of the movie is terrible.",1,44,79,3 November 2019
The Disaster Artist," Horrible movie
","Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. You've been warned. James Franco is utterly annoying and unbearable in this movie. I don't get the joke.

Steve Jobs," Danny Boyle has lost his touch
","Really bad movie. You learn nothing about the man or his methodology behind his success. It's just another fast-talking Aaron Sorkin movie where everyone knows and talks more than you ever can.

Crazy Heart," Great movie until the predictable end
","Bad Blake, played by Jeff Bridges, is a down and out country singer who is an alcoholic. He gets involved with Maggie Gyllenhaal's character and her young son. So they're having a great time, hanging out, he's taking the son places, and come on, you know exactly what's going to happen. He loses sight of the boy and for some reason, can't find him until she arrives. Really? My parents lost me quite a bit growing up and my mom never left my dad, lol. It was my fault. Why would he have been far from the bar? Why would he have told him to explore the place? Why didn't the bartender offer to call security to help him instead of being a jerk? It's contrived writing like this to create conflict that kills movies for me. It's annoying. It was a good movie until that point, it's a shame.",5,0,1,9 March 2018
Joker," Shameless ripoff of King of Comedy, deserves zero merit, also propaganda
","So Hollywood basically wants to use comic book characters to push political subversion now. I get it. In Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos wants to reduce the population by half for the greater good. In the comics, he was doing it to win the love of a female version of Death. In the movie, Thanos all of a sudden cares about managing the population through controversial means.In the Joker, somehow, WB wants to turn this character into an anarchist and terrorist; he's basically Antifa. This movie makes no secret of the fact that he's being depicted as the good guy here. That's why I just didn't like this movie. I think it's dangerous. Do the rich get away with too much? Yes. Does this movie have anything to do with the character or the Batman universe? Really and truly, no. This movie is a one-sided political statement in favor of Antifa. I'm not dumb.Worst of all, is this even canon? Is Phoenix the new Joker? Did they basically just make Batman the bad guy? It seems so to me.I would have to say that if this is an origin story for The Joker, it's the worst one they could have come up with. I could have written this as a kid. There was no nuance in the film. This is what any eight-year old would have come up with watching Batman as a kid. Real life isn't like this.This was terrible, it will be forgotten in a year or two, max. I guarantee it.I have to add, I've just seen the King of Comedy and Todd Phillips shamelessly ripped it off. He has fooled people into thinking he made something original and artistic when it's glorified rehash of that movie with the Joker name slapped onto it. I'm glad I didn't pay for this, really and truly. This does not deserve Oscar consideration.",1,31,136,6 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Could not believe how obnoxiously racist the script was
","I wanted to walk out but I took my mother who loved the first one and my dad tagged along. I could not believe how racist this movie was! In the first film, most of the kids were pretty much solidly middle or lower class. They were grounded. In this movie, all of the white members of the Losers do not just have good jobs, they are wealthy!!! Like, they are all white collar professionals who are likely millionaires, if not billionaires like Ben! Mike, the African-American, is the only one that is unemployed, driving a clunker from the eighties and possibly squatting in a building. What is up with that???!!! I've never seen a more ridiculous display of a microaggression by the writers in a movie in my life. In 2019, no less! I do believe the maliciousness was intentional, especially the contrast between all the vehicles the characters drive at different points in the story. How can you feel any sympathy for the characters when the writer constantly puts their white supremacist beliefs on display, using Mike as their punching bag? I mean, it's not even like some of them have normal, everyday jobs and like a couple are really successful. Mike is the odd one out. His present occupation is never discussed, he was like an outcast at the Chinese restaurant. The contrast between them is stark, glaring and not even acknowledged or explained somehow. The way such a likable character from the first movie was treated is so malicious, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, almost like they are treating the character like a voodoo doll. Something about Mike's depiction just rubbed me the wrong way; so much so that I knew it wasn't just a part of the story, it was an angry, racist writer taking out their issues against minorities. Speaking of contrasts, at the end, Mike is shown driving away from Derry to Florida in his eighties beater, shortly contrasted with a scene of Beverly and Ben living the life on a gigantic, expensive yacht. None of Mike's so-called friends would even chip in to help the guy buy a $5,000 Toyota for his drive and new life in Florida.Whoever wrote this movie really wanted us to know they didn't like Mike for some reason. The message has been received loud and clear dude!As for the actual movie, it was garbage. There was too much Pennywise and I felt at times that I was watching a videogame. Some people claim that there was a need for Part Two. It is what I thought it was all along, an unnecessary sequel. The first movie was fine on its own. This was trash in every way. I really wish someone would call it out but no one is brave enough to, apparently. Lke someone mentioned, it's absolutely redundant, the same film with adults and a less coherent plot. I will not recommend. Worst movie I've seen in a long, long time.",1,8,35,11 September 2019
12 Strong," Lowest common denominator war movie
","You can tell right from the outset that this is a movie for 2nd amendment gun nuts, America never loses types. Director couldn't even get the reactions to 9-11 right. It felt like everyone was rewatching the attacks in 2018. People were literally speechless after this happened. They used to see the WTC in pictures of NYC's skyline, in movies, videogames, from the airport, then boom, it was all gone. People couldn't believe this happened in America. It only happened in other countries.The attitude was that Afghanistan had to be taken and the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had to be dealt with. The goal was to get Bin Laden and correct the injustice the Taliban were inflicting onto their own people. The History Channel only broadcast shows about the Taliban every week, back when it was basically Pentagon propaganda and not a reality TV/bad history drama station.There was basically no effort to let anyone know this was 2001. Anything from CRT monitors, cellphones to cultural oddities, hairstyles, was left out.Unfortunately, like Black Hawk Down, the movie, I think this was basically another Pentagon sponsored movie focused on being Army recruiting and war promotion to the public than telling a truthful story. Nonfiction war novels are far more honest and gritty, unfortunately. Maybe I'll pick this book up, but this didn't pass the smell test.",1,8,23,15 April 2018
Parasite," One of the worst movies of 2019, I don't get the hype

Every celebrity, message board poster and even the former President of the United States Obama are saying this was the best movie of the year.It's just not good! Why is this being considered one of the best of the year? I'm totally lost. This is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. To put it bluntly, even Michael Bay's worst Transformers movie is better than this dreck.I came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next City of God based on the hype. It's actually on the level of a movie on Netflix that I'd spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking 'thumbs down.'Don't waste your time, trust me on this.I forgot to add, it's very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off Shameless in many ways. They were definitely inspired by it.",1,94,189,30 December 2019
Wonder Woman," Terrible, poorly written movie
","This was a very bad movie. DC has another stinker on its hands. Most people are going to see it because the trailer was fantastic. The movie, however is not. It's just absolutely absurd. The SJW, feminist nonsense is just over the top. Gal Gadot is a terrible actress. The battle scenes are just garbage, as well as its treatment of the conflict and resolution. It's over the top absurd. How most of the professional reviewers haven't called it out is unreal. If you're a history major, interested in history, you're going to hate this movie and its message. It's just dumb. Wonder Woman basically has the same mentality as Emily Blunt's character in Sicario, and it's just as absurd.It's not a good movie. I can't recommend it.",1,126,264,3 June 2017
Marriage Story," Actually is worthy of the hype, every man should watch this
","Great movie, should be required viewing for every boy and man. Unlike other overrated, mediocre movies hyped by the critics like Uncut Gems and Parasite, you can tell that this was someone's baby. I only expected to last five minutes but it ended up an incredibly compelling movie. I'm a big fan of Adam Driver's work, I haven't seen a thing from him that I've hated. He's honestly one of the best actors from America to be in the business for a very long time after years of Hollywood casting frat bros and pretty boys with no talent. I don't need to name names.Extra points for giving Ray Liotta a job. He did great.This definitely deserves to be considered a classic. Storytelling in modern movies is a dying art, great to see someone bringing it back.",10,6,14,31 December 2019
Black Panther," One of the worst movies I've ever seen, too many plot holes
","Oh yes, this review has spoilers. 1. Lupita Nyongo and Winston Duke do an amazing job in the movie; Chadwick Boseman is way too boring and terrible of an actor to be a leader. Michael B. Jordan completely fails as an actor here. He needs a Razzie for this performance. The rest of the cast are simply contrived or phoning it in for an easy paycheck. Andy Serkis did seem to enjoy his role. It felt like a waste when he was killed off.
2. Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is the worst villain ever in the Marvel universe. Jordan approaches the character, who is supposed to be a genius, like an NFL defensive end that is on steroids, which makes it very hard to take him seriously. He was smart enough to graduate from the Naval College at 19 and go to MIT for grad school but opts to become a SEAL who kills hundreds of people? Right. Worse yet, Killmonger also appears the be the only character in the history of Wakanda that has any sort of common sense. Aren't you not supposed to sympathize with the bad guy?
3. The whole premise of the country of Wakanda is an insult to Africans and black people in general. Instead of basing Wakanda on your average African country, it is portrayed as being like a futuristic Shanghai with tech that is decades, if not centuries advanced. How in the world has no one left Wakanda and told the world about what is there? How has it been kept a secret? Why haven't they conquered the world? Killmonger is the only leader of Wakanda that has figured out what the country is capable of! Once again, that takes you completely out of the movie. How can a society be so advanced but yet not understand how powerful it is?
4. Wakanda is supposed to be the most advanced nation of Earth but everyone still dresses and acts like primitive tribal people and even determine their leadership through individual combat. Despite being advanced, T'Challa's bodyguards use spears and call guns primitive. Seriously?
5. M'baku, the leader of the Jabari tribe, wants to be the Black Panther very badly and hates every other tribe, but when presented with the chance to ingest the flower that will give him the Black Panther's strength and kill off T'Challa, opts to help him recover instead and take back his throne. Predictably of course, he claims to not want to help T'Challa at first, only to show up during the battle. Surprise! Not really.
6. On the topic of predictability, as soon as you see Daniel Kaluuya's character, you know he's going to be the friend that stabs T'Challa in the back.
7. They tried too hard to push Shuri as a lovable Q like character, but she was never convincing at all. If anything, she was beyond annoying.
8. Black Panther's father, as Black Panther, commits an unsolved black on black murder in a project in Oakland in 1992. I am not making this up.
9. T'Challa comes to Oakland in the present day, shows some kids his futuristic jet, who then gawk and start discussing how they will steal it, strip it down and sell the parts. Once again, not making this up. Wasn't this supposed to be a positive film for black people that didn't reinforce negative stereotypes of them?10, 20 years ago, movies like this would have been nominated for a Razzie. Now, they are getting near perfect scores on Rotten Tomatoes and under consideration for Oscars. I'm just not buying it. This was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. I could go into detail but I just can't remember everything. You've been warned.",3,102,229,17 February 2018
Creed II," All the Rockys are the same movie, mix it up for once; terrible!
","You know a movie is bad when you can predict the plot from start to finish. If you had to ask someone to write down the plot of this film with the sole guideline that it not be edgy, this is what you would get from most people. It basically was a remake of the Rocky with Drago without Apollo Creed dying. Whoever wrote the script for this movie should be ashamed of themselves. There was zero attempt to be original, zero attempt to make the film nuanced, zero attempt to develop characters. The Ukrainians/Russians were the worst. This is 2018, not the eighties. It felt like the Soviet Union never fell in this movie.I didn't like the Drago subplot specifically. It was beyond lazy. There was no point bringing Drago's ex-wife back. Develop the character if you're going to do that, don't just put her in the movie without a good reason for her to be there. We're also meant to assume Drago's dad was completely shunned by everyone after the first movie, which just wouldn't have happened. There was no rematch? He didn't continue his career? He didn't move to Little Odessa, NYC, join the mob, train fighters? London? Come on. His mom just gave the younger Drago up, apparently?One last thing, Michael B. Jordan was the weak point of this movie. It's official, he can't act. His performance in this film was embarrassing. It had to be said. He used to try before, but now it seems like fame has gotten to his head. I wouldn't be disappointed if Creed was recast for the third movie. TBH, I'd rather see a proper film about Drago and his son, just with a better actor. There's more of a story there than with Adonis Creed.Can't recommend. Don't even bother on video, it's that bad. The audience at my showing loved the movie and even clapped, but they must have never seen a Rocky movie before because it basically was a carbon copy. A shameless one.",1,45,92,24 November 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Just not good at all
","I'm sorry, what about this movie warranted any nominations? I totally didn't get the Hitler 'imaginary friend' thing. Taika Waititi thinks he's funny but I think he's trying too hard and he's laughing at himself too much. There's really a fine line when it comes to comedy and he's just not it.The whole movie just seemed incredibly irreverent and disrespectful to the war and all the people who died in it. I wasn't learning anything either.I would consider it one of the worst movies of the year.",1,6,25,13 February 2020
Midway," Much better than the reviews said it was
","As usual, liberal critics who hate America and nationalism bashed this movie. I went in wanting to hate it completely, I had a discounted ticket and just wanted to get out to the theater because I'm working a very stressful job now. Ed Skrein did an amazing job and Roland Emmerich did an amazing job recreating 1940s America and the Navy. Many directors just choose to hire today's flavor of the day actors and won't even make them adopt period-accurate hair styles and personalities. Even Saving Private Ryan was pretty bad about that, with soldiers talking like they were from the modern day, haircuts that the actors wear everyday, there was just little effort put into recreating the period.I was pleasantly surprised at the battle scenes. From what I've read of the actual Midway battle, they got many of the details that I remembered fairly accurate. I'm no expert, but at no point was there any head-scratching moment like you saw in 'The King' or 'Outlaw King' where they had something ridiculous happen like the King of France trying to fight the King of England 1v1 and getting killed by some ordinary soldiers after slipping in the mud, lol! To make matters worse, that's a Netflix movie, not something commercially released in theaters! I think if this movie was that ridiculous, it would have FDR in one of the dive bombers or something, good lord.I will definitely be buying this on home video when it is released. I am impressed. Do not listen to the critics.",10,16,29,9 November 2019
The Matrix," Great movie, but Agent Smith didn't stay consistent throughout the series
","At the beginning, you see Agent Smith acting like a real agent, taking stairs up, acting like a normal human being, conversations and everything. As the movie goes on, and the series in general, the writing and action scenes get out of control, with Smith warping to one person to the next. It just lost its consistency and it got hard to take the film seriously.The film is great, even a classic, but it all went sideways after the first movie. If it could be rebooted without the Wachowski Brothers, it would be a great franchise. I'd like to see that happen someday.But for now, I just pretend the other two films don't exist. It's for the best.",9,1,2,1 April 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Good film, but the right-wing privatization element bothers me
","Another great film from Matthew Vaughan, with great action scenes, story and acting. The only thing that bothered me about the cast is Taron Edgerton, he's not leading man material and not really that good of an actor.Watching both films recently, I was a bit confused about the Kingsman and how they were funded, given that in the second movie, the Statesmen were entirely funded by a whiskey company. So upon rewatching the first movie, I hadn't realized that this whole ludicrous outfit was being funded, legitimately, by tailors making suits.REALLY?So yeah, for some reason, instead of trying to profit as much as possible, the Kingsman run a vigilante operation that operates under the pretenses of patriotism and always serves the country and the greater good? Really? There are also numerous times that events in the first film contradict what is going on in the second film, and at times, within the same movie itself.The message of the comic/movie from Mark Millar is rather clear; private industry is better than the government at doing its job, and not corrupt. I just don't get it. It's just one of those movies that really shouldn't be thought about too much, otherwise, you'll realize how stupid it is underneath it all.I don't know.",8,0,3,8 October 2017
Annihilation," This really earned the one-star rating
","Holy cow, tried to watch this a few nights ago. It's really bad. Think I got 30 or 40 minutes in, looked up from my computer and realized that awful pretentious psychiatrist was still droning on to Natalie Portman about some pretentious babble in the facility. It was nothing like the trailers made the film out to be. Natalie Portman should not be cast as the lead in movies anymore, she does not care about acting anymore, hasn't since she finished Leon. It's sad that she continues to get jobs when other actresses can't break into the industry. I really like Alex Garland's writing, but as a director, he's horrible. This is the second misfire that he's had, Ex Machina being the first. It's such a shame.Seriously, don't bother watching this. It really is that bad.",1,6,13,18 March 2018
Spectre," Not horrendous, but terrible script ruins movie
","1. Christoph Waltz is a terrible Blofeld, it's impossible to take him seriously. Jesper Christensen or Mads Mikkelson would have been much better Blofelds.
2. Ralph Fiennes is a serious downgrade as M. The 'Hot Priest' would have been a better choice, but he wasn't well-known five years ago.
3. Seriously doubt an organization like Spectre would allow talented, capable assassins and members to be usurped by gigantic, mindless thugs in combat.
4. Recycled music really takes away from the presentation of the movie. It just feels lazy.
5. Over the years, the movies have contradicted each other about how the organization works. It's possible that in Quantum, the opera scene was set up as a plug for the production involved as it was in Mission Impossible 5. They went from an organization that was very private and shadowy, to driving expensive sports cars to a historical building in Rome which is sure to attract all kinds of attention. It's just ridiculously stupid.
6. Shooting down a helicopter with a handgun is beyond stupid.
7. Bond is supposed to not be able to recognize people after Blofeld's machine does its job, but absolutely nothing happens. Ok?
8. Why make Blofeld related to Bond? Why do this? He's an antiquated step-down compared to the characters introduced in the past twenty years.Sadly, the next one seems like it will be worse.",6,1,6,10 November 2019
The Social Network," Movie hasn't aged well
","This movie is pretty much about the first years of Facebook, when it was pretty much a cleaner version of Myspace and more open to free speech. While it was well-made, it was made much too early. Facebook a few years after this movie got made has pretty much gone down the dumps. Whether it's left-wing political bullying by friends, utterly uninformed right-wingers spreading misinformation, moderators punishing users with up to 30-day bans, it's a site with one foot in the grave. I really don't understand Facebook's rationale for who gets banned and who doesn't, I know some crazy people who never get banned while I get banned for speaking my mind about community issues.The Zuckerberg in this movie would have been horrified at what is going on now. If he did this at the beginning, Facebook wouldn't have taken off. It would have gone down. Now they are a giant enterprise and can basically run anyone out of the business. There is no competition. No one will go use the competition. It's a sad state of affairs. I haven't used or participated in social media for years. It was nice while it lasted but I can see that people are tired of it and it's a fad that has passed.I don't know how well Facebook is doing. I still get asked to friend people on the site but I keep telling them I don't use it anymore. Kids in high school still use it, although kids at some schools claim they don't. Some of these kids do nothing but post fights and violent stuff on there, but while I get banned for sharing what I observe everyday at work, no wacky, controversial opinions, they are free to do this with few repercussions.The site is garbage. When it has to shut down, I will throw a party. If a sequel is made, it will have to detail how Zuckerberg let power get to his head and ruin a good thing.",5,0,3,6 April 2020
The Martian," Sadly, a movie that gets dated very quickly
","Dialogue is pretty much the downfall of this movie. It has fantastic cinematography and special effects. The cast is fantastic. However, as someone that went to a reputable university, unfortunately, the movie chose to give the characters in the movie the same sort of personality and culture that you'd see on a college campus. I've never worked for NASA or any engineering firm, so maybe it's realistic, I'm not sure. In a way, I thought it was a kid's movie. Mark Watney doesn't act like a grown-up, no one in NASA acts like a grown-up, it almost seems like the only mature people in the entire film are Jessica Chastain's character and Bill Pullman. Mark Watney's character is absolutely obnoxious. He was obnoxious in the book too, but the director should have had the discretion to change the character to be a bit more mature and human. At no point is suicide ever discussed by anyone in the film, nor does Mark ever come to terms with the fact no one may ever come back for him. He just acts like a little kid who has been left home alone, one big party. This is all made more convenient by the fact that he conveniently has no family or loved ones, despite being a Botany Ph.D. and an astronaut with a great job.I bought the blu-ray thinking it would be great for my collection, but this thing is going to get horrible real fast. It's most certainly not a classic, nor is it even something I'd show in school. It's a shame, because the film certainly could have been a lot better.",6,0,1,17 September 2017
