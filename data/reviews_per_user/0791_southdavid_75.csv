The Avengers," How Loki can you Go-ki ?
","'Endgame' prep began with me deciding to rewatch the three Avengers films starting with 2012's 'Avengers Assemble' as it was called in the UK. I can't believe it was only 7 years ago, it seems like so much longer.Thanos (inexplicably, given what's to come) lends an infinity stone to Loki, so he can head to Earth and conquer it. In return, Loki will acquire the Tesseract, use it to transport his Chitari army across the galaxy and then, presumably, hand the stones over to Thanos. Following the loss of the Tesseract, Nick Fury instigates his Avengers Initiative program, pulling together some of the exceptional people known to SHIELD to form a response unit, to the threat of intergalactic war.Happily, 'AA' still holds up really well. The effects are still strong, only one little scene of Captain America outside the Helicarrier clearly looking like a CGI stuntman and some weird scaling on Hulk in the final stare down with Loki. There are some awesome scenes in it, iconic even. Hulk chasing Black Widow down the corridor before leading into the fight with Thor, the 'Puny God' moment and essentially the whole Chitari showdown battle.Character wise it's strong too. Starting some relationships that continue to pan out in the series. Friendships between Romanov and Banner and Stark and Banner. The immediate antagonism between the opposites of Stark and Rogers, but also starting Cap's distrust of organisations that would pay off in The Winters Soldier. The character whose probably least like he is now is Loki, much more vicious and condescending in this than he becomes... though even there, there are moments, between him and Thor.It's not a perfect film though, it does have quite a large block in the middle, between the capture of Loki and Barton's attack that feels a little draggy, again there's a lot of good character work here but compared to the later films it's a little slow. Though it has funny moments, it's obviously not as referential as the films could become later, when there were a few more of them.Though it's been superseded in quality over the years, 'Avengers Assemble' remains a high point in the series and a real indicator of what a combined cinematic universe could offer.",8,0,0,24 April 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Crazy Eighty Eight Out Of Ten
","So. On to volume 2. Though lacking the action of volume 1, I came away liking this half of the story more than the previous one. It's more talky, more talky than even I remembered, but it's also more dramatic and it's moments of violence spread out.The second half of the story shifts the focus back to America as The Bride (Uma Thurman) hunts down the remaining members of the VIPER hit squad Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) before heading after Bill (David Carradine) himself. However, after falling into a trap, The Bride has to recall specific training given to her by Pai Mei (Chai-Hui Liu) for just such an occasion.It's definitely the less cooler half of the story. There's no iconic outfits, tunes, no pussy waggons. There's no action to rival the Crazy 88 scene, though the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver in the confined quarters of a mobile home is pretty great stuff. But it's a better story than volume 1. It has an Arc across it as we see the Two Pines Massacre, before what Budd is up to and his interactions with the bride that take us to one of the darkest points of a story that's filled with dark moment.The ending is perhaps slightly underwhelming. The scenes between The Bride and Bill are fun, and the dialogue here is perhaps as close to Tarantino dialogue at its best that the two films ever get too.What it is, is another Q.T. film that, whilst its quality is undeniable, I don't feel is an undisputed classic.",8,0,0,16 June 2020
It," Down With The Clown
","With Chapter Two out this week, I rewatched the first film over the weekend in preparation. Happily, I found that, though not quite as much as the first time, I still enjoyed the film - though admittedly it's not actually that scary.Haunted by the disappearance of his brother several months early, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) and his friends begin their summer holiday. They, and the rest of the town's children are being tormented by horrific visions that are linked to a clown, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). Their investigation leads to the understanding that Pennywise has inhabited their town for decades, appearing every 27 years to hunt and then disappearing back to the sewers.It should first be said again, as a horror film 'It' isn't particularly scary. It has a few creepy moments, most of which a either background characters or moments. There's one fantastic scene involving a projector - but for the most part the film scary elements are Pennywise's manifestations. Those are created in CGI and they're fine, just not that frightening. However, if you recalibrate slightly, 'It' is a wonderfully entertaining (and surprisingly funny) 'Stranger Things-esque' adventure about a group of children that fight back against an evil that is after them. Finn Wolfhard's presence in the film helps to add to that 'Stranger Things' feeling and his wisecracking character Ritchie is one of the highlights amongst the gang. It's like 'The Goonies' but with more horror elements.The cast are great, Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise is already an iconic horror character - without detracting from the Tim Curry version. My only concern is that this is the easy half of the overall story, and the second chapter has some much less cinematic elements to try and find a way to incorporate. I guess I'll find out tomorrow how successful they were.",8,0,0,10 September 2019
Hereditary," Headless Horseman
","This is going to be a hard review. In another review I've posted, for 'Annihilation', I talked about a fairly solid film that was undone by a catastrophic ending. 'Hereditary' is almost the mirror opposite. Despite a gnawing sense of tension throughout the 90 minutes I think my most common sensation was one of boredom. Indeed there were some people leaving the Cinema during this time and not returning. However, what they missed was a gloriously insane last twenty five minutes, which almost, but if I am honest doesn't quite, make up for the journey to get there. The performances throughout are particularly strong though. Toni Colllette is great, Oscar worthy is a fair assessment, although I'm sure that as a genre film and length of time to next March will mean it's forgotten by then. Alex Wolff too is excellent and I particularly liked how he reverted to a younger child crying for his Mummy during the later scenes, it was a brave choice not to try and hold onto any cool detachment and just go for it. The film looks beautiful and the idea that Annie creates models of her house and of scenes from her life that interacts with actual sets of the movie works well (if that never actually pays off into the actual movie at all). The tension is slowly ratcheted up across those initial minutes, as the film toys with the idea that something supernatural is going on against the idea that mental illness or schizophrenia runs in this family and is affecting the grief that befalls them - but there's just too much of it... It goes on too long with family members either not sufficiently curious or deciding to get the hell out of the house, or away from each other, than is realistic. The music and sound design really feeds into this, with a low off putting buzzing adding to the sense of dread. Then there's the ending. I liked it. I expect that for some who weren't paying attention it does rather come out of nowhere and I too was with an audience that laughed at some of it but this gloriously OTT finale really worked for me. Enough to earn it two extra stars on my score.",5,1,2,15 June 2018
John Wick," John Wicked.
","Bit of prep work ahead of seeing John Wick 3 here.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired hitman is forced back into that life when he's beaten, his car is stolen and his dog is killed by Iosef (Alfie Allen) the son of a Russia Crime boss (Michael Nyqvist). So begins Wick's act of supreme revenge as he uses his very specific skill set to track down and kill all of the crime syndicate.Seeing it again, I was surprised at how much time 'John Wick' gave to establishing the character and world before unleashing him. It's probably 25 minutes or so before the action really starts, which is helpful as those 25 minutes are really the building blocks that the three films have been based on. It does go some way to establishing the world of 'John Wick' too, with glimpses of The Continental and establishing the rules of the universe that will become more important in the sequels.Acting is not good, as you might imagine, though Reeves has somehow found a way to legitimise his one note deadpan style for Wick. The story is a basic revenge thriller but that's not really why we're here. We are here for glorious visceral expertly choreographed violence that has proved a stark contrast to the CGI heavy or edited within an inch of their lives action films that have been prevalent in the last few years. Though it's only a return really, to how films used to be made, particularly in the 'Hong Kong' style, the fact it's been away for a while does make it feel like 'John Wick' is special and unique.",8,1,1,3 June 2019
The Big Lebowski," A Perfect Strike !
","Recently given a one night cinematic return to mark 20 years since its initial release. 'The Big Lebowski' remains on the highpoints of the Coen Brothers remarkable career of excellence. Their farcical homage to Raymond Chandler stars Jeff Bridges, as 'The Dude' whose real name, Jeff Lebowski drags him into a plot to ransom the wife of his namesake, played by David Huddleston. Blackmailers come to the wrong address, rugs are pissed on and threats are made. Eventually the 'Big' Lebowski chooses 'The Dude' to be the bag man for the ransom drop off. A decision that all involved soon come to regret. Twenty years has allowed me to watch 'The Big Lebowski' a few times, and to be fair it's a film that improves with each watch. The plot is nothing special, in fact it's almost non-existant. The character revolve around each other and at the end of it you're no wiser as to who, if anyone, actually kidnapped Bunny (Tara Reid) or what happened to the $1M dollars. . But you come to appreciate that the plot isn't as important as the characters and what characters they are. Jeff Bridges gives a career best performance as 'The Dude'.... Mumbling and 'man-ing' his way through the film, which belies the wit that he sometimes allows a glimpse of. It is one of the funniest, most quotable movies of all time. Full of the Coen's regular acting troop, some of whom show up for just one or two scenes, make their memorable mark and then are never heard from again. It is a stone cold classic, and we'll still be watching it in another twenty years.",9,3,4,25 September 2018
Unbreakable," Purple Rain
","In preparation for the upcoming 'Glass' I decided to rewatch 'Unbreakable' to remind me of the early adventures of David Dunn.Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, is lone survivor of a train derailment who inexplicably doesn't have a scratch on him. The reporting of the event brings him to the attention of Elijah Price (Sam Jackson) a man with hyper brittle bones caused by Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Inspired by seeing the opposite of his fragile body, and by a life of reading comic books, Elijah attempts to investigate and then convince Dunn that he is a hero and should be using his gifts.Firstly, I was stuck on how much of 'Unbreakable' I remembered, despite it being a few years since I last saw it. Back when M Night Shyamalan could do no wrong, his trademark twist in this one seems obvious, even overplayed, once you know it. Though I do remember, whilst not on a 'Sixth Sense' level, this was a pretty solid twist the first time I saw it. Though Shyamalan's twists became his 'trademark', eventually to his detriment, there are a lot of other key traits of his in 'Unbreakable' that remain there to be admired. Shot framing and particularly camera movement are excellent. The longs takes and limited cutting also are striking, with occasionally deciding to keep the character on one person in a conversation, and look at their reactions, rather than drifting backwards and forwards. The colour palette usage is also nicely done.'Unbreakable' feels very much like what it was apparently originally envisioned to be. It's the first third of a superhero film (the character establishing section) stretch out to a full length feature. As a result it does feel a bit of an unusual film. There isn't many of the beats you would expect, it's mostly Dunn putting his family back together and coming to accept who he is (or who he might be). The films climax comes from catching a murderer who is not mentioned prior to the previous scene this occurs in. A more traditional film might have built that character more across the runtime, before having Dunn oppose him, but 'Unbreakable' is more interested in the relationship between Dunn and Price.I'm not sure that the pacing would allow the film to stand up to too many repeated viewings, but as a film seen once every so often it very much stands up - and I'm looking forward to a proper return for Dunn and Price in 'Glass'.",7,0,0,7 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Skrull Island
","The 21st film of the Marvel Cinematic universe marks the debut of new and powerful character in what is a good addition to the series, although a little short of some of the series highest points.Vers (Brie Larson) is a member of a Kree special ops team led by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). The Kree are at war with the Skurlls, a race with the ability to physically change their appearance to mimic anyone else. When a rescue mission becomes an ambush, Vers ends up crash landing on Earth and discovers a Skrull plot involving an earth scientist (Anette Benning). Ignoring protocol and continuing her investigation, Vers meets Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) a midlevel agent of SHIELD and together they discover that Vers links to Earth might be more than she imagined.That top line generally sums up 'Captain Marvel' for me. It's good, really good. It ought to be as Marvel have made 21 decent films in a row, so they've got the tone, effects and story beats down. Just the one effect, Coulson's de-aging, doesn't quite ring true, I'm not sure if it's the hair, or if there just isn't as much footage of Clark Gregg from around that time in his life, as there is of Samuel L Jackson (as a reference if nothing else), but it never quite crosses the uncanny valley for me, everything else is spot on. The story is good enough, performances are too and the chemistry between Brie Larson and Jackson is excellent. One area where 'Captain Marvel' is the best in the MCU in my opinion is musically. I'm a 90's child so there were some great memories and some of my favourite songs in here.The only negatives are that it suffers in comparison to the series highspots, including the most recent few like 'Ragnorok' , 'Spider-man: Homecoming' and 'Infinity War'. It's not as funny as the first two (although Ben Mendelson is giving it a go and I hope that we see his character again in subsequent sequels) or as weighty as the third... (Indeed it can't be, as you know that at least half the cast of this film are going to reappear in subsequent ones in the timeline, so the stakes aren't there).It's a good time though and I look forward to where the sequels, as well as her joining The Avengers, will take us.",8,1,2,12 March 2019
Us," Tether Ball
","Jordan Peele's follow up to his hugely successful 'Get Out' is another horror film that has something to say about the world and how we see each other. This time though, the message is a little more overt and the plot a little more contrived which leave 'Us' in the good/not great bracket.Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) and her family visit a beach resort town, which was the site of a childhood trauma for her, as she went briefly missing from the funfair when she was a child. Her paranoia and feelings of dread grow across the day, until the evening, when the family notice another family standing on the edge of the driveway. To their horror and disbelief, the second family are their exact doubles.It's going to be difficult to talk about my perceived failings with 'Us' without drifting further into spoiler territory that I am usually willing to do in my reviews. I'll start with the positives then. The principle cast are great. Away from Adelaide's increasing paranoia they feel like a realistic family with plausible interactions between each other. I loved Winston Duke as Gabe, the father in the family. The Music is great, the film is often quite funny and the camera work is dynamic and interesting. The early part of the interactions between the families is genuinely creepy as is the sense of dread that inhabits the initial part of the film is palpable.I get the allegorical nature of the story, and I appreciate that. The class differences that display between us can often be traced to a few, or even just one decision that ends up defining a person. Or even just an accident of birth location. The Mexican or Polish person 'coming for your job' isn't some sort of monster, they are a human being with wants, needs and dreams just like you. They are 'us'.Where it falls down is as the film opens up. Spoilers ahead !Somehow, the horror situation becomes less scary as the scope becomes larger. It's the difference between a slasher movie and a Zombie movie, neither a less valid but one speaks to individual fears and the other societal horrors. At the same time, logically, the film begins to breakdown here. It's just impractical to live underground your whole life, eating nothing but Rabbit and function properly. The rules of 'tethering' seem pretty ill-defined too, as sometimes they mirror above as below, and sometimes not.It's not a bad film, not at all - I enjoyed my time with it, but it does leave you with more questions that it answers.",7,1,2,4 April 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," That's Why Mum's Gone To Iceland
","Although I know it's a big deal to some people, I don't really enjoy a Eurovision event that much and I worried before seeing this film that the contest was beyond parody to begin with. I think I was right and I wouldn't say I enjoyed this film, but I find it hard to generate any real venom for it either.Since childhood, Lars Erickssong (Will Ferrell) has had one dream, to win the Eurovision song contest. To the chagrin of his father (Pierce Brosnan) and the majority of the Icelandic town he lives in, this dream has stayed strong, and along with his childhood friend Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) they have submitted a song each year to be the Icelandic entry. When all the remaining options are killed in an explosion, Lars and Sigrit head to Edinburgh to represent the nation. But there, as their affection grows, the Russian entry, Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens) begins to make a play for Sigrit.So there are, for my money, three things wrong with the movie. Firstly, it's far too reverential of the Eurovision Song Contest itself to operate as a parody. None of the performances are that over the top, compared to what you'd actually see. This is probably because Ferrell is a fan of the show, and that it uses many of the official logos, themes and presenters of the actual event - and in order to secure that, they can't then poke too much fun at their hosts. Secondly, Ferrell himself. I know he's the only reason the film gets made in the first place, as he's the fan, but he's strikingly older than McAdams. Distractingly so and I felt the character could have done with more genuine charm or naivety that Ferrell didn't provide. But thirdly, and most crucially, it's just not that funny. It doesn't try for enough jokes to get by on the hit rate that the film has. It's not even prepared to allow for Fire Saga to be a bad band. Accidents befall every performance that they have, but they can sing as well as anyone else on the show.That said, I can't bring myself to say I hated it like I did 'Holmes and Watson' say. Dan Steven's is great, the Demetriou siblings are both in it, though not given enough to do, and the resolution of the Demi Lovato ghost subplot made me chuckle. It's all very amiable - just not funny.",5,2,6,29 June 2020
Knives Out," 'I Might Be Wrong'
","Really enjoyable, if slightly overpraised (at the moment) for my money, murder mystery from Rian Johnson.Acclaimed author Harlan Thromby (Christopher Plummer) dies on the night of his birthday party at his stately home. Though seemingly suicide, the celebrated amateur detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) believes it may be something more sinister - particularly when he learns that Thromby has recently been putting his estate in order, which would prove costly for his lazy ruthless trust-fund family.There's an awful lot to like about 'Knives Out'. It's an all-star cast, and the performances generally live up to that billing; even if, rather by the necessity of time, some of them don't feature very much. The script is also very funny, with several laugh out loud lines - though I wouldn't go as far as calling 'Knives Out' a comedy and definitely not a parody of a 'whodunit'. I do like to see a murder mystery on the big screen again, as a genre it's rather fallen out of favour, or been resigned to the television - I don't think we've had a big screen one since 'Murder on the Orient Express'. Once you get used to Daniel Craig's accent, it's easier to warm to the character (in fact I'd like to see another Benoit Blanc mystery at some point in the future).One criticism is true of the genre, rather than specifically this film. Given that I now know what happened that night, I don't think I'm going to need to see the film again any time soon, if ever. There isn't much replay value to it.Specific to this film though, at its conclusion I felt like I wanted more. There are a number of twists, but they revolve around the characters that we're left with and I think I'd have preferred a cleverer version that involved a few more of the rest of the family in some capacity. I do accept that this is a delicate balancing act though, and too many twists for the sake of it might have driven the film into farce.That said, for the two hours you're in the cinema with 'Knives Out' it's a great time.",7,2,4,3 December 2019
Aquaman," Dampen your enthusiasm
","I'm at a bit of a quandary about how to review 'Aquaman' here. It's not good, that's fair to say but I've a strange feeling it's about as good as its ridiculous source material would allow it to be.Jason Momoa is Arthur Curry. Hilariously he's supposed to be 29 years old. He's also the son of Atlanna, fleeing queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) and Tom, a lighthouse keeper, played (in unconvincing de-aging CGI by Temurea Morrison). His half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens to unite the undersea kingdoms and wage war on the land dwellers, so Arthur returns home to challenge his brother for control of the undersea realms.So, whilst it's not really acting as such, Jason Momoa is always watchable and his charisma will carry you through quite a distance. The film also has a few decent action sequences along the way, particularly the underwater battle that concludes it and the opening fight scene on board a submarine. That's about it for the positives though.On dozens of occasions, 'Aquaman' is laugh out loud hilariously awful. The plot is terrible, a clichÃ© ridden McGuffin hunt, a painfully obvious twist towards the end and some awful foreshadowing plot points. It has, noticeably, terrible music choices throughout - a horrible score of pretend wonder. The rest of the performances apart from Momoa are dreadful, particularly Willem Defoe and Dolph Lundgren but nobody else comes off particularly well. It's the script though, that should have been drowned. From 'This was your grandfathers knife, he was a frogman in World War 2, then they turned their back on him' onwards it's a terrible collection of recycled everything you've heard before in action movies for the last thirty years. It's painfully unaware how unfunny it is too.The CGI is patchy, happier with real creatures and vehicles than it is with fictional characters. It often ignores its own internal logic too, at one point Curry hangs onto to a building to avoid a ten foot drop - but before and after that he happily falls hundreds of feet and shrugs it off. Conventional weapons can't damage Curry, until towards the end, where one can. Nobody runs away when a shark starts to crack an aquarium wall.Sadly, I'm not convinced there is a better 'Aquaman' movie possible than this one but I'm not sure that's any reason to pretend this one is any good.",5,3,6,18 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Dead good too.
","Deadpool puts together his X-Force team, to help save a teenage boy from Cable (Josh Brolin) a time travelling super soldier, who has come back from the future to kill him before he can cause devastation in the future. 'Deadpool 2' is good, It is, . . . it's just not great. It's too similar to the first one, for me. In some ways, that's a positive. The returning characters are definitely welcome but there are a lot of gags from the first film that are reused, line by line in some cases and a lot of times I feel the writers assumed that swearing will be enough to be funny, when that's only sometimes true. Also sadly true - even though they sometimes used alternate takes - a lot of the funniest lines and references were in the trailers.Maybe part of the problem is that the MCU have stolen away some of Deadpool's gimmick. Self-referential humour is as prevalent in 'Thor: Ragnorok' for example, as is was in 'Deadpool'. Deadpool is left with little except taking it to more of an extreme and repeated jokes about paedophilia can start to drag after a while. The new characters are welcome additions though, particularly Domino and Cable, and giving Reynolds a larger group to spark off is a good idea. I do hope that a proper 'X-Force' film does come next. The action scenes have improved, as you might expect when switching to a director who worked on 'John Wick'. It's has its moments definitely, It's just that it somehow doesn't add up to a particularly memorable whole.",7,1,3,18 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Molijnir to perfect.
","A second viewing of the film, following the home video release shows that though still highly enjoyable, the film was perhaps so memorable that the rewatch suffered in comparison. The demise of Odin releases the shackles that have held Hela, The Goddess of Death, (Cate Blanchett) imprisoned for centuries. A short battle on Earth sends Hela back to Asgard, whilst Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are cast out of the Bifrost to Sakaar, a planet run by 'The Grandmaster' (Jeff Goldblum) who insists that Thor must defeat his champion in order to earn his freedom. I loved this film on my first viewing. Seeing the capacity that Chris Hemsworth has to be funny it was a masterstroke to take a cue from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and broaden Ragnorok into a genuine comedy. It's a fabulously written movie, the story gives everyone a chance to be comical, but in a way that make sense and allows for both Thor and Loki to finish their character arcs and accept who they are. It also introduces some new characters that will hopefully reoccur in future movies; Tessa Thompson plays Valkyrie, a drunk former defender of Asgard and Director Taika Waititi motion captures Korg, a freedom fighter made of rocks. It's actually pretty amazing, in retrospect, how it manages to legitimately include so many characters without making any of it feel forced. The music is also fantastic, from both the 80's inspired Synth score and the use of licenced songs. It looks amazing too, one of the best looking films of the MCU. Sakaar and Asgard are very different Alien worlds but both look fantastic. The fight scenes are all terrific, logical and well shot. So why not a perfect score. Like most comedies, it's not as funny the second time around and much of Ragnorok is based around surprises and cameo's which obviously have less impact the second time. In light of Infinity War too, the film takes on a more bittersweet conclusion.Ragnorok is a brilliant addition to the MCU and really shows the potential that they have to fully exploring other film genres, whilst remaining a 'superhero' film. (Add on another star if you haven't seen it).",8,2,4,13 September 2018
Ready Player One," All your review are belong to us.
","I was able to attend a Cineworld preview of the film a couple of weeks before the official release. Wade Watts (Tye Sheriden) lives in a slum high rise in the future dystopia. He, like the rest of the world, escape their daily struggle to live in OASIS, a virtual reality universe where everything and anything is possible. However, there is battle for control of OASIS, pitting its ideological members against a cynical and murderous corporation bent on monetarising the virtual playground. Of course the plot, source novel and even Stephen Spielberg have been secondary in the run up to the release of 'Ready Player One' as all have taken a back seat to the discussion about the thousands of licenced properties that inhabit the world of the OASIS. Some commenters have found this wave of nostalgia that the films advertising brings to the fore nauseating, so I am happy to report that, in my opinion, the film mostly manages to walk the line between the smart references and endless 'look at this, you used to like this' moments pretty well. Occasionally they are forced, ( I recognised the bike from Akira, you don't need to literally tell me it's the bike from Akira - and if people don't recognise it, then telling them 'it's the bike from Akira' isn't really going to mean anything to them), but mostly they are either made integral to the plot or on and off screen so fast they are simply background. It's a film that will reward pausing the film at home, and trying to spot exactly who is who and what is what at a later date. But, apart from the endless cameos what of the actual film itself? It's pretty good, it's a bit patchy and some bits work better than others. Naturally when adapting a novel, even one as superficial as 'Ready Player One' at lot of the depth has to go. The struggle of the real world is probably the biggest departure, and the idea that people live, work and go to school in OASIS and not just use it for entertainment. There are other changes to make the film more cinematic, gone are much of the sections of the book where Parzival progresses in the Easter Egg Hunt by playing Atari games and they have been replaced by an car race, that opens the film, and a section of the film that is comfortably the films best - set in recreation of the Overlook hotel from 'The Shining'. Whilst talking about that scene, I'm pretty amazed that the film will get away with the 12A rating, based on the horror elements in that scene, some parents might be better seeing it themselves first, before letting younger children see it. Performance wise, the film is a bit all over the place. The two leads, Tye Sheriden as Wade and Olivia Cooke as Samantha/Art3mis are OK. Although over 50% of their performance is vocal / motion capture, their best work is done when they are out of OASIS though. Lena Waithe too, is much better in the real world than when inside the game. Mark Rylance gives another great turn as James Halliday, the creator of the game, he portrays the shy, melancholy nature of the man, without ever slipping into too much clichÃ©. Simon Pegg is less effective, ok playing the younger Ogden Morrow, but struggling when saddled by old man prosthetics. I should say, I saw the film in 3D... which I normally would try and avoid as I find the glasses blurs the action rather than enhancing it... but 'Ready Player One' always looked clean and crisp, probably the best I've ever felt with the gimmick. 
Enjoyable whilst it lasts 'Ready Player One' is a fun ride with some excellent parts. I suspect that come the end of the year it'll likely be pretty forgotten, let alone in a Spielberg career retrospective.",7,14,43,20 March 2018
Molly's Game," Game on.
","Staying within his current wheelhouse of intelligent biopics for his directorial debut, acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin choose to adapt 'Molly's Game' the autobiography of Molly Bloom, Olympic hopeful turned Poker Princess. The film stars Jessica Chastain as Bloom who, when injury side-lines her from her dream of representing the USA as an Olympic skier falls into hosting an exclusive poker game for some of Hollywood elite. When that game is taken from her, she moves to New York to establish a new game for the Wall Street High Rollers. Unbeknownst to Bloom, her game also becomes frequented by high ranking figures in organised crime. Similar to 'The Social Network', 'Molly's Game' is structured using voice over driven flashbacks to fill in her history alongside scenes where Bloom talks to her lawyer, Charlie Jaffey, played by Idris Elba. Performances are universally excellent though the real star is, as usual, Sorkin's script. As you might expect he sacrifices realism for wit and the snappy dialogue fires back and forth. I think this, along with a focus on the relationship between Bloom and her father (Kevin Costner) really elevates the film as Molly's story in and of itself, isn't quite as interesting as it appears. And that's probably what stops the film from hitting the very highest of heights. At times, certainly during her rise - Bloom is almost an ancillary character. Merely being in the room whilst things happen around her, suffering at the whims of others, or caught in the tail end of illegal activity just because of who sat at her table. The resolution too, to her personal story if not her legal one, stretches the boundaries of plausibility.But these are relatively minor complaints about a movie I enjoyed enormously and would recommend is worth seeking out.",8,1,3,12 January 2018
Crash," Crashing and Burning
","Another film on the quest for the 2005 Oscar's badge. 'Crash' was a controversial choice for Best Picture at the time beating the heavily favoured 'Brokeback Mountain'. Since then 'Crash' stock has increasingly fallen and is regularly ranked as one of the worst films to have won the Best Picture Oscar. If I'm honest, I can see why.Exploring the race relations of Los Angeles over a three day period. 'Crash' centres of various exchanges between amongst others, a racist cop Ryan (Matt Dillion) and his interactions with TV Director Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton). Elsewhere, a District attorney (Brendon Fraser) tried to appear on the side of law and order, whilst simultaneously keeping the black community on his side. Meanwhile, Persian Immigrant Farhad (Shaun Toub) purchases a gun to help protect his store from robbers.The trouble with the film is, despite I think generally trying to do good and explore prejudices that exist it's just so heavy handed in its approach. Several times characters literally monologue about their feelings on race relations in such a way that nobody speaks or has conversations in real life. The story is actually reasonably clever, as the vignettes crossover and some of the reveals that come later in the film are pretty good but I'm not sure any of the character arcs actually earn the redemption the film acts like they do, particularly Matt Dillon's character.The performances are, as you might expect from the wealth of talent involved, really good. It did make me wonder why Chris Bridges doesn't do more serious acting, or at least be given more to do in the 'Fast and Furious' movies, because he's excellent here. But on a technical level the film isn't particularly well made, perhaps because Paul Haggis is a much better writer than he is a director. Shot composition is amateurish and the music selections are jarring. There is a moment towards the end of the film that is supposed to be the emotional gut punch, which is hilariously undermined by a zoom on Michael Pena's face.As I said, I think at its heart the film is trying to do good and stimulate the conversation but the race situation around the world is too important to award points, and Oscars, for effort.",4,1,1,25 June 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Homecoming King
","A second viewing of 'Spiderman Homecoming' following the home release of the film. I recently reviewed 'Thor Ragnorok' following its home release and determined that it wasn't quite as good the second time around, as I remembered so much of it. Interestingly, 'Spiderman: Homecoming' seems to have the opposite effect, and is even better this time that it was the first time. Much has been made about this being the second time that Spiderman has been rebooted. Though I preferred Sam Raimi's films to Marc Webb's - I did prefer Andrew Garfield to Tobey Maguire. However, for the addition of Spidey to the MCU I love both the film that John Watts has provided and the performance of Tom Holland as Peter Parker. He is much more realistic as a high school child, which is natural give his actual age relative to the other two incumbents. Both his Spiderman and his Peter Parker are what the character should be, good natured and friendly, possessing a ready wit without being a smartass. Ready to sacrifice his personal desires for the greater good. Also excellent are the decisions made to move the universe away from the two we'd previously seen. Ben is already gone, the Spider bite has already happened, Aunt May is much younger and better looking in this iteration (which becomes a regular plot point) even things like changing Flash Thompson from a big jock to a rich jerk are great choices. The ties into the MCU are excellently done, from having Tony Stark as a mentor, to Happy Hogan being his point man and the early scenes that tie the film to both the events of 'Avengers Assemble' and the video diary of the events of 'Civil War'. Despite his team of flunkies being a little generic, the main villain Vulture (Michael Keaton) is a compelling character. His reasons for becoming a villain are believable and understandable, if not quite justifiable. He is, essentially, just interested in making money - which is rare for a villain in a superhero film. The three movies that we've had with Tom Holland's Spiderman have all been excellent additions to the MCU and shown how they can handle the return and integration of one of their principle stars back into the fold. Can't wait for the next one.",8,0,1,17 September 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Double Ice Backfire
","The winter break gave me an opportunity to rewatch a film that, in retrospect, was probably the first film in the MCU to really nail the tone, approach and quality that the series has maintained since. I'm not decrying the earlier films, or suggesting that all the films have maintained this level since but here is where there Russo brothers announced themselves to the series and Markus and McFeely found the right beats that would serve them into the Civil and Infinity Wars.With both World War 2 and the Battle of New York behind him, Steve Rogers struggles to catch up with the years lost in the frozen ice. He soon learns that far from diminishing over the years, the threats to sovereignty have become both more insidious and ideological. When a legendary ghost agent, nicknamed 'The Winter's Soldier' attacks Nick Fury, it sets into motion a chain of events that turn S.H.I.E.L.D against Rogers and lead him, and a small band of allies, to a desperate battle to save both millions of lives and the soul of the country.'Winter's Soldier' is, for me, the first time that Marvel realised that they could make other genres of films, utilising their characters (and exaggerating the fight scenes) and move away from the standard superhero plots. The film is a spy thriller, with Steve Rogers, shorn of the advantages that being a SHIELD agent provided him, but forced to stand up to them anyway. Tonally, it's about perfect. A grave threat and a personal issue, assuaged against smart funny scenes of character interaction. It does pull through some of the story threads from 'Avengers Assemble' to, with Roger's mistrust of Nick Fury's preventative measures tactics again becoming a friction point between the two of them. The film allows for both Sam Jackson's Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansen's Black Widow to show more of the range of their characters, some cracks in their demeanours.Cinematography and direction are great, many of the effects done practically and some of the shots, like the initial rescue assault on a SHIELD research ship, are staggering. It's not perfect though. The stories two big reveals, of the identity of The Winters Soldier and the loyalties of some of the characters is fairly predictable. It sags a little once the opening is done and the fact that the villains constantly underestimate the heroes, despite working alongside them for a while doesn't really make sense.All in all though, this film is a big step into where the MCU stands now and still is one of the best in the series as I write the review.",8,0,0,3 January 2019
Doctor Strange," Stranger Things
","I rewatched 'Doctor Strange' in preparation for his role in 'Avengers: Infinity War'. To be honest, I'd been putting off watching it again, as I felt going in it was my least favourite film of the MCU - this second viewing confirmed that, but did remind me that it has lots of great moments. Renowned Surgeon Stephen Strange loses the fine motor skills in his hands following a serious car accident. With all traditional medical options exhausted, he heads to Tibet following rumours of a break through cure. There he meets The Ancient One who introduced Strange to the mystical arts and the ability to tap into powers from another realm. But this power can be corrupting, and one of the Ancient One's former pupils, Kaecilius, returns with a plan to release Dormamu and ancient and powerful evil. So, what are my problems with this film? They are mostly in the first half of the film, and mostly around Benedict Cumberbatch. Shackled to an accent he never quite masters, the first glimpses of a successful Stephen Strange aren't enjoyable. His arrogance is understandable, and part of the arc that the character goes on, but the wit is missing. Jokes throughout this film feel forced and fall flat, which is really strange when you consider how successful the 2017 trilogy of 'Guardians 2', 'Spider-man Homecoming' and 'Thor: Ragnorok' would be. Despite the reliable supporting cast, this humour failure extends to them too. It does look good though, the Inception (let's go with inspired, rather than rip off) folding cities in a mirror universe are really good. In fact all the visual effects are as impressive as they've been since day one. (18 movies without a bad special effect is pretty impressive). The ending is really good though and, without spoilers, it's nice to see one of these films end with the hero coming up with a plan and outwitting the villain rather than simply overpowering him, or a Deus Ex Machina finish. I like the way they left the character in this film, and the 'Thor Ragnorok' cameo pushed towards a better written character. I have higher expectations for the good Doctor in Infinity Wars and hopefully beyond.",6,1,2,19 April 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Killer Performances, confused story.
","Some films are easy to review. You are, after all, just writing down your opinion on something and generally, your opinion is fairly set once the film is over. You were bored, enthralled, amused or repulsed. Your judgement may well differ from others, but at least you know your own. Then along comes a movie like 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' and I'm honestly not sure exactly how I feel about it. Let's start with the facts. The film stars Francis McDormand as Mildred, a bereaved mother whose daughter was raped and murdered seven months ago. Desperate to keep the case relevant, she rents three billboards near her house and uses them to accuse the local police department, and specifically the Chief, Willougby (Woody Harrelson) of forgetting about the case. The billboards stir up feelings across the town as the police chief is a popular figure. Particularly upset is Deputy Dixon, (Sam Rockwell) who starts to look for ways, inside and outside the law, to have the billboards taken down. The spine of the film is Francis McDormand's Oscar nominated performance. This is, for me, one of the films first real contradictions. Her performance is brave and unyielding, but it's also showy and obvious. It's feels like it's a role designed to win awards rather than an authentic portrayal of a real person. In fact, authenticity, is something that the movie struggles with across the board. There's an admirable idea related to almost all the characters in the film, that no one is an absolute. Chief Willougby is a good example. He's not ignoring Mildred's case but the evidence has come up with no leads, he's a good family man but tolerates a degree of racism from his officers. However, these character traits seem at odds with the lack of legitimacy in the beats of the story. There are several scenes of violent crimes being committed, and witnessed, without any genuine consequence, which seriously undercut any sense of realism. Some plot points seem half baked and disappear without any conclusion but the most egregious problem that the film has though is that it doesn't, in any way, earn the redemption of Sam Rockwell's Dixon. Openly and fairly unapologetically racist from the out, he ends the film as the nearest thing the film has to a 'hero' despite never really repenting or undergoing any character growth. In light of the way the world is in early 2018, it feels horribly out of touch. The tone of the film is difficult to pin down. It's often funny, with some laugh out loud lines of dialogue but there are other scenes of suicide and menace that are difficult to watch. That said, the films is never less than watchable and none of the performances let the side down. To conclude, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is a real Curates Egg of a film, but one worth exploring, if only as a character study.",6,2,3,24 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Aren't you a little short of ideas for a stormtrooper?
","Nearly two weeks on, I'd hoped I would have a better handle on my opinion of Episode IX by now, but frankly... I'm not sure I do.Let's do the plot bit first. The Emperor has returned. Angered by the threat to his control, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) hunts him down, but before he can strike, the Emperor offers him a fleet for Star Destroyers to lead. Rey (Daisy Ridley) leads her group of friends on a mission to discover a key to finding The Emperor's location.So how do I feel. Underwhelmed, I guess. I'm not massively disappointed and I don't think the film was unduly horrible, but there's definitely a feeling of 'is that it?', with notes of relief that the 'Skywalker Saga' is over and we can now (hopefully) start exploring new stories with new elements set in this Universe. I really didn't like bringing back The Emperor in the way they did as, has been mentioned in lots of places now, it undermines the central thrust of Vader's redemption from the original trilogy. I also didn't care for bringing back Lando. I feel like the decision to bring him back, and it's indicative of the whole film, is a decision made for 'the fans' rather than because it serves the plot of the film. The elements where it reacts to 'The Last Jedi' really feel forced, or perhaps where it reacts to the reactions to 'The Last Jedi' is a better description. Fans liked the Kylo Ren mask, glue it back together. Fans didn't like Rose, quick get me Charlie from LOST and copy and paste her lines to him.It still looks good and some of the action scenes are great. I like the new cast, they do well and I wish that the filmmakers had more faith in them. There's isn't a lightsabre battle to match 'Last Jedi' though, or a space battle to match 'A New Hope'.It's better than any of the prequels, I'll say that. It's just lacking in good ideas.",6,4,6,10 January 2020
10 Things I Hate About You," A Comedy With Errors
","The second film, alphabetically on Sky Movies is 1999's '10 Things I hate About You' and adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of The Shrew' set in present day (well... present day at the time) Seattle.Desperate to date Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is thwarted by her father's rule that Bianca can only date when her sister Katrina (Julie Styles) does. This seems unlikely as Katrina is forthright and opinionated to the point of alienating almost all her school. But Cameron hatches a plan, he encourages the schools rebel, Patrick (Heath Ledger) to approach Katrina, hoping that if successful, his path to Bianca has been cleared.Time has not been kind to '10 Things'. One aspect of that is not in the least related to the film itself. The untimely passing of its leading man casts a shadow over watching any of this films. There's a melancholy to seeing him, knowing that this is one of the few movies he made. Away from that, the film has aged badly, the visuals for the opening credits look awful, musically (though there's the odd good song ) it is mostly terrible, even the film stock (of the version I saw) looked like it had seen better days.Which is not to say that the film is awful, the performances are nice and the script raises a smile from time to time, there's a definite wit to it. The story perhaps is less solid, there could have done with a few more story beats to convince me that there is actually something to the relationship between. . . well, actually either of the principle pairings. It also unravels pretty quickly if you start to apply any logic to the situation. The dad has a 'no dating until college' rule in force when the film starts, why does he open up the loophole of dating when her sister does, what actually constitutes 'dating' anyway. Bianca is alone with Cameron, away from school grounds on a couple of occasions.Whilst I appreciate that some people love this film, looking at it constructively, 20 years later (how old is J G-L anyway he looks the same!) it's a decent, if slight film with a couple of classic moments, but a few bizarre ones. Far from essential.",6,0,4,18 July 2019
Predator," Dutch Masters
","Not really inspired by anything in particular, we decided to rewatch the original 'Predator' film last week. It's the first time in a long time, so I was interested to see how well it holds up.The plot is remarkably simple, Arnold Schwarzenegger is Dutch (name not nationality) who along with his specialist rescue unit are dispatched to the Central American Jungle to rescue a politician who has been kidnapped, at the request of a CIA analyst (Carl Weathers) who insists on joining them. There, the team are hunted and picked off one by an invisible assailant.What strikes you first about 'Predator' is that it's a remarkably tight film. The set-up is about five minutes, whereas it would more likely be the whole first act in the hands of another film maker. The characters are then picked off in a series of spectacularly violent and entertaining ways until the final showdown between Dutch and The Predator that is a battle of wits as much of wills. The only scene that sagged for me was the assault on the camp which just runs too long, so much so it started to make me laugh about how long and sustained it was. Some of the one liners, though truly groan worthy, have become pop culture icons.Couple of things haven't aged particularly well. One is some of the effects. Stan Winston's model/make up for the Alien still looks great, but a few green screen shots, particularly when exiting the helicopter at the start, aren't great. The other is some of the dialogue, you might still include Shane Black's off colour jokes (though I'm not sure what they really added to the character) but Ventura's homophobic slur just isn't acceptable anymore in any context.Performances, characterisation and the script are all terrible, but it doesn't matter in a movie that is a cheesy classic.",8,1,2,22 February 2019
The Aviator," Auto Pilot
","Continuing the run of Biopics that dominated the 2005 Oscars, 'The Aviator' tells the life story of Howard Hughes from film producer, to Hollywood playboy, to aviator entrepreneur, to recluse.Given the many and various things that Howard Hughes attempted in his life, the movie feels to me like it's skimming over his story somewhat. I think it would have been better suited to take a deeper dive on one or two key aspects, rather than trying to cover it all. It makes some of it feel a bit disjointed, for example, Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) comes and goes from his life without much explanation of how they connected, or reconnected following a violent breakup. There's little information provided about how things really turned out, his film for example, 'Hell's Angels' is given a sceptical standing ovation at the Premier, but we're never provided any information on how the film turned out.Whilst I'm stuck on the negatives (and I know I'm criticising a legend here) I don't think some of the choices for shots are great. There are occasional hyper kinetic pan shots that I had to look away from to stop from feeling queasy. There are also some horrible overlays in establishing shots of locations and occasionally the effects haven't held up very well (although that's not the case in every scene).Which is not the say that the film is terrible, or bad even. Performances are great, across the board. It's a very mannered performance but Cate Blanchett is worthy of her best supporting Oscar for her performance as Katherine Hepburn. John C Reilly and Matt Ross are also good. There are a myriad of little performances, sometimes only in one scene, from the likes of Jude Law, Willem Defoe and Danny Huston that add to the quality of the production. But it's Leonardo DiCaprio's film. He's in virtually every scene and his performance was definitely good value for the nomination, though I'd agree it's not better than Jamie Foxx in 'Ray'.Never dull despite its running time, 'The Aviator' is tremendous from a performance viewpoint, though a little shallow, making it solid but not essential.",6,1,2,9 November 2018
Bird Box," Bird Brained
","Like the rest of the world, I too watched Netflix's film 'Bird Box' over the festive period. Whilst I'd say it's unarguably the best of the prestige 2018 releases that I saw, given the state of some of the others, that's a little like damning with faint praise.Sandra Bullock is the star, playing Malorie, who's in her later stages of pregnancy when the world's population is enveloped by a mysterious compulsion to take their own lives. By luck she makes it to a suburban house where it becomes apparent that the suicides are caused by a mysterious entity and if you see them, the compulsion will overtake you immediately. Thrown together, the makeshift team must find a way to survive, including finding food, all without using their most useful sense.So what works? Sandra Bullock does, her commitment to the physical nature of the role is admirable, as is her willingness to play a reluctance towards motherhood, even before the situation unfolds. I love Sarah Poulson. She too is great in what is essentially an extended cameo in this. The premise is an interesting idea and much of the early execution is good. There's some excellent horrific imagery in those early scenes too, as rakes of people off themselves as quickly as possible.Unfortunately, then the film breaks down a bit. I've not read the source novel, but not knowing it was a book previously, I felt like the film was a premise without much of a clue what to do with it. The films flashes back from Malorie's perilous blindfolded trip down the river to her time in the house immediately following the outbreak. All of that is fairly standard Zombie movie stuff, barricading the door, deciding whether to let outsiders in, and internal mistrust. Eventually they have to make a run to get more supplies, and here's where the logic starts to breakdown. Rather than the simple act of wearing a blindfold and breaking into next door, they decide to paint the windows of a car and drive to the supermarket, they complete the journey, using the Sat Nav to guide them. They manage to get there and get in, load up their shopping carts and I'm thinking, well that was the easy bit, finding the car, loading it and getting back to the house again are the real interesting bits, but the film just cuts to them back at the house. The river trip is another logical issue. The whole trip takes about a day but one point, near the end, they understand that they have to navigate some rapids - which will need someone to look. They eventually decide to risk doing it blind..... but THEY DON'T HAVE TO STAY IN THE BOAT. Get out of the boat and walk the 10 minutes, keeping close to the river and they'll accomplish the same thing in a much safer way.I do think it's good when a movie leaves things to the imagination - and I'm OK with the fact that you never see the reason for the suicides properly, in fact the actual reasons are only ever speculated at, but the films lack of logic, dull last twenty minutes and middling supporting performances blindfold this one from the start.",5,1,3,4 January 2019
Justice League," Bland-al Savage
","I rewatched 'Justice League' this weekend, for the first time since its Cinematic release to see if time and expectation improves the film at all. Unfortunately it does not, if anything it heightens the folly of the movie and the desire to compete directly with Marvel in a race they've already lost.Wracked with guilt about his part in the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) discovers that the earth is under attack from scouts for an alien race that would rule the planet. He works to pull together a team of powered individuals that can mount a resistance but before he's ready, the villain Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) arrives to secure and reunite three long forgotten energy sources.It's not so much that 'Justice League' is irredeemably awful; like an artistic idea that didn't resonate with the audience for example, or is just undone by one aspect of that undermines good work elsewhere. The film is just so staggeringly mediocre, in every aspect. A dull fetchquest story, punctuated by a number of uninteresting fighting sequences. Tepid banter between the cast. Generic CGI villain. It's all so bland, so uninspired and now has the added bonus of not being worth it as 'road to somewhere better' as this appears to have been the final nail in the idea of an extended universe, with DC now looking to the much more sensible approach of asking interesting filmmakers to do what they want with the characters.Having said earlier that there isn't one particular aspect that lets the film down, there is actually one that drags you out of it whenever he's on screen. The CGI work to erase Henry Cavill's moustache is always, staggering and distractingly awful. You can look at literally nothing else whenever he's on screen.It's hard not to acknowledge the tragic circumstances that forced a change in director and for Joss Whedon to complete filming reshoots and editing. I appreciate that people would like to see what Snyder's true vision for the film was, however, I can't believe that there's some magic way to reedit this film and make it passable. The 'bones' of a good film just aren't there for that to happen.A waste.",5,0,0,9 December 2019
Split," Horde Mode
","Although we didn't know it on first viewing, 'Split' is the second film in Shaymalan's 'Unbreakable' trilogy, due to be concluded in early 2019 with 'Glass'. In preparation for that I rewatched 'Split' and found an entertaining film, that's undermined slightly by the necessarily low key ending.Three young women; Casey (Anna Taylor-Joy), Claire (Haley Lu-Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) are kidnapped by Kevin (James McAvoy) a man with a split personality disorder whose lost control to some of the other 23 distinct personalities that live within him. Though some of those personalities are trying to get help, others are preparing for the arrival of a monstrous 24th personality.What 'Split' does have, unquestionably is a wonderful central performance from James McAvoy. He plays the principle personalities really well, so you're never not sure which personality you're seeing (apart from when the story needs it). The setup first two thirds of the movie is really solid too. It's mostly scientific justification mixed with some classic (if familiar) horror movie set up and execution. Mixed into this is some unsettling, if necessary, back story for Casey's character - explaining why she seems much more capable in the girl's predicament that Claire and Marcia. I also enjoyed the direction. Shyamalan is a much more gifted filmmaker visually beyond the 'twist master' clichÃ© that he's become known for. (I know 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' was a bit of a trainwreck, but I'd like to see him take a few more gigs that he hasn't also written in the future).Though this list of negatives might seem more comprehensive, I'd like to reiterate that overall I enjoyed it. The ending though is a bit underwhelming. I was not lost by the 'other worldly' aspect of it, that was fine, it's more that the film doesn't build towards a real climax. Presumably they had half an eye on the sequel but still, a more contrived escape attempt, or a rescue wouldn't have undermined the characters and made for a better finale. I also felt that the gradual undressing of the girls across the movie was a bit unnecessary - it didn't play out in the story at all, and felt it was more to pacify a studio head wary about their bottom line. I was also going to criticise the heavy handed portrayal of the gay personality 'Barry' but given time to consider it, it perhaps makes more sense given the reveal regarding that character that we get towards the end.There's elements of a great movie in 'Split' and if it was just slightly more concerned with its own plot it might have made it. Instead we've a solid character driven thriller that, if nothing else, has built my anticipation for 'Glass'.",7,0,0,17 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Smiles from home.
","Glorious. There simply is no other word for 'Into The Spider-verse' a fun, thrilling, funny, self-referential trip through the history of Spider-man, in both film and comics. It's one of the best films I've seen this year and one of the best animated films I've ever seen.The Kingpin (Leiv Schreiber) is conducting dangerous experiments under the streets of Brooklyn, opening wormholes to alternate dimensions. Aside from bringing through a radioactive spider, which bites young Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), the wormhole also drags through various versions of Spiderman from across the multiverse, who must team up to put an end to the Kingpins plans and save the multiverse.The animation style of 'Spiderverse' is top notch. A beautiful blend of 3D computer animation and 2D elements. Occasionally aspects are ripped directly from the pages of the comics too, with sound effects written on screen or occasionally splitting the image in to panels. It's a unique and dynamic experience. That would be for naught though if the script and story wasn't up to much, so fortunately the film excels here too. The story finds a legitimate excuse to drag the various Spidys together and actually gives them something to do. It's funny too, self-referential to the universe, to the medium and to the film itself. The highlight of the humour is probably 'Spiderman Noir' a 1930's detective version of the web slinger, whose whole world is monochromatic and is voiced with laconic style by Nicolas Cage.It does have some darker moments though, a couple of deaths that would be a bit much for some of the younger children in the audience. Stan Lee's cameo too, though nothing specific about the cameo is sad, it still pretty emotional for his first one since he passed (if you ignore 'Ralph Breaks The Internet'). Also, at least in the screening I saw, occasionally the image seemed to .... Duplicate somewhat ... as if you were watching a 3D film without glasses on.But those minor detractions won't take away from a magnificent film that I'd really like to see more of.",9,7,15,18 December 2018
Edward Scissorhands," 'No matter what, Edward will always be special.'
","It's tough now, to look back and imagine a time when Tim Burton was a gothic indie darling and Johnny Depp an enigmatic underexposed young actor, but indeed once they were - and Edward Scissorhands is probably the apex of that time in both their careers. Having not seen it for quite a while, a recent one night cinema showing gave me the opportunity to reappraise it as the jaded adult that I am now. Peggy Boggs (Dianne Wiest) decides to visit the grim dilapidated mansion that towers over the American suburban estate where she resides, as part of her Avon cosmetics round. There she discovers Edward (Depp), a creation of the inventor who previously owned the mansion, who passed away before he could provide Edward with the human hands to replace the scissors that make up his current appendages. Though Edward is initially popular in the suburbs, misunderstanding and prejudice soon start to raise their heads, particularly around Peggy's teenage daughter (Winona Ryder). The film really in unmistakably Tim Burton. The decision to use practical sets and models rather than CGI was a good choice, as the film still looks great. Maybe the aging prosthetics on Ryder in the opening and closing wrap around scenes doesn't look that impressive, given what CG can do there - but that's the exception rather than the rule. There's an unreal fantasy aspect to the town and its looming impossibly stylised mountain range that is beautiful and memorable. The costume and hair design is brilliant too. Danny Elfman's score too is another iconic collaboration with Burton, though he chooses a more orchestral and sweeping pieces here, over the 'Plinky Plonky' themes he was often providing at the time. The story is a little undercooked, a variation on both 'Frankenstein' and 'Beauty and the Beast' it could have done with another couple of moments to heighten the believability of the love story, and the way that the town turns on Edward, once he rejects the advances of Kathy Baker's bored housewife. The script though is good and often laugh out loud funny. Alan Arkin steals a lot of the film as Peg's husband, entirely nonplussed about the events going on around him. Vincent Price too, with his glorious cadence is great in his scenes. Sad both in terms of the actual plot and when viewed against the triumvirate of misfires Burton would direct, the lost years of Winona Ryder's career and the eventual overexposure of Depp; 'Edward Scissorhands' is imperfect but beautiful. Timeless but evocative of that period in Burton's career. Artificial yet genuine and you should definitely see it.",8,1,1,20 July 2018
Spider-Man," A Bug's Life.
","Decided to reappraise Sam Raimi's 2002 initial version of 'Spider-Man'. My fear was that, given the current sophistication of the MCU and superhero films in general, this vision would might feel juvenile in comparison. I'm happy to report that generally, that wasn't the case. You don't need a synopsis. It's an origin story; bitten by spider, learns powers, Uncle dies (spoiler) and learns to become a hero. His villain in this one is The Green Goblin, played with joyous unrestrained mania by Willem Defoe. Kirsten Dunst is Mary Jane Watson and James Franco is Harry Osborn. There are a few smaller roles filled by actors that went on to greater things. Joe Manganiello plays Flash Thompson and Octavia Spencer plays the wrestling company secretary. It all holds up pretty well, after all this time. There is a lot of Sam Raimi in the movie with trademark tracking shots and overlaying images - as well as more explicit references like the classic Oldsmobile car from the Evil Dead films. The CGI is largely pretty impressive, though there are some moments when the transition to a digital stuntman are obvious - a lot of the film was done practically though and most of that still looks pretty good. The story is strong and the performances are pretty solid too - there are occasional moments that drag you out of it though. The Goblins attack on Aunt May for example, forcing her to complete the 'Deliver us from Evil' line is so over the top it's jarring. This portrayal of Spiderman is, if I am honest, probably my least favourite of the most recent three. Nothing against Maguire's choices specifically, but he just feels a little too old and not quite as witty as the two that followed. Defoe leaves no scenery unchewed, but it works as his character is truly psychotic, a fact he acknowledges at one point. It's an excellent, fun adaptation that helped to pave the way for the MCU and some of the great films we have now.",7,0,0,30 May 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Hot Bub Time Machine
","In a desperate last stand, The X-men transfer the consciousness of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the 1970's in an attempt to stop Mystique (Jenifer Lawrence) from murdering Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) and industrialist who is at the forefront of the Sentinel programme, giant adaptive robots capable of identifying and annihilating mutants. The plan requires Wolverine to reunite Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) with Magento (Michael Fassbender) to appeal to Mystique before it's too late.Visually, 'Days' is a bit of a step up from 'First Contact'. Some of the effects are striking, particularly around the portal work in some of the present day fight scenes. Other effects, such as the Beast transitions are again improved upon. Plot wise though it's not as tight, driven by a desire to include all the X-men they possibly could (often more than one incarnation of them too) leading to a messy story that occasionally sacrifices some logic for spectacle. Why, for example, they decide they need Magneto with them for the mission is purely to provide Michael Fassbender with more to do. That's not to say it's not a clever story, managing to accommodate so many characters and bridge the gap between the original 'X-Men' trilogy and this new series is no mean feat, let alone finding a way to explain a bit more of Logan's history and retcon the events of 'X-Men: Last Stand', the unwanted sequel that all but killed the original run.The action scenes are particularly strong in this one, both in terms of seeing the X-men fight the sentinels as a team and in one like Quiksilvers ultra slo-mo scene (worth a whole additional star on its own.)Though perhaps not the most logical, 'Days of Future Past' is one of the best in the series.",8,0,0,5 June 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Decent Films and where to find one.
","Decided to have another watch of 'Fantastic Beasts' ahead of seeing the sequel. This, for reference, would be my third viewing of the film.In the film, Newt Scamander (played with reserve by Eddie Redmayne) is an English wizard, heading to New York in the 1920's carrying with him his menagerie of mystical animals in his suitcase Zoo. He soon falls foul of the US ministry of magic, initially via Tina (Katherine Waterston) and then her boss Graves (Colin Farell). But Graves has his eyes on a bigger target, an invisible force that is causing carnage on the streets and risks exposing the Wizarding world to muggle eyes.My experience with the Harry Potter world is pretty exclusively limited to the movies and not really the books or surrounding lore, so I think I'm judging these films not as am uber-fan, but as someone willing to judge on their own merits. That said, I really enjoyed 'Fantastic Beasts'. The period setting is great, the visual effects are stunning and the story is a premier example of creating a universe without sacrificing the narrative of the individual film.Some of the lesser known members of the cast, Dan Fogler, Ezra Miller and Alison Sudol, do an excellent job in raising their profiles with memorable performances. Colin Farrell is great also (so much so the ending is kind of a disappointment in that regard). Eddie Redmayne deserves praise too, other actors might have fought to iron out some of the idiosyncrasies in Newt and make him more of a traditional hero, but Redmayne keeps him a quiet honest boy, whose devotion to the preservation of life remains constant throughout. His chemistry with Tina is nice and underplayed too.I can see that in other reviews people have described it as a cash grab and although I understand where they are coming from - 'Universes' can encourage lazy writing, or direction, on the assumption that people will show up anyway, but I do think there's an inherent flaw in the logic, with that as a criticism. Either the film is enjoyable to you, or not. An enjoyable Star Wars film would surely be better than an terrible film with a brand new IP.",8,0,1,23 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," 'I like this one'
","I couldn't have hoped for it to be as satisfying as it is. After 11 years, the Infinity Saga closes with the ultimate showdown that the MCU could have provided. I'm honestly not sure how they can top it.Following the snap that concludes 'Infinity War' with 50% of all living life in the universe extinguished, the remaining Avengers struggle to cope with their collective loss. Reunited with a couple of missing friends, the heroes come up with a daring plan, to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos and return to their time, undoing the snap with one of their own and returning those lost.'Endgame' is perhaps, the ultimate fan servicing sequel of all time. Shorn back to (almost) only the original Avengers, the film is then like a greatest hits tour, as the time travel element allows the characters to revisit past MCU highspots from another angle. The film also includes dozens of lines of dialogue from previous films, and dozens of visual or emotional call backs and pay offs. The amount of characters it services is masterful, with each getting at least one or two strong character and action moments over the run time. (Whilst I'm on the runtime, any concerns that three hours would be a problem are forgotten as the film flies by)It's not totally without flaws. It's a little laggy in its opening sections, and I'm not sure that the world following the initial time jump in entirely believable, but these are minor criticisms against a film that, with 11 years build up and 22 films back story, is more complete and rewarding than you could possibly have hoped it would be.",9,1,5,1 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Woody Hassle-Bon
","I too felt that following 'Toy Story 3' another sequel would be pushing it, and I'm not sure if that opinion coloured the whole experience for me, but through pretty enjoyable, I came away from 'Toy Story 4' a little underwhelmed.Having started pre-school and struggling for friends, Bonnie (Madeline McGraw) makes a new friend in Forky (Tony Hale) who struggles with the transition from Utensil to toy and is constantly trying to return to the trash. Seeing his importance to Bonnie, Woody (Tom Hanks) desperately tries to keep him onboard whilst the family go on a road trip. Their escapades lead to Wood reconnecting with Bo Peep (Anne Potts) who was passed on by Andy's sister several years earlier.I don't want to go overboard with my criticism here, there is plenty to admire with 'Toy Story 4'. As with all Pixar films it looks fantastic, the surfaces and textures are great. There's lots of work done on the backgrounds, cameos and Easter eggs filling the shelves of the antique store. There are a few moments that are funny enough to register with the adults in the audience, mostly revolving around Key and Pelle's characters or Keanu Reeves' Duke Kaboom, an Evel Knevil parody.The problem is, it's just not as good, worthy or significant as 'Toy Story 3'. It's not as emotionally satisfying as it essentially reheats some of the series story points, there's no real villain to the story. The ending is a little contrary, both in terms of the 'rules' of being a toy and anything we've seen in Woody's personality previously.As I said, let's not go overboard with the criticism, it's a perfectly solid entry, but for Pixar and for the franchise, it feels a little underwhelming",6,0,1,8 July 2019
The Favourite," Rampant Rabbit
","Enjoyable bawdy comedy that unfortunately loses a bit of steam towards the end, but still contains a trio of terrific performances.Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) sits on the English throne, beset by depression and confusion she allows her confident and childhood friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) to speak for her and guide an increasingly disgruntled parliament through a war with the French. Sarah fallen cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) joins her household initially as a maid, but soon begins to climb the social standing within the court. Abigail's social climbing eventually puts her at odds with Sarah for the affections of The Queen and it soon becomes apparent that one of them has to go.I liked a lot of the style choices that director Yorgos Lanthimos makes here. The film has a very naturalistic look and often uses a wide-angle, or even a fisheye lens in the exterior scenes. Humour wise, it's pretty consistently funny, though often relying on swearwords and vomiting to get that across. Performance wise it's excellent. Colman is the standout, and it's pretty amazing to see her ascent from UK sitcom roles all the way up to Oscar nominations, via things like 'Broadchurch' and 'The Night Manager'. Weisz and Stone aren't that far behind, definitely worthy of their nominations. Nicholas Hoult too is great as Harley, the leader of the Tory opposition in Parliament, he pouts, kicks and moans his way through another fabulous comic performance. Mark Gatiss, always great, surely can provide his own costumes now, the number of times he's played in period roles recently.Where 'The Favourite' wasn't quite as successful for me was the storyline, particularly towards the end. Without trying to give away any spoilers, I was hoping that there would be one more comeback for the lady who is forced to leave court, not particularly because I favoured her, just because she seems to resign to her fate too easily, but as it stands it ends as a bit of an anti-climax.Preferable to 'Mary Queen Of Scots' for me but not one I'll feel the need to revisit very often.",6,0,1,21 February 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity Scores !
","Thanos is coming. That's about all I can write for a plot synopsis without delving into the many potential spoilers that 'Avengers: Infinity War' contains. Obviously, Earth's mightiest heroes will stand against him, joined by the various other characters that the MCU have introduced in the decade of success we've enjoyed since 'Iron Man'. 'Infinity War' is one of the rare films that, for me, lives up to the gargantuan hype that has revolved around it, since is announcement. Tonally, it's spot on. The moments of levity releasing a tension that caused by the honest belief that this is going to be the end for some of the characters we've spent that happy decade with. Somehow, despite the history with the previous 18 movies, that the heroes will win in the end, there's a sense of purveying dread throughout 'Infinity War', that any encounter with Thanos is going to be the last time we see that character and if it's even possible to stop him, the cost is going to be astronomical. Marvel are often accused of having a problem with their Villains, but that is not the case here. It really is Thanos' film, he's in virtually every scene and even when absent he's the focus of discussion from the other characters. It's testament to Josh Brolin and the writing and animation teams that Thanos is not simply some genocidal madman, he believes in the justification of what he's doing and the price he's had to pay to do it. One of the initial concerns I had was how they would balance the 50 odd named characters without making them token. My concerns were unfounded - the writing team do a masterful job of explaining why each hero is where they are and their justifications for staying or travelling to where they do. It's full of little hero moments, that make your heart beat a little faster and as I say above, the comedy is spot on. Doctor Strange is much more compelling here, than he was in his solo film - the sorcerer supreme at the height of his powers, his dialogue, event he early comedy is much better written than before. The heaviest work from a hero point of view is probably done by Thor, who continues to show the character development across his films arc, and the humour that Chris Hemsworth is becoming so adept at. The ending (No spoilers here) is perhaps the only real blot on the copybook. Despite the immediate shock of it, you realise fairly quickly that it's . . . not going to stick, I guess is the best way to describe it and that next year's Avengers film will be about sorting out the situation that they are left in. But this is a relatively minor quibble, soon routed by the realisation that we're actually only half way through an epic story of loss and redemption. One year to wait until Avengers 4, I will be counting the days.",9,2,6,30 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Strictly on the Q.T.
","Quentin Tarantino movies are one of the few releases that still feel like 'events' and if this is to be the penultimate film, whilst I enjoyed it - I can't help but feel that there was a better film in this material that this version just didn't quite get too.Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Hollywood actor for whom film parts are drying up and TV guest roles are taking their place. His stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) has morphed into more of a gopher role as rumours about his past circulate Hollywood. As Rick struggles with his future, his neighbour Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha) is on top of the world, a successful director with a beautiful wife, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) but it is 1969 and Los Angeles's most disturbing family has plans...I liked the film fine. I want to say that up front because I think the rest of this is going to sound like criticisms only but no, it's good. I don't think it's up there with Tarantino's classics, the dialogue is not as snappy, the musical choices are plentiful, but not as iconic. The historical recreation is excellently done, it's all good - but I didn't feel it was great. I could necessarily quantify why until I sat down to think about it once the film was over. Spoilers from here, but I'm going to try and not be that specific. Once the film was finished, I felt that I would have preferred to leave out the Tate/Manson aspect altogether - or at the very least, relegate it to a background event and focus more on a fake biopic of Rick Dalton. He was the character I was interested in. I've seen some criticism that Pitt's Booth is the most engaging character (and there's a chance he murdered his wife) but I felt he had a dog instead of a personality. Dalton though was expertly played by DiCaprio. His career is struggling, and despite his demons, he doesn't take it out on the people he meets - he has time for everyone, tries to help his friends and is a talented actor. I would have preferred the film take me on the rest of his journey - was there a career renaissance or was it back to TV?Alternatively, I'd have like the film to expand another story - Maybe Bruce Lee's - and tell a wider variety of Hollywood stories, taking time from the others.I was disappointed by the ending. Whereas the alternate history was somewhat amusing, it felt like a cheap 'get out' to end the picture, whereas, though not exactly 'Boogie Nights' it did flirt with more serious themes. I appreciate it's not the first time that Tarantino has changed history, but with 'Inglorious Basterds' I never felt there was a thoughtful film there in the first instance.I appreciate that I am nobody to tell Tarantino how to improve his pictures, if nothing else, these are totally his choices as he's one of the few who studios dare not interfere with. I await QT's 10th still",7,1,3,3 September 2019
Get Out," Smart genre mingling effort.
","As you may guess from the submission date, I'm reviewing 'Get Out' several months after its cinematic release. Unfortunately, the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me, which no film could possibly have lived up to. This is not to say that it's not good. Jordan Peele directs well, but it's his writing that is one of the core strengths of the picture. There is such depth to it the screenplay, not only with its allegories and metaphors, but also with subtle foreshadowing and lines with multiple meanings. There are many layers to be 'unpeeled' (pun intended) on repeat viewings. The other strength is Daniel Kaluuya. A regular face on UK TV for a while now and with a few smaller roles in Hollywood productions, Kaluuya is brilliant and this should be a career-making performance. So, what doesn't work as well? Essentially, it's the films third act. I try to write my reviews without spoilers and I will here, but the film takes a leap into science fiction towards the end that stretches your willingness to go along with it. It's an idea that make sense figuratively but not literally. Also, Chris transitions a little too far into action hero territory, given that there's been nothing to justify that, save some talk about Judo lessons. Provided you're not anticipating horror in the traditional sense, 'Get Out' is a smart genre mingling effort. Not perfect, but certainly not bad for a debut film.",7,20,39,19 January 2018
Aladdin," You better rub me the right way.
","This really felt like a hiding to nothing. A largely unnecessary remake of a classic animated feature, full of classic songs and featuring a paramount performance from Robin Williams. Add to this that Guy Ritchie's recent run of films has not been good, and the shaky images of Will Smith as the Genie that were released a few months bank and it felt like a recipe for disaster. But ... I'm happy report that though not without flaws, I enjoyed 'Aladdin' a lot.Aladdin (Mena Massaud) is a thief surviving on the streets of Agrabah with just his wits. The Sultan's advisor Jafar (Marwen Kenzari) sends Aladdin to the cave of wonders, to retrieve for him a magic lamp. However, Aladdin becomes trapped and once accidentally rubbing the lamp himself frees a magical Genie (Will Smith) who grants Aladdin three wishes.There is lots to love about 'Aladdin'. The production is great, with Agrabah feeling like a real city. The effects are actually pretty good too, the single still of the Genie didn't do it any favours but as in the animated film, he's constantly changing size and shape, particularly during the musical numbers, and for much of the film he pretends to be a regular human too, so loses the blue altogether. The cast area really good, and there's a nice chemistry between Massaud and Naomi Scott, who plays Princess Jasmine. Though rewriting the Genie's style of humour helps a lot, Smith doesn't really come close to catching Robin Williams version of the character, and the songs style don't suit him either. (I winced a little at the start of a couple of the genies numbers).If, for whatever reason, you're only allowed to see one version of 'Aladdin', the animated version is still the way to go, however, as a companion piece or curiosity, there is much to admire in this version.",7,0,3,3 June 2019
2012," 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 5 (out of ten)
","Here I am, punished again by the Sky Movies alphabetically ordered film gods. Next on the run through was '2012', the disaster movie from 2009.The film is about a devastating destructive event that occurs to the Earth in 2012 and a number of characters who work to try and ensure their survival. Amongst them is author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) who is estranged from his wife Kate (Amanda Peet) but has their children when the disaster begins. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is one of the scientists that first understands the depths of the disaster that will befall them, so has to work on getting a plan for Human survival in place.There is only one real positive to the film. The effects are generally pretty good, even a decade later the scenes of destruction hold up. It does show you some genuinely memorable things, subway trains plummeting from broken tunnels, aircraft carriers crushing the White House. But they are outweighed by the negatives and then some.The film is looooooooooooooooooong, so very long. Both in terms of its runtime and how the film feels. To be able to fill that length with something so intrinsically dull, is almost impressive.A film like this really needs to you care about the characters, and their survival and unfortunately for this film, I did not. The central family aren't particularly interesting, and their separation just seems immediately like something that will be over by the end of the film. Particularly telling about how much you should invest in the relationship issues is how quickly Kate moves on once Gordon meets his fate. Other characters are given screen time despite not having any real effect on the plot, Thandie Newton, John Billingsley, the old (awful) singers on the cruise liner are all there just as emotional pressure points for other characters.Technically solid, but lacking in wit, flair, humour or relatability '2012' is not worth your time.",5,1,2,2 January 2020
The Incredibles," Pixar the action.
","Another film rewatched and reviewed in my quest to earn the 2006 Oscars badge.
Outlawed and retired from his prime as a superhero, Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is frustrated with his dull job and, though he loves them, his family, despite their powers, aren't providing him with the outlet he's looking for. He's provided with another opportunity for greatness when offered the chance to takedown an experimental robot that's loose on a tropical island.
I never particularly loved 'The Incredibles', I'm not sure why so I was hoping this repeat viewing might clear it up. Visually it's not aged particularly well. The faces of the characters are lacking definition and plasticy and though the ice, fire and explosion effects are decent, water and wetness is not as well done. Vocal performances are good throughout and the future/sixties vibe works pretty well.
Storyline wise its ok, but it does take quite a while to get started. There aren't that many genuine laughs though but the action picks up once the whole family make it to the island.
I do, in retrospect, prefer it to its sequel but in terms of both the superhero genre and the standards of animation now, its light years behind something like 'Into The Spider-verse'. Of course, without 'The Incredibles' and its massive success, we probably don't get these subsequent films.",7,0,0,8 April 2019
A Quiet Place," Acting papers over plot holes.
","I came away from 'A Quiet Place' thinking that I wished I'd found the film on my own, and not gone to see it following the glowing reviews it's received. It's not that it's not good, it's just that my expectation for it were too high. In the near future, the Planet has been invaded by vicious armoured creatures, who cannot see, but have acute hearing. The film takes place several months after the initial attack, and when the majority of the population has been lost. Lee Abbot (debut director John Krasinski), his wife (Emily Blunt) and their three children are surviving in near silence, in a remote farm. For his debut feature film, John Krasinski has crafted a subtle, interesting, if a little derivative science fiction horror film that reminded me of 'Signs' and 'Pitch Black'. Tone and performance are extremely good, especially, as you might expect, from Emily Blunt, who undergoes most of the physical suffering in this story. But Millicent Simmonds deserves heaps of praise too.It's just a bit of a shame then, that in reflection it felt anticlimactical relative to the notices that it's received elsewhere. Though the need for the family to remain quiet is a fresh twist, it's a fairly straightforward story, even a little clichéd at times and as numerous others have pointed out, there are plot holes you could push a corn silo through. I wish I'd found it on my own, it would be a brilliant cult movie... but as a mainstream hit, it's a disappointment.",6,5,8,17 April 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Balk Like An Egyptian
","Last bit of preparation ahead of 'Dark Phoenix' and I braced myself for 'Apocalypse' which wasn't actually as bad as I remembered, but does run 'The Last Stand' close for worst X-Men film.An ancient mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is awakened and begins to reclaim the world that belonged to him centuries ago. His plan, and his recruitment of Magneto (Michael Fassbender) finds him opposed by Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the students of his school for the gifted.Whilst not as bad as I remembered, 'Apocalypse' is not good. Though it has its moments, it's all rather hamstrung by its villain - Apocalypse. He looks ridiculous, it's a very heavy makeup and prosthetics job and aside from the silliness of it, it also cuts the legs out from under any performance that Oscar Isaac is giving. His plan is not much better than his aesthetic, though initially talking about finding the four most powerful mutants as his 'horsemen' he actually selects the first two he comes across, Magneto ( who admittedly is plausible) and Angel (who's only involvement is losing a fight to Nightcrawler earlier in the film).The movie does have another excellent Quiksilver scene, though I think I prefer the one from 'Days of Future Past' but ultimately there's not much else to enjoy in a plodding run though a beloved X-Men Story.",5,0,0,10 July 2019
Coco," I'd rather have a bowl of Coco Pops
","After some recent misfires, Pixar really find its stride again with 'Coco', a charming and beautiful tale that builds a relatable family story around the mythos of Mexico's Day of the Dead. Young Miguel longs to be a musician like his hero, Black and White Screen Idol Hector De La Cruz. Unfortunately, since his great great grandmother was abandoned by her musician husband, music has been banned by the family in favour of their shoe making business. During the Day of The Dead celebrations, Miguel is transported to the Land of The Dead but soon finds that his late family is no happier about his life choices than his living one. . . so he sets off to meet his Idol and prove his dream is valid. Initially, I was hesitant about even seeing 'Coco'. Its long gestation period allowed Guillermo del Toro to release 'The Book Of Life' in 2014, which was film I really enjoyed. Having seen the two, despite the similarities in setting, the plots are significantly different and both are worthy of your time. My other concern also proved to be unfounded. A child lead, particularly a singing child, can occasionally prove more grating that great. Anthony Gonzalez is excellent though, aggrieved but not whiny, and his singing is accomplished without being overproduced. 'Coco' does have a relatively predictable story, once the initial ideas have been set out. You will see the twists coming but oddly those don't always work against the film. For example, around two thirds of the way through, Miguel learns a song important in the life of his great grandmother. As soon as I saw the scene, I knew that Miguel would end up singing the song himself and I knew that it would make me cry, and indeed it did. Admittedly, it's not as funny as some other recent animated features and what humour it has is 'Family humour' rather than jokes that work on different levels for adults and children. Also, it's oddly specific that a film for children would rely so heavily on Frida Kahlo being an integral part of it. It is, however, Pixar's best looking film. The land of the dead allows them a freedom of creativity that many of their other films don't attempt and they capture it, and contrast it with the 'real' Mexican village beautifully. It's odd, and a little sad that Pixar will spend the next two years on sequels to their current IP's, when, Toy Story aside, they have usually just been underwhelming - compared to the successes of 'Up', and 'Inside Out' but until then I am looking forward to whatever original idea they come up with next.",8,1,2,14 February 2018
1917," Trenched Warfare
","Though I feel a little like War films are going to struggle to find anything new to say, '1917' has a pedigree that meant I couldn't let this one pass me by, and it's such a technical marvel that I'm glad that I did.During The Great War, two soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are charged with crossing what was formally no mans land to locate a battalion that is planning to go over the top the following morning. Unbeknownst to the command team at this location, the German's have withdrawn strategically and are setting a trap. Blake is particularly invested in this mission as his brother in part of the battalion due to attack.There was a great choice made to attempt to tell his story is a few cuts as possible, so, for example, the film opens with a good half an hour long scene of the soldiers receiving their orders, making their way along the trenches and across no man's land. It's here that you get a sense of the filmmaking scale, with miles of trenches being dug out and hundreds of extras giving a full impression of how awful conditions would have been for the real soldiers. You also see the skill of camera work, as it moves along the trenches with the guys, before sailing out and around them as they reach more open land.All that technical work though, shouldn't over shadow the central performances from the leads. They're excellent. Both convey that they are best friends, but that they are at different points in their war experience, with Blake more optimistic about heading home than Schofield. The key personnel in the military brass are all played by recognisable actors, Daniel Mays, Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch and though they're little more than cameos they're obviously dependable and they all do a good job.Admittedly, away from the strengths, it is another film that has the similar 'War is bad' message and whilst that's a message that's often worth repeating, it's not a new one. I would also be a little critical of the score, which felt heavy-handed in places - particularly around the ruined town.The positives far outweigh the negatives though for a film that must be the favourite for the Cinematography Oscar at least.",8,1,2,13 January 2020
Million Dollar Baby," Very Heavyweight.
","Sometimes it's hard, years after a particular Oscar season to look back and assess why a particular film did so well. 'Million Dollar Baby' is, for me, one such film. Though there are some aspects to admire, much of it feels like a fairly overt attempt to tick off 'Oscar worthy' boxes. Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) runs a boxing gym with Eddie Dupree (Morgan Freeman). Reluctantly, Frankie agrees to train and then manage Maggie (Hilary Swank) a tenacious and prodigious boxer. Eventually the pair work their way up to a Las Vegas Title Fight which has fateful consequences for the pair. Questionable politics aside, Clint Eastwood deserves his legendary status in Hollywood and though 'Million Dollar Baby' doesn't come close to matching 'Unforgiven', his talent at framing a shot, and use of lighting is evident. His performance in front of the character her is a little.. one note, and brooding, misanthrope does start to wear then - even when the actions of the conclusion start to weigh heavily on him. His verbal sparring with Morgan Freeman is nice though sometimes crosses the line from funny to bizarre. I wasn't massively impressed with Hilary Swank's performance either, though her commitment to the role was admirable, the rest of the execution felt a bit forced. (I know she won the Oscar, and who am I to criticise, but still, in my opinion). The Casting Agent did a really good job though, with early performances from Mike Colter, Margo Martindale and the MCU double bill of Anthony Mackie and Michael Pena. The trouble is, apart from Colter's Willie who serves the plot by making Frankie wary of committing to training again, the rest of the gym are just there to fill time, with a unresolved B- Story that doesn't serve the film's narrative in any way. Did I enjoy 'Million Dollar Baby'? No, how could I? How could anyone given the miserable conclusion? But did I appreciate it - somewhat. I had heard a little of the ending before seeing the film, so it wasn't as much of a bait and switch as it would have been at the time. It has, to be fair, stayed with me for the 24 hours after seeing it, but I'd also don't feel like I'll ever want to sit down and watch it again.",6,0,1,4 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Porgy And Bess
","Another film watched in preparation for seeing Episode 9 at the cinema in the upcoming week. My feelings, based on the only time I'd seen 'The Last Jedi' before was that I didn't really like it, particularly as a follow up to 'Force Awakens'. Watching them both again now, my opinion has flipped, and though this film has more stuff that I don't like, it does both try something different with the universe, and have higher high points.The Resistance are racing across the Galaxy trying to escape an Empirical flotilla led by General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson). Disturbingly, the First Order appear to be able to track their opposition through hyperspace, which has previously not been possible. Running low on fuel and with the command structure become increasingly fractured they form a desperate plan. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill) unwilling to take her on as a student, given how badly it turned out with his last student.Whilst I think Episode VII is consistently OK, episode VII has a much wider range of both good and bad moments. Bad times include Leia in space and essentially the whole section on the casino planet but those are weighed up against one of the best lightsabre fights in the entire saga, the final jump to lightspeed and the fact that the whole central plot is something different. No super weapons to be destroyed. No Shields to fall. I was disappointed at the first viewing, that 'Jedi' abandoned some of the ideas that 'Force Awakens' put into place, Rey's parentage, for example. But, at the time, (and certainly now having seen 'Skywalker') I like that idea that anyone can be a hero.Much more uneven than its predecessor, but ultimately the good outweighs the bad. My favourite of the sequel trilogy.",7,3,15,9 January 2020
A Bug's Life," Ant-iseptic
","I've always viewed 'A Bugs Life' as the Pixar film that got away, the one that nobody loves like 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' or even 'Cars', but a slight rejig of the alphabetical order on Disney Plus pushed it up to being the next film on my list to watch. I remain underwhelmed.Flick (Dave Foley) is an ant, whose colony pays protection food to a group of violent grasshoppers at the start of the summer. When he accidentally destroys the offering, he leaves the village to look for a group of tough bugs to come and protect the colony from the grasshoppers and their monstrous leader Hopper (Kevin Spacey). Triumphantly returning with who he believes are just the creatures for the job, he's distraught when they reveal to him that they are, in fact, a circus troupe.So I really didn't enjoy 'A Bugs Life'. I don't want to take away anything from the monumental effort that goes into making any form of animated film, but the film does look pretty dated now. The tree and plant effects are pretty convincing still but the characters, particularly facially have a dull plastic-ness to them. There's a 'dead behind the eyes' look to them that fortunately Pixar managed to overcome pretty quickly going forward from here.That's not the only problem though. The storyline is pedestrian and familiar given it's a reworking of 'Seven Samurai' or perhaps more closely 'Three Amigos', and the script lacking in genuine moments of humour. There's a dissonance between the world that the Ants inhabit - essentially, just an empty hole in the ground, and the trash reconfigured to reflect the human world that the rest of the insects have, with bars, restaurants and circuses.I don't want to go overboard with my criticism, there's no one area so spectacularly awful as to undermine the film, it's just that the experience of the film is consistently underwhelming.",5,0,0,29 June 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Scarlet Fever
","Continuing the 'Endgame' prep with 'Age Of Ultron' a film that, somehow in my head is a bit of a misfire. Happy to report that, though this is perhaps the weakest of the three 'Avengers' films, 'Ultron' is still a decent film and has a lot of great moments.Haunted by the threats from other worlds that he's seen, Tony Stark wants to replace the Avengers with Ultron, an autonomous artificial intelligence that would protect the Earth. Finally locating Loki's missing spear, he utilises the properties of the Mindstone Infinity Gem to bring Ultron to life. Faulty and psychotic, Ultron decides that the best way to protect the earth would be to rid it of the primitives that inhabit it.I find it really hard to believe that this was only four years ago! It seems like a lifetime. 'Ultron' gets off to a shaky start, I felt. The battle to capture Von Strucker is a little bit too frantic to be enjoyable, and the CGI occasionally is a little shaky, however, the film really picks up from here and neither of those flaws could be levelled against the rest of the film. Expanding the cast and adding a number of characters who would feature in 'Civil War' and 'Infinity War' was done well. The plot points for the whole Infinity Saga is starting to come together too, with Thor learning about the Infinity Stones and realising that someone is behind their recent appearances, perhaps that impacts on this film a little - as Ultron doesn't necessarily feel like the same threat that Thanos is.I can't decide how I feel about James Spader's Ultron. His naturalistic delivery is fun, and often funny, but I'm not sure how realistic it would be for an artificially intelligence to display these sort of mannerisms. Visually he's not quite as good as say Thanos in 'Infinity War', there's a sheen to the CGI that's not quite dead-on, maybe the moving mouth was a mistake too.The film does have perhaps the single most rewatchable single scene in all the MCU, the battle between Hulk and Ironman in his Hulkbuster outfit. There is lots of good stuff in the final battle scenes also. With hindsight, it's easy to say that it was time for Whedon to move on from the MCU and for the Markus/McFeely/Russos to take the saga forward, and with their writing and direction they have elevated it to another level. But 'Age Of Ultron' is a really really good film, that would, in any other series, be a highlight. Here's though, it's just a solid addition.",7,0,3,25 April 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Star Chores
","Alphabetical scrawl through the films on Sky Movies has me land on '2001: A Space Odyssey' on a lockdowned Saturday afternoon.Two astronauts, David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on a mission to Jupiter when their ships computer HAL (Douglas Rain) suggests that a piece of kit is broken, although with further investigation this proves not to be the case. Unaware of any issues with their artificially intelligent system previously the guys talk privately about the idea of rebooting HAL, an idea the sentient computer doesn't find appealing.Try as I might, and my little film nerd heart would really like to, I just can't come around to liking '2001'. I can appreciate the artistry of the special effects - revolutionary for the time - and I love the scope of the film. Human evolution laid out from start to finish. But I just find it too much of a chore to get through, particular that closing half an hour - which I don't think I've ever made it through without at least a bit of fast forwarding. I can also appreciate that the performances are good, the classical music is iconic in this context and I can see why it's become such a cultural touchstone. I love Kubick films, and love that he's such an auteur, in the time of auteurs, that he can make a film as wildly loose and esoteric as this one.But none of that appreciation transfers into what I want from a movie, which is either to be entertained or educated and despite all the will in the world, I'm yet to find that with '2001'.",5,0,1,24 March 2020
Midsommar," Herring-bone
","Ari Aster's second film, following last years 'Hereditary', is another divisive movie that sits roughly in the horror genre, without ever really being scary and is probably going to bore as many people as it enthrals.Dani (Florence Pugh) suffers a horrific family tragedy which encourages her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) to offer her the chance to join them on a trip to Sweden, to see a once in a lifetime festival on a remote agricultural commune. Dani's shaky relationship with Christian, coupled with the culture shock of this isolated community unsettles her but could darker forces be at work .It's barely a spoiler to say, yes.... All is not what it seems in the idyllic village. You'll be able to predict the plot of 'Midsommar' as it doesn't deviate very much from its template of a being a trippier version of 'The Wicker Man'. That isn't the point, there's a sense of inevitability about what happens and 'Midsommar' is very happy about taking it's time to get there. This will, I'm sure, alienate some of the audience, it's a film about aesthetics and atmosphere, rather than twist and jumps, and I would understand anyone whose takeaway about the film was that they were bored.A lot of credit need to go to the central performances of the leads. Though not expressly trying to, I am seeing everything that Florence Pugh is doing and I continue to be impressed with her versatility and vulnerability. Jack Reynor, who I'd previously only seen in the Transformers movie, is excellent too, fearless both in his willingness to do some of the scenes and to not try and redeem his character of his underlying resentment towards Dani. The cinematography is excellent, as is the use of sometimes subtle CGI to enhance backgrounds or illustrate the use of hallucinogenics.Admittedly, the idea of sitting through it again doesn't seem particularly appealing now, which is why my review score isn't as glowing as it might have seemed from the comments so far, but I will keep my eyes open for Aster next film.",7,1,3,17 July 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Random Access Memory
","Finally back on my quest for the IMDB 2005 Oscar's badge, the next film on the list was 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' which won Best Original Screenplay that year.After discovering that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had their relationship expunged from her mind, Joel (Jim Carrey) decides to undergo the same procedure. Whilst seemingly asleep, Joel experiences his memories being deleted like a fractured dream, during which he decides that he still loves Clementine and he's made a mistake. Desperate, he tries to cling to his memories whilst confused technicians Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) try to complete the extraction.It's been a while since I'd seen 'Sunshine', though I did watch the series 'Kidding' towards the end of last year, which share some similarities and I loved that. To be honest, it took a while for the film to win me over, although it did before the end. Though Carrey is great, it's Kate Winslet's performance that I'd forgotten about. Initially I misremembered her character as being the 'Indie Pixie love interest' that would become a trope a few years later, but she isn't really like that. She becomes an appealing character, or at least the version of her in Joel's memories is, and it's clear why Joel would repeatedly fall for her, but she also does appear to be very impulsive, perhaps to the point of being bipolar. That said, I think much of my initial apathy to the film came from seeing their initial connection (or perhaps reconnection) and not really feeling it was all that plausible.So, why did it win me over? I guess because I eventually found myself invested in that central love story, in wanting Joel to find a way to overcome his decision and keep his memories. You combine that with some excellent practical effects (techniques that Gondry still employs today) it makes for a truly memorable experience. (In fairness, some of the digital effects haven't aged quite as well as the practical ones). What I do find extraordinary is how few films we've had from the mind of Charlie Kaufman since that early 2000's period, including 'Being John Malkovich and 'Adaptation' was a hell of run, with two nominations to go with the previously mentioned best original screenplay win. Why we've only had one full feature since then presumably has to be his choice?Beautiful and memorable, though at bit patchy at the start, its charm may win you over, as it did me.",8,0,0,4 March 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Hounds Of Love
","As if I've not started enough stupid internal lists to I've decided that we're going to run through Quentin Tarantino's career and reappraise how I feel about it. So naturally, we started at the beginning.When a jewellery heist goes violently out of hand, a group of career criminals return to base and try to determine what went wrong. Though they've taken precautions and are using codenames, the remaining members of the group begin to believe that one of them may be a police informant.So. This is an Iconic movie in my life. I had the poster on the wall of my University dorm room, and a framed picture of Tarantino at other points. We even, at my insistence, recreated the final third of the movie for one of my friend's art projects. The point is, I was really (embarrassingly) into this film a few decades ago. Now.... I feel it's got some undeniably iconic scenes but I'm a little underwhelmed by some of the other aspects of it.It's a lot more awkward than I remember. He's one of my favourite actors, but Steve Buscemi trips over his lines a lot. You could argue that is creating a realistic style but if that's the case, he's the only one doing it, as Harvey Keitel is all about the style of his lines. 'You shoot this man, you die next. I repeat. You shoot this man you die next'. A few of the aspects of the back stories aren't up to that much. Particularly the ten minutes devoted to Mr Orange's anecdote, which isn't particularly funny. The pop culture discussions though are excellent and were along with 'Clerks' revolutionary at the time.Visually it's dynamic, with the camera chasing the crooks down the street, for example. But there's some odd choices, such as a combined focus two shot that has a distinct and obvious line down the middle of the screen.Generally I still feel like 'Reservoir Dogs' is a good film, a great film even . . but perhaps not the all-time classic I used to think it was.",7,0,1,16 January 2020
Pulp Fiction," 12 out of 12 (Imperial System)
","My Tarantino retrospective continues with 'Pulp Fiction' a film I know well, and love. Having been slightly underwhelmed by 'Reservoir Dogs' a few weeks back I was delighted to find that 'Pulp Fiction' is as Iconic as ever.Told with a convoluted timeline, 'Pulp Fiction' revolves around two Hitmen, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who recover a briefcase for their boss, the criminal Kingpin Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Several calamities befall them as they attempt to return the case. Wallace then arranges for fading boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in a prize fight, when Butch double crosses him, Wallace goes after him, which has extreme and unexpected outcomes for both of them.Iconic really is the only word that fits. Each scene is chocked full of quotable dialogue and legendary moments of cinema. So many sections have been parodied in things like 'The Simpsons' and 'Spaced', the film is a juggernaut of popular culture. The jumping backwards and forwards in time, help take what is a relatively straightforward story to the next level. There is a good time to be had just mentally putting the film together again in the correct order.Visually, it's a step up from 'Reservoir Dogs' as the camera is much more dynamic that it was, travelling with characters through sets and shooting locations. Performance wise too it's a lot better, flush with the success of 'Dogs' Q.T was able to keep the best from that cast, but also attract some enormous talent. Samuel L Jackson is probably the standout. . and this is probably the best performance of his career. Every line, every intonation, every eye bulge is (and here's that word again) Iconic. The music choices are fabulous - just as they were with 'Dogs'. Every song fits the tone of directly into the scene perfectly.It's not totally perfect though. Tarantino's scenes in front of the camera make me cringe. He's not a good actor, and on top of that his use of the N-word seems a bit egregious, or that a character like Jules would let him get away with it.That though doesn't spoil what is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps even the only true masterpiece in Tarantino's catalogue (I'll see as I check out the rest).",10,1,1,3 February 2020
The Shape of Water," Heart Shaped Box
","Really enjoyable and beautifully made, if slightly corny love story that could only have come from the mind of Guillermo Del Toro.Mute cleaning lady Elisa (Sally Hawkins), works at a secretive Government facility at the height of the cold war. One day, an asset arrives at the lab, a merman dragged from the sea by his handler and now guard Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). As Strickland and the scientists attempt to gather information about the creature, Elisa secretly uncovers his intelligence and they form a bond. As their relationship deepens, the military decide that vivisection is the only option so Elisa, her neighbour and a reluctant scientist come up with a daring rescue plan. Like so many of Del Toro's films, 'The Shape Of Water' is, at heart, a dark violent fairy tale. Full of magic and wonder, its implausibility doesn't really stand up to a lot of scrutiny - but that's not the point. The film is about connection. Elisa struggles for connection as she is unable to talk, only her neighbour played by Richard Jenkins and her colleague Zelda, played by Octavia Spencer are able to understand her sign language. There's a credibility to her relationship with the creature that stems from this, although perhaps a few more scenes together would have helped sell the risk she takes to try and save him. Richard Jenkins character too is unable to make the connection that he wants in his life, as a gay man in the 1960's. He has presumably lost his job because of this, and risks the dangers of engaging with the much younger man who runs the local diner. Both Zelda and Strickland have unrewarding marriages, which feed into their desire to help or destroy the central couple.Performances are universally excellent, but special praise must go to Sally Hawkins in what is a daring turn, if playing a Mute wasn't enough, Elisa is entirely naked in several scenes. Michael Shannon Strickland is closer to the thugs and psychopaths he's played previously, but he's still a magnetic presence whenever he's on screen. The ending is potentially divisive, but Del Toro, seemingly aware that it might be, suggests that it's an interpretation. The other criticism of the plot is that it's pretty predictable. It's not suitable for children at all, given the sexual content and violence scenes but adults willing to forgive a little contrivance will find much to admire.",8,23,42,23 April 2018
The Disaster Artist," Morecambe and Wiseau
","Greg (Dave Franco) meets enigmatic and eccentric Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) at an acting class in San Francisco. They decide to move to LA together to pursue their dreams of acting professionally. When opportunity doesn't knock, Tommy decides to write, star, direct and finance his own feature 'The Room'. His unique approach to filmmaking, along with his distinctive acting and writing styles mean that 'The Room' is considered one of the worst films ever made, but it also is a cult hit that runs for years. I've never actually seen 'The Room' but enough of the memes have made it to me that I knew about its existence and have seen the 'Oh Hiya Mark' scene. Fortunately, though helpful, I don't think that seeing 'The Room' is essential to enjoying 'The Disaster Artist'. As a comedy in its own right, it's pretty funny. The decision to focus the story on Dave Franco's Greg was a good one, as he's a much more relatable character than the mysterious Tommy. When it comes to the actual making of the film the farce of the situation grows and grows as Tommy's erratic decisions and terrible artistic choices create a difficult environment for the experienced cast and crew he hires. It's at this point that the film is at it's funniest.To be honest, I started to grow weary of James Franco's Tommy Wiseau after a while. It's a very good impression, but you do get used to it and (although the real answers aren't known), I ended up wishing for a few answers to the questions about Tommy's background. It's not the only flaw, the issues that come up between the pair come and go without too much real exploration of the reasons behind them and I'm not sure I really buy how quickly Tommy comes around to accepting the audience's reactions. I'm not sure I'm likely to rewatch it too many times, but it was a diverting time whilst it lasted.",7,0,0,11 September 2018
Zombieland," Columbus Crew
","I rewatched 'Zombieland' on Saturday in preparation for the sequel this weekend. I was surprised to discover that although I still feel positively about the film, it's both slighter and shorter than I remembered and I didn't love it as much as I thought I did.Columbus (Jessie Eisenberg) seems an unlikely survivor of the Zombie apocalypse, but several months in he's still alive and living by his list of rules. He runs into Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who seems destined for this new environment, and then sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). Together they traverse the US, headed for Los Angeles, and for an amusement park, legend has it, is Zombie freeNot sure quiet why, over the last decade, 'Zombieland' has gone from a movie I loved to one I just liked. Maybe it's the proliferation of that sort of irreverent, gore spattered fun that has made it feel less unique and distinctive than it once did. Some, but not all, of it feels a little more tedious than it once did. I was surprised about how short the film was, coming in at less than 90 minutes as that wasn't part of my recollection of the film. I think you can see how the film is a pilot script filled out to get close to running time. You can also see that legacy in the plot of the film, it's pretty ... inconsequential, I suppose. It's more a collection of things that happen, rather than a real story that builds to anything.This is all, again, not to say that I suddenly now don't like the film. The CG effects are starting to show their age a little, or perhaps are starting to betray the budget of the film a bit, but the practical effects are really good. It is consistently funny, particularly with regards the dialogue and interaction. I love the characters and how the cast play them. I like Eisenberg's narration, I enjoy spending time with these people.It's just that I didn't quite enjoy the film as much as I thought I did.",7,0,0,21 October 2019
Joker," Dark Phoenix
","I tried to leave out all the noise surrounding 'Joker' and just focus on my feelings having seen the film.Arthur Penny (Joaquin Phoenix) plagued with mental Illness and confidence issues murders three yuppies whilst on his way home from his job, as a party clown. His downward spiral into madness appears mirrored by Gotham City itself, where budget cuts have the city on the edge of breaking point. The clown murders become a focal point in the civil unrest and inspires rioting in the streets.There is simply no denying the glorious committed central performance from Phoenix. The weight loss, the body contortions, the portrayal of severe mental Illness. The Oscar is his, you might as well give it to him now, and it's well deserved. I remember writing a review of 'Quills' when I was at University and I raved about him then and 'Joker' is the crowning achievement of a career that's full of high spots and has many more years left to go.I can't generate the same enthusiasm for the film though. I found it .... inconsequential. I spent a lot of time afterwards wondering if it's because it's an origin story for a character (or version of the character) that we're unlikely ever to see again and so they'll be no second or third act to the story. That's not to say I think they should do another one, I don't see how tonally this Joker will work against a Batman, it's too grounded, too realistic - even more so than Christopher Nolan's films were. This Joker isn't a terrorist or a 'Clown Prince of Crime', he's not interested in 'watching the World Burn', he's just a disturbed guy with a handgun. I suppose, at heart, my criticism is that the plot isn't new, different or complex enough for my taste.From a technical standpoint, the film is well done though. Cinematography and historical recreation are excellent, the colour palette of the movie is striking and bold, and whilst nobody else really comes close to Phoenix's level the rest of the performances are pretty solid across the board. The soundtrack is excellent too and I like that it's dark and violent. But as I sit here now, I wouldn't want to see the film again for a few years - and even then it would be for the performance rather than the film itself.",7,2,9,7 October 2019
It Chapter Two," .. but doctor, I am Pennywise.
","I said in my review of Chapter one, that though I really liked that film, one of my concerns was that this was the easy half of the story to tell. Though I didn't like Chapter 2 as much, I did feel it mostly avoided the potential pitfalls and was an OK conclusion.27 years after the children of Derry forced Pennywise (Bill Skarsgaard) into an early hibernation, Mikey (Isaiah Mustafa) the only one of the gang to have stayed in town, recalls his friends to honour the oath they swore, should Pennywise remerge. With the town in their past, their memories of their horrific battle have magically dissipated, but as they return, the recollections and the horror come back.I feel like this might be another review where I say that a film was alright, and then just list a series of my problems with it. So I'll try and be clearer.... The film is fine. Perfectly acceptable. Performances are solid, the story is decent enough and some of the pitfalls of the more outlandish (or perhaps offworld-ish) areas of the plot are dealt with as well as they could be. It is, again, reasonably funny - in fact there are more laughs than screams.That, perhaps, is one of the principle problems though. Again, it's not particularly scary, especially when Pennywise is inhabiting something else and not present in his clown form. There's a lot of CGI creations some of whom are more successful than others. Whilst on the subject of CGI, in some of the flashback scenes, they used software to make some of the young actors more closely resemble themselves from a few years back, this occasionally looks awful and gives poor Jeremy Ray Taylor in particular a plastic face. I don't feel like the adults had the same chemistry that the children had as a group either, despite the big names amongst them.These failings, along with the lengthy running time, mean I'm probably not going to revisit 'It' very often, but I do feel this is as strong a version of the story as you are every likely to get on screen.",6,3,4,13 September 2019
Ray," Ray of Light
","Jamie Foxx gives a stellar performance as Ray Charles in an amiable, but perhaps a bit lightweight, biopic of at blind virtuoso.Born to a poor Southern family, Ray overcomes the blindness that besets him at a young age and learns the piano, eventually performing with various combos on his way to joining Atlantic Records, and releasing his first single. Although success comes, eventually turning him to one of the biggest stars in the world, he's continually beset by guilt over the death of his younger brother and turns to heroin to help him deal with it. 'The part he was born to play' is a bit of a cliché, but is perhaps truly appropriate with Jamie Foxx here, he inhabits the role completely and was most deserving of his best Oscar actor for this performance. He's in virtually every scene (as you might imagine) and manages to convincingly play forty years of the main man's life. His is not the only great performance though, both Kerry Washington and Regina King provide excellent foils for Foxx as his long suffering wife Della Bea and 'Road wife' Margie Hendricks. Whilst I understand that it was a passion project for Taylor Hackford, I do feel like there is some criticism for him for some of the decisions. Some of the montage wipes involving news articles and the like feel pretty amateurish and jarred a bit with the quality of the rest of the production. Despite its running time, I felt it was skipping over some aspects that it could have gone further into, particularly the negative aspects or controversies. The criticism that Charles received for 'sexing up' gospel music is dismissed after one scene, as his is decision to pull out of gigs in front of segregated audiences and his court cases are dismissed with phone calls. I also felt that it could have done with a bit more after his hospitalisation rather than just an onscreen note that said he was successful and recorded for many more years. . . I understand the argument that there wasn't much drama in those years, but still. A performance of a lifetime, in a fairly decent film. You should check it out.",7,0,2,15 October 2018
Parasite," Won Direction
","The Best Picture win for 'Parasite' finally convinced some local cinemas to me to give it a whirl. Though I enjoyed it, I'm not sure I know genuinely know enough about South Korea class systems to be sure that I fully understood it. (Also, I apologise in advance for butchering South Korean Nomenclature in the next paragraph)Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) lives in a subterranean apartment with his family. One day, he is offered the chance to tutor English to Park Da-Hye (Jung Ji-So) the daughter of a wealthy family. Spying the opportunity to exploit the family, Ki-Woo brings in his sister Kim Ki-Jung (Park So-dam) as art tutor to Da-Hye's younger brother. His father, Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) replaces the family's chauffer and most importantly, his mother, Park Chung-sook (Jang Hye-Jin) replaces Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) as the families trusted housekeeper. All is going well for the Kim family, until one night when the Parks are away - the former housekeeper returns and requests access to the basement, to collect something she's left behind.I enjoyed 'Parasite' a lot. The performances are great. Kim Ki-taek is probably the standout but there really is nobody who lets the film down. The direction and cinematography are excellent. I enjoyed the story, and particular, not knowing exactly where the film was going to go. I'd seen 'The Host' before, so I know that Boon Joon-Ho is capable of taking his films into B-Movie territory so I had all sorts of potential horror/science fiction plots in mind. I don't feel like the film suffered in the second half although I accept that for some the switch from a confidence trickster movie to more of a revenge thriller might be a bit too much for some.My problem was that I really don't know much about how South Korean society works. I'm assuming that he film is parable about the tiered levels of class and money in Korea. That the 'Parasite' of the title can be considered both as the Kim family scamming money from the Parks, and the Parks living of the labour of their lower class employees. But again, I feel like I'm guessing this, rather than being sure.That doesn't really affect my appreciation though of an excellent film and a worthy best picture winner this year.",8,1,2,4 March 2020
X-Men: First Class," Class Action
","Prep for 'Dark Phoenix' begins with the first of the prequel films for the main X-men series.Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) discovered his magnetic mutant powers under extreme duress as Sebastian Schmidt (Kevin Bacon) exploits the Nazi's reign of terror to instigate his own experiments. 12 years later, the now renamed Sebastian Shaw is interfering in both the Military and political landscapes in the US and the USSR, which brings him to the attention of the CIA, who contact Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) an expert on genetic mutations to assist them. But Lensherr has not forgotten the terrors of his youth, and is looking for revenge.It was interesting to watch 'First Class' again after all these years. In a few aspects, particularly from a visual standpoint, CGI has moved on quite a lot in just the 8 years since and a few of the effects don't stand up that well. There's no 'weight' to a lot of them and a few specific examples, Beast running with Xavier as one, just look awful. Away from those concerns though, the film is pretty solid. It has one of the most straightforward and logical plotlines of film in this series, I understood the motivations for each of character and only really found that Mystique's 'accepting who she really is' turnaround came without sufficient motivation. It's got quite a lot of humorous moments and a few references to the wider series, McAvoy talking about losing his fair, the Stryker family making their first appearance, what looks like a young Storm, Cameos from Rebecca Romjin and, of course, Hugh Jackman.There are issues beyond the CGI. Michael Fassbender's accent wavers throughout and he's very Irish in the scenes towards the end. It's a little odd to see Mystique throw herself at both Beast and Magneto at a couple of points, you feel like they wouldn't make those choices were the film being made today. Minor quibbles in a very entertaining additional to the franchise.",7,0,0,4 June 2019
Black Panther," Solid enough but not t'op drawer.
","The 18th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is another solid entry to the franchise but It's a testament to how far Marvel have pushed the concept of a 'Superhero film' in the last couple of years that 'Black Panther', which would have been amazing as little as three years ago, now feels a bit out-dated. Following the death of his father during 'Captain America: Civil War', T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned its new King. He discovers that agents both within and outside of his homeland believe that the country should be doing more with their advanced science and technology to help the oppressed around the world. At the same time, Wakanda's most wanted, the only man to see hidden treasures and escape its borders, Ulysses Klaue, commits a daring robbery and may finally be vulnerable to capture. It's a beautiful looking film, and feels authentic to the region, even though Wakanda is a fictional land. Its debates about the morality of interference outside its feels like a genuine cause of conflict and Killmonger, excellently played by Michael B Jordan, is a villain whose motivation you believe in, even if the MCU's villain was/is family to the hero trope is again in force. However, I did find myself feeling at times that it was a bit po-faced, especially when compared to last years near comedies of 'Spider-man: Homecoming' and 'Thor Ragnorok', though the times when it is funny, usually revolving around Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister - Shuri - usually hit the mark. Another criticism I'd have for the film would be the editing, particularly in the earlier fight scenes. Modern action films are plagued by fight scenes shot too tight on the participants, which creates for a kinetic energy but, to my taste, makes it difficult to determine what's actually happening. Fortunately, for me, this stopped in the later fight scenes. Also, and very unusually for the MCU films, the CGI is occasionally a little subpar, particularly in the climactic battle. Though not breaking into my personal top five films of the MCU, there is much to enjoy with the characters and plenty of story scope for Black Panther 2.",7,17,35,19 February 2018
Mother!," Mamma Mia !
","Sometimes, it's a thin line between smart analogy and wasting everyone's time and, if I am honest, I think 'mother!' did too much of the latter to justify the former. The plot, such as it is, revolves around the titular mother, played by Jennifer Lawrence, who is the young wife to a brilliant poet who is suffering with writers block (Javier Bardem). Mother spends her life painstakingly restoring their home following a fire. Her peace is destroyed by two characters, played by Michelle Pffeifer and Ed Harris who are a married couple, welcomed into the house by the Poet, who immediately start undermining mother and ignoring her requests and boundaries. The film escalates from there. Let start with the one unquestionable part. The performances from all the cast are great. It feels like a stage play, indeed the 3 months of rehearsals must have made it feel like that to them. Cinematography and editing are excellent tooI can understand why people have hated it, particularly if you were anticipating a more traditional horror film. The issues are with the wholly metaphorical plot. Being honest, I did miss the principle idea about it being a mother earth and the incomprehensible damage that we are doing to it, despite how painfully obvious it seems once it's brought to your attention. Other ones I did pick up on though, the parable for Christianity and as a treatise on creativity that other have mentioned. I did think the initial scenes were about having children . . . though I seem to be alone with that one. I have to admit, I'm still thinking about the film a couple of days later, which I probably a good sign, but can I say that I was genuinely entertained whilst I was watching it ... no, not really.",5,2,3,19 June 2018
The Greatest Showman," Old Man Show-gon
","Second viewing for 'The Greatest Showman' following seeing it at the cinema towards the end of 2017.Hugh Jackman is PT Barnum, who rises from poverty via a job on the railroad to become the owner and purveyor of a museum of oddities in New York City, to more legitimate forms of entertainment. The film charts that rise and the effect it has on his family, including his wife who he has loved since their childhood.Whilst I do think that 'The Greatest Showman' is an excellent musical, as a legitimate biopic of PT Barnum or even as a film it's not as worthwhile. A bit of research shows its massively inaccurate and there just isn't enough conflict to his adult life to make it worthwhile story to tell. Critics don't like him, but people show up. He turns his back on his circus cast to promote an opera singer, they sing a song about it and then forgive him. He nearly has an affair and his wife leaves him, she comes back the first time he sees her.The songs though, are undeniable. They're all catchy and memorable and it's not surprising that so many of them have taken on lives of their own outside of the film. They're all performed and choreographed well. The blending in of CGI elements into some of them only enhances the experience on some of the songs and the direction, for a first full feature, is excellent.I doubt it'd be the one to win over any musical theatre holdouts but if you're anyway inclined towards the genre, I'm confident you'll enjoy it.",8,0,0,20 December 2018
Space Jam," Jordan Devlin
","I was surprised to learn that the 'How Did That Get Made' podcast had picked 'Space Jam' as one of the movies they were going to do. Though I hadn't seen the movie in years, I remember as a 16 year old, taking my younger brother to see it at the cinema - just the two of us and it wasn't, in my memory at least, a bad film. Turns out, they were right, as the movie is a pretty shambolic mix of advertisements and nonsense.With his space amusement park failing, Mr. Swackhammer (Danny DeVito) sends his lackeys to Earth to capture the Looney Tunes characters as his new attraction. Thinking fast, Bugs Bunny (Billy West) says that the Tunes characters have the right to defend themselves in a competition of their choosing. Given the small stature of their captures, Bugs picks Basketball, but the Aliens have a plan, and steal the skills of various NBA players (as well as a series of physical enhancements). Seeing that they'll now struggle, the tunes recruit Michael Jordan to play for their team.Overall it's a bit of a mess. I can actually take the advertisements, they're not as egregious as it's been made out to be in other areas, but the plot is horribly under baked and lacking, the voices sound wrong (mostly because they're different people) and worst of all, it's not funny. Not even slightly. Not even when Bill Murray is in it. The best bits, oddly, revolve around the real human basketball players and their struggles once the aliens have taken their basketball skills. Their visits to hospitals and psychiatrists trying to get to the bottom of it. The animation work is poor too, with the interaction with the real world less convincing than 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' despite that being almost a decade later.Michael Jordan actually does OK performance-wise. So much so you wonder why he hasn't taken up acting since his actual retirement and he's unquestionably the greatest NBA player of all time, so I understand the desire to eulogise him in a film like this. But even taking into consideration 'It's a Kids film', like that's some sort of genuine excuse, 'Space Jam' is far from a slamdunk.Also. R-Kelly (Shudder).",3,2,5,27 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
","On the whole, I feel positively about 'Jojo Rabbit', though I do accept and can see the reasons why some people might not enjoy it.As the WW2 turns against the Germans, young Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) a committed if incapable member of the Hitler Youth, discovers that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish Girl in her attic. Torn between his desire to be a good Nazi and to not get his mother in trouble, Jojo's life is complicated further by his imaginary friend, the Furher himself (Taika Waititi) who tells him that Jews cannot be trusted.So, the positives first. Roman Davis is great and his relationships with all the other characters is spot on. The film is gently funny, rather than a laugh riot, which is absolutely the right call and helps make the shifts to tragedy less jarring than they otherwise might be. The do still resonate though. Despite being a focus for the films marketing, Jojo's relationship with Hitler is actually a relatively minor part of the film, it could even have been dropped altogether without losing much, maybe just a little clarity on Jojo's thinking about his guest.I don't see what there is to find offensive, the film is clearly meant to be a parody and is patently absurd for most of its runtime.So why not a perfect review?It is, for my money, a little heavy handed with its story, each committed Nazi is ridiculous, in their own way. A few aspects of the farce wear a little thin, as the show goes on. Sam Rockwell's battle armour, for example, just doesn't tie in with the character we've seen leading up to it. It also doesn't really have anything new to say. Innocence being the first casualty of war is a long acknowledged idea.That said, I enjoyed the experience.",7,1,3,6 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Rey Mysterious
","Ahead of watching Episode IX at the cinema, I decided to rewatch the previous two film from this trilogy as preparation. Interestingly, I found that though my recollection of this film was that I enjoyed it, and that it was still the case, it does feel like a basic retread of the formula from the original trilogy.Rey (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku, and Finn (John Boyega) a deserting Stormtrooper, escape the planet on an abandoned Millennium Falcon with a plan to return a droid, BB-8, to his rightful place in the Resistance. Though the Empire fell, the First Order rose in their place (and with their clothes) led by a Sith Lord, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and his mysterious master, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis).Technically, the films marvellous. CGI is second to none, the scope of the planets, the backdrops of the destroyed Star Destroyers. I like all the performances, and all the new characters (with perhaps the exception of Maz Kanata who I don't feel was an interesting design or necessary to have as a motion capture character - I'd rather have just seen Lupita Nyong'o on screen).I mean, it's a film that I like, rather than love. It's a nostalgic bump of childhood, solid but not exceptional. Its conclusion is almost identical to the end of 'Return of the Jedi'. It has a painful sacrifice, like 'A New Hope'. It has a gun capable of destroying world, a droid with vital information in it. I feel, especially having watched Episode VIII again too, like it's disappointingly unwilling to do anything new with the universe at its disposal - so we're left with a film that's consistently OK, but never great.",6,1,2,9 January 2020
Deadpool," Deadgood.
","Former special Ops solider and now a mercenary, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is enjoying a passionate relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). On the day he proposes, he collapses and discovers that he has very late stage cancer. Desperate, he agrees to undergo a mysterious procedure that will cure him and also make him a 'hero' but the procedure actually involves activing his latent mutant genes following extensive torture. Left for dead, Wilson's mutant healing factor saves his life and allows him to pull on a red suit, call himself Deadpool and strike out for revenge. The plot is only half the fun though, less than half in fact. With the shackles off and a relatively low budget mitigating much of the risk, 'Deadpool' is a violent, foul mouthed action-comedy, with Reynolds and writers allowed to crack jokes about their careers, the state of superhero movies and other facets of pop culture as Deadpool breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience.This was my third or fourth viewing of the film, watched ahead of seeing the sequel. If I am truthful, some of the lustre does start to come off after a few repeat viewings. Some of the more accessible comedy moments, the trailer ones particular - like Angels' 'superhero landing' gag are all a bit too familiar now. It's interesting though that the self-referential style of humour has permeated outside of 'Deadpool' to become common place in the subsequent films of the MCU, if not quite to the extent that it does here. Plot wise, it's all fairly straightforward despite some time jumps in the first two thirds of the film. For the budget though, the action scenes are pretty strong, particularly the scenes involving a downed helicarrier at the conclusion.Still good, just overexposed a little now. Chuck on another two stars if you've not seen it before.",7,0,0,7 June 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Burning the Candle At Both Ends.
","Starting soon after the conclusion of the first film, Keanu Reeves returns to another stint of what he does best, highly choreographed fighting and emoting terribly.Word of Wick's re-emergence has spread around the organised crime community and prove particularly interesting to Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) a passed over Gomorrah boss, to whom Wick owes a blood debt. Dante calls this in and refuses to take Wick's 'please ... no ... don't do this' for an answer - blowing up his house. Out for revenge, but bound by the code of Assassins, Wick agrees to the job. Your opinion on John Wick 2 is likely to be pretty similar to your opinion of the first one, as it is, generally, more of the same. It's fair to say it's not quite as good, just by virtue of being so similar to the first it doesn't have the same effect. Also expectation is much higher now, whereas the first film came out of nowhere. My opinion though is that they are very welcome additions to the action genre, disregarding CGI heavy combat, or blurry heavily cut nonsense, for proper choreographed action, performed by stuntman and to an impressive amount by Keanu himself. The body count is high and the action is brutal, although not without is comedic moments too. Direction (and art direction) is excellent and the creation of the hyper stylised world that Wick inhabits is really strong. Acting in the film is . . . interesting. As if to counter act Keanu downplaying everyone else chews the scenery with abandon, none more than Lawrence Fishburne who clearly enjoys bellowing his lines at the top of his voice. Ian McShane isn't far behind and neither is Riccardo Scamarcio, twirling his metaphorical moustache as the films primary antagonist. Chastising the films realism is, for me, missing the point. Finding it dull or repetitive I can appreciate, even if I don't necessarily agree - but it's clearly not supposed to be set in the real world. There isn't really an assassin's hotel in the Flat Iron Building, people sewing Kevlar into Italian suits or a worldwide cabal of organised crime. You want to drive yourself really crazy, trying working out the exchange rate for what the gold coins are worth.",7,0,1,31 August 2018
Annihilation," Total Wipeout.
","Following on from 'The Cloverfield Paradox' and 'Mute', 'Annihilation' is the third in the trilogy of 'Risky Sci-Fi ventures sold to Netflix because the studio wisely thought that they would lose money on a wide cinematic release' and unfortunately, despite some nice ideas 'Annihilation' ends with such a disastrously awful third act it makes avoiding the glare of the paying public the right decision. So, Lena, (Natalie Portman) is mourning her solider husband Kane (Oscar Issac) who has been M.I.A for a year, when he inexplicable shows up just long enough for an evening of being enigmatic, before keeling over with massive internal trauma. As he lies in a military hospital, Lena learns that he's been part of a team sent to investigate inside the Shimmer, an area of swampland that has been enveloped by a shimmering light source that doesn't allow communication out and has so far seemingly claimed the lives of everyone who has entered. Desperate for answers, Lena volunteers for the next expedition. There are some good aspects to this film. Alex Garland's direction is capable, and there is a visual edge to the film that can be truly breathtaking at times. As the team enter the Shimmer and get closer to the centre, the weirdness of the creatures comes to the fore, and the horrific screaming skull bear is a memorable creation. The cast perform well, and it's nice to see a couple of the actresses perform against type, with Tessa Thompson and Gina Rodriquez having roles that you might have thought would have suited the other actress better. It's Natalie Portman's film though, and we experience the whole story from her point of view. Lena is a layered and flawed character, who's given a lot to do but Portman performs all aspects of it well. It's a shame then, that the film is entirely undone by an ending that is somehow both inexplicable and obvious, incredulous yet boring. It's up there with 'AI: Artificial intelligence' as a generally enjoyable and thought provoking film that's entirely undone by the decisions made for the last half hour. Unfortunately, this must fall at Alex Garland's feet too, as writer director - not the first time a solid film he's worked on has unravelled at the end, I'm thinking 'Sunshine'. It's another example too of a film where the explanations don't work within the internal logic of the story. I'm writing my review without spoilers, but there are a number of questions that came to me subsequently, even some the characters in the film specifically ask, that the ending doesn't really explain. (Maybe the two further novels that the film was based on may cover those, but they are unlikely to be made now). Sadly, it's the last impression that sticks with you regarding 'Annihilation' and that one is a mess.",4,1,3,5 June 2018
Jackie Brown," Hello Jackie, you look nice.
","Continuing on with my revisit of Quentin Tarantino's back catalogue lands us on 'Jackie Brown', the least Tarantino feeling movies he's done.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is an airline hostess who's caught transporting money back from Mexico for LA gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson). Trying to stay out of Jail, she cuts a deal with ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) to catch Ordell with the money in return for her immunity. But knowing that Ordell is a dangerous man she comes up with another plan, to keep his money for herself, but that plan requires the co-operation of bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster).That feeling that this isn't really a Tarantino movie is hard to shake. Partialy, I think it's because despite only being three films in, he already had a preferred cast of collaborators, a repertory theatre if you like, but 'Jackie Brown' has a cast of actors he was using for the first time, and then mostly wouldn't use again. It also doesn't sound like a Tarantino film, the dialogue is rarely as snappy as in the previous two films, I'm not sure , but I wonder if that's because he's adapting the Elmore Leonard book and isn't quite as free as he otherwise would be to write what he likes. The use of music is different too, it's quieter and relegated to real times you would hear music, car radios, in stores and bars. It looks like a Tarantino film though, in terms of shot choice and Sally Menke's editing.None of that goes to say that the film isn't good, or even great. It's a lengthy character driven twisty thriller. The performances are generally pretty good, although I don't much care for De Niro's lazy mumbling turn as one of Robbie's friends. But whenever Grier, Jackson or Robert Forster are on screen it really shines. Despite its length it flies by fairly quickly and arrives at a satisfying conclusion.I was hoping to have the experience that others appear to have had with 'Jackie Brown' and rediscovered this as the underappreciated classic and becoming their favourite Tarantino film - unfortunately, though I really liked the film, I still don't feel that way about it.",8,0,0,15 May 2020
Incredibles 2," Not so much a sequel as a remix.
","For whatever reason, I haven't really revisited the first 'Incredibles' film since the first time I saw it. I didn't dislike it, but I also haven't felt the need to watch it again since. Having seen 'Incredibles 2', to be honest I largely feel the same way. In a plot that's overall pretty similar to the first one, this time Holly Hunter's Elastigirl goes back to work as a 'super' leaving Craig T Nelson's Mr Incredible at home to look after their three kids. The return is inspired by brother and sister combination Winston and Evelyn Deavor (Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener) who are attempting to reverse the laws prohibiting superhero activity. Their plans are thrown into chaos though when a new villain 'Screenslaver' makes their presence and their mind control abilities known. Predictability and repetition is what really does for 'Incredibles 2' for me. The villain reveal at the end is pretty easy to see coming but it's the repeated plot points and scenes from the first film that lost me, the kids saving the day again, another visit to Edna Mode - it's pretty much the same film as the original. That's is not to say that it doesn't look great, it does - particularly in some amazing portal work when the character of Voyd. The Vocal work is good too, though nobody is particularly outstanding.It passed a couple of hours in a reasonably entertaining fashion, but it'll be a long time before I decide to watch it again.",6,1,4,16 August 2018
Beetlejuice," 'I'm afraid Robert Goulet hasn't arrived yet Sir'
","I've discovered that it's a risky proposition to go back and rewatch the films you liked as a kid through adult eyes. Plot holes seem more apparent, your sense of humour may have evolved, your life experience can change your outlook. So I was very happy to rewatch 'Beetlejuice' and find myself not only finding new things about the film I hadn't noticed before - but that so much of the film, from a visual effects standpoint if nothing else, still holds up.Young married couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland(Geena Davies) are tragically drowned on their way back to their Idyllic small town house. Returning as ghosts, they're horrified when a new family, The Deetz buy their house and move in. New York developer Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and his wife Delia (Catherine O Hara) arrive and she has big interior design plans for the house. Desperate, the Maitlands call on the help of bioexorcist Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) to scare the living away, but they soon discover that the solution is much worse than the problem.I mention the visual effects in the opening because they're one of the most striking aspects of the film, rewatching it today. Mostly practical or stop-motion, they haven't aged like some computer visual effects of the time (or even later) have and they're so unusual, so directly from their director's twisted mind, that they remain memorable. It's not all the film has going for it though, the script is funny and the performances are very strong too. Alec Baldwin looks impossibly young, Catherine O' Hara is a comic genius and Winona Ryder's Lydia is the prototype movie Goth girl. Michael Keaton is great too, apparently adlibbing for his life whenever his character gets a chance on screen. Some other reviews have suggested Betelgeuse's limited screen time as a bad thing, I think that's one of the films strengths. Fun as though he is, he would become a bit much if he was on screen longer.Funny, scary and brilliant 'Beetlejuice' is a classic. (Maybe don't let your younger kids watch it though.)",9,1,2,19 March 2020
