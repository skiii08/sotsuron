The Mask," Light movie version of a pitch-dark comic
","I first met The Mask as a comic, a violent, even revolting comic. I had to read it is small doses, because the violence was too extreme for my taste.As a movie, it is totally different. That is usually a bad sign, most movies that changes the concept so much fail to tell a good story, but when The Mask gets a less violent script and Carrey's incredible rubber face combined with cartoon-style special effects (and pretty good acting in between), the result is that the humor gets a lot stronger.In the comic, Ipkiss murders his old teacher with a book down her throat, and the car service men are slaughtered in similar ways. In the movie, we see one of the car service guys in pain, but he obviously survives. When the comic Ipkiss slaughters dozens of policemen, the movie version merely teases them. And it is much easier to laugh at.And the movie is great fun. No wonder it made Carrey a superstar. I have seen many of his movies, and this is one of the very best. Other favorites, 'Bruce almighty' and 'Truman show' are in many ways logical successors.The original story misuses our Norse god Loki as bad as US people always seem to do. Americans seem to be unable to understand Loki, so they use him as a devil or a demon, which is completely wrong. But the movie is more bent to mischief than slaughter, so the movie makes a big step in the right direction.Something that disturbs me is the bad guy Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) and the plot around him. He is a flat, standard mobster, and his part seems like something that was slapped on because the original ending was too horrible for the movie. But let me also say that the actors do their job well. I just feel that the standard gangster plot feels cheap.So the mobster plot was a disappointment in an otherwise very funny and worthwhile movie.",8,0,0,24 August 2007
The Terminator," Icon SF action thriller
","This is one of the great classics in the SF action genre (along with Alien), and a terrific example that budget and quality are remarkably unrelated. The big breakthroughs are made on tights budgets. It has a truly original concept, really well performed. I can't find any big holes in the plot like too many movies have. I can't even find small ones. Well, except for the time travel paradox of course.The whole story is tight, extremely well planned and executed. There doesn't seem to be a single second that isn't well timed. Of course, the actors help - not a single bad performance. Not only are Hamilton and Biehn doing their parts nicely, and stone faced Arnold of course, but all the side roles are just as fine. Cameron seems to have been doing the best directing of his life.25 years after its release, only some animations in the end feel dated (and to be frank, they were pretty bad even back then, certainly a budget problem). Today, the animations would be smoother. Let's accept that as it is. All the rest is 100%, as close to perfect that an action movie can get.It also stands as an example that action doesn't come from numbers of bad guys. One is much better than hundreds.What is there not to like? Again, some crude animations. And if you just don't want action you want to watch something else, certainly. There is blood, gore and violence. And if you don't like nudity there is a scene or two to skip. and you have to accept that time travel works despite that it doesn't. If you want Arnold as a hero and speaking more, this is not for you. But I don't say that as criticism to the movie, only stating what should keep some from it.",10,1,2,22 September 2009
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Cassidy vs Cassidy, Curry vs Curry
","Fun naming trivia: Butch Cassidy, played by Paul Newman, has a fight with Kid Curry (Harvey Logan), played by Ted Cassidy. 'Kid Curry' is later used as the name of one of the similar heroes in 'Alias Smith & Jones', ironically played by Ben Murphy, the Paul Newman look- alike! Cassidy fights Cassidy, Curry fights someone who looks like the other Curry...This is a very good movie, although not perfect. The story about the two charming outlaws, with more or less truth behind it, is pretty good, although a bit over the top sometimes. The ambition to tell the story about the real outlaws is undone more than once by over- simplifications and dramatic effects. Fortunately, the movie has qualities beyond that.I think that the fine performances by Redford and Newman is what holds it together. That, plus the good photography, and the fact that the script most likely was very original at the time. Later, the 'Alias Smith & Jones' TV series shows what would have happened if they had been granted amnesty, which they are denied in the movie, resulting in a lighter version of the story.So, if you want something less bloody than 'Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid', get 'Alias Smith & Jones'. If, on the other hand, you like 'Alias Smith & Jones', this is the original that you can't miss!A classic, definitely.",7,1,2,7 November 2008
"I, Robot"," 90% Judge Dredd, 9% TRON, 1% Asimov
","At first, I was upset that the name for the great book 'I, Robot' was used for this movie, which has almost nothing in common with the book. We have Asimov's robot laws, we have one specific situation which is somewhat similar (faulty robot hiding in a mass of robots), and a few names, that's all. Most surprisingly, the movie doesn't even use the robot jokes!But from a totally different point of view, this is a pretty good movie. In particular, this is what the Judge Dredd movie should have been about! Robot crime and robot uprisings, that is a big part of Judge Dredd, which was all too overlooked in the movie. Here we have a robot uprising, not as violent as in Dredd, but complete with the robot that takes side with the humans and helps them to victory. Of course, we don't have any revengeful Call-Me-Kenneth here, but a Master Control that wants to control humans to protect them. But the story still has much Dredd qualities.That brings us to the other similarity. I call the big robot brain Master Control for a reason. Here, it is called VIKI (with interesting implications towards Wikipedia, maybe?) but what I see if Master Control, the control program and ultimate villain in TRON. The whole ending is very similar to TRON, complete with something that the heroes must insert into Master Control to turn it off, it just isn't a Frisbee.I'll be nice and consider that part a tribute to TRON rather than a rip-off. TRON is, after all, the mother of all modern SF, especially with computer graphics, so including it as part of this movie is called for.I refuse to rate this movie, because there is no single rating that fits. As a movie version of Asimov's book, it is no more than a 2 (complete failure), but as the 'real Dredd' movie it is more like a 7, a well done and fun movie (but missing some details, like the 'right' hero). As an independent action movie, maybe somewhat lower (due to all the things that makes me think of Dredd and TRON), if you notice them. It all depends on your point of view, but more than usual.All in all, the movie is worthwhile and entertaining. But don't expect any connection to Asimov's book, and you might even enjoy the few minor connections that there are. Recommended to Dredd fans!",Null,1,2,24 April 2012
Duck Soup," Great for the Marx fans
","This movie is without doubt one of the best Marx movies - for those who have seen a few before. It failed at the box office, and many reviews here at IMDb, mostly from people who never saw a Marx movie before, are not very positive.This all makes sense if you think about it. Duck Soup has an unusually high tempo, several very well done scenes. The plot is questionable, but Marx movies are not about plot. But with that tempo, you really need to be used to the Marx concept. If you are, you will have a really good time.But if you are not so used to Marx, I would say that the ones to start with are 'A night at the opera' or 'A day at the races'. The latter was my favorite as a child, and even after watching all Marx movies, they are still on par with Duck Soup for me.Duck Soup is a good comedy, but I don't think it deserves to be called the best of all time. My prime alternatives for that prize are The Great Dictator, Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Blues Brothers. The Great Dictator is really the one to compare to, also being a political comedy. I do like Duck Soup, it is an iconic movie, but as a parody of politics and war, how can it match Chaplin's finest hour?",9,1,1,28 November 2013
The Incredibles," Too violent to be a good children's movie
","This is one more well-produced Pixar movie. Technically, it is great. Also, there is much action and the story is even a bit interesting. It is also very funny in the early parts, where they try to lead a normal life with variable success.But there are two things I really don't like with it: the violence and the morals.For being a movie for kids, I find it daring to have the hero finding the corpse of a murdered man, and a list of victims that the villain has killed. We also see clips where several super-heroes are killed in accidents due to wearing capes. To top that off, the villain is killed in a brutal way.My view of the morals comes from comparing to 'Robots'. In 'Robots' we are told that you should be persistent in working towards your dreams and that anyone can make it. In 'Incredibles', we see that if you are not born super, you can not be super, and if you try to be super anyway, you should... be killed by being sucked into turbine???I know, the villain is made villain due to bad treatment by Mr Incredible. This is the good part, what excuses the otherwise horrible message. But it is sad that his creativity and ingenuity is only used for evil things, as if inventing things is evil. He is a classic mad scientist and science is evil.So most of all, I question this is as a good children's movie. Too much violence and deaths, anti-creative and anti-science. Get 'Robots' for the kids and watch 'Incredibles' yourself.",6,0,2,18 July 2006
A Clockwork Orange," A masterpiece in ultra-violence
","How should violence be presented in a movie, for maximum impact? Should as many people as possible be killed? Should people be killed in as extreme ways as possible? Should the violence be as detailed and gory as possible? Big explosions? Exessive use of firing machine guns?No. Limit the effects and make it realistic, and the violence will go to the heart and be really nasty. Less is more. This movie is frightening, horrible, despite the fact that you never see much. It is frightening in the same was as Hitchcock's movies were frightening. Even a simple thing as the gang beating up a man is significant, not because of the pain they inflict (which is limited) but because they do it for fun.The gang, Alex in particular, are close and still distant. You see the world though their twisted eyes. You get all their motives and still they have none.When I left the movie with my friends, nobody spoke for several minutes. We had seen something very different and tried to grasp what it really was. That alone is a good sign. And what we had seen was a masterpiece.",10,0,1,18 July 2006
Tombstone," Quantity over quality
","I saw this movie a few years ago, and I won't see it again.The first half of the movie is a somewhat amusing low-quality western. The acting is poor, worse than most TV westerns, and the production is average at best, but the story works as a kind of parody of classic western stories. I wasn't impressed but somewhat amused. But the ending is a total disaster. A long hunt is summarized to many short cuts in very high tempo. It is almost a music video tempo, and there is absolutely no plot left, just a repetitive kill-kill-kill, a clear case of quantity over quality. The movie producer seems to think the movie gets better the more people that we see killed.The opening is tasteless and over-done, where the 'cowboys' gang massacres an entire village because someone in that village killed a gang member. I see the point, it presents the bad guys, but it is too long, had been better left out. Again, there is no point in showing every separate death.So, the movie has its greatest moments in the first half, where something meaningful actually happens and there is interaction and tension. The death of the sheriff (by accident) is the only violent scene in the movie that is well done and memorable.Skip the ending (and trim the opening) and it is a decent low-quality western. But as delivered, it is garbage. Leave it in the bargain bin.",2,12,30,16 July 2006
The Producers," A fun movie with some visible holes in the plot
","I understand that this movie was a hit, and I did enjoy it very much. Mostel and Wilder are truly great, and the idea behind the plot is superb.There are, however, a few weak points. The biggest one is the mystery how Bialystock first have to court old ladies to barely earn a living, and then suddenly can swindle them of a fortune. There is no obvious reason. Why would he need to produce anything if the old ladies are naive enough to invest in a play that they haven't even seen the script for? If, on the other hand, they had started with a first-rate script, sold too many shares on THAT, and then do all they can to make a flop out of it, that would have been much more logical. Without the bad script, we would not have the mad writer (Kenneth Mars), but the plot would have been convincing. I have read at least one story based on The Producers that avoids those logical problems.The other total lunatics, like deBris (Christopher Hewett) all make sense (and over-act as they should), and how deBris and the actors can fit together to make the result a hit is quite sensible.A second weak point is Ulla (Lee Meredith) the blond bimbo. She is a cliché that adds nothing to the movie, she is not fun but only makes me sad. Of course her presence is a result of Bialystock's strange ideas of luxury, but just finding a complete idiot like her is too unlikely. She could possibly have been part of the play (as Eva Braun?), but as a pet secretary she is only offending.There is one more weak point. The turning from flop to success, by actors performing a high school student level farce is not convincing. Rather, the grandiose opening was more likely to work as something so superbly overdone that it becomes a good satire. So when the play goes from grandiosely overdone musical to cheaply improvised amateur play, that is not the point where I expect the audience to start loving it. They could possibly start smiling at a bit of simplistic farce, and THEN get enthusiastic at how it fits with the music numbers, but not the other way around. Or is the audience that easy to please? But I take this problem as a problem with time; it would take too much time to show high-class humor with tension and perfect timing.All in all, I think the actors (and most likely first-class direction of them) carry this movie. Mostel, Wilder, Hewett and most others (even most smaller roles) do terrific acts that add up to a very enjoyable movie and I can choose to ignore the logical errors.",8,1,2,10 April 2008
