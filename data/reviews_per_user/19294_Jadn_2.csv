Angels & Demons," Swing and a miss
","I should have known you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Religion, science, worlds end, moment of creation, ancient secret societies... Ron Howard stays faithful to his cues, but ultimately the downfall of this movie lies solely in plot and writing. Today, audiences can suspend disbelief if they go into a theater with such intention, but that was the magic behind The Da Vinci Code, wasn't it? We walked out of the theater with a sense of 'what if?' despite having been ready for a movie that was supposed to be unbelievable. Angels and Demons fails on this note because the plot is childish and absurd, in no way a justice to its paperback counterpart. It seemed rushed, despite being too long, and many a minute were wasted on meaningless dialog that could have otherwise been used to develop characters whose interactions were arbitrary, to say the least. There is, though ill-fated, an attempt made for a Langdon/Sophie relationship here... which in itself was just pathetically copycat material. And to make matters worse, characters who exist long enough and seem to finally be taking a decisive role suddenly are either killed or shooed away for more haywire plot development. And when I say haywire, I mean insanely over-the-top ridiculousness. It's sporadic and even a bit desperate to capture the essence its predecessor left behind, and in the end it just doesn't compare. Wait for the DVD folks.",6,16,32,1 June 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Just goes to show...
","you should never believe the hype. By all accounts, this movie is good, but it is not in a league of epic proportions. The story is incredible, but nothing that hasn't been used before, and the predictability takes away from the natural curiosities that make us movie-goers interested in the first place. Given, once the movie actually begins, the directors do a great job of sucking in the audience with shock value realism and of course the staples of any good movie: money and women. The problem is that its all been done before in a thousand different ways, and the only twist here is a game show. This is defiantly a movie everyone should see at least once... but your not going to be dying to watch it two months from now. And there is no reason to see it in theaters because its effect is not action or sensory based... although the soundtrack is pretty good. If there was a choice, I probably would have went with a 7.5 but the hype is why I rounded down here. Give it a shot, but don't go expecting a movie that won 8 Oscars, or a top 50 movie spot.",7,0,1,17 March 2009
