","Whereas this moving is entertaining, when is Denzel Washington not entertaining, how can you possibly have a movie about New Orleans, the Crescent City - and have everyone speaking in a generic voice. New Orleans has a very unique accent and culture and to have a movie set in New Orleans and have no New Orleans accents is ridiculous at best. Also, movies about time travel always absolve themselves from having to be consistent. I think it is the lazy way out and when coupled with no local accents - sorry Denzel = this is a lazy movie. But you can get away with it! With very little effort, you could have added lots of color and culture with just a little bit of New Orleans in your movie about a terrorist act in New Orleans. How hard can that be? You could have masked the obvious holes in the plot of the movie if you had added the local color - and not just beads around the necks of women who bared their breasts for Mardi Gras!",5,0,1,30 April 2007
