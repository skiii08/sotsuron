The Blair Witch Project," Real boogers! Beavis and Butthead, eat your hearts out.
","Slightly nerve-wracking in a few places, but hardly 'the scariest movie since The Exorcist.' The scariest part was when the camera was looking up the nose of this sobbing girl and I was cringing in fear that we'd see a slimy booger drip out.  As it turned out, though, just as the booger started to drip down toward the lens, the camera . . . No! That would be a spoiler.  Sorry, you'll just have to see the movie.",1,0,1,11 September 1999
Alien 3," Bad idea
","It's fun to compare Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher, the directors of Alien, Aliens and Alien^3, respectively. You couldn't find three more different directors. In Alien ^3, Fincher wants you to think he's cool. In Aliens, Cameron wants you to see the movie three times at the theater, tell all your friends how terrific it is, then buy the video the day it comes out. And in Alien, Scott wants you to eat sh*t and die. Cameron and Scott succeed, Fincher fails.Or maybe: Scott is NYC, Cameron is LA, and Fincher is Seattle.How about: Scott is a Lamborghini, Cameron is a Lincoln Navigator, and Fincher is a Prius with a Hummer hidden in the garage at home.Alien^3 just doesn't make it. Its grim penal colony is a boring cliché. The script is lame. Because of it, Sigourney Weaver gives her weakest performance in the Alien series. Alien^3 tries to be pretentious and fails even at that. Skip over this one and move on to Alien Resurrection, which might not be up to the standards of the first two but still towers above Alien^3.",Null,489,529,11 August 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Steven Spielberg is a genius
","Everything came together in this classic movie. Spielberg is our resident entertainment genius. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of those movies you never get tired of: the tenth viewing is as much fun as the first, and each new generation loves it as much as the previous ones loved it. Unlike the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, membership in a cult is not required.  It's just a great piece of movie entertainment.  A perfect 10.",10,0,0,27 May 1999
Casablanca," If it's so great, how come you never watch it?
","This movie is the darling of the beret-and-baguette crowd in every self-important college town in America. Cineaste wannabes trip over each other between sips of chardonnay to gargle its praises.  That should tell you something right there.  It's a ridiculously overpraised 'B' movie, and if you listen carefully you'll hear the tones of above-it-all irony in the cineaste wannabes' voices.  Still, if asked to name the greatest 'films' of all time, be sure to put Casablanca up near the top, along with Citizen Kane and It's a Wonderful Life, just so you won't have to listen to it.",4,11,26,14 September 1999
Fight Club," Pretentious
","Another of David Fincher's tiresome gay fantasies involving rough trade with shaved heads, and one pathetic female outsider. (Think Alien^3.)  Lots of muscles, sweat, grime, adrogyny, faux-noir scenes.  Hey, David -- been there, done that, still bored to death by it.You know, actually, it was on its way to becoming a nice, different kind of thriller, but the writers apparently ran out of ideas and turned it into a groaner.  I literally groaned and shook my head, and stayed only to see how it ended.",3,3,11,15 October 1999
Monster," Pity
","This movie is so dominated by Charlize Theron's performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos that it's easy to overlook the screenplay and the direction, both of which are of a quality to help unveil Theron's towering talent.  But in the end it's that talent that overshadows everything else in the movie. 
Christina Ricci, for example, all but vanishes in the thankless role of Selby, Wuornos' shallow and frightened lover.  There is an innocent but oddly and cruelly calculating quality about Selby, as Ricci plays her, that descends from Nabokov's Lolita herself.  Wuornos never has a chance as long as she's with Selby, as Ricci's performance makes clear.  But in order to see it, you first have to tear your eyes off of Theron.  Good luck with that.  And where did Theron's talent come from?  Where did *Theron* come from, for that matter?  Up until this movie, my impression of her is of something exquisitely decorative off in the corner of a few movies like Mighty Joe Young, or a highly competent -- but no less decorative -- actor in movies like The Cider House Rules.  The first time you get a glimpse of her in Monster, when Aileen Wuornos ambles into a bar near the start of the movie, a gasp goes up from the audience.  It's an amazing, unbelievable, transformation.  It's so shocking, in fact, that it almost seems like a stunt in a couple of places.  I suppose that's basically what it is.  But that doesn't matter. Theron deserves all the praise she's been getting for this performance. When an actress of Theron's physical beauty strips down to her underwear for a scene, or appears nude, the last thing she ordinarily wants the audience to feel for her is pity.  But that's what Theron goes for in this movie, and that's what she achieves.  She is a gifted actor, and a very brave woman. 
Highest recommendation.",Null,0,0,25 January 2004
Shakespeare in Love," Gwyneth's best
","I'm a sucker for any historic drama. This isn't awfully historic. For one thing, we don't know much about William Shakespeare's life, let alone his love-life (which, according to what little we do know, wasn't especially interesting). But the movie does deal with some real people, and is filled with English-Lit-major in-jokes. My favorite one is John Webster, goriest dramatist ever - portrayed as a boy whose favorite parts of the plays are the violent death scenes. There's a very nice love story in there, too, plus Gwyneth Paltrow at her best.Highly recommended.",10,0,1,6 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Subversive and hilarious
","This movie bristles with thorns.  Anywhere you touch it, there's something sharp enough to draw blood.  But just as inside such superficially 'warm' movies as It's a Wonderful Life there sometimes lurks a cold manipulative contempt for the audience, South Park's prickly exterior masks a fun-loving creative impulse that deeply respects the audience and invites us to join its subversive cause.  This move assumes that you are intelligent, that you aren't fooled by the pious crap that issues from the mouths of politicians and power-tripping 'morality' crusaders, and that you might enjoy participating in the noble effort to lace their food with laxatives and lock all the bathroom doors.  10 out of 10.",10,0,0,21 July 1999
Elizabeth," The Godmother
","I'm a sucker for any historic drama.  This one is better than most, thanks mainly to the acting of Cate Blanchett, who seems to have perfected her 'tude by watching Glenda Jackson in the old 'Elizabeth R' TV series.  French cinebabe Fanny Ardant is hot in a brief appearance as Mary of Guise.  The over-all atmosphere and the final scenes of this movie are cribbed straight from Godfather I, however.  I almost expected to see Fat Clemenza show up and plug Norfolk in his bed.",9,0,2,6 September 1999
Final Destination 2," Gruesome fun
","Take the Rube Goldberg death sequences from the first movie, expand on them, and remove the plot, such as it was, and you have this sequel.  My wife and I both had the same reaction -- who ever would've thought that seeing people burned, stabbed, eviscerated, decapitated, dismembered and impaled could be so much fun?  I can't explain why this should be.  You just have to see the movie and decide if you love it or hate it.A couple of comments.  First, Shirley Walker's music for the original Final Destination was so good I bought the DVD for that reason alone.  Her score for FD2 is nice, but not as moody or atmospheric.  Second, as I'm sure someone has already pointed out, the characters in both FD and FD2 are named after famous horror movie directors: Corman, Carpenter, Hitchcock, Browning, Lewton, and others.  That alone should clue you in to what's going on.",Null,0,0,26 February 2003
Alien," The Perfect Movie
","The sick claustrophobic dread, the blinding disco-era strobes and deafening noise, the machine-like creatures, the organic-looking machines, the face-hugger, the chest-burster, H.R. Giger's nightmarish monster (and what *was* it doing to Veronica Cartwright, anyway?), Jerry Goldsmith's neoromantic score segueing to Howard Hanson's 2nd Symphony at the end, that darned cat -- 'Alien' is The Perfect Movie. James Cameron's sequel was a better film in almost every way, but it will never make the midnight cult circuit, as Ridley Scott's history- making shocker has done.  Cameron wants you to see his movie three times at the theater, tell all your friends how great is is, and buy the video the day it comes out. That's why we love him, but it's also one of his limitations. By contrast, when asked what effect he wanted 'Alien' to have on the audience, Scott replied: 'Like someone pounding a nail into your head.'",10,1,3,29 April 1999
American Hustle," Overacted and confused
","A movie about Italian and Jewish hustlers back in the late 1970s, made by people whose idea of these things apparently comes from magazines and TV. I grew up with such people, and here's a little hint: They had better taste in clothes, and they weren't always screaming at each other at the top of their voices. And seriously, guys, if you want to portray a Jew from the Bronx, why not cast a real one in the role? Christian Bale's performance was one long cliché, punctuated by Bale's embarrassing scenery-chewing 'Oscar moments.' He didn't know what he was doing. Amy Adams' strength is her looks and the occasional camera take, but that's about it. Bradley Cooper was better but still not great. Jennifer Lawrence was the best of them, by far the most convincing (except for her character's inexplicable attraction to the repulsive Bale). The plot was confused. Not really worth following - there's a time-saver for you. And the setting was not convincing as either New York or New Jersey. What a missed opportunity this movie was.",4,3,4,27 April 2014
10 Things I Hate About You," Not shrewish enough
","Modern retelling of The Taming of the Shrew. A pretty but sadly watered-down Kate is the flaw that kills the movie.  Not the actress's fault, she only had what the writers gave her.",Null,0,0,16 March 2000
He Got Game," If you love basketball, this is your movie
","A great performance by Denzel Washington, a so-so story line but wonderful basketball vignettes and weirdly appropriate music by Aaron Copland: Appalachian Spring, Billy the Kid, music from the movies Our Town, The Red Pony, The Heiress, etc., and a chilling couple of scenes using Copland's Orchestral Variations, which is his orchestration of his famous Piano Variations).  A good solid performance by Jim Brown, of all people. Highly recommended.",8,0,1,20 May 1999
Pitch Black," Interesting twist on the Alien genre

American Beauty," Those exotic suburbs again
","It pleases Hollywood and a large number of moviegoers to believe that affluent suburbanites aren't nearly as happy as they seem to be. So, they wallow in preposterous fictions like this one. Makes 'em feel better about themselves, or something.The thing that struck me most about this movie is the nasty strain of misogyny that runs through it. Granted, there are no male *or* female characters that resemble anyone living or dead; but the women especially are all drawn with utter contempt, from the pathetically naive daughter to her Lolita-like seductress friend to the vile harridan played by Annette Bening.Shame on them for participating in this.",1,1,4,24 November 2000
54," Not bad, not great
","I wasn't crazy about 54.  The expensive-looking set wasn't very convincing.  Neve Campbell is a fine actress, but even she couldn't bring her hackneyed character to life -- the weary, 'I bet you think this is glamorous,' actress who finds coffee and conversation at a simple diner more rewarding than drugs and dancing at fabulous 'Studio,' as everyone called it (wouldn't've made a very good title, though).  Mike Myers' sustained impression of Steve Rubell was okay.  5 out of 10.",6,0,1,11 September 1999
Aliens," Cameron's finest
","My apologies to any Titanic fans reading this, but in my opinion Aliens is the best thing James Cameron ever did.  It's a tremendous thriller with excellent special effects and, in the egg-laying queen alien, the greatest movie monster of all time.  For Ripley to stand there and say her famous line, 'Get away from her, you bitch!' (don't you just love the way Sigourney Weaver positively *spits* the word 'bitch' at the creature?) takes the kind of over-the-top heroism that screen legends are made of.  The Alien franchise could've died with this movie -- instead, it became the classiest and most durable of them all. If it lacks the cult-appeal of Ridley Scott's Alien, it more than makes up for it in every other way.",10,4,6,1 May 1999
Velvet Goldmine," Say five Our Fathers, ten Hail Marys, and watch Velvet Goldmine.
","The music is 'glam rock' or 'glitter rock,' which evidently is one of those kinds of pop music attending concerts of which will make a certain type of person feel as if he's starring in a more interesting version of his own life.  A movie about fictional rock stars and the lives they lead is not a bad idea in theory.  The problem with this particular movie is that the music sucks.  As Beavis said on another occasion, it sucks so much, you need to find a new word for how bad it is. And there's so much of it, dear God.  It goes on and on and on.  Rent this one if you've done something terrible and need to atone for it.",2,3,12,22 May 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Liked it in spite of myself
","I'm no fan of John Woo or the 'timely somersault' action genre, but this movie is hilarious.  It's Woo doing a parody of/hommage to himself with a squillion-dollar big-studio budget.  I've seen the movie twice, once at the theater and once on DVD, and both times was left in awe of Woo's mastery of pace and timing, and the cheerful presumptuousness with which he shoves this absurd movie in our faces.  If nothing else, it's about ten times more watchable than MI-1.",Null,0,0,26 February 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Like its two stars, beautiful and shallow
","A beautifully detailed production but as shallow as a pizza pan.  It can be helpful with a movie by a Kubrick to imagine that it was directed by someone else -- say, James Cameron -- and then ask yourself what your opinion of it would be.  Eyes Wide Shut flunks the Cameron test dismally.  Even the sumptuous visuals got on my nerves after a while.  I mean, how many curtains of Christmas lights do I have to be shown before I shout, 'I get the idea!'?  And how many times does Nicole Kidman have to dissolve in naughty-schoolgirl giggles before you want to put duct tape over her mouth?  The plot is entirely predictable, the married couple's wrangling is banal.  A sad expensive failure.",Null,0,1,10 March 2000
Titanic," Still amazing
","Titanic is one of those movies that will have to be rereleased in the theaters periodically, because you miss a lot on the small screen.  Even so, Cameron's fantastically detailed canvas still amazes me. The movie is filled with images you can never forget.  It's the work of a great visual artist.",10,0,2,27 April 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a good movie...
","...but not a great movie, and certainly not one of the greatest of all time.  I realize you can't say that without being accused of kicking kittens and other atrocities, but that's the way I feel.  Sorry.I mean, really: 'Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings'??  Puh-leez.  If a Robin WIlliams movie were made today with such a line -- not to mention the cartoonish characters, the sappy plot, the false sentimentality -- it would be laughed out of the theaters.  Are we supposed to make allowances because this movie was made back in 1946 when they didn't know any better?  Believe me, they knew better.The only reason to go out of your way to see this movie is that Drew Barrymore's great-uncle Lionel is in it.  You should always show respect for Drew Barrymore.",5,13,27,19 May 1999
War of the Worlds," Occupations Always Fail
","My whole family loved this movie.The effects are as cool as you'd expect. In particular, the bone-shaking noises the machines communicate with are highly unsettling.The plot follows the H.G. Wells novel somewhat closer than the 1950s movie, for what that's worth. The tripod war machines are the most noticeable example. There is at least one touch you won't appreciate at all unless you've read the novel: the aliens' interest in a bicycle wheel in one scene is a nod to Wells' improbable conceit that the Martians (for that's who they were in the novel and the George Pal movie) had never invented the wheel! - their machines ran on a complicated system of sliding arms and cables.Dakota Fanning, who plays the little kid with her emotional problems and trendy coping devices ('This is your space. You are safe inside it.') is the best thing in the movie, by far. She gives a professional, nuanced, performance. But Tim Robbins delivers the best line in the movie: 'Occupations always fail.' What with all the ghastly bad publicity about him lately, it's a little tricky at the beginning seeing Tom Cruise and not thinking, 'That's Tom Cruise. He's insane.' But you get used to it after a bit.",9,1,5,4 July 2005
Scream 2," Silly, but on to itself
","Not really a serious slasher movie, but a subversive swipe at our media culture, it succeeds grubbily where The Truman Show fails elegantly.  It helps to have seen Scream 1, if only to recognize that Tori Spelling playing the Neve Campbell character in Scream 2's movie-within-a-movie version of the story of Scream 1, is the very thing the Neve Campbell character jokingly predicted would happen in Scream 1.The punch line of Scream 2 comes at the very end.  The movie's many lapses into false gore, false pathos and false sentimentality are probably necessary evils, and in any case they don't detract from the fun.Things like 'It was my head, but Jennifer Aniston's body,' and 'At least you were played by David Schwimmer,' and that bitchy dissection of the latest Party of Five episode by two sorority girls, will all sail sadly over the heads (beneath the dignity?) of art house types who wouldn't be caught dead watching a sitcom.  But there are other things they might get. There's the cell phone/cordless phone theme: Also, caller ID makes its first appearance in a movie in Scream 2 -- there's none of the anachronistic call-tracing nonsense we still see in other movies.   (FBI agent whispers desperately: 'Keep him on the line for another 45 seconds, for chrissake, we've almost got him!' -- and in real life  the rest of us know who's calling on the first ring.)",8,0,0,29 April 1999
Platoon," Only average without the music
","This movie seems to tear your heart out. If you try watching the key scenes some time with the sound turned down, you realize that it's a run-of-the-mill war movie.  Stone's direction is excellent, as always, but his greatest inspiration was to play Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings during the scenes of battle and carnage.  The music is what tears your heart out.  Without it, you're left with a well-crafted movie based on mediocre material.  I credit Stone with using Barber's music to such devastating effect.",6,0,3,23 April 1999
Blow," George and Mirtha. Sad, sad, sad.
","The plot wandered, as life tends to do, but the characters and settings were fascinating. It seemed a lot longer than it was, because it would come to a dramatically logical end and then start up again. Plus, each new phase is more depressing than the last. Based on the true story of one George Jung, who is said to have supplied 85% of the cocaine used in the USA in the 1970s. If that's true, then the particularly nasty circle of hell he inhabits to this day is well-deserved. Johnny Depp wore out his one facial expression about a third of the way through. Penelope Cruz gamely tries to chew the scenery, but is a weak link. Ray Liotta's performance is strangely affecting.",7,0,0,8 April 2001
Bruce Almighty," Stranger than we can imagine.
","Some scientist once remarked that the universe is not only stranger than we imagine: it's stranger than we *can* imagine.  Except for the obvious fact that the word 'strange' is a relative term, and that what might seem strange to that scientist might not seem so strange to someone else, the statement has always seemed to me to be a very reasonable expression of one man's faith in the essential zaniness of things.  (And his faith was not misplaced: the latest news is that we're all made of vibrations and have no way of knowing what it is that's vibrating.  Explains the buzzy sensation that replaces thought in the minds of politicians.)Well, since the universe includes God (or is God, or is included in God, depending on your sect), then we shouldn't be surprised if God looks like Morgan Freeman.  Freeman's wonderful voice and his look of calm competence -- you *know* he knows way more than he's saying -- has left him typecast as the authority-figure in one movie after another.  Why not the Ultimate Authority-Figure in this one?  And, continuing with the strangeness theme, why shouldn't the Creator pick one Jim-Carrey-like human out of all the billions of humans who demand favors of Him, and give him God-like power over one neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, USA?  And finally, why shouldn't He deliberately neglect to give that human God-like wisdom along with the God-like power?  (Because otherwise there would've been no movie, obviously.)'Bruce Almighty' tries to convey a Capra-like faith in the essential goodness of ordinary people.  Bruce easily could've sunk into Elvis-like debauchery or Stalin-like mass cruelty by the end of the week, but instead he attains a certain humility and kindliness.  Seems unlikely, I know, but that was just God picking the right person and keeping the movie a comedy instead of a tragedy.  It's not a great comedy, but I like that the theologizing and philosophizing are kept to a minimum.  And how can you not like any movie that has Jennifer Aniston in it?I gather that some atheists and fundamentalists have a problem with this movie.  Atheists can always look at it as a fantasy, no different than if it had been Pan (Chris Rock) or Odin (Gene Hackman) instead of the Christian God.  Fundamentalists should remember to judge not, lest they be judged.",Null,1,2,10 August 2003
The Sixth Sense," Pretty lame
","It's one of those movies in which several key characters would have to be stupid, or laughably inattentive, to behave the way they do, and in which the director repeatedly has to cut away from certain scenes and move hastily on, in the hope that we won't notice.  Cheap trick.  There were a couple of well-executed startles, which are always fun, and the drizzly autumnal atmosphere was just right.  Bruce Willis is his usual smirky self.  The little boy is very good.  The 'surprise' was figured out in the following order, according to the people involved: my 15-year-old-son (the movie maven in the family), right after the opening sequence; myself, about 15 minutes in; my wife, a couple of scenes before the truth comes out at the end; my 13-year-old daughter, when we explained it to her on the way out to the car.",1,6,17,6 September 1999
Final Destination," Nerve-wracking horror movie
","This movie doesn't require much thought or analysis.  There's no secret ending to guess, like The Sixth Sense.  What Final Destination does is pull you to the edge of your seat and keep you there right through to the end.  If you're looking for nerve-wracking escapist fun, with a dash of shock-comedy, you'll love this movie.  Devon Sawa is surprisingly good as a psychic highschooler trying to save the lives of his classmates by literally cheating death.  Ali Larter is perfect as an unhappy young woman who share's Sawa's vision.  (She's also a living doll.)  Definitely give this one a try.",Null,1,1,19 March 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Mumakil!
","The effects completely took it over.  The mumakil were especially well rendered, as was Grond and its attendant trolls.  Worth seeing just for the Gondor battle scenes.  As for the acting, story, plot, etc., I realize LotR is sacred and everything, but why was I on the verge of giggling half the time?  Frodo's perpetually faux-anxious facial expression?  Gimli's embarrassing quips? The way the story always seemed to join Aragorn exactly three days after he last shaved?  The dowdy matron horribly miscast as Eowyn?  (Quite believable as simpering love-puppy and snuggly maternal Hobbit-protector, but apt to have a bladder accident if required to roar 'DEATH!' at her enemies as she charges into battle.)  The grindingly tedious build-up to Faramir's almost-immolation, all for nothing?But despite all of this, you can't just wait for this movie to come out on DVD.  You have to go see it in a theater, the bigger the screen the better. What are you waiting for?",Null,1,2,29 December 2003
The Truman Show," And the point was . . .?
","What I liked about The Truman Show was the setting and the cinematography.  The production values are good, which sometimes impresses me more than it should.  At least in this case the resulting sense of realism is very satisfying.But the story seemed muddled and pointless, Truman goes through a random process of discovery, and then breaks free.  So what? Can it be possible that the message of this movie is that we watch too much TV? That many of us have trouble distinguishing entertainment from reality?  That everything in life is an illusion?  If it isn't one of these hoary platitudes, what is it?  Even when someone suggested that the movie is an updated version of the escape from the Garden of Eden, and so probably has something to do with loss of innocence, I still end up asking 'So what?'  There's a dorm-room earnestness about The Truman Show that left me cold.  You might love it.  It's definitely worth a try.The Truman Show may be like Citizen Kane, a movie that everyone knows is great but that hardly anyone asks for at the video rental store except extreme cineastes.",4,11,26,4 May 1999
The Matrix," Incredible effects
","The special effects are the best I have ever seen, and I've seen 'em all.  The concept was a little too dorm-roomy for my taste.  (Remember those earnest conversations in your sophomore year: 'What if I'm just a brain in a vat, man?  And all this is, like, being fed into my mind by a mad scientist or something?')  I loved the actress who played Trinity.  How many faces can survive such extreme close-ups? And what a surprise to learn, here on IMDb, that she was the female lead in a 1993 TV series called -- are you ready for this? -- 'Matrix'!  Deja-vu, man.",7,0,0,10 May 1999
The Cabin in the Woods," High-Tech Lovecraft
","If you've read much H.P. Lovecraft you will understand this movie. There is a race of Ancient Gods, or Great Old Ones, or whatever, lurking just underneath our perception. They are 'dead but dreaming' down there, waiting for the moment when they will be released to rule, or kill, the human race. There is a cult of humans trying to keep the Ancient Gods down, or perhaps trying to release them. Some poor soul says the wrong words and releases one of the Great Old Ones. Use your bloodiest imagination to fill in the rest. It's all rather nonsensical, but if you suspend your disbelief for a few pages you will lose sleep over it. If you are young and impressionable it might scare the crap out of you.What this movie does is to techify Lovecraft's idea and then take it further than Lovecraft himself ever took it. It's not pretty.",7,1,3,25 December 2013
The Wedding Singer," Romantic comedy short on romance but long on comedy
","This is one of three movies released in Drew Barrymore's annus mirabilis of 1998. Ever After was the best of the three, but in many ways The Wedding Singer is more significant.  In it, the 'new' Drew emerges in all her comedic glory.  There's never been anyone quite like her.  Adam Sandler is hilarious, as always, and there are many memorable minor characters and set pieces. Steve Buscemi is especially good.  But that benevolent glow that infuses the movie and moves it along despite all obstacles, comes from no one but Drew Barrymore.",7,0,1,10 July 1999
