Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Jack and Pirates have done it again!
","I have to say, this movie was amazingly the best Pirates movie in this franchise. I just came back from it and I was literally biting on my straw towards the end. The acting was good and the plot continued from where the 3rd movie had left off. I wasn't anxiously wanting to see this movie, but I did want to see it and I'm glad that I did. It seems to me that Jack Sparrow got smarter in the beginning.It began with him finding out that someone was impersonating him. In the bar scene, he finally found out who it was. It was his old love Angelica (Cruz). The last few lines at the end of last conversation between Jack and Angelica was something that I wasn't expecting to hear This movie had a lot of action in it. The final battle scene was thrilling.In my opinion, this movie did just fine without Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly. However, Johnny Depp is my favorite actor, so this movie will be horrible without him and Geoffrey Rush. Those two are my favorite pirates.So I give it a.... 10/10!!",7,2,4,21 May 2011
The Hunger Games," Good enough...
","I have read the book and these are nothing alike. But, I did enjoy it. It was good enough.The Hunger Games follows two kids from the twelfth district. They (one volunteered) were chosen to participate in some game they host every year called 'The Hunger Games'.The Hunger Games is where twelve boys and girls. One by and girl from each district. There are 24 kids in total, but only ONE can be left standing.They changed the rules to make it so both people from the same district could win towards the end, but then they changed to one. Then, they made so both kids from District 12 would win.The reason for that was Young Love.Their trainer wanted them both to win, but President Snow didn't want that to happen. He didn't like District 12 from the looks of it. he was mad that they both won.I find it interesting that the people in control of the Hunger Games kept adding more things in the arena. I find it sad that 23 kids have to die, leaving only one winner in the beginning.",7,0,8,3 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," This Movie was one of my most anxiously waited movies... and I'm glad it was worth it
","I have been waiting to see this movie for awhile and I was counting down the days until it came out. I wanted to see it the first weekend it came out and glad that I did. It had A lot, and I mean A lot, of scary scenes. If a little child wanted to see this, they should definitely have an older sibling or a parent to go with them.Both me and my dad wanted to see more of the movie. I could tell where the movie would end. It could've used more story in this part, but I still liked the movie though. I wish Nevel had been in this movie more. He only had one line though. After one part in the movie, I told my dad that I was glad that we weren't watching it in 3D. It would've been a lot more scarier in 3D. That scary part my heart jumped at was at a snake part. Talk about CREEPY!!! My favorite part was when Harry and his friends, Hermione and Ron, drank some polyjuice potion and then disguised themselves as people who worked in the Ministry of Magic. It was hilarious! So I really would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Harry Potter. And remember, if little kids want to see this movie, make sure an older person goes with them.",8,1,2,21 November 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," This is the VERY First Spiderman Comic Book.
","My did and I went to go see this yesterday and we both liked it. Although I have never heard of the lizard before this movie even came out. But, I also didn't know that Uncle Ben was going to be shot in this one either. That was a shock. I think I might have heard about Gwen Stacy. Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker's love interest before Mary Jane came along. The movie was good.The story was darker than the last three Spiderman movies earlier on in the century. But, I feel that this was better. I do hope that there will be some more movies about this Spiderman in the near future. I just hope it won't be like the past three.8/10",Null,1,4,4 July 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Just...Good
","It was just a good movie. It wasn't bad. It wasn't mediocre. It was just good, that's why I see a 7 for this movie. Why? Let's start from the beginning of the movie, with the dragon. The beginning of the movie started off excellently, where the second movie left off with the Dragon heading to Lake Town. We see the citizens of lake town fleeing for their lives as they see the Dragon. Of course, some citizens didn't make it out alive. We see Bard's children heading out with Tauriel and the dwarfs, but are worried as to where their father is. Their father was still imprisoned, but escaped by sending a rope out the window, and having the so-called king of Lake Town getting trapped, but surviving being in that rope. He climbs atop a tower and shoots arrows at Smaug. He figures out he is immune to those arrows. His son decides to do something dangerous and goes to help him. With him, he has a metal arrow. Bard shoots it and it hits the dragon in the weak spot. This is the part I find a bit over-dramatic; his death. Really? THAT'S how a dragon is going to die in this movie? REALLY?? Come on, that was just over-dramatic. He falls on top of the so-called king of Lake Town, but his death. I can't get over that enough.Other than that, there were some cheesy elements throughout. Kill trying to get Tauriel to go with them. Tauriel being banished from her home. OH! and Alfred being a big baby. HE was 'assistant' to the ruler of Lake Town??? HAH!! What a coward. The fight scenes were definitely the best part. There were also some heartfelt moments in there. The last movie has a good setup for The Lord of the Rings, I guess it just wasn't what I was really expecting.",7,2,6,20 December 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," After 10 LONG years, The Wizard has finally defeated Voldemort!
","One word: WOW!!!I saw the midnight screening (July 14) with my sister and we were quite thrilled with the movie. SPOILER: This movie was about a famous wizard named Harry Potter. He survived when Voldemort killed him. According to someone, he was known to Voldemort 'The Horcrux that Voldemort Never Meant to Create'. Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, finished looking for the Horcrux in this movie. There was only one in the Hogwarts castle. What was the most heartfelt moment of this movie was when Harry looked into the Pensieve. He took a tear from Snape and put it in the Pensieve. He learned the truth about Snape. He saw everything that happened that night when his parents were killed.Finally, Harry learned what the final Horcrux was. It was... Eh, You'll see for yourself. I really recommend this movie. This is a wonderful ending for the Harry Potter Series. J.K Rowling, you should be proud of how your Harry Potter series became very popular.Very well done!!!",10,1,3,15 July 2011
