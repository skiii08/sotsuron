The Avengers," Avengers is a team
","Avengers UnleashedThe highly anticipated movie from Joss Whedon, 'The Avengers' was released in the theater in May 2012 and the DVD release was in September 2012. I could not wait for this movie to finally be released, after watching Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America on the big screen. I would finally get to see a full team on screen, what kind of story would they do and make it work with all these different characters and cast. Robert Downey Jr. AKA. Tony Stark / Iron Man does a great job with his part, his sarcastic one liner's are great and humorous. Chris Evans AKA. Steve Rogers / Captain America does a good job, but some moments I felt were kind of flat. Mark Ruffalo AKA. Bruce Banner / The Hulk steals the movie with his interpretation of his character, he reminded me of Bill Bixby's character he played on the TV version of The Incredible Hulk. There are moments in the movie that will catch you off guard and make you laugh with The Hulk. The rest of the cast does a great job with their characters and makes the team work well together. I would still like to see some of the back stories on some of the characters. The movie started slow for me, but then gets action packed and is nonstop for the rest of the movie. The story line works well, has some good underlying messages, like Loki in Germany and wanting everyone to kneel to him. Wasn't there a leader from Germany that wanted everyone to kneel to him? How did that work out? Tony Starks realizes that his building is the power source for Loki to bring his army through a portal. Throughout the movie The Avengers have to figure out how to coexist and work with each other. In the end they get it done and now some like them and some don't.The movie is shot well and put together good, I seen the movie in 3D at the theater. It was OK but it didn't seem like most of the movie was shot in 3D. Just most of the action packed parts of the movie. I watched at home a couple of times on DVD, I liked it just as much. The CGI was done good with some good scenes, loved the flying battleship. Overall this was a great movie and would recommend it to everyone. Joss pulls it off and makes The Avenger into a great movie, can't wait to see the next one!!!!!!!!!!!!",9,1,4,12 November 2012
