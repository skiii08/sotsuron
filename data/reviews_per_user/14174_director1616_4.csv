Marie Antoinette," Sofia Coppola's Independent Style
","The 2006 version of 'Marie Antoinette' is one of the most beautiful movies to watch that has been put on screen in quite some time. But I say that in reference to the costumes, set design, and art direction. The term 'eye candy' that has been used by some of the critics and moviegoers alike is very appropriate for this film. Worldwide, there seems to be an even split among those who loved the film and those who loathed it.I saw the film for what it was: a director's independent and different vision of a real-life character whose story everyone already knows. We know what the ending for the real Marie Antoinette was. I believe that Sofia Coppola should be highly complimented for her style in telling this version of the Archduchess of Austria & Queen of France.That's not to say this film is without its problems. Though a big deal was made of Coppola's use of rock music during some scenes, it wasn't as 'horrible' as the French critics made it out to be. As a independent director myself, it is my belief that Coppola could have done a better job matching the music with the scenes with which she used them. The timing choices were a little jarring. And there aren't enough technical reasons in the world to excuse some of the obvious technical 'oversights'. I understand why half the people who saw this film had a problem with it - which is the lack of this film being story driven. The 1938 version of 'Marie Antoinette' (starring the great Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power) is much more story-driven. If I had directed this movie, I probably would have gone deeper in the mind of Kirsten Dunst's 'Marie Antoinette'. There could have been more done visually to explain why the people of France hated Marie Antoinette in the end.Having said that, I would give my right arm to be able to have access to Versailles in France. Sofia Coppola helped make the cinematography lush and gorgeous by agreeing to the pastel colors used for costumes and sets. The real 'behind-the-scenes' stars are Costume Designer Milena Canonero and Set Decorator Veronique Melery - each deserving of an Oscar nomination, at the very least.Kirsten Dunst did well as 'Marie Antoinette'. Marianne Fathfull will probably never get the recognition she deserves for her performance as the Austrian Empress, Maria Theresa. Though her scenes were short, she played the imperial Austrian icon perfectly.I liked 'Marie Antoinette', and tend to side with critics like Roger Ebert of his assessment of the film. But as historical films go, this movie is not without its critics (some of it very justified). But I praise Sofia Coppola for being courageous enough to try something different.",7,2,6,7 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Finally, a Great Swashbuckling Movie!!
","The best thing about 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is that it does THE one thing that seems to be rare in movies today - it actually tells a STORY!  It is a true-blue pirate story - full of pirates, ghosts, treasure, ships battling at sea, etc.  Johnny Depp is brilliant as Captain Jack Sparrow, playing his character with such a uniqueness and abandonment, he is unlike any character ever seen in American films.  Geoffrey Rush's performance as Captain Barbossa is in the stratosphere - he plays his pirate character with such an evil subtleness that he is extremely convincing as a pirate.  But it is the entire cast (including all the secondary quirky characters) that really makes this film.  The screenplay by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio takes the audience where every pirate movie fan wants to go.   Very impressive is the direction by Gore Verbinski, for the pacing of the film is near-perfect.  He did a wonderful job with the swordfighting scenes - for they are not as overly choreographed as we have seen in recent films, but they have a real touch of reality to every move.  The cinematography of Dariusz Wolski is first-rate, as this movie is visually wonderful to view, as the movie-going audience becomes swept-away into another world.   'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a movie for everyone.  It may not be a perfect movie, but it's a great swashbuckling movie for the movie-goer who just wants to escape.  Just the performances of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush alone are worth the price of admission.  Young girls seem happy with the addition of Orlando Bloom to the cast, then you add the very elements that pirate fans would want in a movie, you have the perfect ingredients for a wonderful time and experience at the American cinema.  Hollywood should take notice - if a good story is told (and not rely solely on special effects, CGI and/or explosions), then people WILL flock to the theater every week and attendance records would be broken every year.",9,0,1,10 July 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A Perfect Script For a Near-Perfect Movie
","'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It is my favorite film of all time, and the biggest reason for that is because of its script by William Goldman.  It's very rare in film that a script has perfect lines in it from beginning to end, but this film is an example of what can be achieved by Hollywood screenwriters. It was William Goldman's script of this movie that sparked my passion for the American cinema.  Though most Westerns of the cinema past have serious and gritty tones to them, this film has just the right mix of comedy, wit, and adventure.  The greatest team in Hollywood history, arguably, is the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford.  The presence by these two Hollywood legends has help cement this film as one of the greatest movies ever made - according to organizations like the American Film Institute.  The direction by George Roy Hill is first rate, and much credit also has to be given to cinematographer Conrad Hall, who did a great job giving this film the superior look of the Old West.    Katherine Ross adds to this film in the role as the beautiful Etta Place, as does the score, which makes us feel good about going to the movies.  This was the film that, for the first time, got audiences to root for 'the bad guys'.  This film should be shown in every film school to show film students how to make a theatrical film.  I will always love this movie, and indeed, this movie is something special.  It is also special to me because the REAL Sundance Kid was born in my hometown of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.",10,87,135,25 January 2001
Pearl Harbor," Not a Critical Masterpiece, But....
","I have just returned from seeing Pearl Harbor, and as an 'indie' filmmaker, I feel that I am qualified to critique this film from a director's point of view.  The film critics who have bashed this movie are way over the top with their criticisms.  Yes, Randall Wallace's script has more romantic cliches than a Doris Day film festival; and yes, the love story took away from what should have been more focus on Japanese preparation before the actual sneak attack; and yes, the film could have been cut down to two hours and fifteen minutes and still have been very good; but I was not offended by the sometimes dumb dialogue.  The corny lines were not as numerous as I had expected.  Making a film like Pearl Harbor in the manner that Michael Bay did can take the life and breath out of anyone who is a director.  I am sure he had plenty of help.  For that reason, I was very impressed by the look of the film.  From a cinemagraphic point of view, it was beautiful.  The battle scenes were first-rate.  For the men and women who actually went through the attack on Pearl Harbor, I applaud them for their courage of enduring that horror.  I was very impressed with the special effects.  I look for flaws in CGI's and could hardly find any.   Two actors in the film who went unheralded during the pre-movie hype should be commended for their superb performances.  Jon Voight played FDR so well, it was scary.  His short screen time made a huge impact.  The very reliable Mako, a veteran actor, did a great job as the 'hard-as-steel' Admiral Yamamoto.  Though Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett gave satisfactory performances, if they had more realistic lines to say during the love triangle scenes, their performances would have been more credible.  I understand why Randall Wallace wanted the Cuba Gooding, Jr. character in the film, but it easily could have been taken out, and it would have not affected the story.  For that matter, the love story could have been taken out and replaced by the real story of sailors trapped in a ship underwater for weeks after the attack, perishing around Christmas.  That would have made the movie more credible, then it might be worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Picture at the 2002 Academy Awards.  As it is, it will clean up the technical awards come Oscar time.   Pearl Harbor is a film that accomplishes one thing - it entertains. Could it have been better?  Sure.  But most people do not have a clue the amount of heart and soul that goes into making a Hollywood epic.  Despite the script, the man power and creativity by the people who are 'above-the-line' makes this movie worth seeing.  I guarantee you, no matter what your opinion of this film is or will be, Pearl Harbor will not be forgotten for a long time to come.",Null,0,0,26 May 2001
