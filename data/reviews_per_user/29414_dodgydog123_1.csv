The Incredible Hulk," Not a disaster, but still not everything I would like out of The Hulk.
","The movie was not a disaster at all, far from it and by myself was much anticipated, but I feel that it was still not everything I would expect from a hulk movie and just as in Ang Lee's version the action is much out-lived by the dialogue and science behind the character.Much of the problem in Ang Lee's version was the short-lived action and the mix up of the HULKS origin. All in all this film was very good and quiet fulfilling to my desires, but in future productions of our big green friend would like to see more action and less of the origin of The Hulk. Also sequels would make the hulk movies just as in the x-men and spider-man trilogy's would make the story clearer without elongating the film and causing a draggy feeling such as in Ang Lee's version.For portrayal of the hulk-7/10 Action 5/10Over-All 8/10",8,0,0,22 August 2009
