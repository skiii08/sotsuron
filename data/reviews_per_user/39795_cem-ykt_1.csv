Iron Man 3," Worst Iron Man Movie and a Failure
","If the teasers make you incredibly curious about this movie, I would say you were right. At first, when I watched the trailers I was pretty excited to go see it. However, the movie was a failure. Fight scenes were so complicated, at least in 3D, to catch up. Even the scenes were blur and you wouldn't understand who was doing what. The best fight scene was the last one where Iron Man suits were teared apart. The storyline, was also a stupid idea for Iron Man. Firemen around, what the hack seriously? Oh, girls looked pretty hot with their fire abilities, but there were only 2 of them so it is still a waste of time to watch. I think, this would be the worst to publish as Iron Man 3.",3,3,6,7 May 2013
