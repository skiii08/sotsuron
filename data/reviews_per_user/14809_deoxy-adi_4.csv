Skyfall," The best Bond till date
","And the title holds by strong means. This is indeed a view for first day and a must watch. Visually the movie is a treat in the non-CGI/special effects sense. Right from the beginning till the end the setting(s) is a fine fit. The story is quite simple straight forward and very decent but most importantly an original plot which was much needed which makes the movie (series) fresh and enjoyable. A personal story combined with power house of action is what makes this great. It is also a standalone film meaning one would understand it without seeing the previous 2 films 'Casino Royale' and 'Quantum of Solace' while being a sequel of the new Bond film franchise, making it still a good opportunity for attracting new fans.The performance by the case is brilliant. The movie continues to have a great villain and great performance by everyone else. Daniel Craig was brilliant as Bond and perhaps the best bond so far in the series 50 years history. Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw were great in their supporting roles. But the most brilliant and a true antagonist to Bond here was Javier Bardem for whom I immensely got respect for his role was immediately comparable to Heath Ledger's Joker in 'The Dark Knight' For fans of Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy, the director really meant it when he said Skyfall was inspired by 'The Dark Knight' and you will understand once you see the film. At times there bit cheesy lines but nothing that can be considered bad. Finally it serves as a great tribute to 50 years of the Bond movies franchise as it contains bits and references everywhere from the past movies. Bond fans will surely love the easter eggs. The movie ends on a great game changing scale giving the series a sort of new direction. Sam Mendes changed the traditional Bond formula and has given the best tribute to 50 years of Bond by making the best Bond movie yet.As I keep reviews minimum to no spoilers that is all you need to know. Once again the best entry in the series and a must watch",9,1,15,1 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Well made origin story, delight for comic book fans
","With that said, as the name says Amazing movie! Way better than the last trilogy, though I'd say Spiderman 2 is still the best and Sam Raimi the better director, this one stands out on its own and serves as a much better and 'true' origin story. Some parts even feels similar to the way to Batman Begins, but could have been better but great nonetheless. Very good and personal plot, good acting by the cast, Andrew Garfield was amazing, no over exaggeration in the movies you see these days and basic stunts and action sequences done very well then throwing in hopeless complex sequences just to make it look good.More of a 'teen-flick' as this is the first movie I've seen where the girl is beautiful yet clothed all the time and dry and the guy is stripped at a point :P (which makes it enjoyable for females and probably a good movie date?) but not to be mistaken as some action- romantic film as some of the trailers might suggest, this is actually a very good super hero movie, having good moments and having a good balance between comic, dark and realistic.I'd give this a vote above The Avengers on this years best movies. A delight for old comic book and spiderman fans and a must watch for all spiderman fans and for movie goers/lovers wanting to see a good film",9,4,11,29 June 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Quiet an enjoyable must see spy action film
","I had the opportunity to attend a special fan screening in my city's (Mumbai, India) IMAX theater where stars Tom Cruise, Paula Pattan and Anil Kapoor had come to promote the film. To put it down simply, the plot was almost linear and slightly above average. Well done script, but nothing ground breaking, much better than the 2nd and 3rd installments and I must say almost equal to the 1st. Visual appearance and sound were great, since being the IMAX format a decent job done. Sound was average and not much appealing. Action sequences were overall good, certain key scenes were absolutely well made, realistic, brutal and good fighting, and in between good humour being the icing in the cake. The film was fast and continuous, and less likely one might get bored over some 'filler' on screen, so that is a plus one. So concluding, a must watch which maybe enjoyed watched a couple of times due to the amazing IMAX shots.",7,67,137,5 December 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," The Legend ends but the Legacy continues!
","To start with just one word - Magnificent? Awesome? Epic? Flawless? Well in this case all of them! Nolan truly outdid himself this time, more than what he did with The Dark Knight in 2008.After being fortunate to attend a special premier screening before the rest of the world, for the entire duration of the movie I was just glued to my seat without giving a dam what was happening anywhere else. Right from the opening credits till the end, the movie was just mind blowing. They plot is simply awesome, one of the best stories ever told, and certainly for a comic book movie - a cool adaptation of the graphic novels of The Dark Knight Returns and No Man's Land and of course from the Knightfall story arc. Being a comic book fan I got blown away as the movie continued and each time the entire place went in an uproar. If you have read the comics one would love it even more, otherwise the plot is so well written with so much twists, humour at well unexpected places and great moments that anyone would be blown away. Action - now this is the other major part. As having more than an hour of IMAX shooting, the movie truly lives up to its Action and War film genres. Despite sitting for ~3 hour it felt the movie got over very soon. Such is the intensity you can hope to be totally hooked into. Acting was a class apart. Tom Hardy's Bane was indeed terrifying living up to his reputation; Gary Oldman's Gordon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Blake and Michael Cain's Alfred were very well made characters, emotional and core to the plot. Anne Hathaway made a really cool Catwoman, her screen time was full of awesome moments. And lets not forget the main Batman, Bale's BEST performance yet.Hans Zimmer also really outdid himself like Nolan in terms of the music score.So the conclusion is: 10/10The most common and sort of obvious debate will be The Dark Knight vs. The Dark Knight Rises. Well I'd say I love both the movies, but saying one 'better' than the other is not exactly right, rather I would say The Dark Knight Rises is bigger and more grand. Hope that helps. One of the best movies in decades literally. MUST watch.",10,8,17,18 July 2012
