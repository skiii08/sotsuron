Child 44," Not Bad If You Haven't Read The Book
","I saw the film first and liked it prior to reading the book. Then I read the book and the film immediately lost its appeal. Many times, if not always, the film doesn't match the drama or intensity of the book, we all know that. However, in this case they left out plot lines and changed some major events. Unforgivably, they completely changed the beginning and omitted the massive twist/reveal at the end of the novel. What is so frustrating is that they could have easily incorporated both into the film without adding more than 5 or 10 minutes to it. Very disappointing.",4,2,2,22 September 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," Flawless
","A perfect film. I've seen it many times and have never found any flaws. Excellent writing, camera work and performances from the actors. One of my few 10/10's.",10,0,2,2 July 2019
