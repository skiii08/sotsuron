The Blair Witch Project," The beast is in your head
","LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU! Heh, made you look. That's what this movie is about and no matter how much you read the backstory on the web site, nothing prepares you for the end. Better than Hitchcock; something like Ruth Rendell. It's hard to shake the after-shock.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
Alien 3," over analysed
","This third Alien movie suffers from too much critical analysis. It is every bit as good as the first two, just different. The alien in this version is the very best; it behaves like a real animal, which, I hear, it was (a dog) _and_ it runs on the ceiling. The sepia tones, dark tunnels, and unrelenting close-ups of shaved heads and craggy faces make this the most intense of the series.",Null,0,3,14 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," brings it all back
","Finally, the opening credits fit -- long, long ago in a galaxy far away, there's a place where people don't smirk or swear and and still fight for the right. I didn't think it could be done, but George Lucas did it. He took us all back to another time, when the world seemed to be okay. Thanks for the memories, George.",Null,0,0,6 July 1999
Alien: Resurrection," so disappointing
","I waited, like so many others, for this movie and was sorely disappointed. The others were all much, much better and we fans deserve the very best. Next time, we want a movie with some brains behind it. Otherwise, there shouldn't be a next time.",Null,0,0,14 February 1999
Alien," a classic monster movie
","This film still holds my complete attention, still gives me goosebumps, still makes me jump. I saw it in the theatre in 1979 and it has maintained a strange hold on me ever since. Ripley is my hero. See it again, and again, and again ...",Null,0,1,14 February 1999
Predator," Praise from a monster fan
","I love monster movies. Before good special effects, and even after them, I like monsters any way they come: hokey, scary, cheesy, blood-thirsty. Predator is the very best. When the helmet comes off, and his face is revealed ... well, it looks so real. As Arnold says, 'What the hell are you?' If you've seen the movie, you know what happens next. If you haven't, drop everything and run to the video store now.",Null,0,0,23 February 1999
Dark City," Breaking the cardinal rule
","This is one ambitious movie. The visuals are stunning, yes, but they get a little same-old same-old after the first time. The problem is the story breaks a cardinal rule of fantasy and science fiction: you have to explain why things are the way they are. Not how, just why.  I spent too much time pondering the possible explanations to pay all that much attention in the end.",Null,0,1,7 February 1999
Aliens," best sequel ever
","Who says sequels are no good? This is the heart-pumpingest, most macho, wildest ride of all the Alien movies. It's funny, scary, sexy, and touching. I watch it over, and over, and over ...",Null,0,0,14 February 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," even better than the real thing
","This is one of the longest and best of the 60s epic movies. Watching this, you are carried away to the scorching desert while you sit sipping a cool drink. The scenes you will never forget: Lawrence in his white robes, twirling around on the sand; Omar Sharif approaching a lonely well from a great distance; men swathed in dark robes crossing the Devil's Anvil. T.E. Lawrence was a nut, for sure, but we have always respected our military nuts, eh?",Null,0,1,14 February 1999
Men in Black," fin-de-siecle romp
","I liked this movie so much I bought it and I _never_ buy movies. The special effects are fabulous but that doesn't really matter because the movie pokes fun at all our late-90s foibles. And, it's such fun to watch fifty-something Tommy Lee show twenty-something Will a thing or two. The definitive movie for the end of this millennium. As Tommy Lee says, 'A person is smart; people are dumb.'",Null,0,0,22 February 1999
Titanic," Everyone's confused
","Hold on a moment, Roger Ebert and everyone else who gave this movie a high rating. The Titanic sank in 1912 with a large death toll, and over 1500 stories of bravery, cowardice, selfishness, regret, horror, nobility, and so on. Titanic is a movie about the event and, unfortunately, only a triumph for the special effects people. The script is trite, making cheap melodrama of tragedy. To see the spectacular sinking, you only need to view the last half hour or so.",Null,2,3,7 February 1999
The Matrix," Keanu is becoming typecast
","Keanu re-establishes himself as a cyberpunk in this new scifi film, and he's good. Mostly expressionless, he looks rather bewildered and reluctant to be in the adventure; he would have backed out the door if he'd had the chance. Personally, I'd prefer to be a human battery. Speaking of which, surely the computers could have figured out a way to make some nicad batteries, with all the other gadgets they figured out how to make. As science fiction goes, it's a little on the 'light' side, but fun nonetheless. However, before you decide to see this, be warned -- I also liked 'Johnny Mnemonic'",Null,0,0,1 April 1999
Born on the Fourth of July," painful memories
","I was there, and, though I was just a kid, and female, and Canadian, the Vietnam War and its related chaos were burned into my brain. This film makes the political personal: one man's story. Now I know why the war memorial in Washington D.C. moved me so much when I saw it for the first time four years ago. The battle scenes seem appropriately confusing and the rest is appropriately horrific. Thanks, Oliver Stone, for the memories, however painful.",Null,1,2,7 March 1999
