Ford v Ferrari," Enjoyable for anyone
","You don't have to care about cars in the slightest to enjoy this fast-paced story about competition. The film is expertly crafted with thrilling race sequences, but balanced out well by compelling human drama and humor. Christian Bale is excellent and followed closely by his co-star Matt Damon. The 2.5 hour runtime zooms by and keeps you wanting more. Ford v Ferrari is a wild ride and one of the most purely enjoyable films of the year.",9,1,1,8 February 2020
The King's Speech," Truly captivating
",This British period piece is a wonderfully enjoyable tale of courage in the face of adversity. It really is tremendous fun to watch even given its more serious nature at times. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush have excellent chemistry and their relationship is the heart of this film. It's hard not to feel inspired after watching this triumph of the human spirit.,9,1,1,20 March 2020
First Man," Focuses on the very real human sacrifice
","Damien Chazelle's first two films are some of the best this decade, so to say I was looking forward to his third film is an understatement. While First Man is a well-crafted and acted film, it doesn't quite measure up to his previous films and other films that tackle similar subject matter. It's a bit long and slow to start, but the family drama on display is compelling and offers an unique perspective on the effects of the space race. A somber tone is present throughout, which creates an odd atmosphere for such a tremendous achievement, but it helps sell the particular story this movie is trying to tell. The sequences in flight and space are quite gripping as well.",8,1,3,18 October 2018
Alien 3," Lacking compared to its predecessors
","Coming on the heels of two legitimate masterpieces in Alien and Aliens, Alien 3 had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, Alien 3 is a shell of its former films and lacks the suspense and action the franchise was famous for. The film is notorious for having a very troubled production with conflicts between David Fincher and the studio. I tend to lean more towards Fincher's side given the phenomenal films he has made since this one. Alien 3 doesn't have much in the way of a story, but has some okay thrills and features the reliable Sigourney Weaver in her iconic role.",7,1,2,14 March 2020
Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg works his magic with fantastic results
","Catch Me If You Can is a breezy, energetic tale about a fascinating person in the the history of American criminals. DiCaprio and Hanks are perfectly cast and Walken nearly steals the movie from them. From the beginning credits, the vibe and tone Spielberg sets is instantly enjoyable and he manages to carry it all the way through the film. While this film is tons of fun, there is also a lot of depth and emotion, a Spielberg trademark. Spielberg adds yet another very well-crafted film to his impressive filmography.",9,4,5,5 January 2020
Rocketman," Fantasy musical magic
","The marketing for this film was a tad misleading. Rocketman is much more of a musical with fantasy elements than a standard rock biopic. This was a bit jarring at first, with some sequences being a bit cheesy, however, you do get used to it as it goes along. Taron Egerton is fantastic and captures much of Elton John's presence. Plus he actually sings all of his songs, unlike Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody. He is more than deserving of an Oscar nomination. I especially enjoyed the focus on Elton himself, as opposed to just his music. You really get a sense of his struggles and difficulties. Rocketman still has a lot of typical music biopic notes, but it's creative and vibrant enough to emerge as a hit.",8,3,5,21 June 2019
A Star Is Born," An emotionally affecting ride
","The on-screen chemistry between Cooper and Gaga carries this film into the upper echelon of 2018. You can feel a genuine connection between the two stars and it makes this raw story about fame and addiction all the more compelling. The songs are terrific and Cooper's soulful direction keeps you caught up in this dramatic tale. A star truly is born in Lady Gaga as she shows she has tremendous acting chops and a commanding screen presence. This story may have been told many times before, but it still has quite a lot to say.",10,3,5,15 October 2018
Unbreakable," Unorthodox comic book film
","The slow, brooding nature of this film is wildly unique among the pantheon of comic book movies. The story is very character-driven and focused on subtle moments. There aren't action scenes every 15 minutes and it actually works in this film's favor. The twist is interesting, but doesn't detract from the everything that came before it and Unbreakable is strong enough to stand on its own without it. If you tire of action-filled spectacles in comic book movies, this gem from M. Night Shyamalan is one to watch.",8,1,1,31 January 2019
Captain Marvel," A Phase One MCU film trapped in Phase Three
","It feels like Marvel took a slight step back with this film. One of the strengths of their movies is that no matter how good the movie, the main hero is typically always well-written. Captain Marvel struggles somewhat with showcasing its main character and giving her a compelling arc, given she is essentially the same character from beginning to end. Brie Larson is fine in the role, but isn't given a ton to work with. The film is pretty standard in that it has the reliable Marvel action and humor to keep it afloat without ever taking too many risks, a la most Phase One films. Not that Phase One MCU movies are bad, and Captain Marvel certainly isn't bad, it simply comes across as being just..... fine. It's style and tone don't really help it stand out in an increasingly populated MCU and it isn't quite the prelude to Endgame I think a lot of people were hoping for. Captain Marvel is a decent entry in the Marvel canon, but it feels like it could have reached higher, further, faster.",7,4,10,14 March 2019
Us," A solid sophomore outing for Peele
","While it may be easy to compare Us to Get Out, they are two very different movies. Us is much more of a horror film than Get Out was. Both also very prominently use social commentary as a means of crafting some of their horror, however, Get Out was much more overt with it. Us uses a rather complex story to offer up great scares and tension, while also making some statements about society. Lupita Nyong'o is simply fantastic and shows her tremendous range. Where Us trips up a little is in its elaborate plot. There are quite a few holes in the story that don't make much sense and the ultimate reveal is a little far-fetched. While the story isn't quite as tight as Get Out's, Us is still based on a terrifically original concept and filmed brilliantly by Jordan Peele.",8,2,5,20 April 2019
Knives Out," A fun, modernized whodunnit
","Rian Johnson has crafted an enjoyable new spin on the murder mystery genre. With a stacked cast led by Daniel Craig and Chris Evans having loads of fun in their roles, Knives Out is very much set in today's world and updated accordingly. I liked that the story was a complex web, but not one impossible to follow if you pay attention to the various little clues throughout the movie. Even if you can guess what will happen, there are still some extra twists that can throw you for a loop. This film is terrifically entertaining and will leave you in awe of its pay off.",9,5,13,5 December 2019
The Irishman," Worth the wait
","I feel lucky to get to experience a Martin Scorsese crime epic during its release. I've always wondered what it would be like to live through one of cinema's greatest directors making his trademark genre of film. No, it isn't quite Goodfellas or Casino, but the Irishman is still a very worthwhile entry into the crime genre and it does have something meaningful to say. There is a brilliant extended sequence where you're anticipating an action to occur and for most of it you get to observe the gut-wrenching emotions on Robert DeNiro's face. Al Pacino and Joe Pesci round out the legendary acting trifecta and both bring their A-game as well.The de-aging visual effects were spotty at times, but you do sort of get used to it. Yes, the length could have been shortened, but at no time was I ever bored. The most noteworthy aspect of the film is the focus on contemplation of a life of crime and the attempt at reconciliation for said amoral actions. This is something that hasn't really been explored in previous crime films, so it was refreshing to see. It is without a doubt the standout part of this film and elevates the Irishman near the level of its Scorsese predecessors.",9,3,6,11 February 2020
The Fifth Element," Imaginative sci-fi with a comedic twist
","This is a lot goofier than you might expect a seemingly straightforward sci-fi film to be. The cheesy elements kind of work though and give the film more personality to stand out among a crowded slate of similar films. Eric Serra's unique score fits perfectly in this bizarre and wacky future. Bruce Willis is rock solid as the lead and Milla Jovovich bursts onto the Hollywood scene in stunning fashion. The oddest role by far goes to Chris Tucker, who is absolutely bonkers in this movie. The production is ultimately the real standout though, as some real imaginative and innovative designs are utilized brilliantly.",8,1,2,14 July 2019
Aquaman," Fun and entertaining take on the character
","The people behind this film knew exactly what kind of film they wanted to make, and you know what, it worked for the most part. Aquaman is a ton of fun and Jason Momoa has a blast playing the titular character. There are definitely some cheesy moments and lines, but James Wan seemed to be going for that goofy fun vibe with the film. It was a nice change of pace for this film to not be saddled by universe-building and just focus on telling the main hero's story. If WB keeps making DC films in this vein, sign me up for more.",8,1,2,27 December 2018
Molly's Game," A fascinating story
","Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut is a solid, entertaining entry from 2017. His script is full of his trademark rapid-fire dialogue and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. The voiceover can be a bit exhausting at times, but it adds a lot of context to the film. Chastain and Elba are both terrific and each get their moments to shine. The film is a tad long, but it's never dull. Molly's Game is a very interesting true story that lends itself well to cinema.",8,9,9,30 March 2020
The Adventures of Tintin," A fun, throwback adventure
","Spielberg does his best to recreate the magic he found with Raiders of the Lost Ark, and while Tintin isn't on that level, it's still a wonderfully exciting romp. The voice cast is top notch and the animation is stunning. There's not much in the way of character development, but honestly I got so swept up in the swashbuckling adventure I didn't really mind.",8,1,1,26 December 2019
Crash," Crash is not a bad film, but that doesn't mean it should've won Best Picture
","I can understand why the Academy gravitated towards this race-oriented drama. However, it picked a film that beats you over the head with the idea that racism is bad. I'm pretty sure most people watching this film already knew that. While there are some creative sequences, there are an awful lot of incredible coincidences that tie these characters together. Some of the transformations are a little far-fetched as well. The actors do a fine job for the most part, even though the father/daughter scene is pretty melodramatic. I really don't think this is a bad film and worthy of the insane amount of hate it gets, it just is a bit simplistic for a Best Picture winner in the modern era.",7,1,1,20 March 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Compelling and original
","The story makes this film such an interesting watch. It seems highly implausible and apparently is embellished quite bit from the actual story, but it definitely makes the movie better. Adam Driver is hilarious in his role and John David Washington gives an underrated performance as well. BlacKkKlansman runs a bit long, but it's definitely some hard-hitting content.",8,3,6,26 February 2019
Megamind," Mature animated superhero story
",Megamind is a great entry in a superb year for animated films. It is consistently amusing and its story is a fun spin on a classic superhero dilemma. Will Ferrell has a blast voicing the title character and brings a ton of energy to the film. All of the references to Superman mythology were wonderful as well.,8,1,1,17 May 2019
Taxi Driver," A masterclass in acting
","Robert DeNiro delivers one of the finest performances of the 70s in this raw, unfiltered look at the danger of loneliness in one the world's biggest cities. Scorsese demonstrates some of the brilliant techniques he would refine over his career and the script is near perfection. Taxi Driver is one of the great films in American cinema and a showcase for one of the best actors of his generation.",9,2,4,29 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Pure apathy
","I never thought I would be at the point where a Star Wars movie evokes virtually no emotion from me. Whether you like The Last Jedi or not, at least it conjured a strong emotional reaction. The Rise of Skywalker is a mess of a film concluding a mess of a trilogy. There is virtually no through line between these three movies. Even the stuff JJ set up in The Force Awakens is dropped and most of what Rian Johnson set up in The Last Jedi is completely ignored. There is essentially no plot or story to this film. Things just happen without reason or explanation. The worst example of this is the massive retcon of Palpatine surviving and orchestrating everything that happens in this trilogy without any explanation of how or why.It's hard to care about any of the characters because they've been developed so poorly. The climax is so unoriginal and predictable. The amount of fan service, if you can even call it that, to try to win back fans is pathetic. I genuinely don't know who this movie was made for because it sure as hell wasn't Star Wars fans.",5,9,17,22 December 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," Witty fun
","Meryl Streep is fantastic in this enjoyable fashion-filled film. Anne Hathaway holds her own, but her character's story is far less interesting than Streep's. The film comes alive when Streep is on screen. Her character, while the 'Devil' in the title, is more complex than you would think. The critique of the New York fashion scene is pretty amusing and on point as well. The plot is predictable, but The Devil Wear's Prada is ultimately quite a bit of fun.",7,1,2,14 April 2019
Léon: The Professional," A different type of hitman movie
",The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is what makes this film so interesting to watch. Both Reno and Portman play their roles perfectly and you really feel the unusual connection between the two. Add in Gary Oldman acting like a lunatic and you have yourself a very well-made film.,9,1,2,16 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," I want to break free
","I think this film will end up like it's title song and become more appreciated by critics over time. Rami Malek is staggeringly good as the iconic lead singer Freddie Mercury and the rest of the cast is spot-on. As expected, the music is fantastic (given that Queen's music is fantastic) and gives the film a grandiose feel. The highlight is without a doubt the Live Aid concert and is just really amazing to see recreated on film. Bohemian Rhapsody definitely hits the standard music biopic notes, but it's fun and engaging enough to make it unique.",8,3,4,15 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," One of the best superhero stories to hit the screen
","I've long thought that Spider-Man 2 was the gold standard for Spider-Man movies. I think it's safe to say that Into the Spider-Verse gives it a run for its money. Everything about this film, the beautiful animation, voice-acting, character development, and music are top notch. You can tell that the people behind this movie actually care about Spider-Man and care about their craft. From hilarious references to touching storytelling, this movie is just a joy to watch. It's such a unique addition to the genre and indicates that as long as talented people are involved in making these films, the superhero genre will continue to reinvent itself.",9,9,15,23 December 2018
Spirited Away," Endlessly imaginative
",This is an animated movie that can legitimately be called art. Every frame looks like a beautiful picture of images a child might dream up. The magical score adds so much as we follow Chihiro on her journey of self-discovery and maturation. This is such an original work and one that should be long remembered.,10,0,0,17 March 2020
Yesterday," More Beatles, less predictable romance
","I really loved the concept of this film. It is terrifically original and ripe for exploration. What disappointed me was how little the film actually spends delving into a world without the Beatles. Instead, we mostly get a cliched romance story about childhood friends. There still is a lot of enjoyment to find in Yesterday though. The music is great, as expected, and the humor around missing elements of the world is always humorous. I only wish the filmmakers spent more time on the band themselves.",7,1,2,19 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An unforgettable conclusion
","It's hard to put into words my feelings after seeing this film. Endgame is an epic, unpredictable, and emotional end to the most impressive long-form storytelling in cinematic history. This film is captivating for its entire 3 hour run time, with every scene and piece of dialogue carefully crafted with purpose. The payoffs and callbacks to previous moments in the MCU are amazing and reward those who have been loyal to this franchise. Avengers: Endgame absolutely surpasses the massive expectations it had and closes the book perfectly on an unprecedented saga of films.",10,3,6,27 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Never doubt Pixar
","Given the near perfect ending of Toy Story 3, I didn't want this franchise to be touched ever again. I am happy to say Pixar managed to craft a more than worthy story for this fourth film and an ending that fits just as well as a goodbye to these characters. This might be the funniest Toy Story film with hilarious jokes and gags lovingly sprinkled throughout. The new characters are all terrific and brilliantly brought to life by greats such as Key and Peele, as well as Keanu Reeves (firmly in the midst of his Keanussaince).It's hard to emphasize the amount of love and care that went into making this film. You can tell that the creators didn't want to tarnish this franchise's legacy, but instead enhance it. Toy Story 4 is funny, profound, emotionally resonant, and a perfect cap to arguably the most consistently excellent franchise in film history.",10,2,5,3 July 2019
The Favourite," Wickedly entertaining
","This is how you make period pieces fun and enjoyable. I laughed out loud multiple times and that doesn't happen often with this type of film. All of the lead female performances are great and it's hard to pinpoint just one for praise. I only wish the ending had been better. The last 15 minutes seemed a bit unnecessary and the odd ending didn't help. Other than that though, the Favourite is a humorous tale with lavish production and interesting characters.",9,5,11,4 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino lovingly showcases his passion for cinema
","This is probably his film most similar to Pulp Fiction since the 1994 classic was released. The late 60s Hollywood setting is basically a character itself as QT fills much of the runtime with references to the time period. It is a long movie, however it's easy to get sucked into this wonderful, recreated world. Leo and Brad are a terrific pairing and the rest of the cast fill their roles nicely. I can see this film being a little divisive, though you should know what you're getting with Tarantino by this point. The story does seem to meander a bit, but it all comes together and subverts expectations. The ending is classic Tarantino and is a nice feather in the cap of his love letter to cinema.",9,21,40,26 July 2019
Aladdin," Better than expected, but still lacking some of the original's heart
","Aladdin (1992) is my favorite Disney animated film, so I was very much intrigued by this remake. Thankfully, the live-action film isn't as bad as promotional material would lead you to believe. The first half of the film is great and really recaptures much of the original's magic. The Friend Like Me sequence is fantastic and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get goosebumps when A Whole New World started. They smartly avoided trying to replicate Robin Williams' iconic performance as Genie and instead let Will Smith be Will Smith, and honestly it worked.Where the film falters a bit is its second half. Jafar is pretty badly miscast. He is nowhere near as menacing as the original and it's hard to take him seriously as the villain, especially at the end. While I understand wanting to update the film for modern times, Jasmine's 'wokeness' feels terribly out of place in the film and could have been handled much better. Aladdin is a dazzling spectacle, but unfortunately can't quite match the magic of the original.",7,8,23,30 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," A poignant look at a genius' life
","It's a shame we lost both Stephen Hawking and Jóhann Jóhannsson in the past year, who both were so vital to this film. Eddie Redmayne completely disappears into the difficult role of Stephen Hawking and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor. Jóhannsson's score is beautiful and brings such a sense of wonder and tenderness to the movie. The Theory of Everything is a wonderful peer into the life of such an impactful and inspiring person.",8,1,1,6 January 2019
The Lion King," Better nature documentary than worthwhile remake
","The Lion King (2019) is a stunning visual achievement, but unfortunately that's about the only achievement of this wholly unnecessary remake. It stays very close to the original, which is both good and bad. It feels at times like they're just waiting to hit all the notes audiences expect without supplying the raw emotion the original brought. Part of this is because hand drawn animation allows more emotional expressivity than CGI. Beyoncé can no doubt sing, however her casting here feels off. Rogen and Eichner are the only ones who seemed perfectly cast and expertly stay true to their characters while adding some new material. Ultimately, The Lion King remake is a sight to behold and nostalgia-inducing, but fails to justify its own existence.",7,1,3,26 July 2019
Cars 2," Pixar's weakest effort
",This felt more like a random animation studio's film than the mighty Pixar's. Cars 2 is seriously lacking in Pixar's trademark depth and maturity. The story is pretty weak and the humor is is not really there. This is probably the lowest point in the iconic studio's filmography.,6,1,1,25 December 2019
The Game," Fincher sets the tone
","David Fincher shows early signs of his mastery of the thriller genre with this film. The tone throughout the film really creates a great atmosphere and helps keep the mystery interesting. The ending doesn't feel quite as impactful or jaw-dropping as I would have hoped for given the terrific build up to it, but it still is pretty satisfying.",8,2,2,30 November 2018
Back to the Future Part III," A fun trilogy capper
","Part III is the weakest entry in the Back to the Future trilogy, but it is still an entertaining film in its own right. It's fun to see Marty and Doc united and see the hijinks they get into. This a lighthearted, energetic romp that ends a great trilogy on a pretty high note.",8,2,2,10 March 2020
Coco," A beautiful portrait on death and remembrance
","Coco is top tier Pixar. The studio is at its best when making original films that touch on meaningful topics. This film is the studio's look at family and death as relating to a Mexican family at the time of Day of the Dead. It's enjoyable, emotional, and profound. While you may be able to see where the story is heading, there are still surprises and it doesn't lessen the impact of the heartstring-pulling journey one bit.",10,1,1,27 March 2020
1917," Deakins is just flexing at this point
","The GOAT cinematographer Roger Deakins is now just toying with us mere mortals. His latest film is one big flex, proving how a war movie can be shot to appear as one continuous shot. His photography is stunning and basically makes this movie what it is. Sam Mendes provides reliably great direction and Thomas Newman's terrific score is pulse-pounding and urgent. The unknown lead actors are excellent, as are their more famous counterparts. The main flaw of the film is the lack of substantial character development or plot. 1917 is definitely more of a technical achievement than a full-fledged masterpiece as some are claiming. However, the classic trifecta of Mendes, Deakins, and Newman continue to work their magic.",8,3,5,20 January 2020
Jerry Maguire," Still holds up
","Cameron Crowe's film about the redemption of a cynical sports agent is still able to strike the right notes as a viewer today. The evolution of the characters over the film is the most enduring and notable quality about this film. Cruise, Gooding Jr., and Zellweger are a strong trio leading the film and mostly nail their dramatic moments. It can get a bit cheesy, but for the most part, the drama still holds up.",8,3,4,13 March 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," A sci-fi masterpiece
","I had the opportunity to see this film in IMAX for its 50th Anniversary and boy am I glad I did. The special effects hold up tremendously well and it's so easy to be absorbed into the brilliant imagery on screen. The master Stanley Kubrick makes every single frame of this film into a beautiful piece of art. HAL-9000 is chilling as one of the best villains in cinematic history. While this movie doesn't give you all the answers one is accustomed to receiving in films, this is part of what makes this film so memorable and impactful. All of science fiction owes a debt to this innovative, remarkable film. 2001: A Space Odyssey truly is one of the best science fiction films ever and one of the greatest films of all time.",10,2,3,28 August 2018
Midsommar," Horror's newest nightmare
","Honestly, calling this just a horror movie is insulting. Midsommar is another brilliant genre-bending film from Ari Aster. His sophomore effort is nearly as excellent as his debut film Hereditary. Florence Pugh is outstanding and deserves awards recognition for her gut-wrenching performance. The cinematography is also some of the best I've ever seen in a film. The story about grief and belonging is expertly weaved through the disturbing events that unfold on screen.While it takes the term slow burn to a whole new extreme and doesn't have quite the final impact of Hereditary, Midsommar is a truly unsettling film which challenges cinemagoers and pushes the medium forward in exciting new ways.",9,3,9,19 July 2019
Alice in Wonderland," Visual splendor with a subpar story
","The odd decision to change so many elements from the original really hurt this live action remake. There is a serious lack of charm and the generic good vs evil kingdom story was not necessary. The acting is good for the most part, except Alice who is as dull as a rock. The visual excellence cannot be overstated though. Tim Burton knows how to fill the screen with wonderful imagery, if only he could've ironed out a better story.",6,1,1,15 March 2020
There's Something About Mary," Not quite worthy of its classic status, but still a memorable comedy
","My expectations were pretty high for this film given the cult-like status it maintains in pop culture. While I don't think it quite deserves such praise, it's still a solid comedy from the 90s. There are quite a few memorable scenes and moments that have definitely had staying power in culture, but ultimately the story isn't quite as legendary.",7,2,4,26 May 2019
Joker," Chilling to the core
","Joker is a film that will leave you speechless. From the twisted origin of one of pop culture's iconic villains to Joaquin Phoenix's transcendent performance as the title character, Joker will surprise you time and again. The arthouse-vibe works to perfection in telling the the story of a man who is abandoned by society and has nothing left to lose. As of the film's release, the Best Actor Oscar is Phoenix's to lose. He is phenomenal and the centerpiece of this fantastic social commentary that elevates the comic book genre to greater heights.",9,2,4,4 October 2019
Con Air," Ridiculous fun
","Honestly, the main reason to watch this movie is Nic Cage's glorious hair and southern accent. This isn't a great movie, but man is it entertaining. It's basically one over-the-top scene after another and explosions galore. Con Air is never boring, so I would recommend it to anyone wanting a decent diversion for two hours.",7,1,1,10 July 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," A decent ride
","This was a reasonably enjoyable film with a great, quirky performance from Kenneth Branagh. The killer became apparent about halfway through the film after paying attention to little details in the dialogue with the inspector. The cast is quite good, however most of them aren't given enough to do. I loved the production design and unique filming styles used throughout. The climax was a bit disappointing given the solid build-up, with it sort of fizzling out near the end. I look forward to the sequel with Poirot though.",7,2,5,26 August 2018
Parasite," The film of the year
","The less you know about this movie heading in, the better. Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly. This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary. Bong Joon Ho's vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience.This isn't a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists, and therein lies the beauty of Parasite. It's just murky enough to provide some true thought-provoking imagery and storytelling. Don't let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece.",10,11,16,6 February 2020
Rango," Positively charming
","Jack Sparrow as a chameleon is a good way to describe the titular character. Naturally voiced by Johnny Depp, Rango is an endearing little lizard who shines in this terrific movie. This is a very adult animated film and is geared more towards older viewers, which I appreciated. There are loads of references to classic westerns and one Clint Eastwood tribute that is particularly great. Hans Zimmer conjures up a terrific score reminiscent of the legendary Ennio Morricone and the animation is visually appealing. Rango is a lot of fun and stands out as a unique entry in the animated genre.",8,1,1,28 October 2019
Halloween," Set the slasher standard
","Halloween basically layed out the template for the modern slasher film and there's a reason for that. It's incredibly suspenseful, has a killer score, and a memorable villain. This is a true classic in the horror genre.",9,5,6,9 November 2018
Marriage Story," A painfully real look at divorce
","Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson give everything they have in telling the story of how the dissolution of a marriage can have such profound, unintended effects on a family. This movie focuses on depicting how it's not always someone's fault for getting a divorce. You can understand both characters' point of view and how you can still love someone, but not want to be with them. The cast is stellar and Johansson gives probably the best performance of her career. Baumbach excels at focusing on the little moments that play out in a divorce that ultimately can impact a family more than the big ones. Marriage Story is heart-wrenching, but one of the best acted films of the year and a true must watch. Just make sure you bring tissues.",9,7,11,31 December 2019
Raging Bull," Hard-hitting in its brutality
","Martin Scorsese tends to have a masterpiece every decade and for the 80s, it's Raging Bull. Scorsese crafts some of the most iconic shots and sequences ever put to film in this epic boxing drama. The style of the film is wholly unique and still has not been topped. Robert DeNiro gives another one of the best performances of the century and completely becomes the tragic Jake LaMotta. His story is fascinating, yet difficult to watch. Raging Bull is an all-time classic and one you shouldn't miss.",10,3,3,21 January 2020
Creed II," The best sequel in the franchise
","A stunning sequel to one of the best films of 2015. Michael B. Jordan is given more of the spotlight, while Sly fades into even more of a supporting role. Jordan is simply fantastic and brings such raw emotion to lift this eighth film in the franchise to nearly the peak of the first Creed movie. The Rocky formula is pretty refined by this point, but man does it still pack a punch. Even with how much fighting is in the film, there are still so many great character moments that really elevate this sequel. One of the most surprising aspects for me is how sympathetic the Dragos ended up being. This was a great experience and if more sequels can hit like this, I'm all for continuing this storied saga.",8,1,3,27 November 2018
Jojo Rabbit," It's a satire, not Schindler's List
","People expecting a hard-hitting takedown of the Third Reich are looking in the wrong place. This is meant to be an amusing satire poking fun at the ridiculous nature of Nazi Germany while also providing some heartfelt and meaningful messages. Jojo Rabbit gets serious when it needs to, but the war is seen through the eyes of a 10 year old, thus it views the war with that sentiment. In addition to writing and directing, Taika Watiti's boldest move with this film is playing an imaginary Adolf Hitler, with hilarious results. I appreciate that Jojo Rabbit is not afraid to push the envelope and that in spite of its subject matter, it will leave you feeling hopeful and with a smile on your face.",9,7,15,1 December 2019
Godzilla," Slow burn to a fault
","Gareth Edwards' version of Godzilla is known for taking the unique approach of waiting long into the movie until showing the titular monster and then showing very little of him the rest of the film. It's bold and different, but ultimately it doesn't result in an appealing showcase for the character we all want to see. I don't really care about the uninteresting human characters that take up most of the screen time, I want to see GODZILLA.",6,1,2,6 June 2019
50_50," Good balance of humor and drama
","50/50 walks a fine line in being comedy about a man in his 20s getting cancer, but it manages to find the sweet spot in finding genuine laughs amidst such a depressing story. Gordon-Levitt is terrific and Rogen and Kendrick work well in their supporting roles. It doesn't surprise you too much, but it is very effective in its telling of an inspiring and worthwhile story.",8,1,1,27 December 2019
Green Book," A must-see film that confronts real issues
","Green Book isn't terribly subtle in its message, but boy is it effective. Two strong leading performances anchor the central relationship that makes this film so compelling. This film is all about understanding the situations and circumstances that others deal with. One can never truly understand another's experiences and Green Book acknowledges that, but you can try and ultimately you can have respect for each other. Watching the journey of both characters learning this is why this film is such a crowd-pleaser and one of the best films of the year.",9,5,11,22 December 2018
Annihilation," Ambitious sci-fi
","Carried by a haunting score, Annihilation puts forth thought-provoking ideas amidst a mysterious atmosphere. The themes explored in this film are rather interesting and are brought to life with brilliant visuals. Alex Garland clearly has a knack for this genre and I cannot wait to see more of his films.",8,3,5,17 January 2019
Her," A beautiful meditation on modern relationships
","This is the type of cinema that pushes the medium forward in innovative ways. Spike Jonze really outdid himself with this brilliant look at what a relationship means and what it can be. Joaquin Phoenix is superb as expected and Scarlett Johansson's voice is truly a character unto itself. The use of colors, music, and such an original screenplay make Her a must-watch for any cinephile.",9,1,1,24 February 2020
The Fighter," Knockout performances
","The Fighter has the makings of a conventional sports story, but is elevated significantly by truly powerhouse performances. Wahlberg is terrific in his subtlety, and Adams and Leo both play terrifically off of the male leads. The true star though is Christian Bale, who goes full method and completely embodies his character. These efforts lift this traditional boxing story to near sports classic status.",9,1,1,17 June 2019
The Godfather," Simply the best
",This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.,10,14,16,9 March 2019
