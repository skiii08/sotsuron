Scarface," An epic rags-to-riches story
","There are hundreds of movies out there that tell stories about going from poor to wealthy, but none of them can match Scarface. Scarface tells the story of Tony Montana, a Cuban criminal and a refugee who arrives in Miami without a dime in his pocket, and ends up being the biggest coke dealer and the richest criminal in Florida. What makes Tony so amazing? His character, determination, attitude, courage, devotion and craziness. Tony Montana is a unique character who rises to top using his brains and 'balls'. With awesome performances from Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer and Brian De Palma's directorial abilities and powers, you get an amazing movie that should never have a remake, as its unique, thrilling and crazy.",10,2,4,17 January 2016
Goodfellas," A classic unique gangster flick
","This movie is probably one of the greatest gangster movies that ever existed. But what more can you expect from the legendary Martin Scorsese? Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill, a rebellious kid who dreams of becoming a respected gangster, fascinated by the glorious mafia lifestyle. In his early teens, his dream comes true and he joins the mafia. The film depicts Henry's life in the mafia and all of its ups and downs. Feared Jimmy Conway and psychopathic Tommy DeVito are Henry's friends and allies throughout the film which eventually ends with deceit, betrayal and death. Goodfellas is a movie that I definitely recommend to everyone to watch it. Tip: Before watching the film, read the book ''Wiseguy'' by Nicholas Pileggi.",9,0,1,17 January 2016
