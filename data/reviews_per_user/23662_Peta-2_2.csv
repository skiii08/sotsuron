Alien 3," Scary as hell and this time they have no WEAPONS !!!!
","You know it must be a good film when sad men with no friends don't like it. They bang on about how good 'Aliens' is because they worship Ripley as a super hero and get off on all the guns and sophisticated machinery.  This film is 'Aliens'' opposite.  Ripley is both brave and cowardly, the way all humans are.  She is not super human, but humanness itself is what defeats the alien this time.I could go on all day about the finer sides of 'Alien3' but it would be better if you just watched if for yourself.  Don't be put off by the sad guys who need to stop living in their mum's house and get a life.  They don't realise what a brilliant film this really is.",Null,2,3,23 November 1998
Alien: Resurrection," Ace film with homoerotic subplot
","'Alien Resurrection' takes all the best bits from the other three films and yet creates something quite different.  It has a great storyline, lots of action, and really good quality aliens.  Ripley is back but she's not the same.  Apart from being a bit of an animal, she also has the hots for her feisty friend Call, and who wouldn't, quite frankly !  Between the sharp one liners and the buckets of alien slime a story of lesbian lust is unfolded that finally, after all these years, is what half the 'Alien' series' fans have been waiting for.  Watch this film and weep, boys, 'cos Ripley has finally found Ms Right !",Null,0,1,23 November 1998
