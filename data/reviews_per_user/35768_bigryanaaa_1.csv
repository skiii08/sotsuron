Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Good time that beats up the original (in slow motion)
","I want to start off by explaining why I only gave this movie a 7. I enjoyed it thoroughly and laughed out loud several times (much more than I did the first Sherlock Holmes movie). That being said, there were a few scenes that seem unnecessary are somewhat drawn out. These are the type when you hear the audience let out an audible yawn. I won't give them away, but you will see what I mean if you watch the movie. However, this does not make the movie un-enjoyable, just be aware that it is fairly long and there are parts when you will feel the length.After saying all that, I must give it the credit it deserves as well. The movie is clever and entertaining. You will laugh at several parts if you have a sense of humor. I'm happy I watched it in the theater and I left feeling that the ending was appropriate and gave me the emotional payoff I craved. Robert Downey does an exceptional job and really carries the movie the majority of the time. Watch it, enjoy it, but be prepared for a long ride.",7,0,9,16 December 2011
