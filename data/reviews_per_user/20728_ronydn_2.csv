The Avengers," The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron Man) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America).
","Before the Avengers assembled we've had 2 Iron Man, 2 Hulk, 1 Thor & 1 Captain America movies. Black Widow was seen in Iron Man 2 and Hawk Eye makes a first time appearance in this one. If you do the math it is pretty clear that to get The Avengers right the director has to get Hulk and Iron Man right. Iron Man is safe in the good command of Robert Downey Jr. but Hulk was the only character that never peaked in spite of two actors (Eric Bana & Edward Norton) trying to nail it in two different movies. For me the biggest triumph of The Avengers is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. He is the best Hulk yet.Whats it about? For those who have not followed the series, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) lands up on earth searching for a cube that will help him rule the earth. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has to stop him so he assembles Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Rufalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson), Hawk Eye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Steve Rogers) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to stop Loki. How is it? Paisa vasool entertainment.My Take Like I mentioned above Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk is the bestest part of the movie. You have to be patient enough for The Hulk to appear. His entry is almost after an hour but Mark Ruffalo prepares the perfect build up as Bruce Banner with his restrained and almost vulnerable portrayal of a character struggling with his condition. The second best thing is the humor. Joss Whedon gives all the characters some really witty lines to deliver. Since most part is about the Avengers coming together the humor helps in keeping the audience engaged especially those who are not well versed with the back stories of each individual superhero. Out of the all the superheroes I was only interested in Robert Downey Jr and Mark Rufalo. The rest were great supporting actors at their best. The icing on the cake is the last 30 mins when the film peaks as a special effects loaded summer blockbuster movie. If you look at director Joss Whedons filmography you'll wonder what made the studios trust him with a rumored 220 million dollar budget film. Now, that is the story I am very interested in knowing! He is the only guy I know who has taken a giant leap from T.V to the big screen. Word of mouth The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron Man) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America). Rating - **** (Very Good) Ticket Meter Worth any amount of moneyP.S. If you have it playing in an Imax theatre drop everything and make an effort to watch it there. The fun just multiplies with the Imax experience.",8,1,4,28 April 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," And in the 3rd film he (Nolan) rose again.
","Is it better than The Dark Knight? Does Bane live up to the Joker act? Is it a fitting finale to the trilogy?The biggest conflict in The Dark Knight Rises is not on the screen but in your head. I had thought I would not compare this to the TDK but I failed. If you can manage to shut the above mentioned thoughts out of your head while watching TDKR you have another career option as an art of living instructor.I am sure if you have seen Batman Begins and The Dark Knight you don't need this review to tell you why you must watch The Dark Knight Rises but I re visited BB last night before writing this and I suggest you either watch BB before watching TDKR or at least after watching it.A lot of what happens in this film joins the dots left open in BB so that way this is a highly satisfying 3rd act to the trilogy.There are enough spectacles in store to pump up your adrenaline. Yet again like the previous two films it is filled with dialogues that deserve to go up on a poster and adorn your walls as a work of art. One of lifes lessons I learnt in this one is Jump without the rope to R.I.S.E or what Bane says Nobody cared who I was, until I put on the mask. One of the big reasons I enjoy my repeated viewings of Nolans batman series are the dialogues and this one doesn't disappoint on that front. Jonathan Nolan is the unsung hero who needs to be the poster boy for writers. Watching it with subtitles makes the viewing even more absorbing and enriching.If TDK was about the evil and Heath Ledger who owned the role of The Joker putting Batman in a corner, this is all about the hero. Bane doesn't impress much and the limitations of that Mask works as a handicap for Tom Hardy to rise above the character. But he still is a fitting adversary to Batman using his beefed up body to invoke fear . I experienced it in Imax and you would need a very good reason to not see it in Imax if you have the option of doing so. Hans Zimmers background score will never sound the same in a normal theatre. Just for his work TDKR has to be experienced in Imax at least once.I would end this with my answers to the three questions I asked in the beginning. 1.No 2.No 3.Yes. Would love to know whats yours?Final few words And in the 3rd film he (Nolan) rose again.Rating - **** (Very Good)Ticket Worth 500 bucks",8,1,2,21 July 2012
