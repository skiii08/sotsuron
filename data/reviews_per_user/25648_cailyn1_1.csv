The Equalizer," Ridiculously Unbelievable Action Flick
","I rented this title based solely on Denzel Washington's presence. He's a great actor and I have loved almost every role he's played from Training Day to the Pelican Brief. This movie was a turd almost from the beginning: the killing of five Russian mobsters over a girl he barely knows. Not saying they might not have deserved it but this disconnect runs through the movie. Wanton killing without ever developing a believable motivation. The ending is so over the top, I had to run home and watch the last Die Hard installment to wash the awfulness of this movie out of my mouth. The final killings in Russia were sheer crap. So ridiculous, so over the top, I was left wondering how Denzel ever agreed to a role in this slag heap. 4/10 is WAY generous.",4,6,10,10 March 2015
