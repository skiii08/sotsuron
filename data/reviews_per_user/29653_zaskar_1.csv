Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," AWESOME!!! Remember people, this is #1 of 6, its not meant to be as fast building as the others.
","Ok, lets get one thing straight.  This is 1 of 6, the beginning of the story.  EVERY story has a beginning, middle, and an end.  In there is also a CLIMAX, if these terms are foreign to you, you have no business rating this movie.  The Climax of the movie as around 3 or 4, we have already seen 4. I'm not saying you have to like it.  But some of these comments that say 'there are no strong characters'  When was the last time you saw a movie that had a strong character buildup in the first 10 minutes, which is what this movie is.  'Anakin was annoying'  Youre just jealous youre not in the movie.  'It was boring, so slow, it didn't go anywhere'  Where do you want it to go?  You know the ending, YOU try to tell a story after someone has told the outcome, that is what Lucas had to do, give the man a break.  Ok, Jar Jar could be annoying, Second time I saw the movie, he grew on me. 'The Jedi's had no commanding role's'  This comment comes from people who are expecting action from 'The Terminator' do I need to remind you people that Jedi's are mainly priests???  They are calm and content until the time is needed, then they kick butt.  . I give this movie a very strong 10",10,0,0,7 June 1999
