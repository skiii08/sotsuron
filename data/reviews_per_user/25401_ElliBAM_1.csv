The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Heroes. Just for one day.
","This film shows perfectly, what it is like to survive from one point of view. There are billions of stories, but this shows one of a billion, It connects with an audience more mature than their years through emotional experience. It is poetic and tremendously acted. I can't find many more words to express how incredible this film is, and how important. From structure to soundtrack, casting to shot structure. I could not recommend this more.",10,2,3,28 December 2017
