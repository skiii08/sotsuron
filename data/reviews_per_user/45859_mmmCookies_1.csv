Requiem for a Dream," A masterpiece of modern film making!!
","This movie has captured my attention since I first saw it last summer. Darren Aronofsky does an absolutely superb job at everything from the excellent camera angles to the editing. Yes, there are holes in the movie that some people have pointed out. But you can do that with any movie if you sit and disect it long enough. Aronofsky gets his point across in the movie and he does an excellent job at that.",Null,0,0,3 December 2002
