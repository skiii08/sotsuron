The Rock," Like its title, the film is to the point, substantial and does not crack under scrutiny!
","THE ROCK and CRIMSON TIDE are arguably Bruckheimer's two mini-masterpieces. (CON AIR was just too over-the-top!) The film is given an extra boost by the presence of Sean Connery, who even in his late sixties would STILL make the quintessential Bond (are you listening Sean?)As John Mason, a wrongfully imprisoned British Agent who simply knew too much, his services are required now to assist a bunch of Navy Seals break IN to Alcatraz where former war hero, purple heart and majorly p***ed off General Hummel, is threatening to eradicate a few million San Franciscans if his demands to have Uncle Sam pay the families of his men killed in action are not met. (Not often you come across an honorable extortionist!) Mason's expertise being that he remains the ONLY person to have EVER successfully escaped from The Rock!
Cage too is out of his tree as Dr Stanley Goodspeed, a chemical engineer dragged along for the ride, his job being to neutralise some extremely unpleasant biological weaponry Hummel plans on lobbing downtown. He and Connery work together a treat - you will rarely see two actors spark off each other so charismatically.Even with stalwart commando, Michael Biehn's gung-ho contribution, it remains totally Sean Connery's film who acts everyone off the screen. Even his one face-to-face with Ed Harris as Hummel, yields up perhaps the best and most appropriate line of the movie. David Morse is excellent as Hummel's 2IC and Tony Todd ('Candyman') plays a mercenary just on hand for the big payday! The action is relentless and coupled with a literate script and top of the line production values (except maybe for the curiously unrealistic low-level bombing raid at the end) this is the ultimate action/feelgood flick. No one on their right mind could walk out of this film claiming they were bored. Easily the benchmark by which other action flicks will be measured. Take Connery out of the equation though, it would simply have been a 'good film.'",Null,1,1,25 November 2001
The Blair Witch Project," The 'Duh, What Project?'
","Like Tin Man, I have been involved in writing film reviews for many years and have had my fair share of exposure to just about anything you care to mention from BIRTH OF A NATION to JASON X and I'm here to tell you, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is the greatest 'Emperor's new clothes' routine ever foisted on the cinema-going public. Personally I really get-off on horror flicks, good bad or indifferent, and have watched pretty much every bloodletter made! (Still trying to figure out what was actually WORSE than I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER?) Whom-soever was 'scared' by this, has serious issues to deal with. Either that, or a rampantly manipulable imagination, one can only assume is totally at the mercy of repressed childish fantasy. My GOD - WHAT was scary? nothing happened! Its very amateurishness, far from compounding a fear-factor (though so many were taken in by critics worldwide SUGGESTING this be the case) served only to promote the 'home-movie' status of the finished 'product'...and I use the term loosely!Now I agree, knowing the fact that other horror flicks are actors, retracting knife blades, latex injuries and half empty bottles of ketchup, interacting before a camera, FOR THE MOST part renders the shudder content (for any thinking person at least) to negative levels. So what's different here? Ok, you got no color, no ketchup...a LOT of trees and no-one can act! (Don't be fooled by Heather's 'natural' funk)....worse still that irritating as hell 'hand-held camera' and interminable shots of the ground (yeah that WAS scary huh?)Where have you guys crossed over from reality to fantasy? It wasn't the film's brilliance, it was your exploited vulnerability!You want 'SCARY?'  watch THE INNOCENTS (1961). That and CANDYMAN (The original), perhaps even COMMUNION (1976). That is the SUM of 'scary' I have found in seventy odd years of horror. (You could add that one 'jolt' scene in EXORCIST III) Loved the end too...'Aaaarghhhhhhhh'   Cheapest climactic effect in history! Maybe Sanchez should consider AAAARGHHHHHHH 2? For all its contrived, low budget amateurishness - I preferred BLAIR WITCH 2..not a half-decent concept in there if you think about it! What am I saying?  I preferred PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE! Now, thats SURE to rub a fair bit of fur up the wrong way...might have to keep an eye out for some 'sinister' little twig-men hanging off my porch!",1,2,4,24 November 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Master film-making!
","Kill Bill: Vol 2 is a whole new ball-game.  Whether you assess the film by virtue of its incisive dialog, its brilliant direction, acting par excellance or simply its `appeal,' there is but one factor - Tarantino. QT is to cinematic originality what Kubrick brought to deep space, and beyond the infinite!A lifetime of forgettable movies excepting BOUND FOR GLORY and arguably Scorcese's BOXCAR BERTHA, is erased for Carradine overnight thanks to Tarantino.  As Bill, Carradine has handed in his greatest performance to date.that is to say, QT drew it out of him. The `Old Grasshopper' conveys charm, menace.all the wordly acoutrements his profession would have brought to him. Playing the reed flute that he carved himself from a bamboo plantaton he actually set-up while still making Kung-Fu episodes, Carradine's first appearance outside the small church in El Paso set the scene for the entire movie. He commands our attention from that moment on. His last line, `How do I look?' was delivered with such believable sincerity and  emotive sadness, it closed a chapter in Beatrix's and the viewer's recent experiences with remarkably good taste. The smallest part in this movie, from Samuel Jackson's cameo thru Bo Svenson's preacher to Michael Parks' gifted little turn as the crafty old Esteban is just flawless acting of the highest calibre.QT 'regular'  Madsen also scores with arguably his best portrayal in years as the alkified retired gang-member Budd (aka Sidewinder). He really looked the sad dead-beat that he had become.The flashback sequences are never overlong, out of place or anything but chronologically correct. Everything from Volume 1 is explained. Beatrix's Kung-Fu training sequences with Master Pai Mai might be considered by many, the high point of the film. Certainly Tarantino's love of old Samurai flicks is evidenced throughout, especially in the brief but beautiful silhouette-shots of Master and pupil training. Nice touch too towards the end (I don't wish to give anything away here) where `X' and `Y' are watching SHOGUN ASSASSIN.The final twenty minutes of the movie fully justify the term `awesome.' At the point Beatrix finally confronts Bill, no-one in the audience would be expecting to see what they do. All I will say is that the `little girl' involved is the most appealing and touchingly innocent little thing I have ever seen in a film.  It was a master-stroke of casting, scripting and cinematography. A lot more I would like to say but cannot, without ruining the film for any future viewers.In my opinion, no film ever made betters this!",Null,119,193,23 April 2004
Alien 3," 'Is that all you got? is that all you can fight for sucker?'
","That one line alone, uttered by Dillon near the climax of the film blows ALIEN RESURRECTION out of the water.Greatly underestimated and misunderstood film (even by me intitally). The problem with ALIEN 3 is that it IS so different from the first two movies, not worse....just different!  Dark, sombre, even gothic. It places Ripley in a prison colony on an isolated planet at the ass-end of the universe, her ship having crash-landed following its long journey at the conclusion of ALIENS.Audiences were understandably ill at ease from the outset, having Corporal Hicks, the Bishop Droid and little Newt killed off before the film even got going, but Ripley's performance is the key to the movie here. She is an awesome figure of resolve and stoic bravery.  The plethora of English accents didn't help either (it WAS a British production, backed by Murdoch's NEWS Limited corporation). Extremely good script, just talky and with few action sequences. Problem was that following Cameron's huge adrenalin-rush with ALIENS, audiences were expecting more of the same and it wasn't to be. Many were disappointed also that there was only one alien, as in the original.Charles Dance as the colony's doctor and Charles Dutton as the prisoner's leader and unofficial spokesman ('You're all gonna die, the question is - do you want it on your knees or on your bellies?') are superb. Many top characterizations littered throughout the movie. Picks up the pace towards the end and the 'herding' of the alien into the leadworks is excellent.Few movies have ended with such poignancy, emotional resolve and beautifully choreographed deliberation. Absolutely great musical score here too. If you WERE one of those bitterly disappointed by ALIEN 3, give it another go. With a different mind-set you may see it differently, after all, ALIENS was totally left field of the original. The three are a great trilogy. ALIEN RESURRECTION was simply an aberration....forget it, don't even THINK about watching it! It doesn't BELONG!I once gave Alien 3 a rating of 5/10. I was wrong, it is a 7.5!",Null,11,22,15 November 2001
Gremlins," The ultimate feel-good family movie!
","This is the ONLY film I have come across in the IMDb that does not appear to have attracted a bad or negative comment. 98% of reviewers were obviously captivated by it. I am not about to change that, I believe GREMLINS was probably the most innovative and lovable fantasy ever conceived. Without doubt, Gizmo was the cutest and most lovable 'creature' ever put up on the big screen and as one reviewer correctly pointed out, not a child on this planet in 1984 didn't want 'Gizmo' for Christmas (I had to buy 3)There were those who saw 'Stripe' as way over-the-top violent and this was an arguably justifiable complaint in some circles, but hey, this was predominantly a comedy and the gremlins played it for fun rather than horror. Gizmo of course retained his Disneyesque appeal throughout the movie watching as his compatriots tore the neighborhood apart. Yes, the cinema sequence was a classic and both this and the less-successful sequel worked at an adult level too - just listen to some of the black humor that would sail well over the heads of the younger viewer.A multi layered, almost unclassifiable masterpiece of entertainment and Phoebe Cates?  damn, that girl does something for me! The daughter, girlfriend, schoolfriend...everyone wants!",Null,0,2,14 June 2002
The Sound of Music," A one-off that can never happen again.
","So many things came together in this film whether by fate or intent, that it transcends now even its own legend. It is the ultimate feel-good movie with at its core, decency, beauty, youth, dignity, happiness, femininity, love, unshakeable family values and a childlike quality wherein there is no place for corruption or evil. Its complete moral integrity brings tears to so many people realising where we are all going so wrong!THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a reaffirmation of all the goodness which exists inside the human condition. The perfect family, perfect father, perfect children and in an impossibly idyllic setting (well putting aside the NAZIS who were never a chance anyway) Like Peter Pan, they can never grow up, Liesl is every father's most beautiful young daughter on the threshhold of adulthood and to whom romance is that most magical of experiences. Even today, and probably because I have beautiful daughters about her age, her radiance and innocence brings tears to my eyes. If only they could stay forever as Liesl has!Another reason for the film's staggering universal appeal is that it remains the ONLY musical that offered such simple, but enduring and well loved songs. There isn't a loser amongst them! Kindly name another film that can make this claim? If every film in the world was by necessity destroyed, leaving only one, I would hope it would be THE SOUND OF MUSIC. A reminder to future generations of the potential for beauty that we all have, but rarely acknowledge, inside of us!",Null,0,5,7 April 2002
The Ring," Valiant attempt at cutting-edge horror but let down on a few fronts.
","God, now they're looking to remake films within four years of release! Well, if nothing else, THE RING has generated polarised opinion. Is it or isn't it better than Japan's RINGU (1998)?  My opinion is that its pretty line-ball. For 4/5 of the movie the American version has arguably the edge, but production values and a dodgy last 10 minutes detract.Many images from THE RING are just superb. As creepy and as disturbing as anything I've seen since THE INNOCENTS. Clever SCREAM type opening which broadens into an intelligent and articulate tale of distinct horror. Aussie Watts turns in a blinder of a performance that leaves Kidman's turn in THE OTHERS a work of almost mediocrity. The film follows the Japanese version very closely, diverging principally with the central players and the plot-line variance. There is nothing to be gained re-hashing the story, any interested party will be aware of it.Certain aspects to the film are quite memorable. The cinematography for one. This is is a class of its own. The scenes with the horse aboard the ferry are as striking as they are horrific. The unfolding of the mystery is where THE RING becomes unhinged. Having been far to manipulative and clever for its own good, the makers were only ever left with a narrow window of credibility and backed into a corner the thing doesn't gel, with far too many unanswered questions and riddles. The greatest horror was in what you DIDN'T see...thus when poor old Noah finds himself watching the absolute last film he ever needed to see, the audience is suddenly handed a total rip-off of Dario Argento's DEMONS which wrecks both continuity and credibility. As many have pointed out also, the incessant appearance of the boom-mike is just inexcusable in a film of this quality and totally wrecks the tension and mood.Many were the good things to be had but 7.9 is an insane rating with regard to many other classics of film I could name that have rated far less in the IMDb. 6.8 perhaps!   I would be lying if I said that I did not enjoy this film..it COULD have been one of the best horror/psychological films of the past 30 years. As it stands though, SIGNS and even THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES were better.",Null,0,2,15 November 2002
Minority Report," 'You have the right to remain amazed. You will not need an attorney because you are guilty. If you have anything to say, it is pointless. Book him Thommo!'
","This you should know, is NOT a film sits up there on the big screen saying 'Hey guys, ain't this future stuff fun? Lets rock!' It is NOT a 'surface film' and requires the audience, at least the intelligent ones, to work WITH it. This will be howled down by the masses, but MINORITY REPORT shares much with VANILLA SKY. Aside from Tom Cruise wondering what the hell and WHY, things are happening to him for large chunks of the movie, there is the grotesque facial change once more, reliance on a third party for clarification of events and flashbacks that gradually fall into place.
As an interpretation - maybe 'adaptation' would be more appropriate,  of Philip K Dick's short story of the 50's, it is more than reasonable. That is not to say however it does not have its faults. Personally I found the fx straight-up laughable. The panoramic look of the future city with the retro-looking auto's performing their wall-climbing routines, the anti-gridlock 'continuous' super-highways and the LOST IN SPACE Police choppers were disappointingly Z-Grade and at no stage dovetailed with the remarkably unchanged-looking suburban areas. The Cruise-escape sequence where he performs his aeriel ballet, musical car games and wall and ceiling demolition was juvenile Spiderman/superhero stuff and had no place in the movie. It simply cheapened the whole affair. What held the thing together was the performance of Cruise as the cop heading up the experimental 'Department of Pre-crime'  At this juncture I'd have to say there might just be the teeniest problem arresting and charging someone with a crime they have yet to commit simply on account of three 'pre-cogs' belief that they WILL do it  A first year law student would have them out before they'd rung home to say they'll be late for dinner! The script was excellent, the interiors of the Pre-Crime center suitably futuristic, although the film's grayed-out look, not far off black and white for much of the time was not so much depressing as uninteresting. Product placement was just wicked, though how many of those tricked-up Lexus's would they sell if they had them? Gotta say, I loved the spider eye-scanners. They WERE good! Anyone notice the extreme similarity between Cruise on the run here and Gary Sinise faring nor much better in the other Philip K Dick story doing the movie-house rounds currently, the sadly underperforming IMPOSTER? The sublime impression left to me by this film however was just how awesomely brilliant BLADE RUNNER was. That WAS the future. This is Spielberg's 'I know I'm as good as Ridley Scott' interpretation.  He isn't! (least, not with the future!)Really worth seeing, overlong, absolutely insane 'happy families' ET type last scene, uneven and in the upshot a flawed winner! Go figure!",Null,0,0,21 June 2002
Training Day," Denzel turns to the dark side!
","I really get off on the regular crop of intellectually aloof and simpering movie jocks that figure they have a handle on just about every flick comes out. Why I wonder, given their obvious analytical brilliance and self-promoting bravado are they not making movies themselves?Any which way you look at it, TRAINING DAY is a powerhouse film and Denzel Washington well earned his Oscar even allowing for the fact the Russell Crowe's performance in  A BEAUTIFUL MIND blew this out of the water! I don't really care if this offers no redeeming comment on the direction, success or otherwise of law enforcement. I care even less about the snowballing ambiguity of Ethan Hawke's predicament as Washington's rookie partner, nor the plot variables, missed linkages, Hollywoodisation or in fact ANYTHING other than the performances of the two leads and the script supporting them. It did enough to more than justify the price of a ticket and in my book thats just fine and dandy. True it lacked the racial conflict of IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, the grit of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS or the sheer dynamics of BULLITT. It remains though one hell of a good film - for what it is!Judge it the same way!",Null,0,11,12 January 2003
Se7en," 'Seven' or 'Four point five?'
","There is no doubt 'Seven' is a superior film in every way, so far as crime dramas/psychological dramas go, Fincher is indeed a visionary director. This film however has achieved an unrealistic and totally unsupportable 'aura' of brilliance that is simply unjustified. Having seen it now five times, the latest last night after my son bought it for my birthday, I have to declare it to be as boring and pretentious as the first night I saw it.Without anything but praise for everyone's performance (Spacey, especially) I still have nothing but blank indifference to every character presented here. What in Zeus' butthole was the point of the film? Any half competent lawyer would have gotten Pitt a suspended sentence (justifiable homicide...temporary insanity..whatever) Who cares what the hell Freeman decided to do...hang around a few more years, go shoot a few chickens? As for Ms Paltrow - the most boring and one-dimensional actress yet paraded on the silver screen (though Nicole Kidman isn't far behind)...HER fate was the highlight of the movie.Shamelessly exploitive crap though it was, I found RESURRECTION (A 'Seven' clone) way more interesting and given that starred Mr 'Wooden' himself (Christopher Lambert)....maybe I need therapy.Quite frankly for all its social comment, upmarket direction, cinematography and set-design, I think 'Seven' is a modern 'Kings New Clothes.' Great film....shame about the entertainment factor. ANY film that feels like you've just donated four hours of your life has at its core, a problem.As for those who even MENTION this in the same breath as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - you HAVE to be kidding! That sequence between Hannibal and Starling during their first meeting alone, blows everything this film has to offer out the window.",Null,8,14,13 December 2004
Unbreakable," Cranial overload......but worth it!
","It appears to me, films by M Night Shyamalan reach a specifically receptive audience only. If you are not 'on-line' with this particular 'market niche' specialist, all you're ever going to discern is movement, meaningless words and probable boredom.UNBREAKABLE, I believe is an unsurpassable work. The last 60 seconds of this film simply made me cry, I was just totally overwhelmed by what I was seeing. Great as THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS are, their 'shock' ending doesn't come close to this. My God, if this doesn't move you you're already dead. Willis is excellent as security guard David Dunn the only survivor of a major train wreck and who has to face up to his seeming immortality (Major shades of cult Aussie movie THE SURVIVOR)Samuel L. Jackson however is at the opposite end of the spectrum. An art gallery proprietor born with a congenital bone condition which causes the least accident or fall to shatter his skeletal support. As in all Shyamalan films what you think you are seeing is proven to be quite inaccurate at the conclusion.  In the case of UNBREAKABLE, the outcome is so unexpected as to be quite an emotional upheaval! An incredible film by any standards. Hard to understand why it was considered a 'lesser outing' to THE SIXTH SENSE! But, and I emphasise the fact, the audience must 'stick with this' it doesn't support the 'casual' viewer in any shape or form.",Null,0,0,7 October 2002
Underworld," Heavy on style, light-on in vampires!
","Cleverly conceived and executed (pardon the pun) little confrontation between were's and vamps but what we are left with here is little more than a stylish horror tease with low grade dentures!Basically a two hour special effect that would have been better suited to MTV than the theater. Although a long time devotee of the children of the night and their ilk, I for one am still waiting for someone to come up with a scene that betters the werewolf transformation in the original HOWLING. I mean here we are two decades on, digital technology on tap and still no one can come up with the goods. CGI just doesn't cut it. JURASSIC PARK showed what was possible, so what's happened?

Alien: Resurrection," Alien to the preceding trilogy - yes!
","Has enough already been written about this catastrophic loser of a sequel? probably....I just get so angry thinking about it, I believe it deserves one more shellacking!Having Jeunet direct this sequel is akin to having Walt Disney direct Rocky 6 (or FIRST BLOOD 4: RAMBO GOES AFGHAN, if Stallone has his way!) It has been made with absolutely no 'feel' for the series. Similar comments might justifiably have been levelled at ALIEN 3 which initially turned me off too, but age and multiple viewings have improved it. The flick has much to commend it (refer separate review if you are so inclined!) ALIEN RESURRECTION on the other hand gets worse with each viewing and ends up being turned off earlier whenever I see it! But for the cloned Ripley (A mere excuse for a sequel...better to have had her wake up back on board the NOSTROMO having dreamed 2 and 3!) the thing is a childish and puerile copy of the original even down to the need for another 'Oh My God, it's a robot' scene and Jeunet could be no Ridley Scott even with multiple clonings and genetic alteration!Ripley looks 53 and desperate for a decent scriptwriter. Winona Ryder is the wimpiest 'heroine' (I use the term lightly) you ever laid eyes on and the FX just plain laughable. The 'underwater sequence' with the digitised swimming-aliens is at once a cack-fest and an insult to the marvellous contributions of Scott and Cameron! The ONE decent scene in the movie is that where the two aliens chomp up their compatriot, so that the acid eats through their cage and frees them - I liked that! A thinking man's alien! I didn't find the 'kill me' sequence either moving or relevant...sorry guys, just plain idiotic, like the rest of the disaster that is ALIEN RESURRECTION.What would a critique of this film be without its very own paragraph reserved for the 'baby alien?' My only question is..'How did Ripley keep a straight face all that time, in the proximity of that nauseatingly comical piece of aberrated latex? For that matter, how did the crew not crack-up filming it?  Was it supposed to generate fear? pathos? serious contemplation of our scientific future?  What it achieved in my case (after the laughter subsided) was extreme anger, that some half-baked Director, who should never have been anywhere near the set of an Alien movie, would try to foist this insultingly bad and near juvenile excuse for a monster on to my patch! Enough said!Great ending too huh? It just stops! You could virtually see Weaver whispering to Ryder out of the corner of her mouth  'Hey Win, that damned camera off us yet?'I would happily take up a petition to have every copy of this film destroyed world-wide.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The ride's good.....the film's better!
","As has been correctly stated in piecemeal form, Bruckheimer simply got it all right with this one. He went back to basics, hired the best in the business and came up with pure escapist entertainment that works on every level. THE ROCK with an eye patch! Didn't hurt his cause either, that Johnny Depp handed in this once-in-a-career performance as Master Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow - part cockney, part Gilbert Grape, all Rock-Star - the most endearing rogue this side of the Jolly Roger! Geoffrey Rush's turn as Barbossa, a supernatural `Captain Hook' gone feral and swapping his parrot for an occasionally digitised monkey-with-attitude is given arguably his best role since Helfgott!  Bloom also does just that.Erroll Flynn coming along nicely! Meanwhile, the painfully corsetted Miss Knightley balances the film's romantic interest, Elizabeth Swann, beautifully - somewhere between Ripley and GI Jane.Toss in a truly great script that bridges the gulf so well between pirate chatter and teenage attention-span and you're looking at a seriously brilliant off the wall two and whatever hours of cornball whimsy that wouldn't put a harmful psychological dent in a five year old's psyche.Depp  drops one-liners that are funny as all hell (`Stop putting holes in my ship'). The  production work, costuming, action sequences and set-design are cutting edge. What we have here is a multi-dimensional `lost-boys' loose in a candy shop. It's a buddy movie, a romantic comedy, an actioner and always at its heart,  tasteful family-orientated entertainment. Bruckheimer has tossed everyone's juvenile pirate fantasies into a blender and poured out this tribute to childhood memory and screen decency.Great ending also that does justice to what preceded it.  Reminded me very much of another rollickingly good-time action-fest from Sam Raimi that co-incidentally was also top heavy with some seriously aggro skeletal miscreants - ARMY OF DARKNESS.  `Hail to the King  baby!'",10,1,3,12 September 2003
12 Angry Men," The over-used term 'classic movie' really comes into its own here!
","This once-in-a-generation masterpiece simply has no equal. The late 90's TV remake was quite adequate though totally unnecessary and in the upshot proved simply that updating a film for updating's sake is really an exercise in futility. Even had it BEEN as good - so what?There could be few, if ANY film-goers reading this who are unaware of the plotline and in any event many others have re-hashed this for you. The brilliance of the film is evident in so many aspects. To begin with, the ability to not only sustain interest but to command the viewer's attention for basically its entire running time within a setting of principally just one room, borders on the inspired. Whether or not that would actually work with TODAY'S audiences is another discussion! What we have here are twelve everyday Mr Joe Blows, summoned together on a jury panel to decide a defendant's guilt or innocence with regards to a murder charge. If you were to gather unto yourselves ANY twelve jurors at random, you would most likely be able to pinpoint the Henry Fonda, Lee Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden etc etc amongst them! Their very 'ordinariness' is where the film succeeded. Everyone can identify with at least ONE of those characters. Whether or not he may WANT to is a different matter. The thinker, the sensitive man, the arrogant bully, the opportunist, the mentally challenged loudmouth, the slimeball, the emotionally withdrawn, the sheep etc - they're all here! Welcome to society folks! I dislike society in the main - doubtless a reason I found this film to be such a revelation..even when I was barely into my teens!12 ANGRY MEN also pinpoints the shortcomings of the law, how 'truth' can be so intrinsically left-field and unintentionally flawed. Lumet, working within a minimal budget here, delivers unstinting brilliance in both direction, character portrayal and script interpretation. He had of course superb acting talent at his disposal although some of the most memorable performances are from the lesser players. Some have denounced Fonda's role as being acceptable rather than awesome. I think however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience. His, is a study in deliberation and logic not show-pony stuff, but hell that never WAS Fonda was it?This is a great great movie, as is evidenced by the extremely high user-vote worldwide.

Hostel," If there is a point to this movie - I missed it!
","'Quentin Tarantino presents'.....and that's about as far as his influence extends. Several cogs above 'Cabin Fever' to be sure, but that isn't saying much.If one were to be objective about this film...perhaps 'subjective' is more appropriate - one might justifiably wonder what the Hell has happened to society's values and creeds generally, that a piece of questionable cinematic worth like this is paraded as 'upmarket entertainment.' Not a solitary person's life on this cerebrally-challenged planet could possibly be enriched by watching this ode to mindless violence. The sad thing is, that just such a scenario - an art-house catering for the more twisted morons amongst us, let's say - WOULD in fact make millions! There would be no shortage of psychotic customers queued-up with their Black and Deckers!Tarantino has flair - his horror (From Dusk Till Dawn thru Kill Bill) IS art. HOSTEL is artless - a crudely assembled, rampagingly dark canvas filled with a motley array of fully dislike-able people...Hernandez himself the one marginal exception. Who amongst us is in to Euro trash like this anyway? - this flick has probably set tourism there, back three decades.The cinematographer's odd artsy turn cannot hide the true nature of this vulgar and unbecoming little flick.....and that's exactly what it is - little! For those of you happy to queue up, expecting to be pleasured at the sight of on-going torture and maiming throughout the film - be aware that nothing happens until so far into the thing you'll be wondering whether or not you wandered into the wrong theater. By my estimation...actual screen shots of a high disgust factor (read as drilling, sawing, gouging and their ilk) take up less than eight minutes, the rest is simply your imagination at work. The film justifiably deserves an Oscar however for 'presenting the greatest number of repulsive characters on screen in the space of 90 minutes.' Do you really think Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston, David Niven, Henry Fonda, Kenneth Moore, Danny Kaye, Bette Davis, Peter Ustinov, Deborah Kerr, Robert Redford, Audrey Hepburn, Laurence Olivier and Katie Hepburn (to name but thirteen) would have queued-up for the chance to star in this crap? .....Yeah, I hear you...'Who are THEY?'",5,0,0,26 February 2006

As far removed from STAR WARS as Austin Powers is from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. this film is pitched uniquely at those who can laugh at life but who have deep down an unquenchable desire for adventure and the romantic.Set on a futuristic earth, where really nothing has changed except the technology, Bruce Willis is STILL John McLane, a has-been stormtrooper reduced now to driving air-cabs for a living...same old premise for him - nothing's changed much since STRIKING DISTANCE, except maybe the yellow hair-rinse. Now, legend has it that in a time long long ago, the forces of darkness visited earth and were repelled by the unification in close proximity, of four stones representing the four elements. earth, wind, fire and water together with a fifth 'element' of unknown origin.Dear old Ian Holm is Priest Cornelius, an expert authority on the five elements and keeper of all knowledge on things magical and mysterious. Gary Oldman in arguably his most way-put role is General Zorg who has done a deal with 'The Dark Side' and whose sole purpose is to take possession of the elemental stones. The scene wherein he demonstrates the new weaponry to his alien henchman (from which the one-line 'summary quote' above is taken) is an absolute classic of cinema. Milla Jovovich (Married to Besson at the time of the flick) is absolutely rivetting as Leeloo, the cloned/unzipped humanised fifth element. She must have practised long and hard perfecting her ancient language dialog....it's amazing. She strikes exactly the right note as a being of purity, femininity and warrior woman. As the film progresses she assumes the identitiy of the perfect girl any man would wish for and want to protect.The comedy angle is hysterical, the action sequences in your face, and the fx generally impressive if not mega weird at times. Color and visuals play a major role in this pro-European production, the continent where not surprisingly it was most successful. The outcome naturally is predictable and in the best traditions of 'will love save the day?' as if it wasn't always going to???So, there u have it. Watch it one-dimensionally and that's what you'll get back. let it flow, immerse yourself in IT and you couldn't fail to have a good time, unless of course you are clinically dead or devoid of any sense of fun or fantasy ....but in that case you'd be wasting your time anyway, it wasn't MADE for you!",Null,263,327,9 November 2001
Batman Returns," Nope, Batman didn't return, Michael Keaton did!
","Hate to stand up against a unified front but hey guys, I hated this blacked out, doped-up ode to a night-avenger in built-up heels! What's to like? our rubber-clad hero having his butt unceremoniously kicked by a girl who's pushed the Weight-Watchers guide to new limits? A despicable sleazebag of a villain, a veritable fish-ridden midget in need of either a skilled orthodontist or a hopelessly ambitious plastic surgeon!  Nah, its gotta be the adrenalin-fuelled plot....all those munchkin-sized killer penguins on the loose in Gotham City! Then we have the much-vaunted legomobile with ultimate retractability that permits its maniacal driver to negotiate alleyways too small for the average bicycle!...and only once at that. Yeah, great film for the 'duh' brigade!Hey...I LIKE Tim Burton...least up to the point  he totally blew all credibility with PLANET OF THE CHIMPS!  The original BATMAN was a work of total gothic brilliance despite Keaton being at least a foot too short! Why????  simple..Jack Nicholson came up with the performance of the decade, possibly his career! It had everything.  This had less than nothing and what it DID have should have been crushed underfoot!Take a poll of 3000 BATMAN RETURNS patrons - betcha 60-70% would agree with this twisted, defamatory but totally accurate summation!",Null,2,7,26 September 2002
The Others," Once upon a time there was a young Spanish Director who had a sixth sense for ghost stories!
","THE OTHERS, I must reluctantly admit has its moments. However, it is not a 'classic' horror film, it isn't in fact a classic anything. It is a well photographed, flawed psychological thriller, a tad low on thrills.The 'Once upon a time' opening is a major mistake first-up as it telegraphs clues to the point of striking the viewer between the shoulder blades...'excuse me....this is a clue!!' A curious threesome, by way of Mrs Mills, mute Lydia and gardner Mr Ed Tuttle (the rarest of oddball roles for Brit once-was-a-funnyman, Eric Sykes) turn up at her door, curiously just as she is looking to replace the last help which disappeared into the night. Successful in gaining employment (or re-employment as it turns out, hint, hint!) Mrs Mills and the audience are introduced to Kidman's light-sensitive children, feisty daughter Anne and mega-wuss, her younger son Nicholas.
For most of the remainder of the film, well actually....nothing really happens when you come to think of it! Doors slam, we are given to believe that Anne sees dead people, the sound effects crew are given carte blanche to wring every last wrench, rip, tinkle, slam, shriek and ghostly presence you could hope for. Oh, and her lost-at-war husband turns up during a sequence that blatantly telegraphs what's going down here, IF you're paying attention.Now, it has been common knowledge from both critiques and advance press on the flick, that it borrows heavily from the SIXTH SENSE (a better film in my opinion) and therefore I would have thought the general outcome would be obvious to most anyone, the only question is - which?????? The film answers this poser long before the last few scenes which subsequent to the denouement, are actually the best in the film. For my money, Nicole Kidman though credible mostly, yet almost 40's Crawford at times, is just over the top and downright 'hammy' once in a while. Her best scenes are undeniably at the conclusion of the film.  Fionulla Flanagan is flawless as the kindly housekeeper Mrs Mills and simply acts Kidman off the screen....sorry fans! Alakina Mann all but matches her stride for scream as the daughter with attitude and a rather fetching look beneath that veil!*****POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD *****Clues are littered throughout, with such ludicrous gems as 'Mummy's gone mad...again!' and multiple references to 'that night.'  Even if you DO work out the basic premise and I have to be honest, I did quite early (Half is obvious almost immediately....the other half later!) the 'actual' explanation at the end is acceptable without necessarily being logical - you can put up half a dozen  'Yeah, but what about's' In the end, not so much derivative of the sixth sense but an arguable rip-off, dove-tailed with Henry James concepts in TURN OF THE SCREW. The latter being filmed in 1961 as THE INNOCENTS which leaves this for dead (excuse the pun!) Chilean born Amenobar has undeniably turned out an 'interesting' film (only his third) with strong European influences, never more obvious than from Aguirresarobe's gothic-inspired cinematography. The buzz that THE OTHERS may be in Oscar contention, may be a little premature. One person could well live with that, is Executive Producer, the ex Mr Kidman, Tom 'let me get on with my life' Cruise.",Null,0,0,1 December 2001
Scary Movie 2," About the only thing missing here was having someone urinate over the closing credits!
","The adjectives 'Pathetic,' 'Gross,' 'Disgusting,' 'Excrescent,' simply don't do this flick the justice it deserves. The two questions to be asked are (A) Why did they do it?  (B) HOW did it ever get released?SCARY MOVIE 1 was hysterical, laugh-out-loud funny. True, it did go way past the boundaries of 'decency' several times. This though, crosses those boundaries in the first few minutes - and NEVER comes back! It was pitiful to see such as James Woods of all people, prostituting his art and associating himself with this absolutely charmless and witless piece of insultingly bad cinema.Puerile and obnoxious from go to whoa, it wrecks totally the achievement of the original film.

Final Destination 2," A sequel that delivers......death!
","Brian Collins of Tipperary NAILED it!  'The makers are giving the audience what they want!'   Yes they are!  Stupid? yeah, it is!  so was the first! Intellectually stimulating?  about as much so as 'Judge Judy!' An entertaining movie?  Hell Yes!Dumbass comments like 'All they did was rip off the first one!'  Er thats what everyone went to see it for...hoping they DID!'   They did it better too!  Listen guys if this type of flick ain't your thing...why the hell go and see it?  If you don't want to be confronted by gross-out deaths - go and watch LILO and STITCH, MILO AND OTIS...LAUREL AND HARDY!  Personally, I LOVE gross-out deaths and this little flick DELIVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!The flick is worth seeing for the freeway accident alone. Arguably the most horrific thing ever seen in a movie bar NONE! I have never been a fan of laughable CGI fx.....this sequence however is as good as you're ever likely to see. It has the power to shut down an audiences senses just temporarily. Some people could be extremely upset and feel emotionally violated by this incredible piece of freeway violence.  If you thought the 'bus sequence' was scary in the first - close your eyes here! I tend to agree that the film got sillier as it went on but the sheer creativity of the cast's demise held it together. A.J. Cook was quite excellent (and believable) as Kimberly...Ali Larter really was little more than padding and in the upshot hardly even relevant to the film. Why she receives top billing is a mystery?  I also concede the repetitious attempts to link it to the first one grated after a while. The film and story hold up perfectly well on their own.Question! HOW did the cast and crew keep a straight face when Kimberly delivered the all time classic line, 'They're gonna be attacked by a flock of pigeons?' I'd knock a star off too for the inappropriate and unnecessarily comical ending!",8,1,2,15 March 2003
Blade II," Vampires you really don't wanna mess with!
","Oh yeah, Oh yeah - this is right up there when ur talking serious action fare! Totally counter to the norm, this sequel is streets ahead of the original in terms of style, action, choreography...even testosterone tease. It even manages to flow on reasonably well from the original tale with Snipes awesome in his re-incarnation as the martial-arts vampire vigilante with a cool line in both armaments and fashion sense.If one had gotten Ridley Scott, Dario Argento and John Woo together on a horror/action flick collaboration, BLADE II might have been the outcome. A tad low on plot development? Jeez, give me a break...who goes to see a flick like this looking for character and plot development for God's sake? Certainly not the theater full of actions fans I saw this with the other night. It gob-smacked the entire audience!Few of you would not know by now that 'Blade' is put on a new 'case' this time...hired by the very vampires he hunts so well, to eradicate a bunch of genetically altered super-munchers that feed on their own kind. Most of the film plays pretty much as a re-run of ALIENS, even down to the new breed's retractable mandibles - half Ripleyesque, half PREDATOR unplugged! Derivative or not, this thing rocks. Very RESIDENT EVILish at times with arguably the most stunning fight sequences ever presented. By comparison, BLADE 1 is for wimps.Call me sick, but I personally found the night-club sequence where some remarkably good looking female vampires were being disembowelled and/or having their backs ripped apart to satisfy the blood lust of their companions, totally erotic! As many have commented, the film generates a savage desire to be bitten oneself and to be able to share in this gratuitously violent existence. Ron Perlman, sartorially resplendant as the gothically unchallengable and virtually indestructible Reinhardt, has probably come up with his finest role here. The concluding confrontation between him and Blade is as good as anything I have ever seen. The viewer could never say they were short-changed here!A celebration of vampiric evil, offhand I cannot nominate a more adrenalin pumping children-of-the-night tale. 'Stylish' doesn't adequately cover it! I agree, the fx range from campy at best to straight out jaw-dropping (pun-intended) However the less effective sequences are thankfully very short. Leonor Varela hands us the best-looking euro-vampire yet (mind you, the setting is Prague!)and if ever she needs to bite someone....I will gladly take a ticket and stand in line!My ONLY complaint is the pathetic and totally inappropriate last scene which single handedly destroys the credibility and emotional power of the previous one (the rising sun!) It was unnecessary and should have been cut leaving Blade (and the audience) alone that dawn, with just their own thoughts.Tremendous effort all round. If you don't like it, you have no imagination, no taste for horror films and no right having been in the theater in the first place! No self-respecting vampire would look at you twice!",8,0,12,29 July 2002
Alien," Inspirational sci-fi/horror that launched a thousand rip-offs!
","To judge ALIEN against its sequels is to blame Eve for handing Adam that damned Granny Smith! Without Ridley Scott's masterpiece, there would BE no sequels!ALIEN is almost 23 years old and stands even now as the benchmark for films of this ilk. Even the fabulously entertaining ALIENS did not (and nor did it TRY) replicate its claustrophobic fear, its style, its inventiveness. Ridley Scott is a one-of-a-kind director. Like Stanley Kubrick (and I do not seek to equate them here) he has an individuality that comes through in his movies and stamps them as being HIS alone. ALIEN, LEGEND, BLADE RUNNER and of course GLADIATOR all bear the mark. The sensitivity, the human angle, the unique (at some point) blue lit filtered backdrop. He is an artiste!ALIEN has dated very little, evidenced only by the youth of the actors. Can anyone see a similarity (more-so in attitude) between the young Sigourney Weaver and Jane Fonda in her youth?The bridge of the Nostromo, made up primarily from electronic junk lying around the place was innovative (agreed, 'Mother' looks rather old hat, especially with her clunky old DOS interface!) The storyline has been re-hashed so many times since, but in 1979 it was fresh and cutting-edge stuff. The interior of the alien craft with the 'space jockey' was a jaw-dropping visual and the barely-glimpsed alien, fear incarnate! Not too many bio-mechanical twin jaw chompers before IT! The ONLY time the alien looked even vaguely suss was when Ripley blasted it out of the airlock. Just for a second one had an impression of the old 'man-in-a-suit' routine!Characterizations were superb, as they were in ALIENS! The demise of Lambert particularly, brings the horror of the alien confrontingly close to the viewer. Electronic sound fx and the musical score serve to heigten suspense at key moments, of which there are several. In the upshot however, the film belongs to Weaver as Ripley (although a young Ian Holm is brilliant as Ash - watch his facial expressions!) a model of constructive thinking, resourcefulness and bravery.No, they don't come much better than this!",Null,0,1,17 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Lucas marketing phenomenon steamrolls ahead!
","I can understand why so many people love this film. An opportunity to divest oneself of the daily grind, the chance to let magic and fantasy transport you to worlds unglimpsed, lives which only exist in your yearned-for dreams. This is what movies are all about - entertainment! If AOTC did it for you, well and good. Spare a thought though for people who can co-exist in the world of reality for which 'The King's New Clothes' was never going to be a chance of succeeding.I love fantasy, magic, the lure of an existence in a galaxy far far away! I also walked out totally underwhelmed from the original STAR WARS in 1977. What irritated me then is what irritates me now. George Lucas is making money by simply re-hashing all that you've ever loved and been emotionally touched by in so many films from the past 40 years or so. But it has no SOUL!!!  It is the ultimate joke...a 'clone' of all the action, dramatic and romantic sequences we subconsciously remember.  Take away the special effects, there is NO film, just what the production team saw - actors standing for hours on end in front of a blue screen. Even Yoda comes off, a CGI shadow of his former self when a hand-held puppet! As has been reiterated time and time again, the dialog in AOTC is diabolically childish, insultingly dumb and grossly unmemorable...quite a feat in itself when you come to think of it.For those who want to remain blinkered and selectively limited, AOTC does offer some genuinely brilliant fx, no question there, and it would be remiss of me to suggest it offers less than value for money...but this doesn't make a good film - it makes a successful one (Yeah, I'm reminded of HARRY POTTER, too) True also, is the general concensus that AOTC is more akin to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK than any other Star Wars flick, which is probably just as well since TESB was easily the best of the series.I found it fascinating last night, observing the queue snaking out into the street from the theater complex (well over a quarter of a kilometre most likely) lined up for TWO sessions ahead (some 5 hours plus?) Some of these people actually LOOKED intelligent!  (I'd already seen it at a Press Screening, before you ask!)",Null,0,1,17 May 2002

As identifiable as 'Frankly Scarlett I really don't give a damn!' (No...I'm not equating those two films either!)As someone pointed out, the film gets by without humor, sex, females even, karate, awesome weaponry, CGI.

Armageddon," Gigantic entertainment that left the more 'cerebral' DEEP IMPACT for dead!
","Michael Carruthers opening review here is spot on and I agree with his every sentiment. The main criticism worldwide (outside of the US at least) was that it is was too pro-American....too flag-waving! Excuse me? why SHOULDN'T IT BE? If such an eventuality came our way, who would the rest of the world be looking to to save us?  Scotland? Australia? Pakistan?  I don't think so! Besides, who's $150 million plus financed the flick? That's right, the US! They can film what they like any which way they like, as far as I can see is reasonable!  If other countries object to the blatant patriotism let them go film their own version!All ARMAGEDDON ever wanted to do was to 'entertain' and is anyone dumb enough to suggest it failed in that expectation? OK so neither this or DEEP IMPACT were original ideas, both basically rip-offs of the wonderful George Pal outing WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. I don't even agree that Bruce Willis' character, Oilman Harry Stamper was 'dislikable' as many have observed. He was the boss who simply gets the job done and does he do this here? You bet your sweet drill-bit he does! Terrific supporting 'turn' from Steve Buscemi as you would imagine and the fx are extremely attention grabbing. Those on the asteroid itself quite deafeningly realistic in the theater especially. Get over the 'implausibility factor' for God's sake, did anyone complain about JURASSIC PARK being far fetched? 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY being 'unlikely?' ARMAGEDDON is a solid piece of exciting scifi - kindly leave it at that!",Null,1,4,30 March 2002
The Village," A film for the disciplined mind only!
","TNight_1 so far as I can see is the only reviewer got it right. This IS Shyamalan's best film to date. Shame only one in 200,000 people have the mental resources to tap into it.This never was a horror-film, any more than SIGNS was about aliens. (I have incidentally received over 300 emails worldwide asking me to explain what really DID happen in SIGNS)Shyamalan is evolving as a precocious talent in all facets of film-making and if he continues at the rate he is...he may even have fifty fans by the end of 2005. I don't know why he bothers. To collar the collective lame-brain reviews that his films do, is merely evidence of how far down the intellectually-appreciative time-line the average viewer is!The relevance and success of this film is in the WORDS my friends, the superb characterisations that Shyamalan is able to draw out of his cast. Despite her limited screen-time this was one of Sigourney Weaver's greatest performance. LOOK at her, watch her mannerisms...she IS gentle but aware Alice Hunt. Ripley was another time, another place. Similarly, Hurt delivers a powerful and credible performance as the leader of the Amish-inspired community. Phoenix too gives a marvelous, controlled, yet understated reverence to his role as Weaver's son Lucius. As he so pointedly comments at one stage. 'This Village has too many secrets.'For all the above though, it is Bryce Dallas Howard that is nothing short of stunning in her debut role. Little wonder Shyamalan knew he had found the right girl when he met her. Headstrong, courageous, so very attractive to anyone who knows quality when they see it, she just elicits sympathy yet admiration for the way in which she handles her disability. Feminine to the last curl yet vulnerable given her youth and inexperience - this was a first-up role of a life-time and she carried it off with the professional flair of any A-list actress. Besides her, Kidman should be re-enrolling at acting school!As for the one-dimensional viewer seated there, ingesting handfuls of stale popcorn between his Diet Coke, waiting to be scared witless by the forest-creatures.....I have little sympathy for your ultimate disappointment. You had no clue about SIGNS either....what were you thinking? maybe you got intelligent overnight?Despite those who claim to have seen the 'twist' in THE SIXTH SENSE coming a mile off, (yeah right!) the MENSA graduates who 'figured out' UNBREAKABLE during the first quarter, and now the hordes of cerebrally-challenged patrons who see in THE VILLAGE a 'boring,' 'wooden' film with a 'cop-out' ending, there is thankfully a minority group who grasp what they see. That doesn't include the reviewer so interminably stupid, he even writes he 'didn't know' what the end meant!William Hurt's character makes it crystal clear for all to understand, when he tells the other elders, 'We have to protect the children's innocence.'Most of us would be far better off never entering those woods either  look what's on the other side  mainstream humanity! Sumptuous from a cinematographic viewpoint also, the film shares much common ground with SIGNS. A group seemingly at the mercy of the unknown. A central character dealing with his own emotional overload. Young people in harm's way and the values inherent in communal strength and decency.Far from the laughable perception that Shyamalan is running on empty with his last couple of films, he is metamorphisising into a Director par excellence. His is the big picture, most critics it would seem, can't even agree on the suitability of the frame!",Null,1,2,13 September 2004
Pitch Black," In caves, EVERYONE can hear you scream!
","Oh yeah, this is the real mccoy!Creeps up on you this film. One minute you're sitting there thinking, 'Yep, been here, done that' and suddenly - you haven't! To say this is the best sci-fi ever shot in Australia (somewhere around Coober Pedy I recall) really conveys little. What Aussie sci-fi IS there? (let's forget about the eminently forgettable RED PLANET debacle, most of which was shot overseas anyway) so lets upgrade that comment to 'one of the best Sci-fi films ever made anywhere!' David Twohy goes a long way towards redeeming himself after the soporific WATERWORLD.One of those movies you simply have to view two or three times to appreciate its qualities, it just gets better as it goes along. The plot contributes nothing to the film's success. Interplanetary spacecraft 'Hunter-Gratzner' crashes on to a barren planet at the ass end of the Universe. Bathed in perpetual light and murderous heat from a triple sun alliance (um? is that actually technically possible?  don't planets orbit suns??) the ten or so surviviors deduce that an eclipse is imminent, the first in 22 years - is that bad timing or what? Things are especially problematic when the planet's terrestrials surface from their underground lairs specifically during darkness to snack on whatever's on the menu.The ship's captain, Carolyn Fry (Mitchell) is  already feeling a tad down, as she feels it is her fault the ship has incurred some seriously permanent body-damage. The other crew members are more worried about Riddick, one mean motherf----- of a convict. As it turns out, with his surgically enhanced eyes, he is the only one can see the aliens with his neat 'night-vision,' a talent which comes in majorly useful as the survivors attempt to make their way back to the ship for protection.It is Vin Diesel's movie as he plays his role to perfection. This is as much a story of individuals working out their own issues under extreme pressure as being taken apart by grisly predatorial nasties. Radha Mitchell is equally cool as Captain Fry (a very different Ripley!), an officer with all the right stuff when it matters and a soft feminine side when it doesn't.Top twist at the end and hey, are those aliens grotesquely realistic or what? This is a thinking persons' film.",Null,0,0,3 November 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," They don't come any bigger!
","If entertainment is rated in terms of value for money then I fail to see what other film measures up in terms of the old adage 'what you see is what you get!' The closest would be Jim Cameron's ALIENS no doubt!Not necessarily 'better' than the original, which after all blew the limits of originality and innovation back in '84 with one twentieth of the budget, but it is certainly gynormous in scope and even depth. It does not stand up to logical penetrative analysis, because you can quite easily reason that none of it is theoretically possible. My suggestion is therefore that you simply don't bother, just watch the thing for what it is. An action-filled canvas of implausible but gut-wrenchingly involving sci-fi.This time around (and contrary to the original script) Schwarzenegger portrays the Terminator sent back to protect John Connors against the virtually indestructible T-1000, played menacingly by Robert Patrick. His gradual assimilation of human characteristics and emotions is particularly well handled especially at the film's conclusion, when he must self-destruct in the molten metal at the steel foundry. It is one of Schwarzenegger's most touching seconds of screen time in any film!When you realise that Kubrick's hugely disappointing EYES WIDE SHUT cost not much less than T2, you can begin to realise how well the money was spent here. The second sequel planned for later this year is unlikely to be in the same ball-park as this one-off kick-ass movie!",Null,1,2,22 March 2002
Spider-Man," Skating dangerously close to the edge of crap movie-making!
","I wanted to like this flick, I really did, and Sam Raimi is an innovative director, whose career I have avidly followed since EVIL DEAD. I have to tell you however, this is light years behind ARMY OF DARKNESS, even DARKMAN (another comic caper for Raimi!)Toby Maguire was straight-up excellent in the role of Spiderman. He handles the role of science nerd, fortuitously bitten by a missing genetically engineered spider, just perfectly. The early scenes during which he road-tests his new found arachnid skills are deftly handled and at this point, I had the film categorised a 7 or 8. The first set-back was the appearance of Kirsten Dunst, supposedly the 'girl next door' but in reality more like a brain-dead 27/28 year old with less appeal than the original spider. The supposed great 'love scenes' just never happen and even Maguire himself by the film's end doesn't look that interested either (admittedly, he does have various sequels to worry about!). The film is irredeemably sunk however by the appearance of the Green Goblin. Looking like a retarded piece of junk from an old LOST IN SPACE episode, the film quickly degenerates to a 6. The second half becomes increasingly more stupid and rushed and simply unravels!The fx and CGI are for the most part (In NY) deftly handled but towards the end, during the cable-car-under-the-bridge sequences, they become laughable and insultingly bad. The entire ending is rushed and unsatisfying. That this flick is currently running at an average user-voting of 8.2, elevating it to midway up the top 250 films of all time is simply lunacy - a triumph of marketing hype over intelligence. Un- even and unsustainable in the long run!The film's greatest attribute??? no questions?   Danny Elfman's dynamic score - it is brilliant and by far the flick's greatest achievement.",4,0,1,8 June 2002
Aliens," Easily the greatest Sci Fi/Action flick in history.
","Is this better than the original?? A moot point! The real answer is, its DIFFERENT! and a bone-crunching ride it most certainly is. I recall clearly opening night, the entire theater rose as one at the conclusion to the pic and clapped, stamped and whistled. Warren Beatty can only dream of such a reaction!Part of its success I feel, comes from the inspired multi-floor   postering at the time (at least in Australia), showing Ripley armed to the teeth, looking skywards with the catch line 'There are some places in the Universe you don't go!' 'Exciting' doesn't adequately describe this unremittingly supercharged sequel. It delivered!A key common to most engrossing films are interesting characterizations and this flick has them in abundunce.  Ripley - at the top of her tree, Corporal Hicks, Vasquez, Hudson and even Newt, a winner all the way. The aliens themselves were realistic to the point of disbelief, both in appearance and movement. Even in ALIEN the concluding shot of the beast being blown out of the airlock looked suspiciously like a man in a suit which the remainder of the film had avoided. In ALIENS there is no trace of human involvement.
Packed with smart-ass repartee and memorable one-liners, 'Well why don't you put HER in charge?' asks Hudson (Paxton) referring to young Newt the only survivor of the colony, after Ripley praises her survival techniques. Predictably, the most famous line of all is left to Ripley, 'Get away from her..you BITCH!' as she prepares to do battle with the Queen alien at the climax of the movie.Adrenalin charged action from the opening scene, it'll be a while until anyone sees this again!The special effects were in a class of their own - one has only to watch ALIEN RESURRECTION to realise how true this is. Cameron hit is zenith with this, whether TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is better, I wouldn't like to argue, personally, I think its pretty much line ball.",Null,0,2,17 November 2001

(but that COULD have been coz I was dating this awesomely desirable chick from 11th grade at the time and may have been somewhat distracted from the plot)If you have seen the shorts - don't bother with the film, they are the momentary highlights to be gleaned here. One of the major problems I believe is the rather disjointed and episodic mini-drama intercuts that Soderbergh has cobbled together as a hi-tech film. For me, it just didn't work, in fact I was amusing myself mentally in the theater,  wondering just how much difference it would have made to the film if the laborious 'lead-up' vignettes as they basically are, were edited together in a totally different order. I doubt anyone would either notice or care! Hell of a waste of Clooney - he carried himself AND Danny Ocean quite brilliantly. I hope they make THE RETURN OF DANNY OCEAN one day with John Frankenheimer directing! Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict, the fantatically cashed up and soulless triple Casino owner was great, while Elliot Gould pulled off the role of his career, despite minimal screen time, as rival Casino owner Reuben Tishkoff.Pitt has managed rave notices for his role - why I can't imagine? and Damon and the rest of the (almost) dirty dozen are simply on-hand. The last mega embarrassing five minutes of the flick totally sink it, with the chummy group gazing up into the sky on cue waiting desperately for someone to make some worthwhile comment. It never happens! For those of you thought this was great entertainment - look at it again more objectively! This really is 'The King's New Clothes' revisited!",Null,0,1,26 January 2002
The Usual Suspects," Well up in the top 10 Crime thrillers of all time - just what's better would be hard to nominate!
","To achieve a top twenty all time ranking..and a composite rating of 8.7 you are looking at one seriously relevant flick here. To nominate the film as innovative is almost insulting. So multi-levelled and literate is it, that not one in a hundred people would have picked the solution. Told in coherent and linked flashback, we are presented with a kaleidoscope of facts, a smorgasboard of suspects and yet no thread with which to tie it all together. Spacey was totally deserving of his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as crippled con-man Roger Vint, grilled by cop Palminteri for the majority of the movie. Absolute blast of a performance from Pete Postlethwaite also, as the mysterious Kobayashi.The last three minutes of the film are simply jaw dropping as both Palminteri and the audience realise that they have been 'had' and in such a monumentally intelligent way.

Resident Evil," Absolute screamer of a movie - major stand-out of its genre.....whatever THAT is?
","If movies are all about entertainment, this is one of the most successful films in history! The best action-fest I've come up against since ALIENS, to which it owes more than a nod!Absolutely the best video-game to movie transfer yet made. If it bears but a passing resemblance to the game itself, well who the hell cares? The simplistic plot is ideal for those with limited attention spans. The underground corporation-run sub-city experimental lab is thrown into disarray when a virus forces the 'Hive's' CPU to shut down prematurely. A lot of people die most graphically. Another ALIENS type elite commando team (complete with an APONE look-alike) are sent in to 'rescue' Milla Jovovich who for a while has no idea what the hell she is doing there, plus whomsoever they can rescue before they hope to kick-start the central computer who is playing some really innovative and rogue games with both the intruders and the audience.Mutant victims with more than a touch of the 'Living Dead' cannibalise their rescuers one by one. Jovovich in easily her best role to date (are those the sexiest lips in screen history or what?) high kicks her oppressors and unbelievably well digitised Doberman reconstructs with flair and accuracy. There is simply no let-up throughout the movie which with the decibal screaming Dolby sound and rock-soundtrack just all dovetails together seamlessly.  State of the art FX enhance this adrenaline-pumping scifi caper and propel it into the stratosphere.As good a horror/sci-fi/zombie flick as you are ever likely to see with one all time mother of a jaw-snapping monster yet devised. Makes the Alien Queen look like a sedated kitten!This is one mad movie with a kick-ass direction and totally awesome action sequencing! Check out the dicing-death by laser-grid! This was mega-cool!

","Despite Roland Emmerich's open cheque book and upmarket CGI fx, this scifi outing cannot hold a candle to the likes of DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL or even FORBIDDEN PLANET....especially FORBIDDEN PLANET!!!!!Nevertheless, people queued up to see this film to see the alien threat repulsed, the spectacle of 20 kilometer ships hovering over the cities and megabuck explosions. (I wonder if ANY viewer twigged to the similarities with 'V' which held TV audiences spellbound in the 80's) This flick is about entertainment - and the destruction of the Empire State building was cool stuff you have to admit. Anyone looking for character development or meaningful dialog is best advised looking elsewhere. Once again the spectre of American patriotism seems to irritate so many people. In such an event, who would the world be LOOKING to save them?  Zimbabwe?Ok Pullman makes a wimpy President and Goldblum is an irritating person. True also, the concept of wiping out an entire alien fleet which has just flown God-knows how many billions of miles in a space ship several hundred miles in length with a mid eighties DOS virus is hyterical, but GUYS, just chill out and take it for what it is - expensive non-discriminatory entertainment.",Null,1,3,23 June 2002
Alien vs. Predator," AVP: Absolute vapid piffle!
","My mother used to tell me, 'If you can't say anything nice about something Noel  shut the hell up!' I never was able to live up to her high standards!AVP my friends, is an unmitigated disaster.If one were to rank the two franchises in order of merit, one would probably end up with the following. ALIENS, ALIEN, PREDATOR, ALIEN 3, PREDATOR 2, ALIEN RESURRECTION, ALIEN 2 (lets see who's alert here  there IS an ALIEN 2, I have a copy!) Now not everyone might agree with this order. I will concede 1 and 2 are interchangeable. AVP however ranks somewhere after PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE! 'Loopy' doesn't cover it. Considering the events are taking place some seven years after Danny Glover escaped without a singe, despite being in the immediate nuclear-powered wake of the departing Predator craft (huh? did they come back during a lull in the ratings period?) surely someone in this admittedly dumbass search party would be thinking 'God these critters look vaguely familiar?' Meanwhile, at the other end of the time-line, would not data-records of the AVP encounter have survived until 3946? the year that Ripley blew deep-space insurance premiums out the window, when she fried the Nostromo, just 57 years before she stepped up in class and nuked LV 426.Anderson is a tried and tested hack, the guy you call-in when you want a brain-dead popcorn movie in release. I personally resent his being given the opportunity to bury two sci-fi legends. What were the producers thinking? Was ANYONE thinking? Very much on a par with THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICKULE in terms of lacking meaningful scenes as opposed to excessive Dolby destruction, AVP is so damn dark, the viewer needs a light saber to see what the Hell's going-on in places.So wrapped up in his attempts to link Egyptian, Inca and Cambodian (huh?) pre-history with modern Predator-hype, the audience is left gasping at the plot's unoriginality. Even a cursory glance at the Predator hieroglyphs enables one wannabe stormtrooper-cum-Indiana Jones to regale the audience with the entire Predatorial dynastic history. Sheesh!Meanwhile Anderson and his mega-financed bunch of third-year film-makers are trying to make up their minds whether in fact they are actually shooting an ORIGINAL movie or simply blending a remake of ALIENS, CUBE, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, PREDATOR 2 and KRULL to name but five derivative sources. The script is abysmal, the actors lack-luster and completely overshadowed by the digitised mayhem. When your best actor is a guy the wrong side of 60 in the twilight of his career, things are serious! Perhaps Henriksen has plans of his own to clone himself for future sequels. He sure as hell looked so old here I was wondering if he had actually died mid-shoot and they had digitised his last few scenes. VAN HELSING proved better than most, the fallacy of digitisingread my lips guys.it just doesn't work. The only two films have used CGI to virtual perfection are JURASSIC PARK and GLADIATOR. Those pesky aliens running amok up and down the Inca pyramid here made THE SCORPION KING seem like a class-act! Did Ridley Scott need CGI for ALIEN? James Cameron for ALIENS or John McTiernan for PREDATOR? No, and that is why those films were so damn good. The creatures looked real. They were THERE! But there again, who but an idiot would speak of Anderson in the same breath as those other three meticulous directors  craftsmen not journeymen.Having said all that, the film could have been a winner in different hands and with some more hands-on casting. Well, toss in a decent script, some intelligence and a bit of sunlight maybe.The last scene was puerile, illogical, crappily shot and edited and absolutely par for the course given the previous 99 minutes.To summarise: A disappointing, inept, underwhelming and ultimately insulting episode in the lives of two of our favorite extra-terrestrial soapies.",Null,0,2,30 September 2004
The Transporter," What you see is what you get!
","Did anyone ever go to see THE BIG BOSS or FISTS OF FURY for the plotline and character development? I think not!  So it is with THE TRANSPORTER, an action flick I way preferred to XXX. If you're after something meaningful, go watch something else, don't totally pi-- me off and write underwhelmingly dumb comments as to how shallow the storyline is! Jason Statham is the 'transporter'...he delivers - WHATEVER, wherever! That's what he does, no more no less..and it pays well! He doesn't talk much, he doesn't have to and if people get in his way, well..all that elite special forces combat training comes in pretty handy doesn't it? What IS so good about this flick, quite apart from the prolific action sequences and martial arts work-outs that leave Bruce Lee and THE MATRIX in their wake, is the simple but majorly effective characterisations. Statham as Frank, invites you to LIKE him..why? because he's likeable. Similarly, Francois Berleand is a major plus in his smallish but extremely effective role as the Detective who has been on Frank's 'case' since he 'retired' and set up home locally. Miss Shu is a major plus also, being very natural and extremely feminine as Lai Kwai a girl in the wrong place for MOST of the time.Awesome pyrotechnics, auto stunts, fight sequences and some decent laughs along the way...NEVER was the price of your theater ticket a better investment.

28 Days Later...," Doesn't age well - even in the short term!
","With much to like admittedly, I think the IMDb rating here is an absurdly generous one. You want to tell me this is as good as PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK???Regrettably the entire film spirals downwards from the opening ten minutes. Jim's awakening in a London hospital to a deserted London is lifted directly from THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (They actually achieved an empty and windswept city, NOT by computerised FX but by filming at 6.30 am and having several streets closed off one after the other.) From here the film lurches into I AM LEGEND / OMEGA MAN territory with mild mannered bicycle courier Jim becoming progressively less mild mannered.By the film's end, JIM is fully RAMBOesque taking out trained combat soldiers. This is total bulls---! A weak-as-p*ss ending does nothing for the film either, including the alternate ending...with the 'chicken!'Some of the best moments of the film are when the four survivors are being chased by the 'infected' through darkened streets and buildings in very much THIRD MAN lensed sequences.Two things grate on me. NO infection could cause ravenous zombified behavior in seconds and to the best of my knowledge, Britain has more than sixty million registered private vehicles. Er, where did the zombies PUT them? and why are the freeways completely empty?...there would be cars from one end of the country to the other...hundreds of thousands.

Dumb and Dumber," This and SCARY MOVIE are two of the funniest films ever made!
","Whatever happened during the making of this film has been captured for all time within its images - the thing just gets funnier however many times you watch it - even if you can recite the entire flick in sync with the actors. Some years ago two of my daughters then 11 and 15, put together without prompting, the entire scene in the restaurant when Lloyd dupes Sea Bass into paying for their meals. Their performance was as good as Carrey's and Daniels. I mention this to show the influence this film has had on kids even that age.With the passage of time and fifty or sixty viewings, even the crude edges have worn away, leaving a dearly loved film and a comedy I can't see anyone ever topping. It wasn't just funny in places but simply right the way through it. When I saw the original karate sequence when Carrey is wining and dining Lauren Holly, I cracked up in the theater like I have never done before or since..and it takes a lot for me to lose it!Jeff Daniels, you realise more-so after multiple viewings, has contributed equally to the film in a role totally alien to him, yet the two of them are simply brilliant together. Add to this one of the best soundtracks backing up any film I can recall and you have a grade A winner.If you don't find this funny, you have no sense of unrestrained humor and I would suggest an immediate cat-scan!",Null,0,4,4 April 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," The best movie ever made? What an understatement!
","As several reviewers have correctly observed with regards to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, just so much has been written, debated, interpreted and allegorised over the decades, not too much remains in terms of a 'new slant' on the issue of this 149 minute brain-blender. It can only be ascribed the title 'Best film ever made,' if one is to consider the other 50-60,000 films actual contenders, and with the possible exception of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, GOODBYE MR CHIPS (The original, obviously), THE INNOCENTS (1962), MIDNIGHT COWBOY, CASABLANCA, CITIZEN KANE, PATTON, THE SHOOTIST, HEAT, BEN HUR, THE GODFATHER and maybe half a dozen more which I will diplomatically avoid nominating...they aren't!To call 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY a great film is to insult it. At the risk of incurring social isolation (and I can so live with that!)I doubt more than 5% of the world's population can even grasp at the staggering concepts up there on the screen. To plagiarize the words of Jesus himself, my inclination is to 'forgive them, for they know not what they see!' I have read reviews and comments, that individuals have found the film a 'boring' experience, I have news for them.....it wasn't made for you! Many years ago I had the privilege to be standing at the base of the Great Pyramid at Giza looking up at what is inarguably the greatest monumental artifact left to us on this planet. To my right, a group of English tourists strolled over. 'Just a heap of rock and stone ain't it mate?' said one lowbrow to his cro-magnan associate. Angered to the point of being able to commit what I would have termed justifiable homicide, I stood there, tears of utter rage running down my cheeks. Now, having learned a degree of both acceptance and tolerance, I am better equipped to handle such affrontery. So it must be with this film! There is not one micro-second of this movie that is either boring or without constructive purpose IF you have the ability to receive the transmission! From the fidgeting and furtive glances of the ape family at night, to Poole's dissociated and emotionless reaction to his parents wishing him a happy birthday by video-link, all is as it should be. Ironic that the character seemingly the most imbued with humanity and interest in his environment is HAL himself (How many viewers have yet to establish even HAL's link with IBM?)You will note that I have studiously avoided here re-hashing the storyline of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. If you do not yet know it, I rather doubt you would be reading this. It is, as some enlightened people have observed, anything BUT a space-tripping epic. It is about our origins, our purpose, our future.....why else do you suppose the craft was called 'Discovery?'Technologically the film is so unutterably brilliant it cannot be underestimated. There is not the slightest trace of matte-work or fudging of models here. No film before or since has come close to matching these Fx. Digitising is a total joke besides this. We share Heywood Floyd's weightlessness in the shuttle, marvel at the interiors of the space station (outstandingly scripted little sequence here) and listen to the sounds of silence as the moon bus speeds its way to Clavius and its covert destiny for mankind.The Jupiter craft 'Discovery' itself is without equal in visual history. Does anyone want to tell me that the viewer is NOT in space during this long sequence? Is there the slightest ripple of unreality as Dave exits the pod-bay doors? (So much greater an experience in the original 'Cinerama' format admittedly). Even Bowman's pursuit and retrieval of Poole's body is total realism, even down to the crumpling of his limbs as he is finally cradled within the pod's arms.The conclusion of the film for some, is a devastating emotional wake-up call, something most will never again experience in their lifetime. It is a glimpse of the unglimpsable, a gentle assurance that its not all for nothing, that some indefinable force IS at work directing, nudging, watching!If you all only KNEW what the Monolith really is?",Null,4,12,27 October 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," An enigma which demands your 'eyes wide open!'
","Having read the greater majority of the 1050 user-comments listed here, at least, the fifty odd that were WORTH reading, I feel constrained to add my own; perceptive, witty and appropriate as they are! I believe that Kubrick unequivocably was the ultimate directoral sensai. His unique brilliance shone like a red giant amongst a galaxy of variously and indifferently talented movie front-men. EYES WHITE SHUT is Stanley Kubrick's own personal black hole. Not only can no light escape from it, it totally collapsed under its own seriously weakened infrastructure. More than anything, I had wanted to immerse myself one last time in the work of an artiste, a man whose depth of vision and interpretation of life's everyday abnormalities, brought to the screen towering ambiguity and unending scope for discussion.Despite those who obviously see what they WANT to see in this two and a half hour ad for ribbed condoms, there remains for me just one question. What happened? did I miss the fat lady somewhere?Kubrick took the final print to Hollywood just one week before his death on March 8th 1999 in Hertfordshire England. The ultimately reclusive movie maestro had been working on the movie's post-production since filming wrapped early in 1998 after 71 weeks in production, having commenced December 1996, thus making this the longest film-shoot in history.In line with Kubrick's reluctance to travel - especially by air, the production team recreated the Manhattan street scenes on-set in London. The story itself is based on the Arthur Schnitzler novella entitled 'Traumnovelle' (Dream Story). Budget for the film allegedly topped $120 million, though HOW u would wonder, but a fraction of that is visible on screen. From concept to completion EYES WIDE SHUT occupied pretty much the last decade of Kubrick's life! Many believe that the movie reveals a humanitarian side to the master film-maker that was absent from his real-time personna. Blended surrealism and sexual liberation that could only come to the screen by way of Kubrickvision.What DID happen to Cruise at the masked orgy? (Who cares? I hear many whisper furtively!) All this and less is revealed in the ensuing well photographed confusion. This however is the core of the mystery and perhaps the beginning of another. An elusive note perhaps on which to bow out.Infinitely more interesting than the movie itself are the reasons behind Kubrick making it. Not a solitary reviewer appears to have questioned this aspect of the film. Although little more now than supposition, the death of his second wife Ruth at her own hand in 1968 left Kubrick with a profound guilt-complex, he having accused her of having an affair some months earlier. Later he took refuge in his self-enforced isolation, consoled in part by his inherent distrust of humanity. It was Ruth herself who proposed he should read 'Traumnovelle' It is easy then to view EYES WIDE SHUT as the self-flagellation he felt he so richly deserved. Sexually, Kubrick once confided to an associate that he privately fantasised about having relations with unknown young actresses, although at the time he was clearly smitten (like so many others) with the young Julie Christie. Here was a man mortally afraid of the rejection he felt would inevitably set-in, if a man should lose control of the relationship itself.Whatever the underlying motives, EYES WIDE SHUT though bearing all the hallmarks of the Kubrick directoral DNA, it remains a flawed work. One problem being that Kidman, perhaps entitled to be referred to as 'elegant' while dressed, is surely something less than hot-stuff in the raw. (Just MY opinion, but there again, I thought Tinkerbell had it pretty much all together in the body department!) Either way, Kidman's sterility-inducing opening scenes on the toilet were quite frankly not the aperitif most connoisseurs were hoping for.Try as one might, to WANT to admire this work, it is lean-pickings at best and far from a fitting epitaph to a very great man.",Null,1,3,27 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The best looking 'B' grade film in history!
","Now pay attention students (You thought I was going to say '007' then, didn't you?), lets get this straight...HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE (PHILOSOPHER'S STONE in just about every country but the US) is NOT a great movie. The most expensive to date maybe, certainly hyped and marketed into the stratosphere, but despite many redeeming features which I will get to later, it remains curiously ordinary!The over-riding problem with the film can be summed up in two words. Daniel Radcliffe! Critics, devotees, Potter obsessionalists can say what they like...'but, but he's SUPPOSED to be just an ordinary boy...'Yeah? well where does it say he has to display not one shred of charisma? Rowling's Potter is a bit of a lad...heaps of charisma on tap, Radcliffe looks OK, but the instant he opens his mouth in the opening scenes, the film is doomed! The lad just doesn't have it!!!! This is WIMP with a capital W! His two co-stars, Rupert Grint as Ron 'Know wot I mean?' Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione 'just watch out for me when I grow up' Granger leave him for dead. Watson especially acts the other two off the screen. She 'has it!'  Bitchy little thing and cute as all hell, she should have her own spin-off series! But, back to Radcliffe! He spends the majority of the movie looking totally bemused and looking for the chalk-marks to stand on! Victorious, more by luck than judgment in the Quidditch match, he seems as surprised as anyone at the outcome! To be fair, it is his first 'spin at the wheel' and perhaps he may improve, although I suspect it will be more a case of having to having to block him out and concentrate on other things, to get much out of the sequels.Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid the giant gatekeeper, carries the movie! He is wonderfully convincing and imparts both the gruff kindness and moral strength the role demands. At times, especially early in the piece, you can see him clearly trying to WILL Radcliffe to act, hoping to lead by example. He supports his willing but clearly over-awed co-star to the very best of his ability. You can see him giving Radcliffe a hug after the first take saying 'Not bad Daniel, not bad....now, lets try it THIS way!!!' The flick is in 'worthwhile' mode, whenever Coltrane is on-screen, which fortunately is quite often!Richard Harris excels as Hogwarts Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. He can play this type of role in his sleep now. At all times however one could be forgiven for thinking that here again is Marcus Aurelius, deeply self-contemplative and dignified. Look closely at the scene where he is explaining to Harry to forego the delights of the magic mirror and to be aware of the need to rely on self-determination rather than the false promises of dreams. Is he not back in his tent with Russell Crowe here, saying much the same thing? Unfortunately, Harris/Dumbledore have little enough screen time, cut down significantly from the original book.The same might be said of Alan Rickman, who's performance as professor Severus Snape is the thespian highlight of the movie. As teacher of Spells and Potions, he just oozes menace and hidden ambition. His contribution to HARRY POTTER is unfortunately somewhat restricted, much like John Cleese's thirty odd seconds screen-time which are a complete waste of his presence.Maggie Smith, who has propped up British movies for decades, is perfect as Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall. She imparts just the right blend of loftiness and kindly understanding that J K Rowling had in mind when she wrote the book.Amongst the other star roles, Ian Hart is fine as Professor Quirrell and John Hurt, looking way over 100 (what's happened to him????) is Ollivander, who gives Harry his first wand (Another scene where Radcliffe simply looks too stunned for words!)Besides the casting of Radcliffe, the principal fault with the movie is its lack of continuity. Columbus has obviously tried to remain faithful to the book, knowing that millions of readers worldwide would have screamed the place down had he veered much from the original. In doing so however we now are presented with a series of 'sequences' from the book, but which are not linked with any particular purpose or intent. It is obvious that the production team have decided, 'Right, well lets start with Harry's home in Privet Lane!' It looks like it WAS the first scene shot too, Radciffe appears to be a stunned mullet at this juncture! After that Columbus has decided 'OK, now we'll shoot the Quidditch match!'  then the 'Platform 9 and three quarters' bit (sheesh, forget Julie Walters wouldja!). The Hogwarts Express comes over well (must have cost a truck load of $'s in makeover!) The all up result though is simply loosely related scenes as they have ticked off their filmed wish-list! In doing this however, a principal Rowling plot development centering on Lord Voldermort has been butchered and then puttied-in with the Unicorn sequence.The FX however, are the real stars of the movie. The London parallel/universe streets, the goblins, the wonderfully gothic Hogwarts School of Magic, its grounds, Quidditch field and corridors. The changing steps with a touch of the DARK CITY's! and of course, the owls, three-headed dog and other magical creatures, most especially Hagrid's cutest of cute, baby dragon! (It almost redeemed the entire film just on its own) All THIS the younger viewers will see, caring not one bit about continuity, acting accomplishments etc. From THEIR viewpoint, the film delivers all the magic of the book, it is the adult viewer will see through it.Maybe WE weren't ever supposed to be there?",Null,0,1,1 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry putts a loser!
","Let's get one thing straight - Emma Watson in that ball gown at the top of the staircase has to rank as one of the most entrancing and serenely beautiful sights my eyes have beheld since I saw my wife (then, only a few years older than Emma) glide into the church on our wedding day. Nothing in this movie was ever going to top that emotionally riveting scene. Every man's dream - a mixture of childish innocence, youthful beauty and understated desire, who could deny she embodied at that moment, every aspect of sought-after femininity a man could crave? The film hit the heights in places - the computer graphics for the Quidditch World Cup. The awesome dragon-fight sequences - the scenes of the beast scrabbling and dislodging tiles on the steeples of Hogwarts was unadulterated movie magic. The inspired underwater camera-work with the creatures of the deep bent on making life excessively uncomfortable for Harry.What the film lacked was continuity and in the upshot - purpose. Almost everything you saw in this film would have made not the slightest difference in whatever order you saw it. Scenes came and went which may well have been meaningful to those who live and breathe Potter and who have read the book cover to cover, but for the unconverted...a case of huh?? What a chronic waste of those stunning Quidditch World Cup scenes when you never got to see any World Cup. All that pre-release guff about Harry Potter's first big romance and screen kiss with the young Japanese student....they barely had three lines together! Radcliffe himself - back to his ultra wooden ways of the Philosopher's Stone - he has no vocal delivery or 'presence' whatsoever. As always - it is left to Emma Watson to act her two co-stars right off the screen.Visually sumptuous but sadly lacking in meaningful come-uppance. A good test of any movie is to ask yourself 'Could you sit through that again?' The last two films in the series - yes I could...this one - no way!!!",6,0,2,12 December 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix: Deflated!
","The Wachowskis, having bitten off more than they can digitise in this, the second 'coming' of so many computer nerd's wet dreams, have over-stepped their dubious talent here - obviously victims of their own hype! THIS is the computer game - THE MATRIX was the movie!To be expected, the flick has its die-hard adherents who would happily take a lie-detector test to convince us that they alone can penetrate the bulldust and fathom a master-plan in progress. This armored, but essentially - cranially displaced movie, is, like the sum of Morpheus' spoutings, heavy on pretense, light on significance. Fishburne's Moses-inspired 'address to the nation' atop Pride Rock, must rank as the most non-sensical piece of dialog ever uttered in a movie. Even HE looks utterly embarrassed to be there, frequently pausing as if wondering 'WHAT did I just say?' The entire sequence in fact, including the orgiastic rave with a BLADE soundtrack, appears to have been inspired by THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.As for THAT completely loopy and sex-less coupling with Carrie Ann Moss, I had to avert my eyes for fear of being rendered sterile! (Talk about LOT's wife!) C'mon....the woman looks old enough to be Reeve's mother and unintentionally cruel though it is, has any love interest ever been less attractive in the history of cinema? Reeves MUST have been wearing shades to do it! (Footnote to Miss Moss: No insult intended Carrie, I'm no better - way past my own use-by date but hey, LOVED the catwoman outfit!)
Reeves in fact appears majorly stilted and wooden throughout proceedings here (yeah, I know that IS par for the course for dear old Keanu, but Hell, couldn't NEO (gosh thats brilliant - anagram of ONE,  Thank you HAL!) have had just a little fun? As for his excruciatingly prolonged brawl with the replicated Agent Smiths....what the HELL was that?.....realistic? meaningful? intellectual? spiritual? None of the above, this was pretentious, laughable, overlong and irritating. Did LESS than nothing for the flick's credibility. One may also well ask, why, with his ability to leap tall buildings and fly at warp factor 10, would he even be bothered with such mundane fisticuffs in the first place? If he can repel bullets and the considerably better equipped aliens simply by holding his hand up, whats the deal here with the army of Weavings?  The sequence of course was not intended for logical contemplation. simply to impart to the popcorn-munching cretins that 'hey, ain't this one FUN movie?'Quantum physics, Crane-crap, Zen Buddhism, Armani fashions, Cecil B De Mille, Fritz Lang and Jacke Chan aside, what are we LEFT with here?  A half-decent freeway chase and ONLY the second other intelligent part of the movie - the sequence with the architect. The latter being the greatest, most perceptive and well delivered flurry of meaningful adjectival literacy since Lord Henry gave Dorian a lesson in societal objectivity in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. I cannot believe that greater than 2% of the MATRIX RELOADED's entire audience worldwide would have had the slightest idea of what was being said!The less said about the ending (and I use the term loosely), the better. You want thought provoking Sci-fi? stick with 2001 or BLADE RUNNER. You want action?  MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR leaves this for dead and WITHOUT CGI. You want superb characterisation? try BILLY BUDD on for size. Maybe gothic brilliance is your thing? THE INNOCENTS awaits you! You wanna be swept along with the crowd?  better catch MATRIX RELOADED (actually a sequel to THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES) before you actually get a chance to think!",Null,38,79,30 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A film that towers over most every other one ever made!
","I have had to suspend reading reviews posted here or I will lose it totally! I've got as far as 'Quite good,' 'Russell Crowe was alright,' 'Could have been better,' 'James Horner's score was particularly bad,' 'Jennifer Connolly was nothing special,' and personal fav, the bit about the 'wasted Oscars!'   My God - who ARE these people?The brilliance of this film though, undoubtedly contributed to significantly by so many people, Howard, Connolly, Production team in particular, to name but three,  comes down to just one thing in the wash-up: the totally awesome performance of Russell Crowe as Prof John Nash. Good as Denzel Washington was, it was obviously the BAFTA affair that cost Rusty the Oscar. So far ahead of the field with this towering performance, the Academy has cost itself total credibility by overlooking him. Granted, Crowe's behaviour was untenable but that should never have been any business of the Academy who are there solely to judge performances not social etiquette. I don't think I have ever seen an actor immerse himself so deeply in a role. His performance in GLADIATOR for example, though dignified, interesting and beautifully executed could never measure up to this mighty effort. It was the film itself that won it for him I believe. Here, he IS the film itself. I found his performance at times somewhat reminiscent of his role as the harassed Wiggins in THE INSIDER. (which should also have taken out Best Actor)So much to take in here. With Crowe such a dynamic focus, it is easy to lose sight of other things. I thought Jennifer Connolly was beautifully natural, she is such a cutie! Without giving anything away, I would like to say that the two highlights of the film for me were Prof Nash saying 'goodbye' to his friend's very young niece and his line 'Have you met Harvey?' which must have gone over the heads of everyone less than 40! Crowe's mastery of facial expressions, hand movements..even the 'walk' of John Nash brought to the fore the true art of 'acting' here. A film requiring multiple viewings, it will be for many, an incredibly emotional experience. It would be hard not to draw parallels in the closing scenes  between this and Robert Donat's GOODBYE MR CHIPS?",Null,0,2,29 March 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," 'The Force' was certainly with Columbus this time around!
","An incredible turnaround from the first outing. Being unshakeably of the opinion that despite so many other shortcomings, Daniel Radcliffe single handedly sank the first movie with his total lack of charisma, acting ability and screen presence, I'm here to tell you that somehow - whether through an intense acting course or by virtue of perhaps, Columbus' positive influence - Radcliffe has come up with a total make-over. He IS Harry Potter now! As well as moving up to warp factor 5 on the acting scale...he is moving and presenting well...dammit, the lad was just plain excellent here!
Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley however, who was so memorable in the Sorcerer's Stone, totally burying Radcliffe's performance, is cruelly over-shadowed here and several times borders on the irritable! Emma Watson reprises her role as Hermione and mega-cute and intellectually appealing . The introduction of Dobby the house elf simply guaranteed the film's success alone - one of the most endearing and professional looking CGI characters I have yet had the pleasure to see. True, the flying Ford Anglia wasn't so hot....at best, a BOYS OWN tribute with limited realism and that is being overly kind. The other ramped-up stroke of utter genius was Kenneth Branagh's turn as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. At times highly reminiscent of a young Christopher Plummer, he simply walked off with the movie. Every scene he was in was a gem. Can't say that Branagh has ever generated much in the way of appeal for me - too intense and low on interest - charismatically undercooked you might say! This however, is his moment of greatness. Forget Shakespeare Ken this is the real you!'Tragic,' is the only word to describe Richard Harris' death so soon after the film's completion. Dumbledore will be hard to replace. Rumor has it that Christopher Lee has been offered the part - one that he could fill in his sleep. He has the age, height, vocal command and physical presence to fill the role - even without fangs! Meanwhile I would simply like to make the comment that Richard Harris contributed greatly to the success of both HARRY POTTER films thus far, by virtue of his remarkable gentility, strength and utterly projected compassion.Columbus and crew really pulled their combined weight with the latest Quidditch match. That in the original movie was borderline reality and not even especially interesting or adrenaline-fuelled. The game here is thumping good stuff and superbly choreographed and realised.Columbus keeps THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS moving at a deft pace. The art work and production detail really quite staggering. I would venture to suggest however that the concluding scenes in the Chamber itself, would be quite scary and potentially disturbing to some really young viewers. Parents should be aware of this!HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is everything a film should be. Decent, exciting, principled, colorful, always interesting and at all times entertaining. It blows the first LORD OF THE RINGS out of the water...the first HARRY POTTER too!",Null,0,0,12 December 2002
Army of Darkness," The film that has what HARRY POTTER so desperately needed, a central character to blow everyone else out of the water!
","Perhaps my personal all-time most cherished flick, ARMY OF DARKNESS is easily the most ENTERTAINING film ever made. Following on seamlessly from the first two tales in the trilogy, its way bigger budget shows. EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN was a classic in its own right (will anyone, and I mean ANYONE ever top the plate-smashing sequence?) but this is another level up again!Unless you are dead, one-dimensional, humorless  or just straight-out contrary, you could not fail to be dragged along here for a riotous and action-orientated laugh-fest. After Ash and his beat-up Chev are sucked into the vortex in 2, they are spewed out in medieval times...none too gently either! It is the very mix of impossibly conflicting worlds that sets this film up for so much good-natured (and scripted) idiocy. A send up of every schlocky horror made, including itself, Ash battles the armies of the evil dead after he fails to retrieve the Necronomican without uttering syllable for syllable the immortal words 'Klaatu Barada Nicto.' Playing multiple roles here (check it out, if you didn't know already), Ash is the bravest knight of them all, wielding one-liners as dextrously as his broadsword and chainsaw.This is fun with a capital 'H.' Amazing fx and Danny Elfman's stirring score is as good as anything he has ever done. It is NOT a film to analyse and critically disassemble, it is one to ride and kick-ass with! Perhaps the absolute highlight of the flick is the very last scene in the supermarket - 'Gimme some sugar baby.' No film to my knowledge has come up with any more inspired an ending.  Bruce Campbell is so perfectly cast as Ash...he can never escape the role - nor would any of us ever want him too. For all that Brando, De Niro, Pacino, Davis (Bette), etc, have achieved, Campbell has topped them all as far as screen 'immortality' is concerned. Who will ever forget,  'Well maybe not EVERY little syllable!'Much as I would like to see Sean Connery do one more Bond, I would prefer to see EVIL DEAD 4!",Null,1,3,8 December 2001
Halloween," Itself beholdin' to PSYCHO, this is where it started!
","Reviewing HALLOWEEN is a little like being asked to review GENESIS! So many factors come into play here.  Did you see HALLOWEEN the year it was released? What age might you have been then? Have you seen it multiple times since???   as a teenager?  as an adult?  Are you an intelligent person?All these variables have relevance to your appreciation, understanding, and interpretive skills of this landmark film. Actually made on a remarkably low-budget, Carpenter really hit the jackpot with this one. It WAS eerie....it WAS frightening and almost ALL of this was achieved with suggestion...rather than graphic violence. The evil and malignant INTENT of Michael Myers filled the theater. Loomis' brave, almost unhinged pursuit of his nemesis was tangible and horror would never be the same again. Both FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH's Jason Voorhees and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's Freddy Krueger were the willing and predictable descendents of Michael Myers.
As integral as anything else here was John Carpenter's own musical score which he re-arranged for both sequels, and other self-directed films of the 80's including ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING. The power of HALLOWEEN has not been diminished OR surpassed in any of the seven sequels. If you are a teenager and have never seen the original HALLOWEEN it might be an interesting learning curve for you. You might say that you've seen it all before.....but that's because it was here first!A 9.4 out of 10 which is pretty good!",Null,0,2,21 September 2002
Vanilla Sky," Kubrick would have liked this!
","Not since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, has a film generated such emotion (both on and off screen). It actually draws parallels with that film, amongst so many others, but we will get to that later! Curiously, it has attracted much the same critical disapproval as Kubrick's work. Seen by many as 'boring,' 'self-indulgent' and 'convoluted,'  it is none of these things. It IS however an unapproachably brilliant work of art, from my viewpoint at least perhaps the greatest film ever made and as close to 2001 in depth and visual brilliance as anyone is ever going to get! Cameron Crowe has not 'done' it for me before, and I really couldn't care if he never 'does it' again. Kubrickian in stature and mystique he isn't, more like the neighbor you never really got into, and whom you might stumble across in the homewares aisle in your local S-Mart. What he has achieved with VANILLA SKY however is mind-numbing greatness, to which so many people have contributed their very souls.To try to summarise or come up with an encompassing precis of this flick is to undervalue if not trivialise a masterpiece. Its greatness lies essentially in its opening line 'Open your eyes'...the only problem IS, you need to have SEEN the film to realise the staggering implications of what you are hearing. OPEN YOUR EYES of course was the original Spanish film from masterful newcomer Alejandro Amenaber who scaled the heights in Hollywood with this year's THE OTHERS. Rather than identify the film in question, aware viewers may well feel a sense of deja vu here, recalling to mind the line 'Open your mind...open your mind' which was surely a precursor, if not the inspiration behind both films. Functioning along multiple awareness channels throughout its 153 minute run-time, VANILLA SKY is alternately, intellectually challenging and emotionally involving. Whether you view it as a thriller, a black comedy, outrageous sci-fi or even JERRY MAGUIRE on acid, this is pure brain-drain, a 'fix' for the fanciful!The opening scenes, as Cruise finds himself in a totally deserted Times Square, seemingly in 'virtual' impossibility sets the viewer up for what is to follow - a mind-trip through hell and beyond the infinite, literally!!! Think MATRIX, JACOBS LADDER, THE SIXTH SENSE, FIGHT CLUB and one other that I shall sensibly refrain from nominating and yes, they are ALL here, but still the mystery remains!Tom Cruise as millionaire playboy David Aames who inherits 51% controlling interest in his father's publishing empire, is a lost soul. Trouble is, right now he doesn't realise HOW lost! That this is the performance of his career is without question - its the performance of ANYONE's career! Running the gamut of experiences, from smartass yuppie to emotionally decimated and disfigured Joe Blow, the film orbits his character as surely as the planets in our solar system. As his legal advisor, Kurt Russell gives HIS greatest performance too, aided as it is by a script of sheer genius. Cameron Diaz, playing his long-suffering and heartbroken lover of convenience Julie Gianni, turns in one awesomely vivid performance, one that can only end in tragedy - though DOES it? You can never assume that what you see was actually what you think you saw!As for Penelope Cruz, reprising her role as Sophia Serrano in OPEN YOUR EYES, she really is a cutie. The chemistry between her and Cruise is just so obvious and up there for all to see. It is easy to see what Cruise could see in HER that Nicole Kidman could never exude in three lifetimes... at least, I can see it!Like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the last quarter of an hour will either blow your mind or leave you cold, wondering 'Hmm what was all that about?' Anyone NOT moved by the Gregory Peck/Bob Dylan revelations (this will make sense ONLY if you have seen this flick) should never have been watching this film in the first place, while the very last ten seconds of VANILLA SKY must wring and hang out to dry, whatever emotions the aware viewer has left, after this movie experience of a lifetime.Yeah, I liked it!",10,3,6,21 December 2001
Bruce Almighty," Presumably God bequeathed us HIS sense of humor. I doubt this tickled his fancy!
","Ok guys, I too am a Jim Carrey fan from way back....but MAN, he and Shadyac are completely off the rails with this mess!The first 30 minutes are fine.....vintage Carrey and right up until the Niagara Falls sequence - brilliant. Can't fault the acting, direction, script or general entertainment quotient. Somewhere just beyond the half-way point however..perhaps around the advent of the moon-roping sequence, the film  starts to disintegrate. The makers, obviously using LIAR LIAR as a template, find they haven't the story or depth to sustain what is basically a one-joke film. The fault is not Carrey's in fact he sustains a high level of acting throughout..even when the film is irredeemably lost by the three-quarter mark! Incredibly...BRUCE ALMIGHTY enters into a phase of utter BOREDOM as we are treated to a pseudo-religious sermon that just refuses to kerb its pretension.One fault - for me at least - was the casting of Jennifer Anniston. Whereas Maura Tierney made such a smart, attractive and cute feminine lead/wife in LIAR LIAR, Ms Anniston looks like a really middle-aged if not totally bedraggled love interest for most of the time..she does absolutely nothing for the picture. The 'highlight' of the movie...the 'newsreading sequence' WAS funny admittedly but would even have been more amusing had not Rowan Atkinson done it way better and funnier in JOHNNY ENGLISH.The last thirty minutes plays out like some out-takes from THE MAJESTIC which also found itself with nowhere to go at a critical point. In summation therefore, I have to agree with so many others who rightly commented that the film could have been soo much better given the premise and yeah...if you've seen the trailer...don't bother with the film!",5,0,1,5 July 2003
Signs," The greatest masterpiece that virtually none can see!
","Having submitted recently TWO reviews of this film wherein I have relentlessly slated individual contributors to the IMDb who appear to have a subconscious desire to broadcast their cranial limitations to a worldwide audience - I cannot be surprised that neither review has been published. I failed at ground level to observe the unwritten law here at the IMDb - 'Keep it objective old buddy - don't trash other reviewers!'  Well I'm sorry they NEED to be trashed. Perhaps if I take a broad-spectrum approach here, rather than crucify specific individuals, I might get the word across and God-knows, it so needs to be! SIGNS IS a masterpiece!  It is not a wannabe-great, a what-might-have been?, a great flick-shame about the ending type offering....it IS total brilliance. Problem is, that from what I can see, professional film critics included, almost no-one has UNDERSTOOD it, having failed completely to read what Shyamalan has shoved right under your noses. Evidence of this contagious lack of awareness is so prevalent from the multiplicity of inane and counter-productive comments here!*  Why would an alien civilisation prone to melting in the proximity of H20, opt to gate-crash a planet covered pretty much with water?*  What kind of retarded alien technology must they have to be unable to break out of a pantry?*  How self-indulgently patriotic, crass even, to have Phoenix belting the bejeezus out of a hapless alien at the end with his all-American baseball bat?  (Lets call this THE ARMAGEDDON syndrome?)*  Rather too cutesy having Culkin 'making it' after all following his mother of all asthma attacks!*  How stilted and unrealistic the characters' behaviour appears at times.I could go on!

The Matrix," Brilliantly pointless.
","Hey, how to lose all your friends in one short review - watch this!
I cut my film-critique molars on sci-fi! Grew up with WAR OF THE WORLDS, FORBIDDEN PLANET, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, THEM, THIS ISLAND EARTH etc. Developed a brain with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, BLADE RUNNER and its ilk. (Do films of THIS stature HAVE any ilk???). Then with the advent of such as ALIEN, ALIENS, HARDWARE etc, things were running hot. The 90's brought about a slump in intelligence but a boost in box office with SPECIES (and its cretinous sequel), INDEPENDENCE DAY and insane gothic madness like DARK CITY....Then there's THE MATRIX!I think I'm the only person on this planet didn't like the Matrix! Lets find out why, coz I'm really not too sure myself!  A devotee of sci-fi, I have nothing against Keanu Reeves. Hugo Weaving is indisputably one of Australia's best actors (Agent Smith is a role well below his talents, which if you have seen THE INTERVIEW or PROOF you will realise is a fact). THE MATRIX has action aplenty, a somewhat convoluted plot but still nothing stands out to account for my total apathy and inherent disinterest in the film. Perhaps it is that I have this feeling the world's audience has been conned into thinking how good the flick is and in fact THE MATRIX does exist and manipulates viewers into (a) handing over truckloads of money and (b) leaves them with the impression  they've had a great time. Take away the FX and you find...'Hey man , there isn't a movie here!'   It's brilliant!From my perspective, the movie is just a riot of activity, designed to rivet in place the minds of today's (for the most part) attention-deficient audiences. The film has plasticity, a veneer of smart-talk and bad-ass hero worship - maybe that's precisely why it was so popular! What it DOESN'T have is depth! I will admit, had I really gotten off on this flick and held it dear to my heart, reviews like THIS would totally rub me up the wrong way, but you see guys, thats the beauty of cinema - we all have our own (perhaps churlish) opinions and we see things differently. Purely in the interests of diplomacy I WILL be charitable and nominate one solitary aspect I DID find impressive - The alien attack on the ship at the end of the film - gr8 stuff, it almost made up for the preceding 130 minutes!",Null,1,3,8 November 2001

Funnier still, if one is to take seriously the entire rating system we would be stifling a laugh that LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING rates Number 6 and this masterpiece not within 'hundreds' of it? Is the world actually populated by THAT many cretins?HEAT is as good as film gets..if only for that cafe scene between De Niro and Pacino. Professionalism like this, I hadn't seen equalled until this month's KILL BILL.Mann fashioned a masterpiece with HEAT, one that succeeds on all levels: script, direction, action, purpose and ultimately - audience interaction.

Hart's War," Hart's War or McNamara's Band?
","If one were to place too great an emphasis on many of the smug and self-serving views expressed by various contributors here, it may well appear somewhat of an enigma that HART'S WAR still rates 6.3 overall. Obviously many who have voted have not posted a review. Equally obviously, to offset its many detractors...a significant number of people must have liked it. I'm one of them! Let us agree immediately, anyone looking for a sequel to THE GUNS OF NAVARONE can expect to be disappointed. A screen adaptation of John Katzenbach's excellent novel, this late WW2 flick tackles racism, POW life and honor...and not necessarily in that order. A re-hash of the plot is unnecessary as every second reviewer has covered this aspect. It is a film to LISTEN to and to take from it what you are able. Negative comments such that the events portrayed are 'unlikely,' that Bruce Willis isn't the 'star,' that 'nothing happens except lots of people keep talking,' are a sad indictment of viewers with a limited attention span. A lot of what is uttered during the 'court-room' sequences has great relevance in all facets of life - IF you care to listen. Farrell is excellent as is Willis in what admittedly IS a far smaller role. Willis' presence however is felt throughout the movie in much the same way as was Jack Nicholson's in A FEW GOOD MEN. (Another military court room flick)Yes its longish and it would be fair to say it is extremely dark for the greater part of the film. It is ultimately though a worthwhile addition to other POW films. You could do a lot worse.",Null,99,128,21 September 2003
A Walk to Remember," Purity and beauty for the traditional romantic.
","I don't know - I'm way too old for a middle life crisis, maybe its the onset of dementia, but this film really got to me. Never in all these years have I come across as beautiful and pure a character as Jamie Sullivan - and to think I gave MTV the flick whenever Britney-clone Miss Moore, started up her song of the month. Call it manipulative, unrealistic, contrived, saccharine, whatever your pleasure - but I absolutely lost my heart to Mandy Moore's character here.  Perhaps the deep-rooted protective instinct in my nature, maybe a reminder of what I never found but always desired, but I would be lying if I did not admit to falling totally in love with Jamie, matter of fact that would be an understatement.An impossible blend of strength, integrity, natural beauty, youth, feistiness, femininity and vulnerability - Mandy Moore delivered a performance so genuine and moving it totally stunned me. She was utterly spellbinding in every scene she was in - which was most of them. I thought her rendition of 'Its gonna be love' during the school play was cinematic magic. She was for those moments, every man's dream and the epitome of virginal translucence.  I was impressed too with Shane West's performance who at times was so reminiscent of a young Kevin Bacon somewhere around his FOOTLOOSE days. At times I agree, the film seemed to be headed down THE MAJESTIC path of over-sentiment but I'm sorry guys, I don't care. So long as Jamie was on-screen ripping my emotions apart, the rest really didn't matter!  What a stunning performance from so young a girl with barely any acting experience. The mere fact that this flick has pulled an everage user rating of 6.6 would suggest a LOT of people liked it. It blows LOVE STORY totally out of the water. On reflection, it is the film's very simplicity, lack of  pretension and strong supporting actors that serves it so very well.By the way, it does so help being a hopeless romantic!",Null,288,316,28 June 2002
Gladiator," There are great films and then there is GLADIATOR
","It saddens me that a man such as Ridley Scott can work for months on location bringing the most perceptive and detailed vision of ancient Rome to absolute reality, only to incur the inappropriate, juvenile and one dimensional comments such that I have read here - the following few 'reviews' (and I use the term 'loosely') especially. Comments such as 'horrible movie,'  'no interesting characters,' 'bad acting' and my personal favorite, 'crappy special effects,' is a sad epitaph to the lack of awareness and utter stupidity of so many viewers.GLADIATOR is one of the finest movies ever made, I don't 'think' it, I am telling you! Ridley Scott pulled off a jaw-dropping miracle reeling the finished product in at just on $60 million. It has the appearance, continuity and professional veneer of a $300 million production. It is in fact only an adaptation on Samuel Bronston's classic 1964 movie THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, itself the most literate and well-acted epic of the 50's and 60's...and again, the key figure of Marcus Aurelius is handled with such dignity, feeling and intelligence. In 1964 Sir Alec Guinness played Aurelius as a strong and clear-thinking man of moral strength and fortitude. In GLADIATOR, Richard Harris hands in what I consider his best role ever, portraying Aurelius as a political visionary, caring parent and incorruptible leader. Excellent though Russell Crowe is here, it is Ridley Scott makes the film what it is, together with the cinematography and enervating musical score. Russell has actually not that great a dialog overload! In the acting department, Phoenix blows him off the screen as the immoral, aggrieved and ultimately weak emperor in waiting. Oliver Reed as Proximo? Well, how he did not win best supporting actor posthumously I will never know. This is the greatest Oscar scandal in history as far as I am concerned. It was the role of his life and he took it in both hands and wrung his life out into the part....completely it would seem. He died as he would have wished, tanked and slipping off a bar stool in Malta towards the end of filming. But he gave us an unforgettable Proximo and I will long honor his name with the memory of what he did here.Crappy special effects huh?  Well, in the film I saw - I was looking at the COLOSSEUM, not a special effect. I was there with them. I have never seen any CGI effect come close to what these techos achieved. Can you believe there were no more than 48 people ever on set? The 'crowds' were made up of the same 48 people wearing different clothes and 'matted' together - you want to tell me it 'looked' like that? The arena action certainly was a far cry from the 'Chariot Race' in BEN HUR but there again, what isn't? It was still exciting stuff though, well for the vaguely cerebral set I hasten to add.A film like GLADIATOR comes along probably once every 40 years or so. Its a pity so many didn't notice it THIS time around. Still, you are probably outnumbered three to one.",Null,1,1,30 May 2002
