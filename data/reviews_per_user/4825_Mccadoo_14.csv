Mission: Impossible III," I had a lot of problems with this movie...
","I enjoyed the first two movies in this series, the first one most of all. That being said, this entry was quite a letdown. I wasn't expecting much, just a good action movie and it is that however, it had some problems that I just couldn't get past; I know his performance was lauded on all sides and there was much talk that he stole the movie but I just couldn't accept Mr. Hoffman as a villain, I found him totally unbelievable and over the top. In the final fight scene it looked to me as if Cruise was fighting the Pillsbury Dough Boy.In that same vein I couldn't buy the Ethan Hunt character as a family man, the scenes with his fianc√©/wife seemed forced and false. I won't even go into the creep factor, that the actress playing his wife is a dead wringer for Katie Holmes.And while I know it's all make believe when a movie causes me to say 'oh come on! while watching it that's not a good thing. This movie elicited that response not once but numerous times. Among the absurd scenes that rated an 'oh come on' were the following; The opening scene where you're led to believe his wife is about to die then later in the movie the cheap cop-out they use to resolve the scene.Cruise and Hoffman are in a jet, at altitude, going 400+ miles an hour and Cruise OPENS the cargo hatch and suspends Hoffman over it. OK, it's a movie but who didn't realize that Cruise, Hoffman, and everyone else in that aircraft would have been sucked out through that hatch from rapid de-compression. Just an aside; the in flight shot of the aircraft showed a Falcon Jet, when they landed in the US it had transformed into a Boeing 727, OK most people probably wouldn't notice that but still...Cruise spends three seconds showing his wife how to operate a handgun, in a very high stress situation, and suddenly she's Annie Oakley! She drops not one but two bad guys just like that.The scene on the bridge in which Hoffman's character is rescued, lots of problems with that one but the main ones were; who in the world would be able to mount an operation like that in the US on such short notice, or on any amount of notice. A missile firing drone? A helicopter? and absolutely no law enforcement response as all, none. If they were near Washington DC or Virginia I can't help feeling the aircraft would have attracted some attention from someone, say the military? Also, Cruise shoots down the drone with no problems at all once he had the machine gun but seconds later he can't seem to hit the helicopter (a much bigger target) and then just seems to give up, lowers the gun and watches Hoffmans character escape, all while the helicopter was still well within range.The final scene with his wife and co-workers all bonding, please, it was totally out of character with the rest of the movie, I felt like I'd jumped to an old episode of the Waltons.Over all I just didn't buy most of the characters or the plot, the villain was too over to top and unbelievable, the story line was absurd, the stunts, while entertaining to watch did nothing to strengthen the story and were too spectacular, they actually took away from the viewers ability to accept what they were watching, I watched them thinking they were there just so they could say forget about the lame ass story, wasn't that stunt cool? It wasn't a horrible movie, it just wasn't a very good movie either.It left me yearning for the next installment in the Bourne series.",4,2,3,13 November 2006
Fury," This movie not only insults American servicemen, it insults the veiwer as well.
","I have a family member, in his 90's now, who was a tanker in WWII in Europe. He got through about half of this movie before he turned it off in disgust. The rest of us in the room agreed with him wholeheartedly and in fact, some of us had voted to stop it before then but he kept hoping it would get better.I remember the exact moment he, and the rest of us gave up on it; the scene were they're eating a meal with the German women in their apartment and acting like knuckle dragging Neanderthals, My Uncle told us, almost in tears, that no one he ever saw in the service acted like that toward Germans or anyone else, they never executed prisoners in cold blood, not that he ever saw although he admitted it may have happened he knew it wasn't common. Overall they were just trying to do their jobs, stay alive, and come out of the war alive with their sanity, their humanity and their minds intact. This movie disturbed him, and the few service friends he has left, greatly and I'm sorry he ever saw it.I wasn't expecting much going into this movie to begin with because Brad Pitt is a terrible actor and overall, his movies aren't that good. And as bad an actor as Pitt is, he looks like Lawrence Olivier compared to Shia LaBouf who's also in the movie and overacts in every single scene he's in, possibly in an attempt to conceal that fact that he can't act...If your anti-American and/or anti-military this is definitely the movie for you, enjoy! If you believe that all allied soldiers in WWII should be honored for doing an incredibly dangerous job as well as they could and helped keep the world free avoid this movie completely because it will make you ill.And if you know anything at all about history, you know...history? As in the actual recording of facts, occurrences and events as they actually happened, you'll know that this movie is nonsense from beginning to end. It seems a lot of reviewers here seem to think Hollywood's version of WWII is what really happened. In defense of this piece of trash they reference other Hollywood movies, not documentaries or history books...other movies. If that's the extent of your knowledge of history then I submit to you that you're opinion of this movie is worthless. And in reading through all those reviews I solved the mystery of how this terrible film could have such a high rating on IMDB; the positive reviews are repeated over and over and over again. I read some positive reviews four and five times...while the negative ones seemed to only appear once. I wonder what is happening there?It's just a shame that a clueless dolt like Brad Pitt and everyone else involved, got the green light to dis-respect WWII soldiers with this project, I wouldn't expect him to understand that, I doubt he has the sense god gave a donut and Hollywood is generally anti-military, and at times anti-American anyway, but somewhere along the way someone should have realized that this piece of drek was an insult to the men and women who served, and those who died, in World War II.",1,13,22,28 May 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Tarentino at his self-indulgent worst
","A lot of scenes in a lot of Tarentino movies are hard to get through; he loves to film long drawn out dialogue between characters that goes on and on...and on. If you enjoy his movies, and I have enjoyed some of them, you put up with it and just wait it out.In this movie however, he not only took this method of movie making to the extreme but, just to make it even more tedious, he did most of it in subtitles. Subtitles that move across the screen so quickly that you spend most of your time speed reading instead of watching the damn movie. It was annoying, it was boring, it was not at all entertaining. I think Mr. Tarentino has cashed in on the gravitas he's built up in Hollywood to completely toss aside his inhibitions (and good sense) and let his penchant for endless dialogue run riot. The result is an almost unwatchable film.Add to that several other drawbacks and this becomes a movie to avoid at all costs. And yes, I know it did good box office, all I'll say to that is there's no accounting for taste. Jackie Chan movies make money too...it doesn't mean they're good.The two female leads could be twins, did Tarentino do this purposely? I didn't see why it mattered if he did but I did at times confuse one for the other. Also, both came to violent ends. And again, yes I know that Tarentino movies are ultra violent but it's starting to seem that he takes special pleasure in portraying attractive women being killed in gory detail. I've read that he even insisted on choking Diane Kruger himself, to the point of her losing consciousness, to make it look realistic. If anyone has seen Atomic Blond with Charlize Theron there's a scene in that movie in which a female character is strangled to death as well. They didn't go to the extremes Tarentino did in this movie and it actually looks much more realistic and disturbing....it's called acting. Is Sofia Boutella a better actress than Diane Kruger, I doubt it. But Kruger never got the opportunity to demonstrate that. Could it be that Tarentino just wanted to see what it was like to choke a woman? Just like he insisted on spitting in Uma Thurman's face himself in a scene in Kill Bill?And never mind the total lack of historical accuracy in the film, I didn't expect it to have any, especially after I watched part of (couldn't finish it) Brad Pitt's last WWII entry; Fury. This movie was just one long, boring conversational circle jerk interspersed with moments of over-the-top violence. Which is of course classic Tarentino but this movie took it much too far...or maybe his act is just getting stale.Don't bother with this movie, it's not worth your time, or the effort expended trying to keep up with the flying subtitles.",1,2,7,24 February 2019
21," Entertaining but with major problems
","Let me begin by saying that I haven't read the book this movie is 'based on' so I went in with no pre-conceived expectations. I enjoyed the movie, it was definitely worth a night at the movies however, I had some major issues with it that really detracted from my viewing enjoyment and yes, I know it's just a movie, but when things occur in a movie that's based on actual events that yank me out of the flow of the plot that's a problem. Things that jumped out at me were; The main character is supposed to be a genius and yet he hides over $300,000 in his ceiling?? No one is that stupid. Especially since there was no need for him to hide it at all; he won it gambling in Vegas, where gambling is legal, hello? He would have had to pay taxes on it but all he had to do was declare it as gambling winnings and open a bank account, or better yet, a short term CD to earn some interest. What did he plan to do, drop $300,000 in cash on the Dean of Admissions desk at Harvard Medical School? That would have gotten the IRS down on him in a heartbeat. It just didn't make any sense and was an incredibly stupid and unbelievable move.The group was counting cards which is not illegal but will get you banned from any casino that catches you. I would think they would have wanted to keep a very very low profile so they didn't attract attention. Wasn't that why they wore disguises? And yet, they stayed in suites, walked into the casinos greeting everyone by name like high rollers, they did everything they possibly could TO call attention to themselves. Again, it just didn't make any sense.Vegas casino's are all owned by major corporations these days, the days of the mob running the casinos are long over. Casino security does not beat people up over counting cards anymore, they haven't for a very long time. They escort you off the property and ban you and that's all. The main character could have filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission (because again, he hadn't done anything illegal), and the casino would have had a lot of questions to answer.The main character's mother offers him a check for $68,000 for medical school, telling him that she's been saving it for years for him so he could go to medical school. So she obviously didn't pay for MIT if she's been saving for years for this, how did he pay for MIT? I assumed he'd gotten scholarships but they never tell you one way or the other.Kevin Spacey's character steals his money and is going to see that he doesn't graduate, huh? Again, the main character hasn't done anything illegal, other than not declaring his winnings and paying taxes on them. On the other hand, I can't help feeling that the powers that be at MIT would take a very dim view of one of their professors acting the way Spacey's character did. All our hero had to do was go to them and spill his guts, I'm sure he could have gotten at least one or two of the others to back him up, probably the guy Spacey had already bounced from the team. He also could have gone to the police and reported the theft of the money in his room, OK, so he would have been in a little hot water with the IRS, but he would have kept at least a large portion of the cash.Casinos don't usually comp luxury suites to big winners, more often to big losers so they'll keep coming back. They want the big winners to go elsewhere. And we're back to the low profile thing again.There are a great many casino's in Vegas, if your trying to get away with counting, why would you go back to the same one (the Hardrock) again and again? Those are just the ones that come to mind at the moment. Again, I did enjoy the movie, but my enjoyment was tempered by the things I've listed above that were, in the end, kind of an insult to the viewers intelligence.",6,11,15,15 April 2008
Shrek Forever After," Heavy on sentimentality, light on laughs
","I must begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this movie, even after having been somewhat burned by Shrek The Third, so my expectations walking into the theatre may have been a bit high. That being said, I walked out of the theatre disappointed, and I must admit, feeling a bit tacky for having that reaction to this movie. Mike Meyers and company obviously were going for sentimentality in this, the reported last installment of the series, and that's fine, that's their right and their call. It is not however, the reason most adults would go to see this movie. Shrek has always been about smart comedy, about cutting wit and social lampooning, about characters you love and love to laugh at, or with. While that all slipped a bit in Shrek The Third, it was almost totally absent in this film. And that's fine, if that was what Mr. Myers and company were going for, it's not why I ponied up nine bucks to go see it. There were brief, very brief glimpses of what this movie could have been, of what made the Shrek franchise so well loved; Rumplestilskin screaming 'chimychangas' in horror as the ogre chef launched them at him in the climatic final battle. The two witches standing on the parapet above the ogres and pointing out; 'We can hear you you know'. Rumplestilskin prancing on the table with the glass of water while his witch minions look on in terror. There were a few others that escape me at the moment but only a few, a very few. The jokes in this movie were glaringly apparent in their absence, or maybe it was that those that were there totally missed the mark, like the two wagon witches whipping Donkey to make him change tunes, I know that was meant to be funny, it wasn't. As I've said, it appears that Mr. Myers and company chose to go the sentimental route in this final film and that's what they did. This movie was dripping with sentimentality, to the point that I felt as if I'd developed diabetes by the time it was over. I didn't go to this movie to bid a tearful goodbye to the Shrek franchise, I went bid a hilarious farewell with bits like the white bronco chase, or Puss in Boots catnip bust, or the Gingerbread Man torture scene, or countless others. I went to enjoy one last look at a group of funny and likable and sweet characters. That was what Shrek has always been about. Instead they went for the sentimental goodbye and I left the theatre feeling a bit tacky because I felt like I should have jumped on board, that I should have joined in on the tearful, touchy feely goodbye to the franchise. But I just couldn't because as I said, that's not what Shrek was ever about and that's not what I went to see. Instead of going out with a tear they should have gone out the way they came in, with a laugh.",6,1,2,1 June 2010
Captain America: Civil War," Too long, too cluttered with a weak plot
","To begin with, this movie should have been at least 30 minutes shorter. They could have achieved this simply by eliminating a few of the fights scenes which were too long and too numerous to begin with. by mid-point in the film they'd become repetitive and just kind of absurd. I mean how many times do you need to see these people beating the hell out of one another?Secondly, the plot was borderline absurd. Yes, I know they tried to tie it all together at the end but it really didn't work, it wasn't believable, and it really made little sense. I think another reviewer nailed it, they'd run out of bad guys and needed an excuse for all of the good guys to start pounding on one another. It got very old very quickly. A few other things I found absurd (and just for point of reference, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Avengers movie, not so much the second. I also thought CA, Winter Soldier was a great movie); Their version of Spiderman doesn't work. I know he's meant to be fresh and funny and irreverent but he just comes off as stupid and annoying. Ant Man, I remember Ant Man comics as a kid, thought they were ridiculous then and I can't believe they'd put him in a movie now, let alone give him one of his own. My wife, who watches some of these movies with me, laughed out loud when he showed up, and not in a good way. Paul Rudd tries really hard and god bless him it's not his fault, they're asking him to play Ant Man!The witch chick, I can't even remember her name, also doesn't fit at all with the rest of the characters here. She may be fine in an X-men movie but her character doesn't belong in an Avenger movie. Didn't work at all.Overall the movie was convoluted, clunky and way too long. I think they've over-used and worn out most of main characters and brought in new ones that just don't work. I may watch Infinity War on TV at some point down the road...maybe when I'm home sick or something...",2,4,5,28 January 2018
Independence Day," This movie has become part of my 4th of July
","OK, so plot holes abound in this movie, and Jeff Goldblum being able to actually sync his laptop up to an alien computer is possibly one of the most absurd plot devices in the history of cinema, and the dog should have been flash fried, I know I know... But I don't care, for me this movie always reminds me of the American 4th of July holiday (I'm American obviously) which means summer and fun. I remember the media blitz in the US for this movie, it began months before the release date and all you saw everywhere were black billboards with nothing on them but 'ID4'. The promotion for this movie was huge and very well done. It opened on July 3rd and my then wife and I went to see it that night. It was the only time before or since I've seen a movie on its opening night because usually it's too crowded but my wife actually insisted, she'd been dying to see it for weeks. And it was indeed very crowded but it was also fun, it was the start of the holiday weekend and the movie was playing in multiple theatres and the air of anticipation after that marketing campaign was palpable. It was an event. Did the movie live up to all of that? No, not really, it's not a great film, it's not in my top five or ten favorites. It's a popcorn movie, a check your logic at the door movie. But what's wrong with that? Those types of movies are fun too. And Independence Day is at the very least, good fun entertainment on a big scale. And on that night, at the beginning of the 4th of July weekend, it was perfect. Possibly if I had seen it at any other time I would feel differently but I didn't, and I don't. Another much maligned film that also came out in the mid-90's, Armageddon, is another prime example of a great popcorn movie. Is it great cinema? Of course not, but it is a great sit back and be entertained movie. It's a movie movie, meant to be seen on a big screen and I don't care what anyone says, it's a fun, entertaining way to spend a few hours. Did the people around us in that theater on July 3rd, 1996 cheer or applaud at the end of Independence Day? No, they didn't, and neither did my wife and I, but we weren't disappointed either. It was a great way to kick off our 4th of July. And now, fifteen years later, I still enjoy watching it, I enjoy sitting down with some popcorn and just being entertained by a big budget movie that may not be great, but that gives you a good ride for a few hours. Independence Day delivers that in spades, every time I watch it.",8,0,3,1 July 2011
Bridesmaids," Not the movie the television ads set me up for....
","Let me begin by saying that I'm a man and that I went to see this movie with my wife, not under duress, I was looking forward to seeing it. Let me add here that in an almost full theater I counted four other men in the audience which would lead me to believe that I was definitely not the target audience for this movie. That being said, my wife didn't like it either, she actually disliked it even more than I did.All of the television promos I saw led me to believe that this was going to be a female version of 'The Hangover', it wasn't, not even close. Which leads to my first problem with this movie, the advertising campaign was very deceiving. Pretty much all the funny scenes in the movie were included in the advertisements. What they didn't show was a very formulatic, been done a dozen times, chick flick about BFF's and wedding's gone wrong.I will say that the funny parts of this movie, and they were few, were very funny; the scenes on the airplane were good, and when Annie was trying to get the cop to help her find Lillian. And...that was pretty much it, except for most of Melissa McCarthy's scenes with the exception of the one during the credit roll which was just kind of sick. The rest of the scenes that were meant to be funny either went on for much too long, were bizarre or crude instead of funny or were just strained. A good example of strained was the bridal party all dancing at the end of the movie, it didn't look natural or funny or like anything but a bunch of actors having been told to dance around and try to look like they were having fun, some, like Rudolf and Wiig very badly at that. If you have zero rhythm and can't dance, don't put a dance scene in your movie. One example of bizarre was two of the bridesmaids just deciding to make out on an airplane, for no discernible reason. Did Ms. Wiig think the guys in the audience would just enjoy seeing woman kiss?The rest of the movie was an overlong, strained attempt to make a funny and touching movie all in one that failed at both. Some other major problems I saw; The scene near the beginning of the film in which Annie and Helen try to top one another at the announcement party went on and on and on way past the point where it was funny and to the point were it became tedious and even uncomfortable to watch. In fact many of the scenes in the movie were like that, they just didn't know where to stop.Kristin Wiig's character, Annie, progressed in the movie from being likable and funny to just being stupid and annoying. The scenes were she sabotaged the wedding plans, either intentionally or unintentionally, also ran way too long and were sad and annoying instead of funny. Ms. Wiig needs to learn that sometimes, especially when the material is weak to begin with, less is more.And while this may sound mean and petty I have to mention it because I kept noticing it over and over during the movie; Maya Rudolph is just not an attractive woman and was just wrong for her role in this movie. She was not believable at all, either as the bride to be or as the main characters best friend or as anything else. She is probably a fair sketch artist but she does not having the looks or the acting chops to carry a movie.All in all a disappointment, firstly because we were snookered in by a misleading advertising campaign and secondly, because the movie tried to be two things at once and failed miserably at both.",2,163,320,16 May 2011
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," It starts off slow and silly but stick with it, you won't be sorry...
","This movie gets off to a slow and shaky start, my wife and I almost stopped watching it. Glad we didn't because somewhere along the way, maybe 30-40 minutes into it you suddenly realize that you're watching a really good movie. I think that point came for me when Ben Stiller imagined Kristin Wiig singing the David Bowie song to him.From that point on just enjoy the ride, this is one of those rare movies (lately anyway) that makes you think, and makes you feel good about the world around us and life in general. It's a quiet, thoughtful, funny movie and those aren't really in style these days but I highlyrecommend you give it a try, you won't be sorry you did. Ben Stillerdid a great job directing and staring in this one.",10,1,1,14 February 2016
I Am Legend," Didn't live up to it's potential
","**Spoilers** I read 'I Am Legend' at least three times growing up and loved it each time. I went to see 'Omega Man' with great anticipation and left with great disappointment.I thought that this time they'd get it right, that this time Hollywood would recognize that 'I Am Legend' is a great work of fiction and can stand on it's own. That for once they wouldn't mess with a good thing. That for once they'd realize that they really can't do it better, they're really not smarter than the original author, and just stick to the game plan. I was wrong and once again, scriptwriters who think they are better writers than the original author and in reality can't hold a candle, missed a chance at a classic.That being said, I didn't hate this movie, it had some good things going for it. I thought Will Smith gave a great performance, especially considering that for most of the movie all he had to work with was a dog and some mannequins. The scenes of a deserted New York City were very well done. The beginning of the movie created the perfect atmosphere for what the story called for. And then, they screwed it all up; The CGI effects were cheesy at best, the nightstalkers didn't look believable at all. And they're behavior was so far over the top that it stopped being scary after their first few scenes and became annoying and even comical. I understand they were supposed to be sub-human monsters but come on, all they did was scream and slam into things. Even real animals don't act that way.The movie never developed the story line, it hinted at the fact that the nightstalkers were 'evolving' but left it at that; hints.And then the plot holes; Robert Neville made a daily broadcast announcing his presence in NYC, this in fact was what eventually brought the woman and child to look for him. Why then didn't this commune of survivors in Vermont receive his signal and follow up on it? Another plot hole; Neville as at the dock, at night, fighting the nightstalkers in an obvious attempt to die after losing his dog. There are dozens and dozens of zombies there trying to kill him, and yet a woman and a child manage to rescue him and drive away? How exactly did they accomplish that? The final act of the movie was the biggest disappointment for me. First, they turn to sermonizing at the end, the woman states that God has helped her and the boy, huh? And the ending was the biggest disappointment of all. The novel's ending is what makes it a classic, and where the title comes from by the way. The movie gives us a cookie cutter Hollywood happy ending and a lame voice over to try to tie the title into THEIR ending. It ruined all that came before it. And it was totally uncalled for, they could have just as easily stuck to the original ending and stayed true to the novel. This is what they should have done because whoever wrote this movie couldn't carry Richard Matheson's water...It was better than 'Omega Man' but still didn't come close to the novel. To Hollywood; please don't make anymore movies from classic works of fiction unless you're going to pay attention to what made them classics in the first place.",6,2,3,24 December 2007

Hancock," Hancock proves, yet again, why you should never listen to movies critics
","I've always been suspect of grown men and women who make a living criticizing the creative endeavors of others while having never created anything themselves. I happen to be a pilot and was for a time a flight instructor; to criticize the flying abilities of others one first had to become a pilot themselves. Everyone has a right to their opinion about movies, art, literature of course, but to make a living at it just seems tawdry to me. I mean, how does one become an expert at criticizing the work of others, especially if they themselves have never done that type of work.I usually take the fact that a movie is panned by critics as a sign that I may want to see it. The reverse is sometimes also true, if critics gush over a movie it oft times turns out to be just awful; Hidden Dragon Floating Tiger or whatever the name of that horrid movie was comes to mind, as does The English Patient, and more recently; Lions for Lambs...Anyway, I have to admit that I went in to Hancock wondering if this time the formula wouldn't hold up and the critics would finally be right about a movie because the previews didn't look that good. The movie turned out to be very entertaining and the perfect movie for a hot humid summer weekend, it was funny, entertaining and had some great action sequences. Was it deeply thought provoking, of course not, it wasn't meant to be. It was fun, and that's what we went to see it for, to be entertained. The casting was perfect, Will Smith was, once again, fantastic, ditto for Jason Bateman, possibly one of our most under appreciated actors, and Charlize Theron was funny and believable and, as always, beautiful.The posters on this site who have burned up the message boards talking about this being a racist movie either didn't really pay attention to the story line, or they just need to get a life. I suspect it's probably a little of both. Some people probably went into this movie looking for a racist element and would have found it no matter what. Lighten up people, and find something more constructive to do with your time, and your minds.This is a great summer movie, its fun and entertaining and that's all it is, go see it.",7,0,2,21 July 2008
Casino Royale," Well done action movie, but not James Bond
","Let me begin by saying that I'm not a huge James Bond fan, I have enjoyed the movies over the years and have seen all of them but I don't wait breathlessly for the next installment in the series to be released. In my opinion Sean Connery WAS James Bond and after him; Peirce Brosnan (to which my g.f., who is a huge fan, agrees. I had to use the jaws of life to get her off of Brosnan's statue at Madame Tussauds in London last year).We saw Casino Royal over the weekend and both of us walked away with the same opinion; it was a very well done action movie but it was not a James Bond movie. And yes, I've read some of the novels and I understand how they have always differed from the movies but that doesn't matter. Nor does it matter that this Bond has blond hair and isn't as suave as those that came before him. That's not what I'm talking about.What has always set the Bond movies apart from all others was their style. Yes, at times they were almost cartoonish and they weren't at all realistic but that didn't matter either. You went to see a James Bond movie for the incredible action, the gadgets, the women, and a very suave, very cool, very English James Bond. It was escapism at it's highest level. The Bond films were unique in that style, often imitated but never successfully. Pierce Brosnan embodied exactly what the movie James Bond always has been and always should be. Just as Damon was born to play Jason Bourne, he was born to play James Bond.We already have plenty of action movies and action movie series and action movie stars, from Ethan Hunt to Jason Bourne, the last thing we need is another one. Mr. Craig did a great job in this movie, better than Cruise's Ethan Hunt in his last outing and almost as good as Matt Damon's Jason Bourne in both movies, but that doesn't matter either.This movie is doing well but I think a lot of that is curiosity, as I said, my g.f. is a die hard James Bond fan and she wanted to see it, after seeing it she stated in no uncertain terms that Craig is not James Bond, this was not a James Bond movie and she'll pass on the next movie. I think that may be the case with a lot of people.As I've said, this movie was very well done and I enjoyed it but that just doesn't matter because, as I've also said, we already have plenty of run of the mill action films, James Bond was always different, he was above all that.Why those behind this franchise would want to toss that cache, that mystique away and lower themselves into the already crowded genre of gritty action movies is a mystery to me.

Midway," Tries to cover too much ground while still leaving out key details
","This wasn't a bad movie, I enjoyed it but it wasn't in the same league with the great war films and actually the 1976 movie Midway with Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda is a better film.Historically this film is pretty close to the mark which I did appreciate but it just tried to cover too much ground and jumped around too much. The Battle of Midway alone is a subject worthy of it's own movie, there was no need to touch, briefly and sometimes confusingly, on the Marshal Islands, the Coral Sea, and even Pearl Harbor. It made the move confusing, scattered and rushed. We watched this at home and I was constantly hitting pause to explain to my wife what was going on, and my wife is a very sharp person.Midway could have easily filled the two plus hour run time of this film on it's own. If they had done that they could have covered so many more interesting parts of the battle that were either touched on very briefly or left out all together. Some of these that come to mind;They never even show the Yorktown being attacked and only refer to it very briefly toward the end of the film.One of the most memorable aspects of the battle that has reached legendary status over the years is the doomed attack of Torpedo 8 squadron. They do touch briefly on this and show the one survivor, Ensign Gay, in the water but it deserved a lot more screen time. They didn't even show Gay being rescued and just left his fate up in the air. He later became an airline pilot and wrote a book about his experiences in the battle.There are no Wildcat fighters in the film at all, to someone who knows little about the subject it would appear that our carriers had no fighter aircraft at all because they are totally absent. Wildcats played a huge role in the battle.A great many aircrews got lost or simply ran out of fuel after their attacks and many of those were never heard from again. This has always been a haunting part of the battle for me, it's not even mentioned here.The incident in which a Dauntless crew are interrogated and then murdered by the Japanese is shown and is true to the facts so I appreciated that. I found it interesting that, after depicting this scene, and considering all the other atrocities committed by the Japanese in WWII Roland Emmerich found it necessary to honor the Japanese forces at the end of the film.I also wondered throughout the movie what was up with the wrinkled uniforms...I doubt any naval officer at the time would have appeared in such a state, war or no war.With all of that it was still an enjoyable movie but in the end something of a disappointment because it could have been so much better. Less would have been more here and sticking to the Battle of Midway would have been the thing to do. If you're interested in the battle I do recommend the 1970's movie, it's a more focused re-telling of the battle and doesn't include some of the cheesy dialogue this movie has.",6,0,0,30 March 2020
