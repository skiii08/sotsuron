"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," pretty, but stupid and shallow
","Terence Stamp can carry off anything, but this is still a shallow one-dimensional movie.   It's nice to look at - so are the actors - and if you're into drag queens, I guess you might like it a lot, but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard.   It's one of those politically correct movies that warps everything else in order to make a 'minority lifestyle' seem warm and cuddly.  It gets a lot of mileage out of bitchy dialogue, which is amusing in this sanitized form, I guess.   Ninety percent of the action is parading around in gaudy costumes in incongruous situations.   The dramatic content is a token appendage - they hardly try to get you to take it seriously.",4,8,26,10 November 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," cartoon for grownups?
","Everyone else seems to love this movie, so I guess I have to be the one to 'dis' it.  I really don't understand why it is so popular.   I really enjoy a good adventure, but I like it to be more than a quarter inch deep.It was so continuously noisy that I had to turn the volume down.   The music was bombastic and grating.  People die like flies.  The protagonists gaily wreak havoc with no apologies.  There is no psychology or character.  The hero is brave - a cheap virtue since he's obviously invulnerable.   The cultural icons dragged in to lend an exotic tone were given the most superficial treatment - everything was a throwaway, but none of it was stylish, witty or funny.  We are talking about a cartoon - except lots of cartoons are more sophisticated and better developed.I can see that the idea is to evoke a golden age of imperialism where we are excused from the duty to care about history, culture and religion, or to feel bad about archaeological piracy, mass murder, ethnic stereotypes, shoddy scholarship, etc. etc. and can just have some good clean fun.  But with all this freedom, what is the fun?   Knocking over piles of blocks like a three-year-old and punching the bad guy in the nose.The movie is a pastiche - almost every scene is borrowed.  The cultural vein of nostalgia that is being mined is old -obsolete - adventure fiction. If we could see most of this fiction now we would probably find it childish and dated - we know more about the world now.  The trick is to make us forget that so we can enjoy our nostalgia.Do people really need permission to regress this badly?",6,34,65,9 June 1999
The 13th Warrior," The 7 Samurai go North?
","This movie was supposedly taken from a Michael Chrichton book, but it looked to me like a scene-for-scene remake of the Seven Samurai. Even the wooden stockade and tall peaked houses were the same.  The fighters were not so sophisticated, but miraculously there were more of them left at the end, since there were thirteen instead of seven to start with.For a Nordic/Celtic fantasy battle film, it was more convincing than many - not that it made any sense.   It had great looking warriors, costumes, and sets, and some nice touches - learning Norse, the boy messenger.  I could watch more films shot in British Columbia!   I kept getting irritated by the cramped framing, but the general momentum of the picture was fine, with a nice shot of the boat in the fjord at the end.      Antonio Banderas doesn't much resemble an Arab, but he is cute as a button, so I'm not complaining, just so no-one tries to persuade me this was a *good* movie.",6,0,0,4 January 2001
American Beauty," Pretentious fraud
","This movie contains a number each of touching, funny, shocking, and brutally satirical scenes, all lovingly photographed and acted, from several incompatible movies that the director could have made.   The problem is, he never decided which one he was making.   Some of the ones he probably had in mind were Good Neighbor Sam, Ice Storm, and It's a Wonderful Life.I don't usually get so bent out of shape when a movie has an inconsistent tone, or doesn't respect its characters, or goes for the feel-good copout, but this movie really made me mad, because it kept pretending to offer things that it never delivered - from the pretentious omniscient after-I-died birds-eye-view to the 'just joking' clue about who killed the guy in the end.   (I hope you all don't think this is a spoiler. Actually, I don't see how you can give a spoiler for this film, because although the opener is red herring, the real ending has no particular meaning or surprise to spoil.)I suppose I should offer some justification for how much I hated this movie. Okay: 1) How warm and fuzzy should we feel about a statutory rapist, if he can't bring himself to deflower a virgin? 2) Do you think 'I was just joking' is a good way to resolve an outrageous teaser?   (How about 'and then I woke up'?) 3) Can you feel a good, warm-and-fuzzy 'go for it' kind of feeling about a guy who suddenly regresses to infantile behavior just when his wife and child really need him? 4) Do you really think that shouting, throwing food around and ruining the furniture is a good way to reestablish legitimate male authority in the family?   And that that's what women really want? 5) Do you really so jaded that adult sex won't do it for you, and you need to see teenage breasts?Fine.   Here's your movie.",3,2,3,14 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," light entertainment with a veneer of sincerity
","No one can deny American movie makers, and Spielberg is a king, can produce the best technical effects in movies.   This movie also has some wonderfully personable stars.   (Tom Hanks is great, and I liked the sergeant, too.) And the human scenes are tastefully understated - no brash posturing here. This is Hollywood art.  But under the beautiful technical veneer, is there anything more here than an incoherent collection of cliches?Is consistent thought or feeling or fundamental honesty too much to ask? What is the point of making another movie about World War II after all this time?   What does this movie say that so many others have missed, if anything?  War is a serious subject - 'serious' is a drastic understatement, if you happen to be in one - one that a new generation knows nothing about. And it doesn't look as if the world has made any progress in avoiding them, since the one depicted here.I think it's dishonest to play the patriotic sentimentality card with such intensity while claiming credit for condemning war.   To show blood and guts is not necessarily to say that war is wrong - only that it is unpleasant, or possibly, exciting.   Is shooting prisoners really wrong?   Or only what you gotta do, and the mark of a real man?   Is war really senseless?  Or is it a patriotic duty, well worth giving your life for?I have never been in a war, but I promise you war is a lot worse than what you will see here.",8,0,0,12 November 1998

","There's unexpected depth to this silly premise, the paving the way for dozens of wildly funny scenes, but nobody is forcing it on you.   Strong and warm performances by all concerned.  A satisfying resolution rarely achieved in film. Vileness is kept to a minimum - a quality harder and harder to find in comedy.  Bill Murray's best movie?",9,2,4,18 August 1998
