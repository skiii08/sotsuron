Requiem for a Dream," Dullest movie ever
","I'll never understand why people are so quick to defend dull and boring movies.I know some like 'art' movies and this is perfectly normal and acceptable, but to claim that people are 'dumb' because they find a film dull is snobbish.I'll admit, I knew nothing of this movie when I rented it, so had no expectations or pre-conceptions and yet found myself bored to tears, and my companion was worse. It really is that bad.Some will cry that is movie is a powerful telling of the slow decent into hell that drugs bring, fair enough, but that doesn't make it interesting or good.I mean, there's artistic merit in a movie about paint drying and I'm sure if such a film was released (if not done so already) there would be people on here saying how powerful and beautiful it was and those who disagree are only interested in explosions and flipping cars etc.Truth is, rubbish is rubbish, whether it's peddled as 'action', 'drama', or 'art'.Whatever this movie was to you, to me it was hours of my life I won't get back. Dull, boring, pointless.Ah, yes you say, that's the point, cause drugs,,,,, blah blah blah. You can show the loneliness of a sentry guard by having 3 hours of a guy sitting in a shed looking out, pointless, dull, boring, but is it art? Who cares!",1,7,17,8 December 2005
