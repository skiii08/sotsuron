The Blair Witch Project," The most original, inventive, & gripping film in ages
","Who ever thought you could make a movie like this and it would have turned out so well. I mean taking three unknown actors into the woods with shaky, handheld cameras and having them improvise most all the dialogue in a film that has an unseen villain and is almost completely absent of violence and gore. And somehow it is the scariest thing you will see for years to come.
Stellar horror films are few and far between. The only great ones in the last ten years were 'Seven' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. But now 'The Blair Witch Project' should be added to the list of horror classics, somewhere near the top. It does for camping what 'Psycho' did for showering and 'Jaws' did for swimming in the ocean.As the three filmmakers get lost in the woods it becomes increasingly more evident with each passing night that someone or something is following them and has not taken a liking to their presence. The events that take place each night gradually become more and more drastic, making every evening more tense and frightening than the last. It continues to build until it reaches an ending of unbelievable intensity, and a final image that is as disturbing as it is perplexing. The best thing about this movie is that it's seen entirely through the eyes of the victims. That is what makes it so damn scary. The fact that unknown actors were used also definitely makes it so much more real. When they use improvisation for dialogue they seem like normal people, and you can feel the anger, paranoia, and fear as it radiates off of them. They're great.'The Blair Witch Project' is a film that continues to haunt you long after the end credits have rolled. It stays with you. At night you may hear noises comparable to those in the movie. Just your imagination, right? This film is incredible. I loved it. Kudos to Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. You guys are geniuses!",Null,1,1,30 July 1999
Chinatown," Good, but not great
","Last year the AFI ranked 'Chinatown' #19 on a list of the hundred greatest movies of the last 100 years, just above 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. 'Cuckoo's Nest' being one of my all time favorite movies, I thought I should definitely see 'Chinatown'. While watching the movie I was interested, but not really intrigued. I know the plot had something to do with water and land deals and murder. I couldn't really get into the story. The acting was good, the ending seemed abrupt, and the whole film overall is overrated. I don't understand why this movie is considered so great. As far as film-noir goes, I thought LA Confidential was much better.",Null,0,1,9 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Not for everyone, just film buffs & Kubrick fans
","I loved this movie. I thought it was great. The direction and screenplay were terrific and the acting was impressive. It was a long film but the pacing was perfect. Things unfold slowly because much of the film is shot with a surreal, dream-like quality. The line between fantasy and reality is blurred wonderfully, without an obvious attempt to do so visible. Stanley Kubrick is probably my favorite director of all time. His films are always thought-provoking and entertaining. They range from terrifying (The Shining) to hilarious (Dr. Strangelove) to wondrous (2001: A Space Odyssey) to disturbing (A Clockwork Orange). He once again succeeds here as both writer and director. The dialogue (especially in the final scene) is intelligent and well-written. And need I even mention how great the direction is? It remains relatively basic (at least for Kubrick) until the legendary orgy scene. The orgy scene is hauntingly beautiful. It takes place in a marvelous mansion that provides a great setting for the occasion. The lighting, musical score, camera angles, setting, and positioning of the mask & cloak dressed extras make the scene an amazing example of film-making that is one to be remembered for years to come. Many complained that the way some of the scene was digitally altered (people having sex blocked by other party-goers watching) tainted the quality of it, but I don't think that it really spoiled it at all. If anything I thought it made it even creepier.
After the orgy the film unfolds like a mystery movie. Bill (Tom Cruise) tries to figure out what happened that night and what happened to the people there afterwards. The rest of the film is intriguing. One revelation after another is discovered, yet the beloved trademark ambiguity remains intact, something Kubrick was always good at. Unfortunately, I think there is some misunderstanding about this film. Most people seem to think it's just a sex thriller or something, but it's much more than that. It's more about deception and psychology than sex. The nudity and sex scenes in the movie aren't erotic but rather have a  bizarre and creepy feeling to them. The only exception to this is Nicole Kidman, who besides being insanely beautiful puts forth a great performance as Alice, the wife whose sexual fantasies haunt her thoughts and dreams.Although it has it's flaws (not many), and isn't Kubrick's best, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a beautiful, intriguing, excellent film. It's definitely the best of the year so far (but look out for 'American Beauty' this fall).",Null,0,0,17 August 1999
