Scarface," Good Fun, all lot of swearing, and one mean Cuban refugee!!!
","Scarface was first released in 1983, but it has not aged and for me it's under-rated. It is one of Al Pacino's finest performances and it has influenced so many things, from Hip Hop to fashion, The acting is great from AL to F.Murray Abraham. Michelle Pfeiffer who has not looked more stunning in any other film (ok apart from Batman Returns). The direction from Brian DePalma is good, and the script contains some of the most classic film quotes, its got designer cloths, girls, flash cars, guns, money, drugs, clubs, music what more can you ask for. I highly recommend this to anyone over 18 (Pacino says 'f***' about 100,00 times).Mark: 7.5/10",Null,0,1,13 December 2002
The Ring," There's just something creepy about this one!
","I saw The Ring last night after my brother rented it out and i found it scary....ish!. Now it takes alot to scare me because i laughed all the way through when i watched The Exorcist, Stigmata and The Omen plus i hate horror films anyway but i decided to give this one a go mainly because Naomi Watts is in it and i think shes really sexy. I thought the film was quite well made but typically Hollywood in its over the top production. That girl in it i think her name was Samara god she was horrible, creepiest little girl i've ever seen in a film, i think the secret to a good scary horror movie is to have a weird little kid causing all the havoc. And im not ashamed to admit that after i watched it and went upstairs to sleep i had to switch each light of and ran as fast as i could to the next one, you know one of them ones. Overall though it was well worth a look.Mark: 7/10",Null,7,13,31 October 2003
Training Day," A day to remember!
","LAPD officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is about to have a very bad day. Thrilled to be accepted onto the undercover narcotics unit headed by street tough detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), on his training day he will be beaten up, intimidated, placed in impossible moral quandaries - and that's before he's taken on the criminals.Washington delivers a powerhouse performance as Harris. Brilliantly twisting his good-guy persona into something charming, sexy, super-confident but ultimately darker than anyone he's played before - the Best Actor Oscar was deservedly his. Hawke also acquits himself well, able to go head-to head with Denzel and be our representative in this modern day Hell.My Rating: 7 out of 10",Null,0,10,1 July 2002
Meet the Parents," Good Comedy!
","I first saw Meet The Parents on holiday in France when I visited some relatives and I have to say it was worth the entrance fee. It is one of the funniest films I've seen for a while, most of the seens where very humorous although a bit over the top. Ben Stiller for me the king of the comedian actors proves it again as the likeable, calamity Greg, and if you liked him in this try 'Theres Something About Mary' just looking at this guy makes me laugh. Robert De Niro also shows the lengths of his acting range as the over-protective ex CIA spy hunter dad Jack, I love the way he calls Greg by his surname FOCKER.  There is also satisfactory supporting roles from Teri Polo, Blythe Danner and John Abrahams. So overall Meet The Parents is a great comedy to watch with the family.Mark: 7/10",Null,0,0,23 August 2002
Dead Poets Society," Great Movie!
","Robin Williams has tarnished his reputation somewhat in recent years with an upsetting leaning towards sentimentality, but back in 1989, he turned in what was quite possibly the performance of his life in Dead Poets Society.Also showcasing the talents of Robert Sean Leonard and a young Ethan Hawke, the film tells of a group of broading school students whose rigid world is upturned by the arrival of an unorthodox English teacher (Williams). Inspired to reform an old subversive literature club, the impassioned students spend their evenings 'sucking the marrow out of life', but their newfound love of life does not sit well against the school's austere attitude, and their gentle rebellion spirals towards tragedy.Visually sumptuous, Dead Poets Society is a perfectly moulded drama.My rating: 8/10",Null,0,1,3 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Highly Recommended!
","In terms of credit for Peter Jackson's translation of Tolkien lore onto film, there are various schools of thought. I believe that Jackson owes the originator a great dept of gratitude, whereas the other thinks that the director should have been bought one hell of a slap-up lunch by JRR should he still have Tolkien for providing such wonderfully rich source material and to Jackson for widening its audience. With a little time having pssed, if not the hype, you realise that what Jackson has accomplished is nothing short of spectacular. The scale of Middle-Earth is vast, with respect for the novels apparent  in every area. Hobbiton in particuler is stunning, given the obvious logistical problems in its creation. Jackson deserves most praise, however, for th efact that the cinematography equals the wonderment of the landscape. The camera doesn't stop at the gates of Isengard, for instance; it coils through Saruman's domain like a curious snake. As well as grandeur, though, there are many tender moments that occur, easy to neglect in that first viewing on vast screen with  all-encompassing sound. The relationship between Frodo and Sam, unrelenting and very moving, proves the centrepiece but examples are plentiful. Even the romantical scenes between Aragorn and Arwen work better than  early word would have had you believe. The casting also fulfils the expectations of the trilogy's faithful following. But though Mortenson may have the range to play Aragorn and McKellen handles Gandalf with subtlety, the real accolades fall to Wood and Astin. The latter in particular relishes his role with such sincerity that you just know how much he loves the story. Don't be embarrased, Sean, your director loves it too. Don't miss this Mark: 9/10",Null,0,0,29 August 2002
American History X," Great performance from Norton!
","I first saw AMX about a year ago and I have seen it more then 50 times since.  I was once again very impressed with Edward Norton who in my opinion is the finest actor working in hollywood today.  Ever since his break through role in Primal Fear he just seems to get better and better. Edward Furlong gives a good performance to but he just dont look like a typical skinhead.  My fave seen is at the dinner table when Derek rages at his mums jewish guest Murray, its very powerful and i don't know how Ed Norton did'net get the oscar for his work in AMX, i've never seen an actor show as much range as he did in this movie and his performance ranks up there with De Niro in Raging Bull and Al Pacino in Scarface.",Null,0,0,25 May 2002
The Usual Suspects," This ones a cracker!
","I saw this movie on video and I think its an excellent, gripping thriller that plays tricks with its audience, leading it down one blind alley after another, dealing in deliberate confusion and double-cross. Its refusal to come clean until its final revelation may infuriate some people, but I think thats part of it's appeal, its aided by some nicely edgy performances from its cast.The plot is simple enough five crooks, who meet in a police line-up and decide to work together on a couple of robberies, come to believe that they are being manipulated by a mysterious master criminal.The good thing about The Usual Suspects is not method acting or directorial flair, but its vivid, audacious, relentless intelligence. This really is a modern classic.Mark: 8.5/10",Null,0,1,19 December 2002
The Game," Another Fincher success!
","A middle-aged workaholic millionaire (Douglas) is , for his for his birthday, given a gift that casts him as a participant in a mysterious game that turns his life upside down.This is a high-energy paranoid thriller that plunges its protagonist, and the audience, into a world where nothing is to be trusted; the result is some dazzling sleight-of-hand.It boosts good performances from it's leads and great direction from David Fincher, and you will not be dissapointed with this gem of a movie.

There's Something About Mary," Tasteless, but clever
","There's Something about Mary is my favorite comedy movie. I think it's one of the funniest movies ever made because it is so unique and clever.  The actors involved are all perfectly cast. Ben Stiller is great once again as shy, but kind hearted Ted, He is always good to watch, Cameron Diaz who i'm in love with myself is also good as the beautiful Mary, There is also good support from Matt Dillon, not one of my favorite actors, but he was suprisingly amusing as the sleazy private detective Pat Healy. But I have to say my favorite character in the movie was Tucker played hileriously by Lee Evans.  So it's absolute must see comedy and I highly recommend it.Mark: 9/10",Null,0,0,12 September 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Great start from Tarantino!
","Got this on DvD and its up there with my personal favorite films, Tarantino made his name with this masterpiece but apart from Pulp Fiction he wont come close to putting together a better film. what I like about this movie is that its a tense and exciting test of male egos on a collision course with just the right mix of wit and cynicism which washes down its melodramatic excesses with sly satire on the blood-and-guts elements of crime movies, there's not many movies out there as powerful or original even do Tarantino got the idea from a Hong Kong based film.The cast are all impressive especially Harvey Keitel as Mr White( my fave character in the film) who turns in for me the best performance. Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink is also a stand out, and Michael Madsen is on top form as the phycho Mr Blonde (watch out for the torcher seen!).For me this movie was ground breaking cinema for its time and will long remain a classic. UnmissableRating: 8.5/10",Null,0,2,4 March 2004
Pulp Fiction," One of the best of the 90's
","Pulp Fiction along with Goodfellas ranks for me as the two coolest and best movies of the 90's. This film is simply the bizz its got everthing and I can watch this over and over again and it will seem better and better each time I view it. Its a clever, witty, violent celebration of junk culture, that relys a bit too heavily on past thrillers but its blessed with some excellent performances which crackle with menace.Samuel L.Jackson and John Travolta have never been nor will they be better and Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman were also great in support.This is a very funky, American sort of pop masterpiece, improbable, uproarious, with bright colors and danger and blood right on the surface.Mark: 9/10",Null,1,2,19 December 2002
Raging Bull," A Classic!
","Well what can I say about this movie!, It is my favorite film and one of the finest ever made. It was voted the best film of the 80's and rightfully so. Everything about this Raging Bull is top drew. From the directing to the actors it lives long in the memory. The film in black n white works well, Robert De Niro gives an awsome and memorable performance as troubled boxer Jake LaMotta and gains 50 pounds along the way to play the older Lamotta and easily deserved the best actor Oscar that year for his work. His acting in this movie is what all great actors should be compared to. There is strong support from Joe Pesci (always good to watch) as Jake's brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty who plays Jake's beautifull long suffering wife Vickie in her film debut, its hard to believe she was just 18 at the time. And what can you say about Martin Scorsese the guy is simply a genius and it is possible that he has directed the best film of 3 decades. Taxi Driver in the 70s, Raging Bull in the 80s and Goodfellas in the 90s. I think Raging Bull is a masterpiece!Mark: 10/10",Null,3,5,23 August 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Best of the Franchize
","A young female FBI agent (played brilliantly by Jodie Foster) seeks the advice of an imprisoned serial killer and psychiatrist named Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), to track down another mass murder.Tense, exciting and sometimes gruesome thriller, suspenceful enough to make you overlook its essential absurdities. Anthony Hopkins plays the role of the devious Lecter with jaw-breaking relish. Infact both the leads deservedly won the best actor/actress Oscars. Mark: 7.8/10",Null,0,0,19 December 2002
Trainspotting," The finest British film ever made, choose Trainspotting!
","Trainspotting is for me the best modern British film which tells the story of four 'so called friends' from Edinburgh, Scotland enjoying the highs and suffering the lows, of heroin addiction, while indulging in petty theft, sex, booze and violence whenever they are capable of it.This is a dark and ironic take on young junkies at their anti-social worst, directed with terrific energy and style by Danny Boyle, it's a witty version of the usual documentary approach to these sort of subjects, and is excellently acted by its ensemble cast. The story is told through the narration of (Ewan McGregor) who plays Mark Renton cropped haired and cheeckier then a Sex Pistol this is easily his best role to date. Renton is a bad person trying to go straight and 'choose life' but finds it very difficult with his no-hoper friends dragging him down, gormless Spud (Ewan Bremner), untrustworthy Sean Connery obsessed Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and little psycho beer monster Begbie played both intensely and hileriously by (Robert Carlyle) who just about steals the show, he's like a Scottish Joe Pesci.The soundtrack is also excellent and all in all a great movie which cost £2m to make but went on to gross nearly £50m world wide.Mark: 8.5/10",Null,0,1,2 October 2003
Goodfellas," Another Scorsese Masterpiece!
","The first time I ever watched Goodfellas, I could actually relate to the young Henry Hill when he quotes that unforgetable line 'As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster', after watching this movie I really did wanna be a gangster.Everything about this film is top drew stuff, The actors are all perfectly cast, Robert De Niro is good as the calm but cunning hoodlum legend Jimmy'the gent'Conway, Joe Pesci is funny and dangerous ashot-head Tommy DeVito and deserved the best supporting actor that year, Ray Liotta who has not produced a performance equal to this since is impressive as wiseguy turned rat Henry Hill. Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco also add good support.The movie tells the story of three decades of todays modern gangstas and what they get up to. My favorite seens are the 'what do u mean I'm funny' and the 'Go getcha f**kin shine box' both of which have become legendary.I would also like to praise the great dialogue, script and soundtrack. This movie is just so good I can't even think of anything else good enough to say about it that has not been said in other reviews, so if you have not seen this classic get of your fat arsess and go out n buy it.",Null,0,0,27 September 2002
Rock Star," Crock star!
","Watching Rock Star is like watching the 'Spinal Tap' episode ofThe Simpsons stretched over two hours, except all of the laughs are missing.Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is a Steel Dragon fanatic, dedicating his life to imitating lead singer Bobby (Flemying) and playing in his tribute band. When his over-serious, perfectionist attitude leads to an onstage brawl Chris is thrown out, mirroring the ejection of Bobby from the real Steel Dragon for being gay (He is colourfully referred to as a 'sausage jockey' by his bandmates'). This opens the door for Chris, who joins the band and jumps feet-first into the hedonism of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle with his girlfriend/manager Emily (Aniston) along for the ride.  As Chris becomes embroiled in the trappings of fame and alienated from Emily, she leaves and he starts to question the validity of what he's doing.Well shot and acted, with nice stylistic touches from Herek, the problem with Rock Star is that it's just plain boring. At no pont do we care about the characters, with their distinct absence of chemistry, and the concert sequences, although spectacular, are repetitive and soulless. The only redeeming feature comes from Timothy Spall as the vulgar road manager, Mats.
