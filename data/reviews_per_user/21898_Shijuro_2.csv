Iron Man 3," Spectacular, and somewhat stupid (vague spoiler inside)
","They introduce but don't resolve a major issue with Tony, but unnecessarily 'resolve' an issue central to the character. Bad physics in evidence throughout, and Tony does some unnecessarily stupid things. The explosions and spectacularly unlikely falls are so numerous as to become numbing. Most overused: the suit-falls-onto-Tony-midair-in-nick-of-time routine (I lost count).I'd gladly re-watch either of the first two films or the Avengers yet again than this. Disappointing.",5,0,1,11 May 2013
Batman Begins," It gets it all right
","I was expecting just another Batman movie, although I had heard this one was quite good and allowed myself to hope it would be. I walked out of the theater thinking they got EVERYTHING right.Intriguing plot, perfect casting, impeccable pacing, special effects that were beyond what was necessary without being distracting, amusing without being silly, truly frightening in parts, and the best job of rationalizing and explaining everything about the world of Batman... This was a great movie.I'm going to have to see it again. I just can't believe I've finally found a film that gets everything right, and with a licensed property even.",10,1,2,20 July 2005
