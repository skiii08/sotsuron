First Man," Mesmerizing
","Damien Chazelle, I don't know how you do it but you've done it again. 'First Man' is superb. In its documentary feel, utterly realistic depiction of the early days of the space programme with meticulous attention to details, in making something we've all heard of look somewhat new and even unpredictable. What they've managed to achieve is a beautiful balance of intimate and epic especially in those sequences with quick switches between the every-day life shots and NASA realities. And it's been remarkably done with brilliant colour grading, Linus Sandgren's cinematography which makes you feel a part of the movie in almost every single shot, and Justin Hurwitz soundtrack - hauntingly beautiful, touching yet powerful. Gosling's subtle, restrained and internalized performance is well matched by Claire Foy who I guess might pick up a supporting role Oscar nomination for this. All in all, a beautiful piece of film-making to be experienced on a big screen. I left the theatre feeling as if I've just been to the Moon myself along with Neil. I guess it says it all.
