Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yet another great film from Lucas
","This is another great movie from Lucas.  He has again given viewers a chance to forget about real life and enjoy two and a half hours of bliss. Phantom Menace begins to play out the story of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan while setting the story for the following two movies.  A slow start but quickly moves into a fast paced, exciting trip of fight scenes, visual effects, and beautiful worlds.  Much of the movie, I was just in awe of the scenery and characters that Lucas has 'invented' in his mind.  The planet of Naboo was incredible to say the least and the new look at Tantooine is amazing. The new characters were refreshing with some being funny and some being quite strange and new.  The acting was weak in a few places but got increasingly better as the film moved on.  Overall, I thought the movie was great and will definitely go see it again (maybe just to try to get a glimpse at the 3 E.T.s in the senate).  Go see knowing you will have fun and experience a great overall visit to the theater.",8,0,0,3 June 1999
