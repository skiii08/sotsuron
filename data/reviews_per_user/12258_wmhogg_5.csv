Black Swan," Transparent and Superficial
","I was late in seeing this movie due to work and travel obligations, so I eagerly awaited my chance to rent the DVD and be able watch this award-winning film.First of all, I'm a big Natalie Portman fan, so I don't fault her in any of my criticism.However, the movie was so transparent that it was very disturbing that the writers and directors didn't try to lead you down the path where you had to keep guessing, like in Fight Club and Shutter Island.Instead, I knew from the beginning that Nina had driven off of a cliff and the rest of the movie was watching the bits and pieces of life pass by before she inevitably crashed on the ground below. The ending was never in doubt.It was so clever to have a womanizing director demanding quid pro quo for his favors in his starlets' ballet careers. I've never seen that before.As a psychological drama, this fails on many fronts and seems to have been geared toward pretty unsophisticated viewers, that is if they felt that they were fooling anyone about what was happening in the whole movie. They may not have intended to fool anyone at all, which would make the movie even worse.That said, Natalie did a great job as usual.",1,10,17,1 July 2011
The Matrix Revolutions," A Terrible Disappointment
","I just saw Revolutions. My love affair with the Matrix that began in 1999 is now over.  The Wachowski brothers have followed the George Lucas formula for movie trilogies: (1) Great first movie (2) In the 2nd movie, deconstruct the premises and change the 'truths' in the first movie. (3) In the 3rd movie, continue to change the premise of the original movie to the point that the 3rd movie is unrecognizable to someone who has only viewed the first movie.While the special-effects were draw-dropping, I feel like I didn't see any character development from the main characters.  I also didn't see the relationships develop further.  I've seen the first two movies 6 times at the theaters, and countless times on the DVD's I own.  I own the Animatrix and have read nearly all of the online material.It seems like the main story line became an after-thought.  The resolution of the conflict with the machines was unsatisfying.  The main love story was terminated very uneventfully.  The minor characters became the featured players in 'Revolutions', which is sad. How did Morpheus react to Neo's and Trinity's death?  How was his belief in the Oracle altered, or reinforced? What was the future of Morpheus and Niobe's relationship?The end of the movie was fitting in that the people I could have cared least for had the featured roles.  I'm sure that there was a reason for the people acting like machines and the machines acting like people, but I don't understand it in the context of the first movie, still my favorite of all time.I felt a deep sense of loss when I left the theater.  My gut feeling is that the Wachowski brothers had tired of the main characters and just dumped them all unceremoniously.  I agree with them.  Now, I don't care about the Matrix either.",Null,0,0,15 November 2003
Wanted," One of the Largest Wastes of Time Ever
","As a big fan of the Matrix, I was entertained by this movie during the first hour, except that sometimes dialog devolved into bleep bleepin' bleep! That was so bleep! Are you bleeping me? I think the script could have used some serious editing so that actual information could have been conveyed in the dialog, instead of just how amazing PO'd the character was (all the time).When the plot twist occurred (think Star Wars), the movie actually expected me to go back and revise everything I had seen, including bullets running into each other, which would have otherwise been fatal.'I was shooting at you to help you, not kill you!' Yeah, right! My suspension of disbelief was over at that point. Then, with a more critical eye, I looked at all the other ridiculous plot elements, and realized I had pretty much wasted all of my time watching this thing.I noticed that a lot of people who liked the movie also read the graphic novel. That probably makes the movie a lot more palatable and fills in blanks so that what is seen is not nonsense.For those of us unfamiliar with the graphic novel, the movie turned on that one plot twist in a very disappointing fashion. I'm sorry, but rather than believe the movie, I'm believing 'my lying eyes'.So, my final comment would be: 'Bleep bleepin' bleep! That was so bleep! Are you bleeping me?'",1,8,13,19 December 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Worst Spiderman Movie Ever
","Okay - I had read the reviews and I knew that this was not going to be a great movie. So, I went into it with lowered expectations. However, I cannot describe how far below even my lowest expectations this movie was.Don't get me wrong, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Sally Fields, and Jamie Foxx all give fine performances. It's not their fault that the writing, directing, and editing were so terrible. The characters behave with very little understandable motive for their actions except that the story needed them to act that way. For example, a man who worships Spiderman night and day suddenly, with just a minor provocation, wants nothing more out of life than to live in a world without Spiderman.The clich√©s in the movie were awful. They even had a character to torture and study Jamie Foxx that spoke with a German accent, wore a black glove, and was in love with the pain he was able to inflict upon his subject. I've never seen that before...The Green Goblin character seemed to be an after-thought, and very little effort was made to explain how this little waif, all of 115-pounds, suddenly had awesome fighting skills and amazing weapons. I don't understand how the Marvel franchise can boast really entertaining films like Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers, and then turn this particular superhero over to writers and a director that obviously had little time to spend on their craft. Orci and Kurtzman have produced very high quality work in the past, so there is no excuse for this poor effort.This is clearly the worst Spiderman ever, including the cheesy cartoon series from the 1970's. The most regrettable part of this is that everyone knows better. Everyone in the studio knew this was a bad script, and yet they let it get out the door and onto the screen in that condition.I would love to know the back-story of how this film was made, and how the politics of this film allowed it to be completed and presented as if it were a comparable piece of the Marvel Superhero empire. Clearly, it's not a worthy effort of the studio, and should be shunned by all lovers of Spiderman.",1,7,35,23 August 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Good action film, not as much fun as the first.
","First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Some of the things that bothered me have to do with comic relief, and I just simply let those go, like the 'humping' of Megan Fox's leg by the little robot.More to substance, I thought that Megan Fox's character had been given a lobotomy since the last film. She had previously pretended to not be smart. She didn't want people to know that she knew a lot about automobiles, because, as she explained, guys don't like a girl smarter than them.When the final battle occurred in the first film, Megan Fox's character lashed up Bumblebee and drove while he fired at the Decepticons. It was her idea. She was brave and smart. That was appealing.Her cooing and dreamy eyes when looking at Sam, in 'Revenge of the Fallen', would have almost tolerable, if she had not gone for the fake Marilyn Monroe voice, stereotypical of dumb blonds.It seemed like no matter what was going on, all Megan Fox could do was look at him, with her lips parted, inviting him to kiss her. Even in the midst of battle, all she wanted was Sam to say, 'I love you', first.I like tough women in films. It's because I believe that they are just as capable as men. So give me Sigourney Weaver in 'Aliens' over 'Revenge of the Fallen's' Megan Fox any day. Lena Headey in the Sarah Connor Chronicles, was just one of many smart, tough women in the series.So, all we got from Megan Fox was 'eye candy', and not a substantive performance. Maybe that's all that mattered to Michael Bay.I also was offended by the Jar-Jar negative stereotype 'guys from da hood' represented by the Twins. I got over it eventually and laughed at many of their lines. I just wish it had not been so disrespectful and racially biased.Those are my two problems with the movie. By the end, I was cheering like all the other people in the theater at Optimus Prime's triumph, and would go see it again.",10,9,20,3 July 2009
