Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Doubt from critics completely unfounded
","I walked into the theatre fairly unsure of what to expect. I'd heard so many horrible things from the critics and now I was to see it for myself.It was slow starting and the character Jar Jar Blinks got on my nerves early on. But I learned to love even that silly character because the other characters didn't take him seriously (just like we, out here in the real world don't take silly people seriously). After the beginning, I felt unsure of where the movie was going and began to doubt. Oh ye of little faith.As the movie progresses, it all starts to tie together. By the end of the film, we are brought from a slow and calm start to an absolute tour-de-force of special effects, action, and passion that will absolutely blow you away. Leave your worries at the door. George Lucas is back in the director's chair.",8,0,1,19 May 1999
