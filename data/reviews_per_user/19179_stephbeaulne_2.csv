Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Worth seeing
","I think it goes without saying but Kill Bill Vol. 2 is well worth seeing. Even if you haven't seen the first part you can see this one and not feel like you've missed anything. If you're expecting to see as much blood as in the first one you might be disappointed because there's really no blood shed, in terms of Vol. 1 blood shed, at all. The fight between Elle and The Bride, who's real name is revealed, is pretty good and ends quite painfully for Elle. The ending, when she kills Bill, is a bit of a letdown but she got her revenge so I guess that's what counts. If you were planning on staying to see the blooper, all five seconds of it, after the end credits I'd suggest waiting until it's released on DVD because it's really not worth it. The movie, with about ten minutes of end credits, last just under 2 hours and 20 minutes. Thumbs up.",Null,0,1,17 May 2004
Apocalypse Now," Great film
","This is a great film and truly deserves to be listed as one of the 100 greatest films of all time but my problem is with Francis Ford Coppola's Redux version of the film. The extra 52 minutes are just unnecessary and the whole plantation scene, which is a majority of the 52 new minutes, just drags on and takes away from the story. The film could of also done without the added Playboy Playmates scenes. I'm not saying that Redux is a bad film but if you haven't seen Apocalypse Now before and don't know which version of the film to see I recommend sticking with the original version if you truly want to enjoy this film and see it in all its glory.",Null,0,1,29 May 2004
