Insidious: Chapter 2," Awesome film
","Film is very gripping, scary and awesome. This movie is one of the best I have ever watched. I really like films that are talking about ghosts and their interaction in human world. This film describes the way to do astral projection. It is talking about the relationship between human world and world of spirits, and how to enter the spirit world. My favorite scene of this film is when the mother of Parker Crane attacks Cali and her mother. Also, I like the conjuring scene. However, I dislike ending scene, because it seems like the film is not finished yet, and I dislike the 'My name is Parker' scene, because it seems a bit violent, but I really like this film.",9,0,0,1 November 2015
