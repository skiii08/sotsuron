Your Name.," An enjoyable watch if you like animations
","I'm not too familiar with Japanese anime movies, but this movie was very enjoyable. It honestly grew on me, after having had some time to think about the movie. The movie has a well thought-out plot, with good characters that are easy to empathise with. Some of the scenes were beautifully animated, adding 3D elements, with big differences and foreground and background focus, making it often feel as though you are watching a normal film, instead of an animation. I did however feel that the female character's voice was a bit whiny at times, and it made me think I was watching a baby toddler having a tantrum instead of a teenager, but this may be more to Japanese taste than mine. Overall an enjoyable watch, would recommend it if you are into animations.",7,2,8,8 April 2017
Match Point," Riveting portrayal of infidelity
","Just finished watching this, and the plot gripped me all the way through from beginning to end. Sure there were things to dislike, the not-always accurate British accents, the at-times cheesy dialogue, with slightly too long stares into nothingness, but so much more to like! Matthew Goode and Emily Mortimer play very believable upper-class English characters, and the dialogue flows so naturally, you'd believe you were sitting right in the room with them and their family, listening to their conversations.In my opinion Woody Allen does a great job in making use of the theme of luck, mixed in with some tennis, offering a surprising twist at the end that might have you reconsidering the effect of luck on your own life afterwards. Despite a few minor flaws, a very enjoyable watch!
