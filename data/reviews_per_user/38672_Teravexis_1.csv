The Monuments Men," Presumable award contender falls short in every category
","It is no surprise that The Monuments Men was one of the most anticipated titles of last year. The cast, the story, the trailers all made the movie look like an instant classic. Sadly, it's more the contrary.The story goes as follows: A group of middle-aged men is trying to stop the Nazis from dispatching famous pieces of art. The idea sounds great, doesn't it? It should have been great. The problem lies in the way the story is presented: There doesn't seem to be any continuation. It's as if the chapters were created on their own, and placed with no regard to the story whatsoever. The script is too cheesy and often feels out of place, not something you would expect from a movie like this. The cast looks promising, the characters they play don't. Clooney and Damon kind of overshadow for instance Murray and Blanchett, simply because they feel their role is to be more 'prominent' than the rest.All in all, the movie is good, but doesn't live up to its expectations in any possible way, which is a shame. This could have been so much more.",6,1,3,16 February 2014
