The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Not just another teen movie...
","'The Perks of being a wallflower' is beautiful and touching tale of adolescence and the trials and tribulations of high school as seen through the eyes of a misfit kid named Charlie.At first glance this movie may seem like the dozens of other high school movies that do the rounds each year (weird kid hits high school, weird kid gets hard time, weird kid meets hot girl blah blah blah). Although there is some romance in this story it is by no means the focal point of this movie. It is a story about a troubled kid finding himself and on the way friends, drugs, music, passion and love. The acting talents of the young stars in this movie are incredible. I personally had reservations about Emma Watson playing Sam (a character in the book I loved). However she certainly proved herself. Logan Lerman as Charlie was not quite what I expected but his interpretation of the character was an interesting one that seemed to work. As much as I loved the film there was a few things that bothered me. In the novel Charlie writes letters to an anonymous person and yes, I know this was seen in the movie too. However I felt this was such an important aspect of the book that it should have been a more prominent part of the movie in seeing Charlie grow. Apart from a few faults The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a beautiful movie punctuated with a killer soundtrack and wonderful cast. It's one of those movies that when it finishes you will want to sit wherever you are for a few brief moments and just...think.",8,2,4,14 October 2012
