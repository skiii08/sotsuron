Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," absolutely terrible
","I don't care if your from the US or not, this movie has the worst morals depicted in theatres. Borat is clearly seen as racist against Jewish, feels women are inferior, should be enslaved to men and are sex items. The movie itself shows dirty situations to people you would usually be cheering for. Good humor would rather see some jackass getting the blunt end of Borat's disgusting habits (crap in a bag and bring it to the table) rather than a church pastor.As a resolve to the movie, they show Borat's country executing a Jew on the cross and poking him like they did in Jesus' crucifixion. What sort of movie resolves with a distasteful hatred against anyone? So what if the Arab nations hate Israel, movies shouldn't be horribly stereotypical, much less visually show it.All of the trailers are very misleading. I imagined this movie was full of slapstick and situational comedy, but to play on racism, sexism, stereotypes of the church, and a bad taste in who participates in the situations was absolutely terrible. This is not worth true comedy's time.",1,55,109,25 November 2006
