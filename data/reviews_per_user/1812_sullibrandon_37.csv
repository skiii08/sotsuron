Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Scathingly Brilliant Comedy
","In his new movie Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazahkstan (you'll only see me use the full title once in this review), Cohen sets a comedic milestone in film history, soaring above everyone else's heads, leaving all other films in the dust, with its genius blend of documentary, slapstick comedy, sharp political wit, intelligent social critique, and all-out gut-busting hilarity.From the slums of Borat's home village in Kazahkstan all the way coast of California, nothing is off-limits. Filmed as part mockumentary, part road trip, the movie follows Cohen as he travels across the country as Borat, a Kazahkstani journalist who is on a mission to America to learn more about our culture so that he can better aid the Kazahkstani government. The catch is this, though: everything in the film is real. None of the people, as they were being interviewed, knew that Borat was actually Cohen, allowing a full-out range of comedy to unfold.The kind of comedy this movie gives has been questioned - many people find it horribly offensive and can't laugh at it. Comedy survives, it thrives, when people take chances. Cohen has taken these chances, and the result is a comedy that knows no bounds. This film is the funniest film of the year, probably even the funniest film that I've ever seen. It is the kind of movie that will have you laughing literally every two minutes or less. More than likely it will be every thirty seconds. You'll burst out laughing, your sides will begin to hurt, you'll be bent over in stitches, but you'll have to compose yourself so that you can hear the next joke that comes along. You can choose to be offended by what Borat says and does, but you'll only miss out on the most amazing comedy in years. I can laugh when Borat is terrified of a couple of Jews that he ends up needing to room with, I can howl with hilarity when he slowly realizes that some gay people may have taken advantage of him, but this doesn't mean I'm homophobic or anti-Semitic. I am laughing at the character. I am laughing at the poor soul who unwittingly plays right into Cohen's clever comedic traps. Cohen is the heart and soul of this film. He inhabits his character so thoroughly and so believably that if you met him on the street you probably wouldn't question him either. People who are offended by this film cling so desperately to their previously conceived notions of decorum, politeness, and properness, that they themselves are revealed to be prejudiced, the very target of Cohen's brilliantly aimed comedic missile. It is precisely our ideas of what is offensive and what is not that make this movie so devilishly hilarious. Lighten up, people - some things really aren't that important.The low point of the movie occurs when it delves into near Jackass quality with a scene of extensive nudity. But that's just about the only thing that's 'wrong' with the film, and it isn't even really wrong. It is hilarious, though, and it works for the scene. It doesn't feel contrived at all.With Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen has crafted an intelligent, sharp, witty, comedic masterpiece, one with bite, brawn, and scathingly intelligent and clever satire. It has no equal. Nothing can compete, and nothing will stand in its way. Even its detractors only enhance its genius. Merciless, smart, and above all, hilarious, this film heralds a new age of fearless comedy.",10,2,13,6 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Mind-blowing nonstop action
","Mission: Impossible III is an action packed adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat virtually the whole time, with plenty of taut tense moments where you honestly won't know what happens next. Though the storyline itself is a little bit predictable, it is a a few steps up from the second Mission: Impossible. It also gives us a new side of Ethan Hunt's character, one of the high points of the movies, and one of the main reasons I am giving it such a high rating.The first half hour focuses on Ethan Hunt and how he is engaged to be married to a woman he is completely in love with. We learn how he is no longer doing field work, but has instead chosen a quieter life where he just trains new recruits into IMF. Not surprisingly, something goes horribly wrong on what was supposed to be a routine IMF mission, and Ethan decides to take part in a rescue mission to attempt to retrieve an IMF agent that may have valuable information in relation to a mastermind criminal known as Owen Davian. From the moment the mission begins till the end of the movie, there is virtually no break in the action, except for maybe the occasional three to five minute interval, but even those are filled with tension so thick you could cut it with a knife.The movie is directed by J.J. Abrams, and he had a hand in the script as well. You can expect great things from the creator of two of TV's biggest smash hits, Lost and Alias. Abrams proves he is not just good for extending tension through forty minutes of TV, but two hours of film as well. His talent translates well onto the big screen, something which I was slightly apprehensive about. He also breathes new life into the Mission: Impossible series by showing us Ethan Hunt's personal life, what goes on outside his mind-blowing missions. He is not just a mindless, perfect agent automaton anymore. He has a heart. He has a life. He has love, and it is this love that drives the movie, helped along of course by Tom Cruise's incredible acting.The action is relentless, creative, but when compared to the first movie, with the unbelievable scene where Ethan Hunt steals the NOC list, it falls just a little bit short, so I must deduct points for that. In M:i:III there are plenty of amazing and grandiose stunts, but they seem a little extreme sometimes, trying to outdo the first one by making all the stunts huge and big, with massive explosions and jumping from buildings hundreds of stories high. All the stunts are beautifully pulled off, but may be a tad bit too much, from a critic's standpoint.The villain of the film is another high point - though we've all seen the calm villain that proves he is evil by talking calmly about horrible things, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Academy Award winner for Capote, if you'll recall, makes it just interesting enough to hold our attention without dismissing him as just another typical calm/evil movie villain.The storyline of M:i:III is the worst part about it. And when I say worst, I mean it works really well for a spy thriller, but it's just a tad bit too generic. It is predictable, where they are going in the movie and how they are getting there, but only on a grand scale - the many twists and turns within the movie are enough to overshadow this by a large amount, and there are plenty of gasp moments in the movie and 'oh my gosh!' Of course I cannot review M:i:III without mentioning Tom Cruise's making a fool of himself over the past year, whether it be raving about how much he loves Katie Holmes, or spouting how everyone should follow Scientology. This is a man who has done something that no Hollywood star has ever done before: created a perfect track record. His movies have not made less than $100 million in years. Even those that have not have earned critical acclaim or created a massive following, such as his debut, the incomparable Risky Business. He is a genius when it comes to picking movie projects, and everything he touches can pretty much be guaranteed to turn to box-office gold. He has an unbelievably charismatic personality. And he went away and threatened to destroy all that by making a fool of himself. M:i:III will be the deciding factor on whether or not his off screen antics affect his box-office potential. I have no doubt M:i:III will make a lot of money, probably between $150 million and $200 million, maybe even a little bit higher. But it won't be enough. If makes anything less than the second movie, it will prove that the age of Cruise is drawing to a close.On the whole, M:i:III is a beautifully directed, beautifully written, beautifully choreographed, and beautifully acted movie. I recommend it without any reservations. It functions very well as its own action packed movie, with plenty of character development and creative, mind-blowing action. Well worth the price of admission.",8,3,5,23 May 2006
United 93," A heart-wrenching tribute to those heroic passengers
","How does one review a movie like this? It's not your typical terrorist action movie. It's not meant to do a lot of things that are expected of good movies, and its subject matter is so close to the hearts of Americans that many people dismiss it without even having seen it, saying it's inappropriate that people are making money off of this tragedy, that it's too soon after what happened to make this kind of movie, and so on. Though these accusations may have some substance to them, I found United 93 to be a satisfyingly reverent tribute to the heroism of those passengers on that fateful day the morning of September 11.The movie opens with the terrorists in motel rooms, praying and getting ready for the deed they are about to perform. Then we are taken to a national air traffic control center, then to the airport, where we see many of the passengers getting ready to board. Throughout the movie, we are taken in a sort of loop through four different set pieces: United 93, NORAD control center, an Air Traffic control center, and the FAA.Paul Greengrass, the director, shows us very well the immense confusion there was over all the hijacking of the planes. Through different cuts, all around the set pieces, we see the realization and the, at first, innocent worry over the 'hijacking' of various planes. They pretty much know that the planes are hijacked, but they don't know what for. Eventually they see the smoke pouring out of the world trade center. And then, the dreadful sight of another plane barreling toward the second tower. We live, once more, through the dread that occurred on that day in history.Greengrass shows nothing but reverence for the material. He knows there are many people out there to whom this is still a very tender matter, and that if he made the wrong film, many people would almost literally go up in arms against him. Never once does he try to glamorize anything that occurred. It is all presented, directly at us, in a straight-forward, no nonsense manner. The score for the film is very muted, only appearing when it needs to, always taking a backseat to the story. It builds dread when it needs to, heightens sadness, and then just fades away to let the story tell itself. Camera-work is mostly, if not completely, hand-held, adding to the chaotic feel of that day. Though the story may also get a little confusing at times, it works for the material, and is purposefully portrayed that way.Also notable is how there is no attempt to give a back story to any of the characters on United 93. In a normal film like this, you would maybe show brief flashbacks of each person's family as they boarded the plane, but not here. Greengrass knows there is no reason for this. This film is about the heroism that occurred that day, and any attempt to give character to these people would be superfluous. We've all heard their stories.Once the passengers start planning the attack on the terrorists, the tension builds exponentially. Here is someplace where the story could have easily gone wrong, yet still, showing immense sensitivity for the subject matter, Greengrass directs it perfectly. The passengers start talking, knowing they have to do what they have to do. These aren't superhuman action heroes - these people could be you, me, the person you sit next to on the bus, the person you see walking down the street. We see glimpses of people calling their loved ones - weeping into the phone, knowing this may be the last time they ever speak to them. When the moment comes and they make their move on the terrorists, with the now famous: 'let's roll' there are heart-stopping moments and heart-soaring moments. What makes it all the more tragic is that you know they will be successful in overtaking the plane, but you also know that they won't have time to avoid the crash. There is a heart-wrenching moment when it flashes back and forth between the terrorists praying and the people in the back of the plane praying. This movie is the closest that I've come to crying in a long while.United 93, I believe, is the most effective and poignant movie that could be made about that fateful flight. No energy is wasted on anything superfluous. There is no character development, but there doesn't need to be - these people are who they are. They do not seem like Hollywood actors either - a wise choice by Greengrass to choose a cast of unknowns to play them. They seem completely real - never once did I stop and think, 'hey, you know what, those aren't actually them!' In fact, in the scenes outside of the plane, many of the people play themselves. The entire film just sweeps you up in its simple, yet visceral, reality. I am giving this movie a 10/10, not because I believe it is perfect, but because I believe it is the best possible tribute film that could be made to those heroic passengers on that airplane. There is no attempt to paint a larger picture either - we see nothing going on outside of the immediate situation concerning this plane - no talk of Al Qaeda, Bin Laden, the President....it is just simply these passengers. The film just wrenches at your heart with the tragedy, and never once seems glamorized, cheesy, or insulting to these people's memory. It is not a film meant for us to enjoy, but it is a film meant for us to see, and I highly recommend it.",10,3,7,23 May 2006
Fight Club," Not a bad movie, but not a great one either
","Fight Club is not a bad movie, per se, but it really does not deserve all the credit that is given to it for being such an awesome movie. It started out fine, I was enjoying myself, well, not necessarily enjoying it, but I liked that it was mentally stimulating - I can respect that about Fight Club. But then the movie just turned....weird. The idea of these characters being part of an underground fight club was not a bad idea, but what the filmmakers did with it might have been. There was a book written about it, and the book focuses much more on the psychological aspect of all that is going on. Obviously, Fight Club is also a very intensely psychological film, but it doesn't seem to entirely know what it is doing with this.It is a movie with no particular teaching in mind or direction in its step. It is a movie in which the director, through intertwining suspense, violence and dialogue, tries to pound into the viewer some sort of questioning or some sort of thing to make us think. Unfortunately, because of the director's attempt to make the viewer ask questions, what comes onto the screen is a jumble of jargon, the focal point of which is the fighting, not the psychological aspects. Occasional mention of sex is thrown in liberally, and somehow made to fit into the plot line, but on the whole it seems kind of useless. The movie to me was just confusing and really not that great. Like I said, it's not a bad film, it just isn't all that.I like plot twists in movies, and the plot twist in Fight Club wasn't all that bad. In fact, it might have made the movie. But there were several factors that didn't work for me. One was the way the plot twist seemed just kind of tossed in there. I mean, obviously, it is integral to the whole story, but I could tell that if the entire storyline was looked at completely intensely, every piece would not fit into place. In the Sixth Sense, every last piece fit perfectly. In Fight Club, it obviously didn't. Also, the ending of the movie kind of spoiled the whole thing for me. The guy shoots himself in the mouth, stays alive for several minutes afterward, and everything continues on as it was going too, except for the fact that Edward Norton's character is going to die. What the heck!? The entire movie just seems confusing for the sake of being confusing. It believes that if a movie is thought-provoking, it is automatically classified as good. That is not necessarily true. I could take a bucket of truth and have characters in a movie speak several twisted versions of it, toss it into a setting, a story, and a climax, and call it a movie, but that doesn't mean it's good. Too much of Fight Club seems like this. Yes, it is very thought-provoking. My thoughts were provoked. Yet there is something integral missing, that piece of movie-making that makes other movies good, and the lack of it leaves Fight Club somewhere in that place between a strange movie and a great movie.",5,0,3,13 February 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pure, Fun, and Completely Enjoyable Popcorn
","Watching the previews for Dead Man's Chest, I felt slightly apprehensive. I saw a whole bunch of weird creatures, dizzying chases through forest-scapes, and the perennial Captain Jack back and acting like his old quirky and slightly drunk self again. It seemed like this movie might make the mistakes of The Matrix Reloaded, heaping action scene upon action scene, whilst pushing character development way to the side in favor of large explosions and mythical sea creatures. I am happy to report that Dead Man's Chest delivers just as many thrills as the first one, plus a few dozen others along the way. Sacrificing neither character, nor original story, DMC consistently delivers clever witty comedy, fantastic special effects, excellent cast chemistry, and action reminiscent of the good old Indiana Jones days.The story begins with Captain Jack Sparrow making yet another unforgettable entrance. We learn that Sparrow made a deal with the master of the sea - Davy Jones. Now his blood debt is coming up, and he must pay it. The only way Sparrow can get out of this is if he manages to kill Davy Jones. Alongside this storyline intersects another - both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner have been sentenced to death for helping Sparrow in the original film. Their stories collide, and thus a new and worthy Pirates story is born.DMC starts out slow. I believe the reason for this was that it seemed Captain Jack had worn out his welcome in the three years since the last film. His acting seemed a bit forced, as did other quips and witty sayings from other members of the cast. However, this quickly evaporated as the incomparable Johnny Depp settled comfortably back into his role, setting just the right tone - somewhere between clever and insane. Or maybe both. Keira Knightley is back as Elizabeth Swann, with a much greater role and a more interesting chemistry with both Will Turner and Captain Jack. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner seems to be the slightest bit eclipsed the grandiose quality of the film in which he is in, but still, his character is expanded and given as much space as can be expected in a film like this. We are also introduced to new characters, including Bill Nighy as the squid-like Davy Jones.The sea-creatures that make up Davy Jone's crew must be mentioned here. They are some of the most creative, grotesque, and fascinating villains to ever grace the silver screen. Each one is completely unique and different too - they are quite a step-up from the skeletal pirates in the original movie. Davy Jone's face that is half-made up of tentacles makes his just scary enough, but not too over the top. Bill Nighy's acting is finely pulled off as well.Above all, what sells DMC is the action. Forget The Last Stand. Forget Superman Returns. Though each of those were fine movies in their own right, DMC trumps all of them, because its action does not require mutants firing fireballs at each other, or planes threatening to destroy baseball stadiums. This is a good, clean, fun action romp that we really don't get to see that often.This film is reminiscent of the good old days, like Star Wars, and, as I've mentioned twice before, Indiana Jones. It just simply is so well pulled off that I don't believe the action in DMC could have been any better than it was.My qualms with the movie are minimal. As I mentioned, the movie seems a bit self-conscious at first - as if trying to very purposefully to live up to the first one. There is an incongruous set piece, about fifteen to twenty minutes long, where Jack gets captured by a bunch of natives, who, in an age-old cliché, come to think of Jack as their god. Eventually, of course, he escapes, but this long intermission from the main course of the story is very distracting. The action is very creative and very well done, but it just seems tacked on there for the sake of a longer and more action filled movie. Oh well. It works, I guess. Another personal qualm was Jack's old flame - an annoying African shaman queen, or whatever she was. She just seemed kind of cheap, and she was hard to understand. Oh yeah, and one last thing - Jack says 'bugger' too much. He said it zero times in the first movie; why is he saying it so much now? It seems a more clever phrase could have been used - one 'bugger' could have been okay, but six or seven? Ultimately, also, DMC is a tad too long - at 2 1/2 hours of running time, though drag is minimal, a simple snip of that unnecessary scene with the natives would have helped to sail this ship quite faster.Don't listen to the reviews. It saddens me when critics try to make a movie out to be more than it wants to be. Fans of the first Pirates did not want a sequel that was more thoughtful, more brooding, and more of a focus on character development, while giving a backseat to the action. What fans want, Gore Verbinski, the director, delivers. More action, more crazy special effects, more Johnny Depp, more of everything that made the first one such a smash hit. This is the Pirates movie that everybody wants to see. Not some high and mighty character study exploring why Jack Sparrow is the way he is, or why Davy Jones is such an upset bugger. Though it may be a tad overloaded, this is completely forgivable, considering how spectacular the movie is. This the first pure, all-out, no-holds barred, popcorn movie of the summer, completely worth a movie ticket, and, if things hold up all right, maybe the third film will be worth a ticket as well.",10,4,8,7 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," An Excellent Tribute to CS Lewis's Classic
","If anyone tries to tell you that this movie is boring, unconvincing, and has crappy special effects, don't listen to them. After reading a few of the user comments about this movie here on IMDb, one major trend I saw was that people thought that A, it was boring, B, it had bad special effects, and C, it was not a good adaptation. All 3 of these are completely wrong.First of all, this film is anything but boring. The child actors chosen for the parts are the best choice in the world. These children play their parts to perfection, and they are completely believable as the Pevensie family. They are talented, believable, emotional, and they gel unbelievably well as brothers and sisters. I never once questioned their bond as siblings. They just....fit. Lucy's wide-eyed wonder when she first enters Narnia is magical...in fact Andrew Adamson specifically did not show the actress the set until that day...she was brought in blindfolded so that her expression of joy when the blindfold was taken off could be fully captured on camera. People's accusations for the boringness of the film are only due to the fact that the children take awhile to get to Narnia. If you are looking for a slam-bang movie with nonstop action, Narnia is not for you. It is a sweet, loving, tale with some mighty fine action in there, but with a core of four young kids in a foreign land, forced to become heroes by living up to the prophecy about them. I greatly respected the filmmakers choice to not try force the children into Narnia right away, without any back-story. The whole set up of the bombing in London, then the train trip to the house, then the hide and go seek game...it all worked perfectly to give the audience time to absorb, learn, and understand the characters of these children. Without this set-up...they wouldn't really be anything else than excuses to have action. The way the film works, with about an hour before any major action, is excellent.As for the bad special effects accusation...this is simply absurd. The Chronicles of Narnia had some of the best special effects of the year, and the only picture that out-did it, I believe, was King Kong, whose special effects were mind-boggling. Nevertheless, Narnia's fx are a wonder to behold. They are so seamlessly integrated throughout the the film that everything seems incredibly real. The beavers, especially, are two of the most cute and believable CGI creations I have ever seen, including Gollum from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The wolves are also really well done. The final battle scene is perfect - the special effects pound at you for a good ten or fifteen minutes at the great clash between good and evil. Of course, the scale is nothing like Lord of the Rings, but Narnia is not meant to be a replacement for Lord of the Rings. It is meant as a tale in its own right....don't put comparisons on it that aren't meant or needed. For itself, it is a good action epic, and the special fx rival Lord of the Rings, even though the scale is not as grand. The greatest special fx creature in the movie, though, would be Aslan. Aslan is the most beautiful CGI creation I have ever seen on screen. Neither Kong nor Gollum, are beautiful, but Aslan is just that. He has just the ethereal, not quite real touch to make him believable as the Savior figure he is. His anger is mighty to behold, and his mane flows like the waves of the ocean.Now for C - the accusation that the movie is a bad adaptation of a book. Making a movie out of a book is always tricky. You are never going to satisfy everybody, and you are never going to displease everybody. There are always some people out there who seem to think that a book is easy to translate into a movie. Well, here's news: It's not. Good movies made from books are few and far between, and for good reason: it's not easy making the transition. The screenplay writer/director has to make cuts, he has to NOT include everything. If everything in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wadrobe had been included, we'd be staring at a five hour movie. The director's and screenplay writer's ability to translate the book into a two and a half hour movie is admirable. And they did it while still maintaining the heart and soul of CS Lewis's classic. Some things had to be cut, and also - the movie is a movie, and should be judged as one. Movies are a completely different genre than books - there are things you can do in books which you can never do in movies, and there are things you can do in movies that you could never do in books. Narnia does an excellent job of taking a classic and making a perfectly admirable movie.In closing, Narnia is one of the best films of the year. I highly recommend it - and don't listen to anyone who tries to tell you that it's a bad movie.",9,0,2,26 March 2006
Finding Nemo," The Perfect Family Classic
","Finding Nemo is undoubtedly one of the best animated movies of all time. It represents Pixar's crowning achievement, which they have been unable to top before or since. Aside from a funny, interesting, and engaging story, it features stunning CGI used in, as always, Pixar's creative and never-boring manner. Written, directed, and voice acted to perfection, it will stand as a monument of amazing film-making for both kids and adults for years to come.We are introduced at the beginning to a married clown fish couple: Marlin and Coral. They are ready to settle down on the edge of the ocean and start a family; in a little cove in the cliff rest over 400 eggs just about ready to hatch. As we all know, an evil barracuda comes along and eats both Coral and nearly all the 400 eggs, leaving only Marlin and a cracked/bruised egg that eventually grows up to be Nemo. On his first day of school, though, he gets caught by fishermen and taken to a dentist's house in Sydney. Thus, Marlin, worried sick about his son, sets off on a long quest to rescue little Nemo.Right from the beginning, the relationship between Nemo and Marlin is perfect. As father and son, they are completely believable and we instantly fall in love with both of them. We can feel Marlin's heartbreak over his son who has been stolen from him. The entire cast of voice actors was perfectly chosen, with one particular one worth mentioning: Ellen Degeneres as Dory. If anybody else had voiced the blue and yellow short-term memory loss fish, she would have come off as annoying and pointless. Degeneres plays her just perfectly so that we can't help but like her. Willem Dafoe is also particularly noteworthy. His role as Gill is just creepy/mysterious/fatherly enough that the kind of presence his little fish body exudes is impressive.The conciseness of the movie was quite well done too. In an age where Pixar movies are getting longer and longer (both Cars and The Incredibles nearly exceeded the two hour mark) this one seems just about perfectly the right length; not too short, not too long. Character development is thus heightened and enhanced because of this; we don't see so much of these fish that we get sick of them, but we see just enough that we kind of hunger for more. The way Marlin's and Dory's friendship grows throughout the movie is also really impressive. All the side characters in the movie, too, (such as Nigel the pelican, Crush the turtle, and Bruce the shark) are so colorful and full of life that never once do they come off as gimmicks or fillers. Everything in Finding Nemo serves a purpose for something else - there is no wasted space.The score, though nothing extraordinary, is still amazing and superbly fits well into the framework of the movie. Nothing really stands out as 'hey this is Finding Nemo music', but that's okay. It always takes a backseat to the story - never pushing itself so far forward that it eclipses the characters. Another bonus - there are no songs, besides 'Beyond The Sea', but that only plays during the credits. Oh yes, and of course Dory's eternal: 'Just keep swimming, just keep swimming...' If you haven't seen Finding Nemo yet, you are missing out on one of the greatest classics to ever swim in the sea. It is so perfectly put together, and is such a pure and fun movie. If you have seen it, though, go ahead and see it again. It's that good.",10,0,2,28 June 2006
Superbad," Hilarious, but a little Cliché and Lazy
","I'm sorry to report that Superbad is a clear step backward in terms of character and story from Apatow's previous stuff, although, admittedly, it was only produced by him, not directed. Superbad is one big long hilarious sex joke from beginning to end, but once all the thin layers are stripped away, there's not much left to distinguish it from other films of its ilk.Jonah Hill is Seth and Michael Cena is Evan, two high school seniors who are on their last week of school and want to go out with a bang. So they enlist the aid of a friend who would make the nerdiest of nerds look like Brad Pitt - Fogell, played squeakily excellently by newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse.He has just purchased a fake ID, and the plan of the three is to use it to buy alcohol for a party so they can get girls drunk and sleep with them. Fogell goes to the liquor store and is knocked out by a thief (whom we never see again), causing the clerk to call the police in to look for the robber. Can you say, 'contrived plot point?'Aside from the three main characters, everyone else is a tired stereotype, from the stupid cops of Seth Rogen and Bill Hader (played with enough pizazz to overshadow their cliché-ness), to the naïve liquor store counter girl who accepts a clearly highly suspicious fake ID, to the girls merely existing so that the main characters can (or cannot) have sex with them. True, most of these are laugh-out-loud hilarious, but for me that didn't overshadow how uncreative they were. In conjunction with this qualm of mine, I also didn't appreciate how everybody except the three main characters seemed to have lost their brains on the way to their parts. Films like 'Virgin' and 'Knocked Up' succeeded because all the characters were three-dimensional real people, not stereotypes. Neither Jonah Hill nor Michael Cena carry enough charisma and clout to make us believe these are actually real people. Jonah Hill plays the exact same part he played in Knocked Up, only without the drugs. On top of all this, the movie is false in its claims to authentically portray the boy high school experience because of how, suspiciously, the entire high school is populated by 25-year old drop dead gorgeous women. Much has also been said about the F-word being dropped at least three times a minute  but so what? What movie doesn't have the F-word these days? This doesn't make it good. It's not like it was some kind of huge risk for them to use it. This isn't the 70's people, it's the 21st century, and when the F-word is used a lot it's not some reason to be impressed by bravura film-making.Finally, my biggest beef with the movie is its faux brotherhood undertones. Yes, Hill and Cena do share wonderful chemistry, but the 'conflict' between them (each of them are going to separate colleges at the end of the year) is barely mentioned three or four times, and it seems merely added for the purposes of giving the film an Apatowsian flair. It's competently done, of course.It's nowhere near as developed as the emotional heart of Apatow's previous two theatrical outings, where the drama was sewn into the whole in such a way that if you removed it, the entire thing would fall apart. In Superbad, though, it seems more of an extra doohickey than something that was needed. Despite all my criticisms, I'm giving this movie a good recommendation simply because of how hilarious it is. Both Hill and Cena hit each comedic note perfectly, and Hader and Rogen as the cliché cops add just the right amount of ridiculousness to make their inclusion forgivable. The most hilarious aspect of the movie comes in the running joke that Fogell changed his name to McLovin when he bought a fake ID. This joke runs throughout, but through intelligent script-writing it never loses steam and always draws a hearty belly laugh. The McLovin' joke alone is worth the entire price of admission, and in a movie with literally a laugh-a-minute, that's saying something. Some moments in the movie also (probably purposefully) recall classics like American Pie, which really helps the movie's appeal, because it throws into contrast how lacking American Pie's comedy is in relation to Superbad's. The writing is simply much more talented and does a heck of a lot more with the material. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire thing, and though at the end of the day it lacked a certain heart and soul that prevents me from giving it an extremely high rating, it does bring the laughs.Perhaps I'm being a little too unfair on Superbad. After all, the director is some guy named Greg Mottola who must be feeling like the luckiest guy in the world right now, with the reigning king of R-rated comedy producing his flick. Why should I place the burden of Apatow's success upon this filmmaker's shoulders? The reason is that Superbad was billed as 'from the guys who brought you Talladega Nights and The 40-Year Old Virgin.' With a title like that, it's obviously wanting very badly to be the next Knocked Up. But if Apatow wasn't attached to the project, you can bet it wouldn't be half as successful, and probably even lower in the critical ratings, too. It was a clever advertising campaign, to be sure, but it only causes me to be suspicious if Superbad actually has any inherent value. For now, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt  it's not as good as the other two hilarious comedies of the summer, Knocked Up and The Simpsons Movie, but it is a great fun-filled teen sex comedy romp that is still above average.",7,3,8,22 August 2007
Hot Fuzz," Perfect British Satire
","I was afraid that Hot Fuzz would be a letdown - the trailers looked kind of lame, and I wasn't quite used to Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright yet. But I had read good reviews, and I absolutely loved Shaun of the Dead, so I thought I'd give Hot Fuzz a try. The trailers suck and don't even begin to do it justice - Hot Fuzz is the funniest and wittiest comedy I have seen in a long time, possibly even exceeding its predecessor.Simon Pegg is Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a spectacular cop who is so spectacular he is making his colleagues look bad. As a solution, his superior officers have him transferred to the very small town of Sandford, where he must contend with the dangerous threat of underage drinkers, loiterers, and drunk drivers. For the most part, Sandford is apparently a small town with small problems.Angel teams up with the inspector's son, Danny Butterman, a cop who is obsessed with cop movies, played by Nick Frost, who worked alongside Pegg in Shaun of the Dead. The two once again share perfect chemistry here as classic cop buddies. Eventually some murders begin to happen around time, murders that most everybody dismisses as accidents but which Angel suspects to be something more. An investigation ensues into the classic serial killer that you've seen in dozens of cop movies, parodied lovingly and perfectly here.Everything about Hot Fuzz works. This is no simple parody that is content to just laugh at its source material. There are so many little things in Hot Fuzz, stuff that you'll need to look for if you want to catch it. Dozens of homages to cop movies are sprinkled all over the place, and the wonderful thing is is that they're subtle, discreet, under-the-counter, woven into the storyline and characters in such a way that they do not jump out and scream at you like in Austin Powers or Scary Movie. This isn't just a parody of cop movies. It's a cop movie. It's a true cop movie in every sense of the word, but its genius rests in the fact that it manages to be a complete cop movie while also making unashamed fun of the genre. As I walked out of this movie I kept on shaking my head at what genius this was - there was such a perfect pitch and feel to this movie I felt it almost literally has no equal in terms of spoofs.A lot of it is due to the excellent cast and the perfect chemistry they share. Simon Pegg is absolutely brilliant and will eventually take his place among British comedic legends alongside the likes of Rowan Atkinson and Martin Freeman. (In my view he's already there.) The cameos from Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, and Steve Coogan at the beginning were absolutely perfect. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg share a virtually and subtly homo-erotic friendship in the film and it is perfectly and subtly funny, never over the top, but just enough there to catch and laugh at. The people in Sandford also perfectly fulfill their role, especially Jim Broadbent as the inspector. Timothy Dalton as the maybe-villain throughout the film is wonderful and you can tell he's having plenty of fun.Another great thing that sells this movie is that it doesn't sell itself short on action. A lot of movies would have probably skimped on the action well known to cop movies and focused too much on the parody , but the final thirty minutes of Hot Fuzz are a hilariously climactic showdown. And it's not just cheesy action. There is some fun cheese and camp within the action, but overall, it's actually GOOD - this is action that wouldn't be out of place in a, for lack of a better word, normal action pic. It's a perfect homage to cop movies while also being a wonderfully thrilling scene in its own right. Shaun of the Dead was lacking a little in what truly constituted zombie action, and the final scene at the bar I found to be kind of disappointing and dragged out. Hot Fuzz's final scene is perfect and expertly executed. The rest of the movie contains plenty of creative gore, and thought sometimes I found it to be a little odd that they were putting so much gore into the film, I eventually accepted it as an homage to the many R-rated cop movies that exist out there - and it's not boring gore - most, if not all of it, had the entire audience cringing with how intense and creative it was.The only thing that Hot Fuzz lacks from Shaun of the Dead is the smart social commentary. Shaun of the Dead was deep and it had some important and interesting things to say, but Hot Fuzz is meant to be just simple and great fun. It's also a better parody of cop movies than Shaun of the Dead was of zombie movies - on the whole it executes its goal with perfect grace and requires smarts and wits to watch. It's not some dumb mindless comedy - so many things in this movie are about watching closely and fully appreciating the love that these creators had for the original material. Many times directors will skimp on thought and originality when directing a spoof - sacrificing character development, plot, and action and just riding the wave of the original's success. Hot Fuzz doesn't even come close to doing this. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright could easily have gone the lazy route, but they absolutely refused, and I respect and admire them for that. This movie is such a film that it is likely people will end up parodying it. A pitch-perfect parody and comedy, Hot Fuzz is entertaining and hilarious and masterfully accomplished in every single way.",10,2,4,28 June 2007
Brokeback Mountain," A Beautiful Movie
","I went to Brokeback Mountain feeling slightly apprehensive about the whole thing. I wasn't sure what to expect, and I wasn't sure if I'd like it, I just knew that a film that was garnering so much critical praise and public attention and controversy was a film that needed to be seen.I left the theatre feeling a mixture of anguish, praise for the movie, and half guilt for how homosexuals are treated in our world today.Now first, let me start by reviewing the movie itself, regardless of the fact that there are two gay cowboys in it. It was a breathtakingly beautiful film, I swear, every new view of Brokeback Mountain or the fields and forests surrounding it took my breath away with their encompassing grandeur. Excellent cinematography, unquestionably. Very very well done.The acting was quite a high point, as well. Jack Twist's and Ennis Del Mar's wives played their roles to perfection, Ennis's wive a confused soul when she finds out her husband is having an affair - with a gay man at that - and Jack's b****y wife who really couldn't give less of a darn that Jack sneaks away up to the mountains to go 'fishing' several times a year. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall were the perfect choices for this film - and they both played their anguish so well I could almost physically feel the pain they were going through. The way they show the connection and love they have with each other is unbelievably good. The way the story seamlessly panned twenty years was very well done too. You could see a very clear difference in each of their characters between the beginning of the movie and the end of the movie.Now for the part about how the main characters are gay. I'm not really against gay people in general, but what I didn't like about the movie was the way the main characters cheated on their wives, and how it was presented as mostly acceptable, simply because they're in love. True, it would have been unbelievably difficult for them to not have an affair once they found out their feelings for each other, but the way their affair breaks Ennis's wife's heart broke my heart as well. The fact that the community around them would have most likely killed them if they found out, too, was another heartbreaking point in the movie, and how even Jack Twist himself is killed because people find out he is gay.On the whole, no matter who you are, this is a movie you should see. It is a heartbreaking, beautiful, painful, wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed masterpiece.",9,20,23,19 February 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," A Brilliant Coming-of-Age Fantasy
","It's been known for awhile that somewhere in the good directing skills of Guillermo del Toro there has been a great director just waiting to spring out. With his latest film, del Toro proves he has that rare great directing spark. Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliantly directed film that excites, amazes, and terrifies, shining with impressive performances, a captivating storyline, and dazzling special effects that are refreshingly lacking in CGI.The film takes place near the end of World War II in Europe, in a war-torn Spain, where our main character, young Ofelia, lives with her mother who is pregnant with a son and is to be wed to the leader of a battalion of the Spanish army. The film opens with a brief fairy tale explaining how an underground kingdom's princess reached the surface and forgot about where she came from, living out her life and eventually dying. Ever since then, the legend goes, the kingdom has been waiting for her return. After this little backstory we see Ofelia, obsessed with reading fairy tales, and her mother traveling to the outpost in the woods, where Captain Vidal awaits his new bride.Pan's Labyrinth involves fewer fairy tale elements than you would think. The trailers present it as this epic fantasy adventure, but most of the action actually takes place in the 'real world.' We are shown this war-torn, horrible world through little Ofelia's eyes, revealing it as ruthless and terrifying, clearly a world that a child should not be forced to experience, but Ofelia must face it every single day, and her only escape is the world of Pan's Labyrinth.Pan's Labyrinth raises some very interesting questions, and it doesn't do them sloppily. This is a very cleanly directed film, with a clear and intent purpose  it doesn't bounce all over the place raising questions for the heck of it; everything is clean and to the point, and there is barely a second of wasted space. More than anything, it is one of the most beautiful coming-of-age tales I have seen in a long while. This entire movie is about Ofelia, growing up, the loss of innocence, and this process is captivated ingeniously by telling it through the medium of dark fantasy. By no means is this a kids' fairy tale story. It is unrestrictedly violent  del Toro does not hesitate in showing us a man get killed by having a bottle neck smashed into his face repeatedly. He doesn't do it so much that it desensitizes, but he gives us just enough gore to place us squarely in Ofelia's world. Ofelia must wrestle with this world in which she lives, and even the fantasy that she creates (doesn't create?) for herself is dark and mysterious and foreboding. The film also seems to be a kind of eulogy for childhood innocence, an acknowledgment that it must end, but also a recognition of how truly fantastic it can be. Ofelia's imagination and wonder hold a solid power in this world, a power that can truly be felt even by those in the world who do not believe it.Ofelia's imagination and the fantasy world that she escapes to is also creatively and captivatingly shown through some impressive special effects work. Aside from some little 'fairies' that show up from time to time, the film is virtually devoid of CGI, making it so much more real. Not only this, but the creatures created are ingeniously original and frighteningly creepy (not the least of whom is the terrifying Pale Man). When a special effects team still has the power to come up with a grotesquely beautiful image or to scare without cheap thrills or useless gore, you know they're good. And the very real lack of 'fake' monsters or backgrounds only makes Ofelia's world that much more engrossing.Pan's Labyrinth is truly a great fantasy masterpiece. Del Toro, with his usual dazzling vision, carefully crafts and completely keeps the essence of this dark world from the first frame to the last. It's difficult to even necessarily find anything wrong with the film. The acting is superb all around, especially from the actress who plays Ofelia. Some people may find the violence to be too extreme for their taste, but I found that it was an extremely effective way of portraying the world in which Ofelia lives. Another criticism could be that there is not enough of the fantasy element, but this only, to me, showed how overpowering and all encompassing the war-torn world was. It's what Ofelia lives in, and it is an entirely appropriate decision considering that we are seeing things from her perspective. Ofelia's lack of incredulity is also another strength of the movie  she is a young child, nearly a teenager, true enough, but what young child in her situation would not believe the incredible things that she sees? She needs to believe them; it's her only escape. Its only fault may be that it drags at parts, but even that is negligible considering the sheer awesomeness of the rest of the film.Pan's Labyrinth is not a perfect film. It does not carry the import of a cautionary tale, such as Children of Men, or the brilliantly dazzling acting of Helen Mirren in The Queen (which I haven't seen). It does contain extreme violence, which will turn some people off. Others may find the fantasy element difficult to grasp or understand. What Pan's Labyrinth does so intelligently is to perfectly capture the world in which it exists. This is an intensely amazing world that del Toro is wrestling with, and the fact that he pulled off portraying it picture perfect should be applauded. Everything that del Toro attempts succeeds with flying colors. This movie is a prime example of expert film-making at its peak.",10,3,8,22 January 2007
Knocked Up," A Heartwarming Film
","Judd Apatow is unequivocally a genius. While traditionally R-rated comedies mean something demeaning, raunchy, and lacking any real redeeming value, such as American Pie, Eurotrip, and Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, Apatow has managed to elevate the genre to something approaching art. I haven't actually seen the TV show 'Freaks and Geeks', but it is universally critically acclaimed and everyone bemoans that it was cancelled, another great show lost in the annals of screwed up TV bureaucracy (Firefly, anyone?). But I did see The 40-Year-Old Virgin, a movie from which I was not expecting much (I had never heard of Apatow before), but which I came out of marveling at how incredibly smart it was and what wonderful performances the cast gave. Here was an R-rated comedy that was plenty raunchy but still managed to have something smart and true to say. Knocked Up is no different - Apatow is two for two now with this wonderful story that celebrates and embraces the differences between men and women while giving us true-to-life view on adult relationships.Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a practically broke pothead who is trying to make money through a website that catalogues films that contain nude scenes of actors and actress. Katherine Heigl is Alison Scott, an up and coming TV reporter who works at E! and gets promoted. On one side, a loser pothead. On the other, a successful drop-dead gorgeous young woman. On the day of her promotion Scott decides to go out and party with Debbie, played by the director's wife Leslie Mann, who is married to a Pete, played by Paul Rudd. The two women are having fun until of course they meet Stone and his pothead buddies. Stone and Scott hook up for a night of a wild sex, but unfortunately they don't use a condom. Eight weeks later, Scott finds out she is pregnant, and together the two decide to work things out.In a scenario as unlikely as a gorgeous blonde hooking up with a rather unattractive and unemployed stoner, the story would suck if the characters were anything but lovable and believable, and fortunately ever single one of them is both. Ben's pothead roommates border on the simply conventional and unrealistic, but I think it's okay that they're just there for comic relief, and they serve to show the kind of lifestyle that Ben leads and how important his pals are to him. Ben himself is true to life and he is played perfectly by Seth Rogen. Katherine Heigl isn't as good, but she still shares some great chemistry with Rogen. Two characters that almost steal the show, though, are Pete and Debbie, who serve as an example to both Ben and Alison about what marriage is like in real life. True, the characters are caricatured a bit, but this is the case in any movie, and I thought both Rudd and Mann had perfect marriage chemistry together and the struggles within their marriage showed admirably well the difference between men and women, which brings me to the best thing about Knocked Up.The mature view of adult relationships, the celebration of the difference between men and women, and the importance of taking responsibility and growing up are all themes that are well and competently explored in Knocked Up. Alison and Ben's relationship works because this is how it would look if it happened in real life. The two are deathly afraid of how Pete and Debbie's marriage looks like from the outside because of how much they fight, and the observations that they each have about the marriage are surprisingly accurate to what a given man or a given woman may observe in those situations. Many people complained about how unrealistic the two's love is, but this is a movie people, and it's not meant to portray real life. Besides, I easily understood what Alison sees in Ben - he's a sweet guy deep inside, and I could tell that he really cared for Alison. Like I said before, the chemistry between the two is wonderful, heartwarming, and endearing.On the whole Knocked Up is a great film. The characters are excellent, the humor uses real life situations and real people for laughs, the raunchiness is not excessive, but perfectly fits the film. Every single one of the cameos is excellent, from Steve Carell all the way to Kristen Wiig, with whom I was particularly impressed. She's only in two scenes, but her comedic timing and delivery in both of those scenes was so perfectly executed that she effortlessly stole both of them. I did not enjoy Knocked Up as much as I did 40-Year-Old Virgin, partly because 40 had the amazing Steve Carell, partly because it bothered me that one of the final revelations of the film comes about because of mind-altering substances (not pot, but something else). I almost felt cheated, but I was quickly carried away from that feeling when I got sucked back into the story. If it weren't for the R rating, this would almost be a wonderful family film - it's that good. Sweet, excellent, heartwarming, and charming, Knocked Up has me looking forward to Judd Apatow's next project all the more.",8,0,2,28 June 2007
The Polar Express," A Christmas Classic
","This movie just recently came out on DVD, and I bought it, not having seen it, but heard good and bad things about it. I wasn't too worried about whether or not it was good...having seen many previews for it it looked like a decent Christmas movie. When I stuck it in the DVD player I was happily surprised to find that it far exceeded my expectations.This is a Christmas movie that everyone should see. It's charming, funny, innocent, overall a perfectly wonderful family film. So many family films out this day and age are full of material that you wouldn't want your seven-year old to hear or see. This movie is the perfect holiday family film, whether you're a little kid or an old grown-up.The movie is about this young kid who hitches a ride on a steam locomotive named The Polar Express, that supposedly takes him to the North Pole. The ride is filled with dancing waiters, a mysterious hobo who rides on the train, a conductor voiced very well by Tom Hanks, dazzling trips across miles of railroad tracks, and many more. This movie is entirely in CGI, and it is the best looking CGI film I have ever seen, surpassing even Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Though of course it is not perfect, it is the best Hollywood has to offer in terms of quality. The detail in the facial expressions is breathtaking, and the at times dizzying train ride had me feel like I was riding a roller coaster. Overall the special effects are wonderful.But what really makes this such an amazing movie is the storyline. We follow the journey of this young kid (and I believe his name is never mentioned) as he makes a magical trip all the way to the North Pole. Though the storyline is nothing especially exceptional, its heart and charm overtook me as I fell in love with the various characters in the story. Their perfect innocence and delight in Christmas was a relief to see after so many horrible recent Hollywood films. The imagination in the film overwhelmed me as well. There was a particular scene where the main kid is on top of the train as the mysterious hobo skis along it towards the front. Very amazing, and at times heart-stopping. The ending is also perfectly wonderful, and I was very satisfied when I turned off the DVD player and the TV.This would be a perfect film, if not for various age-old clichés that are spouted out, like, 'Seeing is believing.' There aren't many of them, though, and they actually manage to fit in quite nicely with the storyline as a whole. They aren't really noticeable unless you're looking specifically for them, or viewing it with a critic's eye like I did.Overall, this movie is almost certainly destined to become a holiday classic. There is nothing not to like about it. The characters are charming, the storyline is captivating and not cliché, it will appeal to young and old, and, well, basically, it's a good story, darn it! It should have gotten more recognition in theatres, but hopefully on DVD it will have a real chance to shine. Go rent this movie, or see it, or something, because if you don't, you are missing out on one of the best Christmas movies of all time.",9,2,4,13 February 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Thriller Perfection
","The summer's most solid action pic is here. Matt Damon is back as super tough amnesiac spy Jason Bourne, who once more travels around the globe in an effort to find his identity. In this film, Paul Greengrass's jerky documentary style camera movements, combined with Damon's perfect performance, and a storyline that refuses to ever stop, all combine to make a sleek and solid action thriller that has no equal. In this one, Bourne is finally coming to grips with who he is as he unearths a trail of clues that have him racing around the world in a globe-trotting movie that takes us to New York, Spain, Italy, and more, all within less than two hours.This is a perfectly paced movie and fine tuned down to the tiniest camera shot, the most basic punch, the most simple cat and mouse scene. Everything about is kinetic, quick, visceral, and pounding. If your pulse isn't going a million miles a minute while watching this movie, you should speak with your doctor. Paul Greengrass, once again using his in-the-moment, in-your-face trademark camera style, places us squarely in Bourne's world, and the herky-jerky camera ups and downs serve their purpose perfectly in getting us into the mindset that this is a real ride, and we better strap ourselves in if we're going to survive this nonstop roller-coaster. This is not some CGI-fest with animated cartoons flying at us from all directions. This is real - I would be very surprised to learn that there was even a second of CGI in this film. It feels that real and that amazing. Even Live Free or Die Hard, which prided itself on going back to basics with its stuntman work and minimal CGI, felt a little extreme and fake sometimes. Sure, the car crashing into the helicopter looked cool, but nobody for a second could possibly believe it would actually happen. In Ultimatum, however, every single blow, every single hit, every single savage throttle feels truly and deeply real, and a lot of this is due to Matt Damon's wonderful performance.There is a beginning, middle, and definite end to Jason Bourne, and if anybody less than a stellar actor had been chosen to play him, it would have failed. Damon brings Bourne emotionally full circle in a climactic final showdown that rivals its two predecessors because of how wonderfully it concludes. The ending does not feel contrived, cheesy, tacked on, or artificially extended. It fits perfectly with what came before, and doesn't overstay its welcome for one second. The resolution happens, and then we move on. We don't spend ten minutes with Bourne giving us some kind of deep monologue, thank goodness. There is no bold character revelation or deep moment of truth. It's straightforward and subtle. No annoying final pontification here. (I'm looking at you, Sandman.) What makes Bourne Ultimatum so amazing is that is stands tall in a sea of summer mediocrity. Yes, I know, I did enjoy Transformers, Live Free or Die Hard, Spider-Man 3, and Pirates 3. (Shrek 3 not so much.) But the reason I love and respect Ultimatum more is because it exemplifies the true definition of a trilogy. I sincerely hope they do not come out with any more Bourne movies. I believe this character's journey is done - in interviews both Greengrass and Damon say that they don't see a sequel on the horizon. Good for them. A trilogy that firmly closes and insists on staying closed is one that should be respected. I love the Bourne movies because each film is solidly encased in a box that makes it enjoyable if you just see that one movie, but watch them all together and they become a beautiful painting of one man's need to discover who he truly is. It's a metaphor for all of us - as Bourne questions his morality and past when he discovers he's been responsible for assassinations, and as he is confronted with the stark reality that he has just killed a man, the pain and tragedy etched across his face speaks more powerfully than any five minute monologue could. (Er-hem, Trinity in Matrix Revolutions.) Bourne must make the difficult journey of finding out who he is. So must we. And because of this, we sympathize with him. Bourne is human. He's flawed. We understand him. He is not James Bond, not even close. The Bourne movies have been said to be a smart man's spy-thriller, and they are, in every sense of the word. They don't disregard audience intelligence and throw us loud explosions, cocky winking dialogue , and voluptuous drop-dead gorgeous femme fatales at every turn. The main character doesn't callously pop off bad guys right and left. When he kills, it hurts him, deeply. There is a moment in the movie, that I won't give away, that I believe defines Bourne's distinct separation from Bond. Bond can stick with his fancy gadgets and toys and cocky attitude. Sure, that's enjoyable popcorn, but Bourne is actual substance. He's a feast, not just crunchy food that you eat in a theater and then leave half behind not ever finishing it.To use the analogy of food from my other favorite movie of the summer, Ratatouille, Bourne is a dish to be savored. It can be enjoyed for its visceral thrills and nonstop chase, but there's human drama there too, a deep one, and it makes every single second on screen that much more compelling. If there's one thing that may be flawed about this movie, it would be its repetitiveness, but I find that completely forgivable. If I weren't a critic I wouldn't even bother to notice it. The Bourne Ultimatum finally gives us what we've all been craving. The conclusion to a satisfying trilogy that only got better as it went along, the final installment a capstone of thriller perfection.",9,0,2,22 August 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," A Genuinely Hilarious Film About Family
","These days, the words 'comedy' do not inspire in me much confidence when going to the movies. When I see the word 'comedy' I think of nauseatingly sappy romantic comedies, or disgustingly over-the-top gross out comedies. The market is so inundated with cliché films of this genre that when a new, innovative, and genuinely hilarious comedy comes along, it feels like a breath of fresh air. Little Miss Sunshine is this breath. Not since last year's 40-year-old virgin has a comedy felt so genuinely funny.The movie opens with an introduction to one of the most dysfunctional families I have ever seen on screen. Steve Carell plays a suicidal gay uncle, Abigal Spencer a young girl named Olive, who is obsessed with winning beauty pageants, Greg Kinner her loser optimist father (a role for which he was born to play, it seems), Alan Arkin the foul-mouthed lovable grandpa who loves and cares for Olive more than anything, Paul Dano Olive's brother who has taken a vow of silence, and finally, Toni Collette, the mother who has to put up with this mess that passes for a family.The premise of Little Miss Sunshine is simple enough. Olive has been accepted into the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, and the family cannot afford to fly there, so they take a road trip in their beat up yellow VW van. As you can imagine, hilarity and chaos ensue along the way. Sound cliché and boring? Well, though this premise (dysfunctional family goes on a road trip) has been done before, in no way is it boring, and it never ever feels like a cliché.Props for this must go to the cast, for pulling it all off so beautifully. Mad props go to Steve Carell, who once again proves what a comic genius he is. Another thing is - this film does not feel like it is riding on Steve Carell's shoulders. Sure, Carell is helping to support it, but it is the chemistry with the rest of the cast that works. Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, and Greg Kinnear all work wonderfully in tandem with Steve Carell and each other, and never once do they not seem like a family. The writing is brilliant and hilarious, sometimes bouncing forth in wild and wacky outrageous ways, in others quiet and muted, only being funny because it is quiet and muted. Though the premise is a bit cliché, none of the jokes are. Everything comes off as genuinely funny in its own right. There are no moments of outrageous slapstick, no disgusting gross-out humor, no excess use of lewd content to pass as humor....the entire script has the feeling of working perfectly in and out of itself....it just works wonderfully.Aside from all this, Little Miss Sunshine is a dark comedy. There are areas that it treads where you'll find yourself uttering a small gasp, wondering, 'Oh my gosh I can't believe he just said that!' Though this could have been overplayed and completely wasted, it is ingeniously pulled off, parodying and satirizing many elements of American culture throughout. Most of all, it embraces the idea of family. Throughout the film, this family sticks together, they love each other. The message of this film is not, 'Ha! Look at how hilarious this family is because of how dysfunctional they are! HA! Isn't that FUNNY!?' The message is, 'Look at this family. Look at how screwed up they are. But look at how they love each other. Look at how they come together. Look at, just, the sheer caring these people exude for each other!' We can laugh at these people, but that doesn't mean we can't genuinely feel for them. Most comedies make jokes at the characters' expense...this film never feels like that, not once. The characters are embraced, not hated. Sure, they're funny, but hey, aren't we all? Flaws? The ending may have been a little bit over-the-top, however amazingly hilarious it was. Other moments of forced hilarity may seem too much for some people, but I thoroughly enjoyed them. Once or times Carell's vibrant acting personality shines through - which is fine, I guess, but I thought it cut down his character a bit. The film isn't too long - one hour and forty minutes feels just about right.Little Miss Sunshine is simply a feel-good, laugh-out-loud, genuinely hilarious comedy that anyone with a heart for family will love. I certainly loved it. It is rated R, though, but I don't believe this really hindered the movie at all. Sure the characters swear, they talk about sex, and whatnot, but who doesn't? Little Miss Sunshine is everything a comedy should be. It is happy. It is sad. It is hilarious. It is tragic. It is family.",9,1,4,7 September 2006
Jarhead," Not your average war movie
","I'd heard mixed things about Harhead. Someone I knew had seen it, and they really liked it. I'd also heard that there was lots of useless sex in it that detracted from the story. Reviews from critics were mixed too, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I almost didn't go, but then I decided to what the heck, I'll check it out, and see what all the fuss was about.After thinking about it I'm gonna give this movie a 7/10. It was not your typical war movie at all. The entire movie was basically about how a certain marine, Jake Gyllenhall, had to wait almost half a year for action to start for him and his platoon in the Gulf War. He trained to be a sniper during that whole time, and he finally gets his chance to get in combat, about an hour and a half into the movie.I won't say anything else, lest the movie is spoiled for you, but it's just about a marine's life, basically, with a particular emphasis on how they're waiting for the action of the Gulf War to start. Though it could be called a war movie, there are less than twenty minutes of combat in a two hour movie. Character development is extremely well done, and we see deep into the lives of these soldiers quite effectively.The reason I docked off 3 points was because of several things. One was the useless, kind of extraneous sex. Though it was a definite part of the storyline, they could have done without showing a lot. At one point I felt like I was watching pornography, and that's never a good thing, even if it does contribute to the storyline. The ending was also a little off, but I personally liked it.So, if you're curious to see what all the fuss is about, go see Jarhead. However, it's not the kind of movie you need to rush out and see. You can definitely wait until it hits DVD.",7,0,1,24 May 2006
Ratatouille," Greatest Animated Film since Finding Nemo
","Ratatouille is a film that, with Pixar now at the helm of Disney's animation department, firmly and squarely places Disney right back at the peak of the animation business. It's is a sumptuous feast of cinematic delight that comes close to and may even be better than Finding Nemo.Remy is a young rat with a nose for good food and a mind for big dreams. He lives in the house of a grumpy old lady with a shotgun and spends his days daydreaming about delicious feasts and reaching that perfect pinnacle of good dish. A world-renowned French chef, Gusteau, is Remy's inspiration, and his book, Anyone Can Cook, is practically Remy's Bible. Remy's dad, however, isn't so fond of Remy's aspirations - in his mind, rats should stay in the garbage heap where they belong and not get picky about what they eat, so he uses Remy's talented nose to sort out the poisoned food from the safe food.Remy's passion is too great, though. His love for food knows no bounds, and he regularly sneaks off to try to cook. One day he screws up so badly that he and his family are forced to flee the old lady's house into the sewers, where Remy is separated from his family and discovers he's in one of the greatest cities for food in the world - Paris, and definitely the most beautiful CGI city that I've ever seen.From its first frame to its last, Ratatouille sparkles with a warm glow that is hands-down Pixar's best computer animation work. Everything about it is beautiful. They take a filthy creature like a rat and make it into this lovable little animal that will win you over instantly. The fur on Remy is also of astounding quality - if it weren't for his very human-like expressions it would look like a very believable rat. And it's not as if Pixar skimped on the rest of the rats while perfectly animating Remy. Every single one of Remy's colony is just as realistic as he is. The animation of the humans doesn't suffer either. Every single one of them, from the villainous Anton Ego to the hopeful chef Linguini is a perfect caricature, a brilliantly animated and creatively drawn masterpiece of character, life, and action.The story surrounding Remy and Linguini is simply inspirational. To see Remy dropping spices joyfully into soup, to see him happily sniffing his concoction to discover the perfect taste and smell is to watch Picasso paint a masterpiece, Beethoven compose a soothing piece of music, an Olympic gymnast land the perfect routine. Remy's refusal to settle for anything less than excellent is a testimony. 'Don't eat garbage!' he yells at his brother. This isn't a movie about a rat cooking in a kitchen. This is a movie about one person following his dream and not settling for anything less than the best. And as much as it's not simply about a rat cooking, it is about food. The food in this movie and the way it was prepared and presented like the perfect dish - I was salivating throughout, even especially when Remy was cooking the foot. It all looked delicious and wonderful and perfectly good enough to eat.Yet another great thing about Ratatouille is its perfect pacing. At an hour and fifty minutes, one would think a cartoon would drag, but each scene is great and the film moves along at a nicely clipped pace, never pausing too long in once place and never cutting one scene too short. There wasn't once in this movie where I thought it dragged - from the very beginning I was sucked in and I wasn't released until the beautiful credits finished rolling. The gorgeous soundtrack perfectly suits the beautiful city of Paris and it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in an animated film in a long while.The list of what makes this movie great just keeps going on and on. The voice acting in Cars was kind of unremarkable, and though the Incredibles was accomplished in every way and the voice acting was nothing bad, it wasn't particularly memorable. I questioned Patton Oswalt as the voice of Remy when I first heard about it. I don't particularly care of the comedian in real life, so I wondered how wise of a choice he was. But he perfectly conveys Remy's little passionate spunky self, wonderfully nuanced, great comedic timing, and absolutely believable. Brad Garrett did possibly the best voice work of his life - normally his voice is instantly recognizable, but he fit greatly into the role of Gusteau. Peter O'Toole was perfectly frightening, conniving, and evil in his role as the food critic.Another very clear strength of this movie is that it refuses to cater and stoop to traditional close-minded views that cartoons are just for kids. Even films like Shrek that adults are allowed to consider cool clearly pander to younger children - especially the last installment in the series. Ratatouille is for adults. It is not a movie that is meant for kids. This is not to say that kids will not get plenty out of it - there are bright colors, hilarious characters, and a funny story - any seven-year old will love it. But there is also plenty for adults to enjoy too. A lot of the humor is too subtle for the young ones to catch.I still don't know if Ratatouille beats Finding Nemo, I would need to see it again to decide, but it is most definitely close. It's undoubtedly the best movie so far this year, and the best animated film I've seen in a long while. A delicious and filling and wholesome feast of animated goodness and solid story combined with hilarious comedy and real characters, Ratatouille succeeds in every possible way and I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being the greatest movie of 2007.",10,3,6,1 July 2007
Saw III," Second one's the best, but this is still pretty good
","Warning: Don't read this review if you haven't seen the first two Saws.With any movie that turns into a franchise, there is usually a distinct taste on the palette that the characters are getting a bit old. The story is becoming less novel and more traditional. Special effects take the place of solid story and tension. There are always exceptions that prove these rules, but Saw III is not one of them. In Tobin Bell's third outing playing the mastermind of Jigsaw, there is a distinctly stale taste in the air, a taste that works against the movie from the first frame to its last. Though Saw III does have plenty of good moments, it sacrifices story for gore, characters for gore, and good story for gore. Gore gore gore.I don't want to give away too much of the story, but the basic plot is that Jigsaw and his new apprentice Amanda have kidnapped an expert in the field of brain surgery for the purpose of keeping Jigsaw alive as he plays one final game. The story intercuts between scenes with Jigsaw and this doctor, and a man named Jeff who must go through a series of puzzles/games as he tries to find the man who killed his daughter.The film's biggest strength is the character of Amanda - whom we see briefly in the first one and more of in the second. In this outing, we see, through a series of flashbacks and how she is reacting to Jigsaw's imminent death, her character in much more depth. Obviously, it's nothing Oscar worthy, but it does add a little bit of spice to the franchise as a whole. We see scenes that extend all the way back to the first movie, which ends up working out pretty well.Jeff, the guy who must find the man who has killed his daughter, is played by a less-than-stellar actor, but that's okay. He goes through all the motions of grief, pain, blah blah blah, but there's nothing really special there. Donnie Wahlberg, playing the cop who had his son kidnapped in the second film, was much better. Jeff's character is just basically a shallow revenge driven man. There are a couple of powerful moments in the film that emphasize mercy, forgiveness, and compassion, but these are eclipsed by the mountain of gore that is always sure to follow.That is another of the film's weaknesses. All the gore. Of course, in a slasher flick, one wants a lot of gore - and if that is all you are looking for, it will not leave you disappointed. But the first two Saws managed to be creative in their gore, not giving us too much, giving us just enough, so that we were never overdosed. Though there is a fair amount of creative gore in the movie (the traps that Jigsaw and Amanda design are some of the most creative in the series), some of the gore just seems excessive. At one point Jigsaw must undergo brain surgery, and the film shows us every last bit of that. By the time the outer layer of skin had come off, I was going through the motions of being disgusted, but in all reality, it had worn off completely - the gore desensitizes in this film.Jigsaw, who has always been the creative mastermind in the first two films, now lies completely incapacitated on a bed throughout the entire thing. He loses a lot of his fire, a lot of his mystery. The second one managed to show us Jigsaw in a vulnerable position, yet by doing that in the way they did he only seemed that much more twistedly clever. In this one he's just a body in a bed. Though the ending does redeem him a little bit, this is a character who has definitely seen better days.The score of the film is fairly good. It has liberal doses of the original ending theme, 'Hello Zepp' done in new and different ways. The rest of the music is traditional gore fest music, nothing too exceptional. The ending piece of music fell a little bit flat, too, it didn't really soar like the piece in the first or second one. And the fact that the ending fell flatter than the first two as well didn't work too well for me either. The tension in the film is lacking, too - because of the excessive gore, but also because of all the focus on Amanda - I did say that was one of the film's strengths, but a more effective balance would have helped the tension tremendously.As much as I may be ragging on this movie, I did enjoy it. The new focus on Amanda was enjoyable, Jigsaw's creepy voice was once again, very well done, the gore was creative in many places and there were many more traps than the first two combined, and Angus Macfadyen, the man who plays Jeff, did a reasonably well job under the circumstances. The worst part about all this is that because it has shown to be so successful, earning 34 million over the weekend, beating the Halloween weekend record, Lionsgate has announced plans to make a Saw IV. Please, people. This may have been a good series, but the Saw franchise has definitely breathed its last. It was good while it lasted - one of the few slasher flicks that I actually respected and looked forward to. But towards the end of the film plot possibilities could definitely be seen to be wearing thin. Saw III was a good and enjoyable film, but Saw IV? No thanks. Ah well. I suppose I'll just sit back and enjoy this most recent installment while it still remains a reasonably satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy.",6,0,2,30 October 2006
Cars," A Worthy Addition to the Pixar Library
","Pixar has done something that no other animation company has done in this day and age: created a string of six solid hits that have satisfied audiences and critics alike by giving critics the quality movies they crave, and audiences the captivating stories they desire. Whenever a Pixar movie comes out, the question is not, 'Will it be good?' it is 'How good will it be?' With Cars, rest assured, the answer is 'Very good.' The movie opens with a ridiculously fast race track scene that is animated to perfection. Lightning McQueen is our protagonist, though by no means is he a likable one. He is snobby, rude, and just plain mean. He ties the race, and he and the two other contestants must race it out in California a week later. On his way to the race, though, McQueen, due to his sleeping chauffeur Mack, gets diverted to the small town of Radiator Springs, where he must stay and fix the road that he destroyed in his attempt to escape from the town cop, who had caught him speeding.Though the movie is a bit slow in building up to Lightning's entrance into the town, once he sets foot, um, I mean tire, into the town it is smooth cruisin' from then on. Pixar could have easily gone wrong here, by inserting a town full of cliché one-note hicks. Instead of this, though, we are introduced to a delightfully eclectic host of instantly lovable vehicles. Character development is one of Cars 'great strengths. Lightning's transformation from an uncaring big city race to car to someone we can actually care about is completely believable.CGI is another one of Cars' strengths. Since Toy Story was released in 1995, the animation in Pixar's films has done nothing but continually grow. Each film builds upon the triumphs of the previous one, and the wonderful thing is, they are never the same. They have gone from toys, to bugs, to monsters, to fish, to superheroes, and now to cars. (And next year to rats, judging from the tantalizing trailer of Ratatouille.) Cars is just beautiful, the kind of beauty that makes you sit back in your seat and go wow. Most, if not all, of the scenery in cars is so wonderfully pulled off that it looks completely believable, with just a touch of Pixar's movie-making magic.Here is another strength of Cars: The entire movie wasn't one big car joke. There were lots of smaller jokes and only two or three times in the whole movie was the joke funny because it was a car. (Though the tractor tipping was pretty amazing.) Other movies may have focused so much on the fact that these characters are cars, but with this movie, the fact that they are cars is just there, and is not a main point. There are fun visuals because of the fact they are cars, but by no means is that all there is to it.Now for the flaws. Unfortunately, even counting all of Cars' great strengths, it is the worst of the Pixar films. The story itself is cliché right from the beginning. Though it is, admittedly, superbly pulled off, it never manages to make us forget that we are seeing the traditional big city guy comes to town and learns to love story. Another flaw is the large cast of characters. With over fifteen cars in Radiator Springs, not counting Lightning, Mack, and other cars that make appearances, there seems to be a crowding of the stage at times. The four main characters, Lightning, Sally, Hudson, and Mater, are all given due screen time and character development focus, but occasionally they seem to fight for screen time with some of the rest of the cast. The score of the film is generically underwhelming also; it lacks any distinctive quality at all. With previous Pixar films, the score and songs were distinctive. With Cars, it just seems like less time was spent working on it - annoying drawling country songs abound.On the whole, my thesis remains: Cars is a very good movie. Solid script, solid visuals, and, actually, solid voice acting too. Owen Wilson as Lightning was questionable, but he turned out to be perfect. I completely forgot I was listening to Owen Wilson's voice coming out of a race car. And, as usual, Pixar has made the credits into a sort of mini-movie. Stick around during them, and you will be treated to car versions of Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Monsters Inc. They are simply hilarious. There is a little something after all the credits are over, too. Go see Cars. It is entertaining for both kids and adults, it has really cool CGI, and it teaches a valuable life lesson. What more could you want in a summer movie? Don't say Johnny Depp.",6,0,1,29 June 2006
The Number 23," A boringly gimmicky 'thriller'
","The Number 23 is a pretty terrible wreck of a movie, one that fails to accomplish anything it sets out to do. It doesn't even fall into the 'so bad it's good' category - most of the time I was disgusted by what I saw on screen. I wasn't laughing. I was too depressed to laugh. Laboring through this movie was more of a chore than a ride; I felt like I was mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, which is actually the exact place this movie belongs. A trash can.Jim Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, a dogcatcher who is unwittingly drawn into the world of a mysterious novel called 'The Number 23,' written by the unbelievingly stupid pseudonym 'Topsy Kretts.' As Sparrow delves increasingly further into the novel, he finds the number 23 everywhere, and an increasingly disturbing similarity to the psychotic main character of the novel.The film's most obvious flaw is the pathetically gimmicky subject matter. The Number 23 is indeed about The Number 23, but who the heck cares? A relatively exorbitant amount of screen time is devoted to characters spewing out arbitrary math problems that 'magically' and 'mysteriously' add up to 23. The main characters live at 1814. 18+1+4=23. When Sparrow's wife, Agatha, played by Virginia Madsen, says that it's stupid, the numbers are 'cleverly' screwed around with until they add up to 23 again. 1+8+14=23. What about 1+8+1+4=14? How is that important? Or 181+4? Giving you a headache yet? It certainly gave me one. I spent an hour and a half watching people do fuzzy math.The number gimmick and boring game aside, the movie suffers from a heavy-handed, plot-hole filled, unimaginative story as well. If handled properly, the whole 'number 23' thing, though ludicrous in real life, could have worked within the fantasy world of the movie, yet the entire production takes itself too seriously and is too ignorant of its own flaws and failures that the movie collapses in on itself, a black hole reeking of attempted noir, thriller, and horror overtones. None of these work, for the film is neither stylish, thrilling, nor scary. Everything is just boring as we jump from one scene of Walter Sparrow spouting out random and arbitrary math to another of Fingerling, the main character in the book Sparrow reads, listing off endless numbers. It's all pointless. Plot holes are many and obvious too, and the fabricated, ludicrous, and telegraphed ending doesn't even attempt to cover them up. Rather, it just creates a whole bunch of new ones, which make the already extremely tangled up plot even more difficult to unravel. I didn't even try.We all know Jim Carrey knows how to act dramatically. He's been in The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and more recently in the relatively disappointing Fun With Dick and Jane. The guy can act, and even though he may be a better comedian than a dramatic thespian, the talent and potential is definitely there. And as ruinous a vehicle as The Number 23 is, Jim Carrey could have made the film even a bit more than the rotting carcass it is. He gives a surprisingly unstable and chaotic performance as he shifts from persona to persona, and he doesn't do it in a good way. You may think, 'Well, he should be unstable - he's playing two different psychotic people', but he does it in a pathetically inept and awkward manner. He never seems quite sure which character is which, and he makes the believability of Walter Sparrow as a character almost disappear. Supporting cast members, even the notable Virginia Madsen, doing nothing whatsoever to help the movie. Both Madsen and Carrey are even further crippled the by the canned, predictable, self-important, and laughably awkward dialogue. So what does a gimmicky premise+a depressingly inconsistent performance from Carrey+a threadbare story full of holes equal? The Number 23. And by the time the movie is over, I'd thought of 97 better ways I could have spent my time. Hmm, wait, maybe that number thing doesn't work after all.",1,16,33,10 April 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Worst of the Trilogy, but still Amazing
","Like a lot of fans, when I heard that Bryan Singer had left X3 to direct Superman Returns, and that Brett Ratner was going to replace him, I felt a growing mixture of dread and anticipation as the release date for X3 approached. After viewing a midnight showing of it, I must say that Brett Ratner is no Bryan Singer. Despite, this, however, The Last Stand is rollicking good ride filled with mind blowing special effects, creative and never-boring action, solid character development, and good philosophical gravitas that people have come to expect from the X-Men series.The film opens with a couple of flashbacks, and then we fast forward to the present day, learning that there is this young mutant from whom the government has been able to extract a way to suppress the mutant X gene. This pisses the perennially angry Magneto off, and makes Xavier slightly concerned. Of course, as if this wasn't enough, Jean Grey has come back from the dead, darker and with an evil aura about her that Xavier seems to know a little too much about.The Last Stand thrusts us straight into the action less than 20 minutes into the story, and barely lets up at all from there. There is not a second of wasted space in this movie, and it all works to move the characters and the plot inexorably forward as they approach 'the last stand.' Despite the frenetic thrust into the action, and the constant pummeling of the viewer with said action, each of the characters is explored more in depth.Different villains are introduced, as well as old ones met again. Pyro, Iceman's old menace, has now taken up with Magneto and stands by his side as his almost equally powerful sidekick. Mystique is her usual beautiful deadly self. Juggernaut, an unstoppable force of a man, aligns himself with Magneto because the government imprisoned him. Each of these people's powers work quite well in tandem with Magneto's, and they make for a show-stopping showdown.Brett Ratner shows us he knows how to direct action. The action in this movie beats all the action in the previous movies combined. There are moments of surprise, gasps, and simply 'holy crap!' Ratner's action is creative and imaginative - he is not simply satisfied with a car blowing up - he has to have Magneto throw the car into the air, and Pyro blasting with it a giant fireball. And the best thing about the action is that once it starts, it never lets up, barely giving us a chance to catch our breath before Ratner takes it away again with another mind-blowing stunt.Now for what makes this movie less than stellar. Though there is plenty of character development, and we do go deeper into the lives of the characters we already know and love - the new ones are introduced with barely a second glance. Juggernaut, Angel, Beast, and the guy who can change into several guys at once - all of them serve only as secondary mutants. What made X2 so amazing was that each new character that was introduced was explored to their fullest potential - the lovable yet creepy Nightcrawler, the dangerously on the edge Pyro, and the sadistically evil Will Striker. The only exception being the woman who fought Wolverine with Adamantium claws. In X3 Pyro is reduced to a mere sidekick - and the only way his character is explored is in his bullying of Bobby. Nightcrawler disappears completely - though this a periodic characteristic of the comics, as well. Mystique, though still intriguingly beautiful, falls slightly flat. We do see more of the love triangle between Jean, Wolverine, and Cyclops; another love triangle develops between Bobby, Rogue, and the girl who can walk through walls. As I mentioned, Storm in particular plays a much larger role.It seems Ratner was more concerned with the good guys than the bad in this one. Glossing over the bad guys in a quick, perfunctory manner, he stays focused on the good guys and their development much much more. Other weaknesses of this film include one of its great strengths: fast, frenetic energy. Though it is refreshing to finally see the long awaited summer blockbuster with no-holds barred action, The Last Stand gives up a little bit too much in terms of character and story. And it is precisely this that prevents The Last Stand from jumping the divide between freakin awesome and truly great.Judged as a stand alone movie, The Last Stand is fantastically well put together - it will undoubtedly become one of the biggest blockbusters of 2006. However, being part of these legendary mutant movies, it must be held up to a higher standard, and, unfortunately, it falls short. Bryan Singer did a job on the first two X-Men films that had people blown away. Brett Ratner's work, though, takes the movie back to its comic book roots, stripping away some of the layers of drama that Singer had stamped on there, and just having some swell ass-kicking fun, with ridiculously amazing visuals. Though this film is not as good as Singer's past two were, it still works, and for that I am willing to give Brett Ratner a thumbs up. He deserves a good amount of congratulations for putting something together so well that so many people thought he would screw up. I know. I was one of them. But he didn't disappoint. I believe he did the best possible job he could, and for that, he gets an 8/10. Because, after all, he's still no Bryan Singer.",8,1,2,26 May 2006
Stardust," Chaotic, Contrived, and Confusing
","Stardust's downfall is that, in trying too much to be like old school fairy tales (Lord of the Rings and such), it carries the air of trying too hard. You can tell that it wants so bad to be the kind of classic fairy tale that everybody loves, but too much of it feels fake and pretentious, and there are several uselessly added layers that don't do much to enhance the story.The film begins with a deliciously wonderful voice-over by the incomparable Ian McKellen, who narrates throughout the movie, and is undoubtedly one of the best things about it. His soothing voice carries us to a small English countryside town whose wall borders on the magical land of Stormhold. A man journeys forth into the magical world, and 18 years later his son, Tristan (geez how fairy tale-ey can you get?) (whose mother resides in Stormhold) has grown up into a man who is in young puppy love with a rich girl who lives down the street. Alas, he cannot win her heart because he is a mere shop boy, but luckily for him, a star falls from the sky that he promises to retrieve for her in exchange for her hand in marriage. He journeys to the star, only to find that it is actually a fallen star named Yvaine, and together they must weather other people who are after them, including a devilish witch (a smart but underused Michelle Pfeiffer) and three sons of a recently dead king (Peter O'Toole in the best role of the movie) who must retrieve an amulet that will give whoever finds it kingship over all of Stormhold. Yeesh. If that plot isn't enough to show you how contrived and pretentious this movie is, let me continue.Stardust's greatest downfall is how much it believes that it is such a great tale of whimsy, fun, and fancy. But with such a convoluted plot (and believe me it gets convoluteder, er, more convoluted), there's no way it can claim to be a simple adventure. For starters, there are several things about the plot that should have been completely done away with. One is Robert De Niro's character of the gay pirate. Yes, I know everyone's raving about how he's playing against type and how great he is, but I don't really care. Once you get past the superficial 'ha ha ha he NEVER plays this type of character!' there's not really much there, and the entire scene aboard his flying lightning harvesting boat (admittedly this is a pretty cool idea) is basically useless.Another useless point, however hilariously forgivable it is, occurs when De Niro sells his lightning to a trader, played by Ricky Gervais in, personally, my favorite moment of the entire movie, as Gervais milks the role for all it's worth, trumping, with three minutes on screen, De Niro's pirate effortlessly. Him, Ian McKellen, and Peter O'Toole are worth the price of admission all in themselves. The end result of the useless plot threads is a story that's so unnecessarily complicated that there's no way it can claim to be any kind of whimsical fairy tale. The extra plot threads wouldn't have bothered me if they had been woven into the tapestry of the movie enough to be unnoticeable, but they're so sloppily done the careless craftsmanship is almost unforgivable.Aside from the useless, sloppily done plot threads, another thing that bothered me was the anything goes use of magic. Supposedly, when the witch, Michelle Pfeiffer, I don't even remember her name, uses magic, it takes a toll on her borrowed youth so that she ages. So she uses magic several times, sparingly, of course, and when she does two bits of magic, both of her arms fade to withered skin dotted with age spots. Understandable, as both of these bits of magic weren't that large. But then she conjures an entire inn, complete with rooms, a bar, baths, a stable, a dining room, and everything you could possibly imagine in an inn. This doesn't take a toll on her at all, and it is never explained. Other instances abound. You might say, 'It's magic, it's not supposed to have rules!' but if magic has no rules, then anybody could do anything, and then there wouldn't be much of an interesting plot, would there? And in the grand finale to the film, all previous supposed rules of magic are tossed out the window in favor of an over-the-top (albeit semi-visually impressive, if a bit derivative) climax.My other qualm with this movie is how its modern elements are completely disparate with its fantasy elements. When the star falls from the sky, we go up above the Earth and look down. What? This isn't sci-fi! Another way that this 'fairy tale' rings false is how the characters easily jump into bed with one another as if they were part of the cast of 'Friends', when the sleeping together does nothing to advance the story, and even detracts from it as the immediate physicality just reeks of lazy writing and a refusal to do anything new with this kind of storyline. It also diminishes the love the characters share for one another. Other amusingly ironic but ultimately too obvious pop culture references pepper the mix.Too often Stardust seems to be trying to be this grand sweeping epic movie, but then it will go into moments where it strains almost to the breaking point trying to whimsical and charming. It never mixes effectively the parts are too different and not woven well enough together to create anything reasonably entertaining. All this being said, though, it can be an enjoyable ride if not over-analyzed, but for me, its slipshod craftsmanship and poorly woven storyline were too much to really give it a good recommendation.",5,6,19,22 August 2007
Transformers," What plot? CGI and Action Carries It All
","Remember about 11 years ago, when some giant flying saucers hovered over Earth, people in computer labs intercepted signals, and a few protagonists around the globe slowly marched toward their role in saving the Earth, with plenty of involvement from the military along the way? Transformers, not surprisingly, nearly duplicates this plot. To call it an homage to Independence Day maybe be giving director Michael Bay too much credit, but in any case it doesn't really matter. I would call Transformers more exciting, more visceral, and ten times more pulse pounding than the patriotic Earth against aliens film of 11 years ago. True, it does lack in coherent plot and character development, but all that will be completely forgotten once you see these titanium titans clash.Shia LeBeouf, as always competently playing a young affable teenager, plays Sam Witwicky, a high schooler who has a crush and purchases a car to impress her. Little does he know his car is actually an Autobot, the good guy half of a race of biogenic aliens, on Earth to investigate if something called the Cube is there, a super-powerful object that could enable the Decepticons, the bad guy half, to destroy all life on Earth and create their own robotic planet. Several subplots abound, including a middle Eastern one with a young general played by Josh Duhamel and a Pentagon/Washington one with the secretary of Defense played by Jon Voight (good, of course, but not very memorable).Oh, Jon Voight could have easily given a full-out performance, but he's not going to kid himself. It's not about him. It's about the bombastically bad-ass battling bots. The crashing metal and strangely modulated towering voices. The leaning forward in your seat to catch every detail during the fantastic battle scenes, which, had they been done wrong, would have made the movie a complete flop. Fortunately for all of us, the effects do not disappoint in any way. I got exactly everything I was expecting, and then some. The effects and action are perfectly entertaining and serve up a healthy platter of adrenaline-pumping, pulse-pounding, teeth-clenching robot butt-kicking. The final battle scene is so mind-blowing and perfect in its execution that the robots almost seem graceful as they smash and crash all over the place. This isn't art, it's entertainment, and it's wonderfully done entertainment from the sometimes overly-criticized Michael Bay.I'll admit, when I first saw the trailer, I was very excited, but then I saw Bay's name plastered across the movie screen. I was like, 'Crap. He directed the Island, didn't he? CRAP. Armageddon. Oh sh--. Pearl Harbor. Bad Boys II. Bad boys. The Rock.I'm going to hate this movie, aren't I?' Coming out of the theater, though, I realized there really wasn't anyone else who could have created a spectacle of this magnitude. Bay never lets anything else but the robots take center stage, and boy what a chaos-ridden magnificent stage it turns out to be. A conglomeration of product placement and sheer heavy metal, it's a wonder anything here manages to shine through. Voight, the pathetic script, the non-existent plot, all of them pale in comparison with the towering transformers, but of all people, LeBoeuf manages to make the biggest impression, emerging straight out of backwater, mediocre sci-fi action pics like I,Robot and Constantine to come straight into the public eye with this sure-fire massive moneymaker, bringing an incredibly personal and easygoing element to this otherwise jam-packed roller-coaster ride of a movie. If anybody but LeBoeuf had been in the main role, the entire thing would have felt like a impersonal spectacle designed solely to make money out of a toy franchise. Sure, it's all those things and more, but in a world of crashing metal and falling debris it's always good to have a character you can relate to and laugh with, and LeBoeuf pulls off that character effortlessly.I'm not going to mince any words on trying to explain the plot further or pretending like there's anything more to this movie than what I've already talked about. After watching this movie I knew two things. 1. Giant Battling Robots are the Coolest Thing Ever. 2. For some reason I really wanted a GMC truck and some Mountain Dew. (Can you believe that at one point a Mountain Dew machine transforms into a Decepticon?) Though the product placement may get out of control sometimes, it didn't really bother me, and what do you expect in a movie that features talking cars? No car label at all? Give me a break.Transformers was advertised as nothing more than a jet-fueled, action-propelled roller-coaster, and it delivers in every way. It reminded me a little bit of Alien Vs. Predator, which came out a couple of years ago, but made the mistake of setting the epic confrontation between the two alien races a few thousand feet underneath the arctic, with about three total confrontations between the aliens and the predators. Transformers isn't afraid to go rampaging in broad daylight, obliterating much of downtown LA. It also beats out its similar predecessor, Independence Day, in that it doesn't waste too much screen-time trying to develop the paper-thin personalities of numerous unimportant small characters. (ID had about six or seven of those, fifteen if you count the whole cast.) Most of the action thankfully centers around LeBoeuf and the Pentagon, never distracting too much from the film's central theme: Transformers. Heck, Transformers may even be the central summer flick of 2007. It's that epic, that good, and that satisfying. Now let's all sit down, and wait patiently for Transformers 2, because the film leaves it wide open and nearly begging for a sequel. Thank goodness.",8,1,3,7 July 2007
Children of Men," Brilliant In Almost Every Way
","Alfonso Cuaron is a genius. If anyone still has doubts after seeing his latest, and possibly greatest work, Children of Men, they need to get their brains checked. Everything about this movie screams genius. It's not perfect, but it is still impressive in every way; without a doubt, one of the best films of 2006.The year is 2027, and women are infertile. Cuaron takes this simple premise and transforms it into a thought-provoking dystopian sci-fi adventure. We are thrust directly into this bleak future with the announcement of the killing of the youngest man in the world. Shortly thereafter, a building explodes, one in which the protagonist, Theo Faron, has just bought coffee. One minute, a bustling store, the next, rubble. Within ten minutes Cuaron has effectively grabbed hold of the audience, a hold that will remain there throughout this expertly paced film.Theo is basically directly in the center of a conflict that has been ripping apart the societal fabric of this futuristic world, a conflict between a group of freedom fighters and the government. A Everything is very strictly regulated, but Theo soon discovers something that will change the fabric of the society. A woman named Kee is pregnant, a woman whom Theo must safely transport to a safe haven known as the human project, where scientists can possibly use the miraculous birth to figure out why women are infertile, and maybe even find a cure.Cuaron is not interested in the miracle of why this woman is pregnant. He is not interested in exactly how the world came to be such a horrible place because women are infertile. He is more interested in, as many critics have put it, presenting this story as a cautionary tale. There is some very deep and powerful societal commentary in Children of Men. This is not a film about how much the world has changed. One of the things that makes it so frightening as that the kind of oppression seen in Children of Men is exactly like what we have seen before, even if it was less concentrated. Rounding up old people, fugees, homosexuals, and all that, putting them into cages, is reminiscent of World War II. Freak bombings like the one seen at the beginning of the film remind us exactly of bombings in Europe, or even the US. It's tangible, and because it's tangible, the prospect of living in such a future is not entirely out there.Another great thing about this movie is how brilliantly paced it is. There isn't a second of wasted space. It's an hour and forty-nine minutes long. It's not some huge sci-fi three hour long epic, but it IS epic. The tension remains constant throughout everything. Everyone who has seen the previews or heard anything about the movie knows that there is a pregnant woman in it, so a failed build-up would have destroyed a lot of the tension. Cuaron gives us the perfect build-up though, and the momentous revealing of the pregnant belly feels just as world-changing as it should. Everything about that scene conveys how mind-boggling it truly is. Clive Owen's acting is brilliant as he stares, open-mouthed, at Kee's belly. It is one of the greatest moments of the movie.Besides the pacing, the muted quality of everything conveys how tragic this world is. This isn't some great futuristic world. This is a horrible dystopia of a place that no one, no one would want to live in. There is no moment, as there are often are in similar films about the future, of 'Oh, wow, wouldn't that be cool!' Anything like that would have done nothing but a detriment to the film. You keep on thinking, 'Oh my gosh. I can't believe that just happened. That's horrible.' There's no glorified action or stylized violence. It's all just real, and there, and the simplicity of everything makes it so much more in-your-face and powerful than it would have been otherwise.There isn't much about this movie that I didn't like. I felt pained many times throughout the movie, and many times I was not enjoying myself at all, but when I look back at it, it only made the movie that much more great. This isn't exactly a movie that can be enjoyed in the traditional sense, but it's a wonderfully impressive technical achievement. The acting works throughout - the main actress who plays Kee, though, is obviously less talented than Clive Owen. Clive Owen's performance is brilliant in many ways, but it's nothing Oscar-Worthy. It could just be that I don't enjoy Michael Caine as an actor, but I found his part to be very grating, and if a better actor had been found it would have helped a little. The music of the film didn't really strike me as very important, but it does its job, and it was very moving.Aside from the horrible advertising, though, this film is just simple genius. It's the kind of movie that is so well done that you don't even notice all the amazing directing and writing choices until after the movie is over, and even though you've probably just lived through some of the bleakest hour and forty minutes ever put on celluloid, you'll want to see it again. Don't believe the horrible advertising. This is a movie that deserves to succeed, so go see it. No way in hell should 'Stomp the Yard' make more money than Children of Men. Anyone with a brain and an eye for quality can see that this is a great movie, possibly the best movie of the year. Like I said, everything about it screams genius. It's a painful, bleak reminder of what our world may come to, and a lot of people may not like. Sometimes, though, quality is not about what we want, but what we need to see. And Children of Men needs to be seen.",9,2,6,16 January 2007
Saw II," Good Gory Movie Fare
","I must say that Saw II did not disappoint. For those of you not familiar with the original Saw, it was about a serial killer who puts victims in situations where they kill themselves in their efforts to get out. It was a masterful movie, a taut, tense, psychological thriller, with a sense-jarring, rug-out-from-under-you, sixth sense type ending.It was also unrestrictedly gory, and what was good about it was that the gore added to the tenseness of the story, instead of distracting you from it. I was afraid that the sequel would still be okay as a story, but nowhere near the original's impact.I was not disappointed. Saw II avoids most pitfalls of sequels, such as following the same basic storyline, the same sorts of stunts, and just making it bloodier and more action filled. The original Saw was made up of mostly flashbacks with calls back to the present time, where the main story was. It was a very creative way to tell a story, and the second one told it in a creative way also. Of course, it is a sequel, so it is not as good, but the filmmakers did not, to their credit, attempt to make it more bloody, or more action-filled. The traps Jigsaw (the main bad guy) sets for his patients are more creative, but not to the point of trying to completely outdo the original. The filmmakers have a clear understanding that, as a sequel, they cannot hope to overshoot the original, no matter how hard they try, so they do not try too hard like so many people do. All in a all a wonderful story, though it is not for the weak of stomach, as it is filled with gore. Another thing I liked about the sequel was that the ending was also sixth sensish. Here's some advice to those of you who have yet to see one or both of them: Don't preoccupy yourself with trying to figure out the story. Ride the whole thing with the characters, and let the realizations come to you as they come to them. You will enjoy the storyline much more if you immerse yourself in what they are feeling instead of analytically analyzing every detail to figure out the plot twist. Go see Saw II, and if you haven't seen the first, go see the first, and then the second. I definitely suggest seeing the first one first, because the effect of the ending in the second one is all the more enhanced if you see the first beforehand. These are two wonderful masterpieces of gore-film-making, while still effectively focusing on proper character development, a rarity in most Hollywood horror flicks. These are definitely not films to miss if you are a movie fan, and especially if you're a gore/horror fan.",8,0,1,13 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Magic is Gone
","In Order of the Phoenix, David Yates gives us a bland spectacle that lacks any real magic or character development and features a disjointed storyline and over-the-top acting. I reasonably enjoyed the book, even though it was over long and nothing really happened, but I didn't really like the movie, and as I'll show you, most of that has nothing to do with the book.The movie begins with Harry at home in Privet Drive, morosely sitting on a swing and making angst-ridden faces. This didn't bode well. It didn't help anymore when Dudley waddled along with his friends and stuttered out lines that seemed to be read from a cue card offscreen. After a brief fight and chase the two are assaulted by a couple of poorly-animated Dementors that have gotten a pointless makeover since the third movie. They have lost much of their threat and seem just to be vapor wisps of CGI floating around. I asked myself, 'What has happened to Harry Potter?' Soon Harry is whisked off to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, where the Order of the Phoenix, a group dedicated to fighting Voldemort since his return, resides. Eventually he goes off to school. All of this happens within 20 minutes, which is actually a good thing. Rowling takes 200 pages to get to the school and spends a lot of time dithering on fanciful descriptions of things, but David Yates takes us straight to Hogwarts. If only he had done it in an understandable manner.The thing that Order struggles most with is finding a central story other than simply Harry. In a movie called 'The Order of the Phoenix' you would think that it would feature the Order more than anything else, yet most of the people in the order get very little screen time. Namely Lupin, Arthur, and Sirius. It is clear from the beginning that this film is going to be about Harry and not much else. It even screws this up, though, as Harry's first crush and girlfriend is merely included because it was featured in the book. We feel none of the fleeting romance that was hinted at in the previous movie. The kiss between Harry and Cho was cheered for, of course, but other than, it was kind of anti-climactic, and nothing ever really came of it. You see Harry and Cho hang out once after that, but she is quickly shrugged aside as if the director said, 'Okay, now that we've got that in, let's move on to the main story.'The two best actors in this movie are unquestionably Daniel Radcliffe and Imelda Staunton. Radcliffe gives us his best performance since Prisoner of Azkaban, brilliantly conveying Harry's inner struggle as he approaches his destiny and realizes what he ultimately must do. The screenplay doesn't give him much quality to work with, but practically everything he touches turns to gold. The only person in this film who exceeds him is Imelda Staunton, who plays Dolores Umbridge. Every single line she utters is a wonderful combination of evil and innocence, joy and anger, pain and pleasure. Her character, unfortunately, comes to an unceremonial and disappointing end, but right up until her last breath before she is carried offscreen, Staunton does an amazing job. Alan Rickman (Snape) of course is astounding, but he doesn't show up often enough. David Thewlis (Lupin) is also incredibly accomplished - his first line in the movie had me practically cheering, as most every bit of acting before that had seemed dull and forced. Maggie Smith (McGonagall) effortlessly masters whatever scene she's in. Rupert Grint (Ron) shares great friendship chemistry with Harry. Emma Watson (Hermione) tries way too hard and every line she utters sounds forced. Her scenes with Radcliffe and Grint carry none of the ease of previous outings. Michael Gambon only reminded me of how excellent Richard Harris was. Admittedly, no one could have been better than Harris. The effortless presence that he carried, the humble glory, the slightly insane wisdom, the endearing fatherly quality, and the awe and respect he instilled in others could be felt with every single micro-second that he was on screen. Gambon, at first, seemed like a good choice.Now, he seems more like a raggedy bum than a wise old wizard. He does have his moments, and it's clear Gambon is still an excellent actor, but he better get his act together or people are going to wish HE would keel over so that a better actor could replace HIM.Even given all these faults, I might have been able to accept the film better if the effects had been up to par, but sadly, this is not the case at all. The finale is pretty spectacular, and the special effects there are some of the best I've seen this year - we finally get to see true magic battled out in a grand and uncontrollable fight scene. Everything else, though, falls far too short of the standards set by the previous four films. Even Goblet of Fire was passable because of the great special effects (the dragon looked completely realistic). But this one just seems lazy. Everything is dark, dreary, and boring. Where's the movie-making special effects magic that the series has become known for? This movie, if nothing else, succeeds as a good transition - taking us away from the fun and fanciful feel from the first four and bringing us closer to the dark world that we must enter if we are to see this series through to the end. I didn't like most of the film, but it's worth a matinée if you're a Potter fan, and don't worry - you'll only have to wait a year and a half for the next one. Unfortunately, the same director is lined up for the next movie, so here's hoping that a better book will translate into a better film.",5,13,20,12 July 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Bad as both an adaptation and a Stand-Alone Movie
","The Da Vinci Code is probably the most anticipated blockbuster so far this year. Based on the obscenely popular novel by Dan Brown, this movie features two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks in the role of Robert Langdon, a symbology professor at Harvard who is suddenly called upon to solve a centuries old mystery. It doesn't work. The movie is a flat-out disappointment - poor in comparison to the book, and poor as a stand-alone film.The movie opens with Paul Bettany, one of the two shining acting jewels in this film, in the role of Silas the monk, hunting down Jacques Sauniere in the Louvre. Immediately following this underwhelming scene, we are shown Silas whipping and inflicting self-torture, managing to incur more sympathy than Tom Hanks himself.It is revealed that Jacques Sauniere, in his final moments of death, set up a clue for his niece, Sophie, and Robert Langdon, to follow. Right from the get go, it is clear we are supposed to think of Sophie and Robert as a sort of erstwhile couple, yet Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou do not share nearly enough chemistry to makes this believable. Hanks' brilliant career has earned him two Oscars, yet in this film his talents are wasted. He plays the symbologist professor as a cardboard cutout who merely exists to get them to next clue in the puzzle. They set off on the trail, figuring out each subsequent clue as if it where nothing more than a Blue's Clues show.The film is slavishly faithful to the book - as if Howard was afraid that anything taken out would diminish its taut, tense quality. Yet it is precisely Howard's inclusion of every mundane detail that makes the movie seem so dull at times. The movie would have vastly benefited from being cut down to 110 - 120 minutes. It's two and a half hour running time is half an hour too long.Another problem is how badly the action of the book is for action on the big screen. The character's long explanations of the clues in the book worked because reading is quite a different experience from viewing. In the film, the characters talk over history channel style grainy flashbacks. It is as if the audience can't be expected to listen to a character talk without some sort of action going on in the background.Eventually Langdon and Sophie meet Leigh Teabing, an eccentric old scholar who knows more than anyone alive about the mystery of the Holy Grail and the Priory of Sion, a secret society dedicated to guarding the location of said object. Ian MacKellen's acting of Teabing is the other bright spot in the movie. This is what makes Tom Hanks's acting so disappointing. Admittedly, the character development in the novel is threadbare, and nonexistent in the movie. Yet that does not mean that Hanks could not have given Langdon a little bit of life. Hanks plays him as this dull history professor thrust into action which he immediately takes to like a duck to water. There is no moment of extreme surprise on incredulity, from him OR anyone else, in the entire movie. They just slip into their action hero jackets and plough straight ahead through the depressingly dull dialogue.The controversy of the film is diluted as well, obviously to in some way quell the angered grumblings of a lot of Christians. Langdon is now a skeptic. It is hard to tell whether this helps or does not help the movie - though given the transparency of Hanks's character, it doesn't really make a difference at all. The Da Vinci Code has been talked about to death. Approximately 1897 TV specials have been done on it, and though it is still selling strong, the time for this movie to come out has passed. Besides Langdon's skepticism in the movie, everything else about the controversial message is there, but it just carries the air of, 'who cares?' Finally, the ending of the movie is the very definition of anti-climax. We are given a perfectly good climax - tense, taut, and fulfilling. Yet the movie goes on for another twenty minutes, dragging out every moment to the point of breaking. One of the final insults of the movie comes when Langdon attempts to summarize the supposed lessons he's learned. The lines are horrendously convoluted and make Langdon seem like a wishy washy wuss - he goes back and forth several times, never quite settling on what he has actually learned. And after that, we are treated to the final 'HOLY CRAP' moment of the movie - which ends up working quite well, but is almost spoiled by an extra bit of camera-work that ends up feeling like a wasted bit of money.The Da Vinci Code, in one word: disappointing. The acting, the story, everything. I was expecting a taut tense mystery thriller, but it came off as nothing more than a particularly dull detective story. The controversial message of it alone may make it interesting enough to be worth seeing in theatres, but that is not enough for a recommendation, at least not from me. If you want the controversial message, AND a good, taut, tense thriller, go for the book. It's a thousand times better.",5,1,2,23 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Another Good Harry Potter movie
","The movie was very well filmed. It showed amazingly well the problems of adolescence, and I can't tell you how many times people in the theatre were 'aaawwing' and 'oooing' when Cho couldn't go to the Yule Ball with Harry, or Ron gave Harry a look that rivaled with that of a Basilisk. The special effects were not especially spectacular, but they were very very cool. And the movie, although very dark and being the first in the series to be rated PG-13, was very humorous throughout, right up until the point where Harry, Cedric, Krum, and Fleur entered the final task by going into the hedge maze. The scene where Voldemort comes back was incredibly well done, and so was the scene where Harry and Voldemort's wands connect and the ghosts of Voldemort's kills come forth from his wand. I thought it could have used a little more dramatism. When Harry brings back Cedric with the Triwizard Cup Portkey, and he yells at everyone that 'Voldemort's back!!' amidst cries of anguish over Cedric's death, the movie seemed to lack a little bit of the importance about how HORRIBLE Voldemort coming back was.My biggest problem with the movie was everything they cut out. Now, obviously, some things don't really need to be in the movie, and aren't that important. The scene that they cut out that annoyed me the most, however, was the Quidditch Cup. They showed the very beginning of it, and then once the Snitch was released by Cornelius Fudge, the movie cut straight to the Weasleys celebrating over the Irish's victory. This means that, for the first time in the franchise, there is no actual Quidditch playing in the movie. Undoutedly the biggest disappointment in the movie. They also cut out the entire subplot about Hermione's quest to free the house elves that make the food for Hogwarts. In the movie Harry only makes one trip into the Pensieve, whereas in the book he makes several. Also, in the book when Harry wins his million Galleons from winning the Triwizard tournament and gives it to Fred and George to open their joke shop......well, that's not in the movie. Hopefully they will mention it in number five.If I went exclusively by how much they cut, I would give this movie a 4. However, it is a movie, and as a movie, it must be judged not by how much it cut from the book, but by its worth as a movie. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a spectacular movie in its own right, however, as a fan of the books, I must dock it little bit for being as unfaithful as it was to the book. Another reason I docked it points was because for someone who hasn't read the books, the movie might be a little confusing. The entire scene where Harry finds out Mad-Eye Moody is actually Barty Crouch is glossed over in a few minutes, entirely skipping the intricacy that the book shows us quite clearly. In the book we are slammed with the realization that Mad-Eye is Barty, probably one of the best endings to the Harry Potter books because of its sheer Sherlock Holmes/Sixth Sense type feel. In the movie it could be potentially confusing to someone who hasn't read the books. Another problem I have with the movie is that it is even shorter than the first movie, which doesn't really make sense, as the book is four times as long as the first one. Why are the filmmakers afraid to make a longer movie? The children fans of the series have proved that they can sit through a very long movie - why doesn't Hollywood trust them (and us) to sit through a three hour movie? We did it with Lord of the Rings, and many young kids went to see that too.For any fans of the books, it is well worth the price of admission. Though be forewarned, you will be slightly disappointed by the amount they have cut off, if not completely disappointed. Goblet of Fire, in relation to the book, is a very good movie. Taken by itself, it is a very very excellent movie.",8,0,0,13 February 2006
The Departed," Brilliant, Gripping Crime Drama
","The Godfather. Goodfellas. LA Confidential. Pulp Fiction. Scarface. These movies stand tall among the greatest gangster dramas ever made. Each of them features a gripping story, complex characters, and a memorable tale of intricate passion and power. The Departed will take its place among these greats and stands tall as Martin Scorcese's greatest achievement yet.There is a rather large cast in The Departed, but if it were to be boiled down to three main protagonists, they would be Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, and Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson. Costello is a rich, powerful, Irish mob boss. Costigan is an undercover cop who wheedles his way into Costello's inner circle, which includes an undercover gangster working in the police department, Sullivan. The Departed follows the investigation into Costello's mob work, Sullivan's interplay with Costello, and Costigan's growing guilt and inner torture over the things he must do and see as an undercover cop.One the The Departed finest aspects is the stellar acting from virtually every member of the all-star cast. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in one of the most impressive performances of his already impressive career. He portrays the tortured Billy Costigan to perfection. Matt Damon continues his unbroken string of masterful performances as Costello's mole in the police. Unfortunately, Jack Nicholson turns in one of the most disgustingly over-the-top performances I had seen in awhile. It looks like he's begging for an Oscar with the way he tries to come across, but all that I kept on seeing was Jack Nicholson playing himself. What could have been a deep and complex character turns into nothing more than showboating at its worst. The character he plays is complex enough, but Nicholson does not give it nearly enough justice. Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen all turn in their own noteworthy performances, most of all Wahlberg, and though he doesn't get much screen time, still manages to portray his character to its full depth and potential. Alec Baldwin's role is almost funny in how close it comes to self-parody, and Martin Sheen plays the head investigator Queenan with a serious fun Character is another impressive aspect of The Departed. Every last character is fleshed out, full, complex, and detailed. The closest thing that any character comes to one-dimensional is the cop psychologist, Matt Damon's love interest. She is supposed to be this amazingly brilliant woman, but she just comes across as irrational and careless as she eagerly dives into dangerous relationships and situations right and left. Aside from her, though, the other characters are sketched out perfectly. Ellerby, Dignam, and Queenan (Baldwin, Wahlberg, and Sheen), though secondary characters, still feel like completely real people. Damon's character of Sullivan is wonderfully drawn. Costello, as I already mentioned, is almost ruined by Jack Nicholson, but he still manages to shine a bit of his complexity through the ruinous vehicle of Nicholson. Most interesting is Dicaprio's multi-dimensional Costigan, who is the most interesting and multi-faceted character I have seen in a film in a long time. He's not the typical cop who's feeling guilty over coming dangerously close to becoming a criminal. He is this and so much more and the huge complexity of his character could easily have been fumbled by a lesser actor than DiCaprio. It's beautifully pulled off, though.The intricate interplay of characters and the complex twists and turns in the film are another hallmark of its greatness. This is not some straightforward crime drama. There will be surprises. There will be twists. But more than this, everything, all these aspects, all work together to grab us in at the outset and to never let go. The storyline is positively riveting in its intensity and uncompromising vision of the dark underworld of crime. We have seen this before in films, portrayed especially wonderfully in the films mentioned above, and The Departed is no less great or capable than those others. At two hours and twenty minutes, it doesn't even stretch its waistline or overstay its welcome. It's just the right length. Usually any movie that goes over two hours overstays its welcome plenty, but The Departed is a notable exception. It is a very clean, streamlined movie. This being said, though, it is not a perfect one.Jack Nicholson's performance drags the whole show down more than any one aspect. If it hadn't been for him, the film could have been so much better. The character of Madolyn comes across as two clear and one-dimensional in comparison to the rest of the cast. Besides this, though, Scorcese seems preoccupied with all the horror and evil that goes on in this world, while never really focusing in on the good. He touches on it in brief tender moments between Costigan and Madolyn and Sullivan and Madolyn, but he never focuses there. Scorcese obviously prefers to show us the brutality and debauchery of this world, which is fine if that is his vision for the film. A more clean and hopeful view, though, could have helped the bleakness a little.Fine performances have always been the hallmark of greatness in films. The cast of the Departed is one of the best to come along in a long while. (If it weren't for that darn Jack!!) Its storyline is not simplistic or overly violent for the sake of violence. Everything, every line, every action, every moment serves a purpose and serves to drive the vehicle of the film forward. The gripping, dark score does its part well in this as well. The complex and multi-faceted characters interacting and clashing on screen have been some of the most real and fleshed-out characters that I have ever seen on celluloid. True, it has its flaws, but as a gangster crime drama thriller, these days, it really has no equal.",9,2,7,27 February 2007
Casino Royale," Bond is Back...And Better than Ever
","The James Bond franchise has been needing a good shot in the arm ever since the series began to flag with Tomorrow Never Dies, back in 1997. Suffering from bleak plots, an increasing amount of campiness that defied explanation, boring one-note villains over and over again, it seemed like Bond had breathed his last. Casino Royale could only go two ways: help the Bond franchise or drive the final stake into its heart. Fortunately, Daniel Craig (Bond) and Martin Campbell (the director) have managed to successfully do the former, bravely reworking the Bond formula into something that the public has longed for for such a long time: a movie that does not solely rely on the name for the numbers, but a movie that relies on what audiences crave: quality.The movie opens with the usual razzle-dazzle display of flashy colors and cleverly put-together graphics, but these defied any previous James Bond film that I have seen. After this we are treated to Daniel Craig inflicting the two kills he must in order to become a 00. We quickly learn that this Bond is not the suave gentleman spy with which we are familiar. This is Bond is real. His bones break. His skin bleeds. He screws up. He gets cocky in situations where it's deadly.Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is the highlight of the film. There's no winking at the camera, no sly 'I'm so great because they picked me to play Bond' feeling. This is Bond in the real world. This Bond is flesh, bones, and blood. He's not some untouchable superhero, like all the others. And screw the fact that he's blonde. And the complaining Bonde fanboys can shut their mouths because this is the Bond that will save the franchise and give us something which we have been craving: good acting.Great action is another thing that sells Casino Royale. There are no ridiculously large explosions, no cheesy special effects that smother the story. Towards the beginning there is a rather large explosion that seems unnecessary, but it's understandable. Aside from that, though, the action is very real, very gritty, and very very well done. A scene at the beginning where Bond is chasing someone through the streets of Madagascar is one of the most breathless chase scenes I've experienced in a long while.The storyline is nothing spectacular, it's nothing revolutionary. What is revolutionary (at least for the Bond franchise) is the way they completely did away with the campiness, the puns, and the sheer disgusting cheese that was stifling the franchise. It was fine when it first came out, but the installments of late have just been disgusting with how much they excessively rely on this formula. As Casino Royale proves, you don't need these things to make a Bond film. What you need is a good Bond, and Craig delivers this. Action flicks have always been a step ahead of Bond because of how they are not chained to a particular formula - Bonds have been able to rely on a solid fan base for success of their films, but fans can only go so far, and Casino Royale has been able to open up the franchise to a much wider fan base - people I've spoken to who normally hate Bond films absolutely love Casino Royale.There is one thing that really detracted from the experience, and it was the length of the movie. After the film reached a very satisfying conclusion, it seemed to drag on for another twenty minutes or half an hour, ending with a very predictable collapse of a building that reminded me of the useless explosion at the beginning of the film. Were the filmmakers afraid to end the film without a building collapsing? What came before the building collapsing also seemed artificially lengthened - I kept on expecting the closing credits to roll, but then scene after scene kept on being piled on. To the filmmakers credit, the extra scenes do attempt to add a bit of character to Bond, but I thought it just seemed fake and artificial. I don't want to give anything away, but I thought the scenes didn't fit with the Bond we had seen before.It's too bad the filmmakers felt like these extra twenty minutes were necessary, because if this fat had been trimmed, this would almost have been a perfectly streamlined adventure. As it is, it just bogs down the picture with forced sentimentality that didn't help at all.Casino Royale is quality film-making in every sense of the word. It is a refreshing departure from the stifling and overbearing Bond formula, Daniel Craig's performance is nearly Oscar-worthy, and it's just so good. This is the shot of the adrenaline we have been waiting for.",8,1,2,11 December 2006
Speed," Blazing Fast Entertainment
","When it hit theatres in 1994, Speed was a rocket powered entertainment vehicle that was guaranteed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats the whole time, barely letting up the entire way as Keanu and/or the bus performed one death-defying stunt after another. 12 years later, Speed has lost none of its quality, and still succeeds in giving solid chills and thrills for a good hour and fifty minutes.The film opens with Keanu Reeves and Jeff Daniels attempting to rescue a group of hostages who are trapped in an elevator that could go off at any second, due to a crazed man who is holding them in the elevator for ransom (Dennis Hopper in a brilliant turn as Howard Payne). Needless to say, Reeves (Jack) and Daniels (Harry) succeed and (apparently) dispatch the bad guy to oblivion. Months later, though, Jack must combat his old nemesis when a bus is wired to explode if it goes below 50 miles per hour.Forget logic. Forget reason. Speed is that rare, liberating experience that actually succeeds in making you not care whether something makes sense. Reeves can ram a subway into a wall and not die, go climbing around in the undercarriage of a bus, and come out virtually completely unscathed. Speed succeeds in virtually everything in sets out to do, which, thankfully, is not much.The filmmakers never have any illusions that they are making this a character driven drama that will have you weeping if one of the characters dies. Thought some characterization is added, it is definitely secondary to the action. All its purpose is to do is to that you care at least a little bit for the main character and what happens to him and his romantic opposite: Annie, played by Sandra Bullock. Though normally, lack of characterization might be classified as bad, Speed is the rare exception to the rule: the rare movie that comes along at just the right time, and blends just enough action and characterization to make you say, 'Forget those people! Let's get to the good stuff!' And believe me, the 'stuff' is good. Mind-blowingly so. With movies out now like The Matrix, Equilibrium, the new Star Wars, and other action-packed films, you would think Speed would lose some of its impact. Not true. Years later, it still has that special something that sets it apart from all other action films. The action is creative, never-the same, constant, tense, taut, and thrilling. A good musical score en-chances the action as well. Dennis Hopper's acting is just the tiniest bit cheesy, but that works for the film. Reeves is his usual dumbed-down action hero, and it fits the part of Jack perfectly. Daniels shows a refreshing bit of his dramatic side, and Bullock captures just enough chemistry with Reeves to make it believable.Speed will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time, with unbelievably tense and amazing action. It never once takes itself too seriously. It is conscious of its own cheese, and fully embraces it, finding the perfect balance of cheese and gravitas. Explosions, a blazing fast bus, and a speeding subway train. What more could one ask for?",9,1,2,1 June 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," An excellent summer popcorn flick
","Admit it. When you first heard that they were making a Die Hard 4, you probably thought it was one of the worst ideas ever. I know it's what I thought. Live Free or Die Hard is, of course, not as good as the original (come on, you had to know a lot of Bruce Willis's talk was just hype) but it is the second best in the series, staying absolutely true to its roots and giving us a solid popcorn spectacle.Justin Long is Matthew Farrell - a genius computer hacker who is the only one left alive after a criminal mastermind and his posse murder seven of his friends and then come after him. Assigned to escort him back to headquarters for questioning is John McClane, the same bad-a** mother****** we knew back in the old days. Kind of cocky, but self-assured and anti-authority like we like him. The action begins about ten minutes in and barely ever lets up from there. The storyline is a bit simple and preposterous, of course - a ring of American terrorists plan a digital Armageddon - but it's a perfect excuse for the spectacular action and believable enough that most people can accept it.There are two things that sell this movie, and if either of them had sucked, it would have been complete crap. Bruce Willis and action. The best part about the action is that it is refreshingly devoid of CGI. It is hardcore, intense, and pulse-pounding. What you see is literally what you get. Bruce Willis jumping out of a car at 25 miles per hour? Actually happened. Smashing a car into a helicopter? Actually happened. However, the action is only the secondary star - the real power behind this film comes from the one and only Bruce. The film is dead in the water until the arrival of Bruce.As everyman cop John McClane who forgot his shoes and went traipsing around on some broken glass in 1988, Willis resonated with the audience in his performance. He was not some superhero - his struggles were real, he made mistakes, and he got bloodied, broken, and bruised for it. One of the things I did not enjoy about this movie was how McClane was less of a real character and more of a legend - he's not such an everyman anymore. But even if the script doesn't make him out to be an everyman, Bruce Willis's performance could have fooled me. Nobody can spout out gallows humor one-liners like this guy. Every single one of his lines drew a huge laugh from the audience, and his carefree and fun attitude with everything only made him more endearing. This is a man who has been through hell and back - and it hasn't fazed him. The only reason he's less of an everyman is because we've known him for awhile, so he seems like something of a superhero. But it's not his fault he's lived through some pretty terrible crap. He is simply a man who loves his country and will do his absolute best to protect it - he just does what he needs to do, and why not have fun doing it? This is still John McClane, and Bruce Willis's performance is perfect.All except three of the rest of the cast is forgettable. Justin Long as the hacker started out annoying, but he quickly became endearing and his great chemistry with Bruce Willis really helped the movie - you can tell that the actor was kind of intimidated by being in a movie with Bruce Willis, but it only helped his performance, because the character would have every reason to be scared of McClane. Timothy Olyphant as the villain was not bad, but he wasn't super amazing either. Alan Rickman, the villain in the first film, was absolutely wonderful and perfect in every way. He relished the role and made it more memorable than it might otherwise have been. For the first half of this movie, the villain is mostly boring and uninteresting, but when he begins to get more screen-time I sensed a genuinely villainous character that was being played with a lot of fun. Sometimes it bordered too close to the typical calm bad guy showing how evil he is because he's so calm, but overall it was a fairly impressive performance, and any performance can seem bad when it follows the incomparable Alan Rickman. The other notable cast member was only a cameo, but it was hilarious and perfect and I won't spoil it for you because the surprise upon seeing this person is half the fun.Live Free or Die Hard may be the best popcorn flick this summer yet.It hearkens back to simply fun days of action cinema. Movies like Aliens, Raiders of the Lost Ark, or the original Die Hard, were hardcore, uncompromising movies, none of which had the handicap of CGI, but which still stand as some of the greatest action movies of all time. Live Free or Die Hard may not be among them as one of the greatest, but it is still an efficiently executed summer popcorn flick that knows exactly what it wants to deliver and succeeds in every possible way. It's a movie that'll have you shouting, 'Yipee-kay-yay mother******!'",8,1,3,28 June 2007
300," A Bloody Epic Battle
","The new Frank Miller graphic novel epic brought to life on the big screen can be summed up the three B's on man movies: Blood, Boobs, and Bangin.To call 300 anything more than what it aspires to be would be a disgrace to its filmmakers. If anyone, at any time, during the production of this film, honestly said to themselves, 'you know, we could win an Oscar for best picture for this movie!', then I'd honestly hand over my left kidney to them. Anybody with a brain knows that 300 is not about the heart, but the brawn. The film takes place in ancient Greece, following the Spartans and their king, Leonidas, as they struggle to push off the yoke of an oppressive Persian Emperor. One day a messenger from the Persian emperor comes to Sparta reminding Leonidas that he must pay tribute to the oppressor. Leonidas refuses, killing the messenger and thus angering all of Persia, who come to his doorstep to return the favor. Leonidas is meant to come off as brave, valiant, and a true warrior, but much of the time he merely comes off as foolish. When he is about to kill the messenger, the messenger says, 'This is madness!' to which Leonidas defiantly replies, 'THIS IS SPARTA!' while I thought there thinking, 'Okay, impressive, but still, kind of stupid of him.' As most anyone knows, 300 is about a valiant group of Spartan warriors who stood their ground against thousands for Persian forces, ultimately losing, but paving the way for a defeat of Persian armies later. Without the sacrifice of those 300, the defeat of the army would have been impossible. All these themes of sacrifice, memory, honor, and courage serve well to somehow justify all the blood being splattered in our faces, and they do get a rise out of the audience, but they are still quite clearly slapped on there. We can't kid ourselves. It's all about the ass-kicking.And unfortunately, 300 doesn't get truly ass-kicking until about an hour or so in, which is a strong detriment to the film. I came to see Persians getting the crap kicked out of them, and yes, though I do appreciate a backstory and a build-up to the main action, much of the emotional posturing could have been done without. The audience knows they didn't some to see some powerful Shakespearean love story of war and betrayal. They came to to see blood flying and unabashed gore. 300, on this front, does not completely deliver. True, there is a lot of sweet action and fantastic visual effects, but it takes a long time to build-up to them, and whenever the action diverges back to the town of Sparta or to the camp of Xerxes, the Persian emperor, I got restless and wished they would just move on with the action. Political movements behind the scenes in Sparta abounded, but they seemed entirely pointless, and even if they weren't, we did not need to see that much. Xerxes's base camp was laughable in it sheer lesbian debauchery. I just sat there shaking my head at the silliness of it all, wishing I could get back to what I had come for: blood.All this being said, what relatively little action there is is done amazingly well. The many battle scenes are breathtaking, captivating, eviscerating, and mind-blowingly spectacular. They are not hampered by a PG-13 rating like Lord of the Rings, and thus, there is no limit to where they can go. A man's head can be sliced off directly in front of the camera, fall off, and go tumbling past so that I can see flesh and bone fly by. There are several sliced heads, severed limbs, and plenty of interesting splatter effects from the blood, which I never got tired of seeing. And it's not just constant splattering either. The choreography and camera-work in the battle scenes is quite well accomplished. Every single man in the 300 is digitally enhanced so that they have six packs and pecs like Arnold Schwarzenegger - quite the accomplishment, though sometimes I just laughed at how ludicrous it was. This, though, combined with the blood spatters, the cool cinematography, and the color-palette, all combined to make a visually fascinating experience.The acting was surprisingly good, too - nothing Oscar-worthy, but every performed in a rousing, screaming, bloody, melodramatic way that it fit the Spartan world perfectly. Gerard Butler as Leonidas portrays the Spartan king perfectly, screaming all the way. He carries a LOT of charisma, too, and steals every single scene that he is. Dominic West as Theron, another main warrior, is well played too, but of special note is David Wenham, who played Faramir in the Lord of the Rings, and plays Dilios to perfection in 300. Every other performance is everything you'd expect from this type of movie - boring, over-the-top, and predictable. Rodrigo Santoro is almost laughable as Xerxes - he comes off as a flamboyant jewelry-obsessed pansy more than a powerful world conqueror.300 was based on a graphic novel, so the reason for its visual style is clear, a graphic novel that was created by the same man who penned and drew Sin City, the film version of which I found far less satisfying than 300. I always found Sin City to be nothing more than black and white hedonistic trash. Nothing was special about it at all except its style. It didn't even have cool action. It was all just a depressing and decrepit picture. 300, on the other hand, manages to contain BOTH style and amazing action. The story is still nothing special, but it's only a vehicle for the violence, so who really cares? Like I said, blood, boobs, and bangin'.",7,0,2,11 March 2007
Happy Feet," True Toe-Tapping Fun!
","Singing and dancing penguin cultures collide in this snowy antarctic adventure that delivers about as much toe-tapping fun as any dancing or music fiend could hope for, with catchy tunes that'll have your feet uncontrollably tip-tapping along on the floor with the happy dancing penguins. Featuring an all-star voice cast, the most realistic computer animation this side of Shrek, and an intelligent and thoughtful storyline that soars above the mediocre heads of all the recently released CGI movies, Happy Feet is a fun and thought-provoking film that not only can little kids enjoy, but adults will find plenty to munch on as well.We are introduced to a couple of penguins in love, in the middle of a mating ritual, which involves the woman penguin waltzing around singing until she finds the perfect man penguin to sing for her. Soon the two have an egg, which, due to a brief uncontrollable toe-tapping from Dad (dancing is forbidden in this penguin society), slides away into the blizzard. He quickly retrieves it, but later on their baby, Mumble, voiced by Elijah Wood, is born, and not only can he not sing worth a darn, his toe-tapping skills are amazing. Rejected by his peers and by most of the colony, Mumble, eventually finds his way to a neighboring penguin colony where he is accepted. From there, he must continue on, using his dancing skills to figure out why the fish are disappearing from the ocean. (Hint: They're aliens with large scary machines.) Happy Feet is a movie that starts off innocently enough. You have a few fun dance numbers, some cool duets and solos, including a rendition of Queen's 'Somebody to Love.' The music is exquisite, the dance numbers are creative and extremely fun. There is one part, involving a chase with a sea lion, that some young ones may find scary, but it's nothing too bad, and it's exquisitely and breath-takingly done. The movie is rated PG, people, and with 'mild peril' for a reason. It's not a movie for very little kids.Then the movie takes a turn that many have argued is for the worse, but which I believe puts it head and shoulders above the competition. After awhile, I wondered what the heck was going to happen with Mumble's dancing talents. It seemed the movie was going nowhere with them, but he eventually uses them, in a very creative way.This movie gets kind of dark, and, many would argue, environmentally preachy, but I'm glad it took this route. I was afraid I'd get a sappy, gag on my puke, clichÃ© storyline, but instead of going with the tried-and-true formula, Happy Feet took a risk, a risk that has well payed off, it seems, as it received 79% on rottentomatoes, and has topped the box-office two weeks in a row, despite tough competition from Casino Royale. Happy Feet is not a movie content to stay inside its prescribed boundaries. It takes chances with the storyline, it does something new, different, fresh, and daring, and it has a lot of people upset. Many people take their little kids to this and are horrified that they were not given the everything is happy and free kiddie flick the previews promised them. The Lion King had a very dramatic death, though, one that caused controversy back in the day, and yet it was a very good movie.Happy Feet may have toyed with its audiences a little too much. It could have been more honest with the previews, and I found the conclusion to the film a little odd and it did seem kind of incongruous with what had come before. I applaud their risk-taking, though. The controversial plot aside, though, character development is stellar, the storyline is endearing and fun, the CGI is so real in places you may swear that you're watching actual penguins waddle along the ice. Each of the characters is fun, too - Robin Williams in the dual role as Ramon/Lovelace, especially. I was afraid he would just be annoying and try to steal the show with his shtick, but it fit perfectly into the storyline. And, of course, with a movie about dancing, if the music sucked, the movie would not be much to speak of. And fortunately, the music is awesome, dancing, happy feet music. It's just a movie that makes me want to get up and dance right along with Mumble and the whole penguin colony. It really makes me happy when a movie raises the bar, especially an animated one, because of how crappy animated movies are these days. Happy Feet does have a few flaws, but they are negligible. And besides, who are we kidding? It's all about the dancing penguins.",8,0,2,28 November 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Amazing Performance by Will Smith
","'Inspired by a true story' always makes me kind of nervous. It's as if the filmmakers are falling back on the fact that it's a true story, hoping that the truth of it will pull our heartstrings, rather than the actual story. The Pursuit of Happiness admittedly suffers from some of these weakness, but mostly overcomes them, particularly in the person of Will Smith, who delivers the best performance of his career.Chris Gardner is a man who is struggling financially, because invested in bone density scanners that most doctors do not find to be too useful. He has a wife and kid, both of whom must deal with Chris's difficulties as he goes through life. One day he happens upon a man who is a stockbroker, who tells him that to make it in that field, he only needs to 'be good with numbers, and be good with people.' Soon after Chris pursues this career path, but he still must deal with his family's financial troubles, and selling the bone density scanners. The movie follows his struggles.The story of Pursuit of Happiness is solid, but it feels kind of pointless. By the time the movie was over, I felt moved by Chris Gardner and his plight, but I wondered why someone had chosen to make a film of him. The end of the movie gave a couple of facts about how Gardner, the actual man, and it kind of justified why the story had been told, but ultimately, it failed to resonate. If a lesser talented actor had been in the role, it would have failed completely.Will Smith's performance is breathtaking. He undoubtedly gives the best performance of his career, and it might even possibly be Oscar-worthy. I wouldn't be surprised if he was nominated, in any case. He fully inhabits his character and never once slips up. His tragedy feels very real, very present. Only because of him does this movie work. He brings out the best about the movie, and even if one thinks the rest of the movie is worthless, his performance alone is worth the price of a movie ticket.I respect Will Smith. He went from being a rapper to being someone who will probably be nominated for an Oscar. This is a very difficult transition for a musical artist to make. He has even earned the respect of critics and audiences. Even if the story of Pursuit of Happiness is sub-par, it deserves praise for bringing out the best in Will Smith.",7,1,2,1 January 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Hilarious but Lacking True Plot
","The Simpsons has become part of our culture like none other. They have been around for nearly 20 years, and are still going strong, with end of the series not even a speck on the horizon. It was inevitable that they come out with a movie sooner or later, and for the most part, The Simpsons Movie is worth the wait. It is rife with the self-aware irony, witty satire, scathing parody, and hilarious comedy that the TV show has become known for. In fact, it is so much like the TV show that, if you weren't sitting in a darkened room surrounded by hundreds of people, you could be fooled into thinking it was a three-parter episode. In a film where hilarity is a given, something more must be asked of it, and, unfortunately, the Simpsons fails to stretch itself in any way, being content, for the most part, to stick with its tried an true formula.Rather than attempt to explain the paper thin plot, I'll just summarize the basic idea for you. Springfield's lake is dangerously over-polluted, so the city puts a ban on dumping any further garbage into the lake. Homer, of course, screws everything up because of his mis-directed love for a young pig, and thus the US government forces all of Springfield to live under a giant indestructible dome, causing the town to riot against the cause of everything (Homer, once again), forcing the Simpson family to escape the indestructible dome and flee to Alaska to start anew. Meanwhile, Bart must deal with a realization that Homer is unsatisfactory as a Dad, Lisa finds the perfect guy for her, and the ever-enduring Marge has to question whether she really wants to endure any longer.With 400 episodes under their belt and counting, one thing the Simpsons have to be respected for is their longevity. No other TV series (aside from the Tonight Show, which doesn't even really count) has managed to stay alive this long, while still maintaining a healthily hilarious pulse. Though it doesn't carry as much clout as it once did, each new TV episode that comes out manages to be satirical, witty, and downright hilarious. The Simpsons movie is all of these things, lampooning religion, environmentalism, the government, and a sizable helping of other subjects too (most notable a spot-on cameo of a very notable star.) The movie is just plain hilarious - no question. There weren't two minutes during this film where I wasn't practically busting a gut laughing. But one also has to take into account that with 400 episodes down the drain, there aren't many plot-lines left to do. I'm not a huge fan of the TV show - I respect it and appreciate its witty comedy and satire, but I'm not a regular watcher, so I can't speak to whether or not this plot has been done before, but one very clear thing that I did notice was that if everything superfluous were stripped away, the movie would be about the length of a 44-minute Simpsons special.Take Homer's love for the pig - the thing which causes him to bring ruin to the entire town. Though it does give us the line that is already becoming a classic - 'Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig, does whatever a Spider-Pig does...Can he swing - from a web? No he can't, he's a pig...' this whole thing is basically a plot device - once the pig has served his purpose we really don't see him anymore. Lisa's new crush is basically just adding on a little romantic subplot that doesn't affect the outcome of the film at all, and Bart's questioning his father's love is merely for the sake of adding screen time. If enough work had been put into the plot, all these things could have worked together towards a resolution - but as it is the only strong thread that runs the length of the movie is Homer. Marge questioning her devotion to Homer comes in a close second, and it's good to see some real conflict in these characters we love, but it's not enough to save the paper thin plot. Another disappointment is that none of the extra characters have any strong involvement - we see cameos from Moe and the gang, but that's all they are. Ironically the strongest character in the movie (aside from Homer) is a government official whom I don't believe has been in the TV series at all.All this criticism being leveled against it, though, I would still give it a positive recommendation. It's a disappointment if you're looking for something beyond the series fare, but if you're just looking for a solid comedy, look no further. One of the reasons it's disappointing is because of the sheer comedic brilliance that we've seen these writers capable of. If they can write comedy like that, don't you think they could have at least come up with a plot that doesn't artificially extend itself with four or five superfluous story lines? Apparently not. Eh. Maybe they'll do better with the next movie. Because whether the series continues or not, you can bet this is not the last of our favorite yellow family's visit to the silver screen.",6,3,4,22 August 2007
V for Vendetta," Good Action Flick with a Well-Thought out Plot
","V for Vendetta is just the right kind of film you would expect to have come from the minds of the Wachowski brothers, creators of the Matrix trilogy. (They wrote the screenplay for V, based off of a graphic novel.) It hearkens back to the day when we were all wowed by their perfectly put together Matrix. The first one, not the sequels. V for Vendetta combines the perfect amount of thought-provoking dialogue and plot while spicing it up with enough a**-kicking to make it a worthy action movie. This is the kind of movie that shows how graphic novels are not to be dismissed as mere comic books, but are a juicy fare of their own. It reminds us of how good adaptations can be wonderful, such as the brilliant History of Violence or the wow-inducing Sin City.It opens with a scene in the early 21st century, that cuts back and forth between Natalie Portman's character (Evey) and Hugo Weaving's (V). Within ten minutes we are treated to a blindingly fast razzle-dazzle bit of action, barely lasting a minute, in which V rescues Evey from a couple of corrupt officers of the law. At this point there is a delightfully brain-tickling bit of alliteration in which V, speaking for a minute or so straight, inserts a word that begins with V every two or three words in his sentence. Not an easy thing to do with the letter V, or to speak it without making it look rehearsed, but Hugo Weaving pulls it off with his silky mastery of language that made him famous as Agent Smith.This brings me to how great Hugo Weaving is in the movie. He is behind a mask, the mask of Guy Fawkes, a freedom fighter/terrorist in England of many years ago. This mask is over his face the entire movie. Not once does he take it off. One would think that this would inhibit his acting skill, but it doesn't even come close. He brilliantly weaves his voice to excellently communicate his character's intent. He is undoubtedly the best thing about this movie.The movie follows Evey's journey as V takes her under his wing in his terrorist plots against the overly-oppressive British government, along the way, of course, brilliantly giving the audience questions about the nature of government, the rights of citizens, and so on. This is another of the high points of the movie, the way it forces to the viewer to put into question basic precepts that might not otherwise be even thought of. V for Vendetta's basic idea can be summed up in one of V's phrases: 'People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.' From this springs the entire plot and idea of the movie.As for special effects, the movie is no replete with action scenes. In fact, I got far less action than I was expecting. But as I left the movie theater, I found myself not really caring. The movie was a good movie, and I respected the filmmakers refusal to pander to trend in Hollywood today of filling up a movie with action so much that it overflows. V for Vendetta finds that delicate balance that a lot of movies do not: just enough action, and just enough dialogue. The action that you do see is quite breath-taking, bringing to the table highly stylized and cool innovations in special fx technology. The final fight scene is frenetic and flashy, and you'll probably find yourself saying, 'Wow.' To close, V for Vendetta is perfect for people who are looking for a solid action flick with a plot that can hold up under pressure. It has a heart and a mind behind all the effects, a heart and a mind that force the viewer out of the couch-potato mindset of watching a movie simply to see some gore fly. And it is well worth a ten dollar movie ticket.",9,2,4,24 March 2006
