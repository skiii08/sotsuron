First Man," Very Insightful!
","I have seen the film's trailer but couldn't watch it on big screen when it got released in India. I have watched earlier space films like Apollo 13, Gravity and Interstellar. After watching the trailer I hoped that this film will be something like Apollo 13, about the victory of human over nature and space. But after watching the First man, I must admit that I am pleasantly surprised.This film reveals us the making of the man Neil Armstrong. What it takes to be the first man to walk on moon? How much preparation and sacrifice goes in making history? Also what happens to the family members of such historical figures? This film is touches all these aspects. And that is the USP of this film.Technique and Craft-wise, it is quite competent on each front. Over all, It is a well made film coming from top director Damien Chazele.",8,1,2,8 February 2019
It Follows," A film which leads nowhere
","Undoubtedly, it's quite an intriguing plot. But it loses steam very soon as there is no progression happening. The pace is kept slow to build in the creepiness of the scenario, but it starts irritating when nothing new happens. Also, the acting is quite average. The direction is OK but it's not supported enough by the screenplay. Overall, a forgetful film.",4,3,4,30 August 2017
The Lion King," This is review of the Hindi version of the film - It is not as funny and entertaining as expected.
","I went to watch this as a fan of the earlier Lion King, Haku-na-matata and Jon Favreau. I have watched the Jungle book in English as well as Hindi. The Hindi version was funnier than the English version because the humor was more Indian and rooted.So I decided to watch this Lion King's Hindi version. But I was quite disappointed. This time the Hindi dub could not capture the essence of the English version. Due the film was felt too long and dragging.The best character in the Hindi dub came out as Scar and then Mufasa. The critics are praising Shryas Talpade and Sanjya Mishra as Timon and Pumba. But I disagree with them. The Hindi translation is quite bad and it is due to the acting of these two great actors that is making Timon and Pumba appealing.
The biggest mistake in the translation is giving fixed regional accent to the characters. While the bad Hyenas are speaking Bihari accent Hindi, the good friends Pumba and Timon are speaking Mumbai accent Hindi. This is very foolish adaptation. I also feel that Mumbai accent Hindi has been so overused in Hindi cinema that it has lost it's charm. I wish the Hindi writers have used some other accent, perhaps Tamil for one and Gujrati for other. It would have been funnier.Due to bad writing the supporting characters despite some great actors like Shahnaz Patel, Shiv Subramaniam and Achint Kaur playing them, couldn't make a mark. The poorest here are Aryan Khan and Neha Gargava. Their voices could not portray the leadership and heroism of Simba and Nala. I am still wondering the reason for selection of Aryan Khan for Simba.Same is the problem with the Hindi songs. The original composition of all the songs is so western and produced as per the norm of composition of the west, that when they are translated in Hindi they felt quite weird. Perhaps that is the reason why greatest of Disney movie songs could not become popular in India.On technical front, the film doesn't leave any stone un-turned. It delivers what is expected from it.Overall, the Hindi version of this movie is totally avoidable.",6,0,0,24 July 2019
Green Book," A very relevant and heart-warming film.
","I was not very impressed by the trailer of this film. But when it got so many nominations in the OSACRS, I was forced to watch it. And I must admit that i was so wrong after watching the trailer.Green Book is a very nice film which should not be missed. The story of two people coming from very opposite background and with many prejudices against each other connects immediately with me. Although the film is set in 1962, many issues shown in the film are still relevant and true.Still the world is divided on the lines of colour, country, caste, religion, community etc. Most of the problems in world have popped because of these divisions. That is why despite this film being based on a true story, it can be adapted in every country. It is this universality of the film which made me fall in love with it.It is a well a well made film which is excellent in every department.",9,1,1,12 February 2019
