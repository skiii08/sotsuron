Blade Runner 2049," I hated version One and now I hate version two
",Well I got convinced that I needed two relook at both movies. Maybe I missed a gemstone. Rented both got an adult beverage and relaxed an watched... boy what a wasted time I spent watching both versions. I don't understand why there is a cult following for this movie. Just plain bad.,1,3,7,4 June 2018
Annihilation," Waste of time, in the current Chick hero mode.
","Disjointed plot is an understatement. Why would they send a team of women in to study this thing why would they send a team of men to study this thing. Why didn't I listen to my own mind as I knew this was a stupid movie. Nothing makes sense in this movie, monsters, reason, events, history black flashes. All for nothing? This movie is on my top 100 on worst movies ever. Sadly due to the lack or creativity nowadays my 100 list is growing.",1,0,6,19 August 2018
