The Blair Witch Project," Ha ha ha ha ha... Oh, I'm sorry. This is a horror film?
","This film is among the absolute worst I have ever seen, and I am taking into account things like Sandy Frank's 'Time Of The Apes'. What makes it bad? The plot was far too loose, leaving way too much to the imagination - plus key elements of the story's development were few and far in between. One CRUCIAL element is only mentioned ONCE, near the beginning.The acting was beyond horrible. It was more than obvious they were just putting on a show for the camera. Truthfully, the only part that WAS good is in all the commercials - the extreme close up of the girl crying.I have never laughed so hard in my life. This is supposed to be scary, right? Perhaps it would be if I were given a reason to be scared... or they lead into some major plot points a bit more.One thing I found very funny - at least about the VHS version - was the 'newly discovered' footage. This extra scene would have saved the film overall, except for the fact it obviously wasn't done rest of the film. The quality alone shows it.",2,0,2,24 November 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Burton + Elfman = Perfection Again
","Happily, the film starts with action - then lets you breathe. Humorous elements are thrown in at appropriate times to keep you from messing your pants. Overall, I found it suspenseful - and the ending a complete surprise. The visuals are greatly enhanced by Danny Elfman's haunting score. After all, what's a Burton flick without Elfman tunes?",9,0,0,24 November 1999
