Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Gross and stupid. Not even funny. Miss it if you can!
","When you see it, it feels like the director was thinking most of the time on how to make you laugh and regret it later. Sadly enough, he has a partial success: its not fun.Since the beginning it resorts to disgusting scenes, racism, and cultural differences in a quite pointless way to try to arise your laughter. This behavior continues during the whole movie, and no, it doesn't get better at all. There is no real story, no good jokes, no dialogs, no fun or enjoyment... nothing at all.This is NOT a stupid-movie to have a fun and relaxing time: it is a boring stupid-movie.",1,27,53,3 January 2007
