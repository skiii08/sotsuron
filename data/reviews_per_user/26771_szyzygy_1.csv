Men in Black 3," Did MIB 3 Insult The Chinese Community?
","After the battle scene in Chinatown, when 'J' a.k.a. Will Smith flashed his light in order to wipe out the memories of the Chinese actors, I swear I could see very clearly that there was a glow of watermark on their faces. This has never happened before with the previous 2 movies, and you don't get to see the same kind of glow on the face of other 'races' not even the aliens'! What does it mean? Does it mean that their faces were actually dirty and/or with germs and can only be detected under florescent light? The MIB franchise has a very highly supportive valuation and is very mush adored by the Asian/Chinese community since it first emerged in 1997. And if my claim is found to be true then MIB not only insulted those who have loved it but also betrayed the loyalty and trust we have invested in all the parties involved in the making of the movies.",Null,5,17,25 May 2012
