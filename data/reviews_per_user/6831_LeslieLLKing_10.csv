Walk the Line," completely wonderful portrayal of sensitive subject matter
","Even if you're not a fan of family saga, Walk The Line is worth seeing, just for the highlights of watching and listening to Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon perform musically. But this movie is even much more, at the heart, which will surprise the movie goer. Joaquin, as Johnny Cash plays the underdog country crooner with heart wrenching grit, style, and surprising sensitivity, sensibility, and sentimentality. His addiction to prescription pills never supports the happiness he truly desires and yearns for with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), who will later become his second wife, after divorcing his first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), played passionately. June is not only perky and positive, but she's intelligent and firm with Johnny when it comes to her stance against his drinking and pill popping.Many of his lyrics reflect love, heart ache, desire, but also darkness, despair and even destruction. He's a man who is forever attached to man's anguish ridden, and often times, battling psyche. As long as he's wearing black, he's singing about such conflicts, 'walking the line,' between sobriety and inebriation, clarity and crime, punishment and compassion. He feels empathy and warmth, where most would feel finality and coolness. This story is so colorfully depicted, even though the man always dressed in black. A challenge succeeds and surpasses our preconceived expectations. We only wish that Johnny, himself, lived with greater multi-color from within himself.For communication lacking in his first marriage, he saves with music, a mutual passion, in his second marriage, to June. Sadly, his first wife never fully accepts that music is integral to himself and hence, their relationship, and marriage. She persistently sees his music as separate from the two of them, even attempting to stop him from hanging band photos on a room wall. At a loss, she is unable to accept him for who he is completely, a man who identifies with himself, others, and life, through lyrical stories, in music. For her own dreams to justly come true, their divorce is inevitable, as their goals, desires, and dreams are not one in the same or shared. June, a talented singer in her own right does understand and is the closest aura of light and color to shine around and within him. But, it doesn't mean that she doesn't have her own share of conflicts, with the man dressed in black. Her hesitancy to get involved with a married man shows her own struggle to remain true to her morals, and respect for herself, for him, and his marriage. When June finally weds Johnny, he is truly blessed to have a shining light to his personal sentiment, and his professional path, a singing and performing career, one she not only acknowledges and praises him for, but contributes with her own talents as well. When things are good between them, personally and professionally, things are great for all, especially their fans, but when things are bad, moments are embarrassing for themselves and their public. But even through the strife, Johnny comes out a survivor, realizing the significance of love he has with June. In a final scene, his father Ray (Robert Patrick) and grandchild are playing telephone talk, with can and string, in the Cash backyard. Johnny helps his dad out and says to him, 'Pull a little tighter on the string,' and we smile, thinking how Johnny is capable of tightening the meaning to his own relationships, especially the one between him and his wife. He can't change the past with his father, but he can accept the present and make the most of what good things his father can offer, as a dad and a man. What a wonderful script and touching film about such delicate subject matters, brought to life by two very thoughtfully and thoroughly engaged actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. The supporting cast is the glue that shapes the work, telling the whole story, in all of its trials and tribulations. Even if you're not a huge fan of family saga, this film might draw your own sensibilities tighter.",10,1,2,14 March 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Mad TV are you warming up?
","This film is a tough nut to crack. Why? It is based upon good vs. evil. What is the evil founded? We know terrorism is evil. And, we know it is founded upon hatred for America, 'anti-American sentiment.' The picture of terrorism is clear and we know exactly why violent crimes occur. But, in MI III, the force behind the evil is not clear, and that diminishes our identification of good vs. evil. Evil takes the form of Davian, none other than a demented man set on grotesque women maiming, as in the case of agent Lindsey Ferris, (Kerry Russell) one of Ethan's newly accomplished students, and Julia, (Michelle Monaghan) Ethan's new bride. Davian's anti-woman charms seem trite, and so does terrorism for that matter, but the sad fact is, neither is extinct from our culture, only a part of it.Why does Tom have to play such a battered hero? It seems like I just recovered from War of The Worlds. But everyone has different breadth, so to speak, and he uses his to best portray the character he is identifying.Ethan's first mission is clear, save agent Lindsey, captive of Davian. Unfortunately, Ethan can't intercept, a deadly body implant chip. His second mission proceeds logically, capture Davian. When Davian takes Ethan's new bride hostage, Ethan follows Davian's instruction, for the safe return of beloved, Julia. Suddenly, John Musgrave, (Billy Crudop) Ethan's consultant, admits his own opportunities for steeling the rabbit's foot. Hunt's ultimate mission prevails, save a second woman's life. The first one died. Ving Rhames, as Luther Strickell, delivers a fine performance, under the pressures of his role too. Laurence Fishburne, as Hunt's boss, John Brassel is likewise is good. But for the lack of identity in this rabbit's foot, his role weakens in credibility. It's like choosing to engage in fighting a war, not knowing if the country really has weapons of mass destruction, that will be used to harm others. Almost every country has weapons of mass destruction, but are they threatening to use them to kill millions of people or any people for that matter? Once Ethan has possession of the bargaining chip, he realizes that even that does not matter. The last mission is clearly to save his wife, whatever the cost, even his own life. It's the one mission that he doesn't fail, the one he wasn't meant to fail. Who restores his lost breadth? His wife of course, pounding on his chest, for any last hope of a heart beat. Undoubtedly, he's got to be ready for that honeymoon. He proved to be an active agent and husband, but at what price? This script is incredibly weak on depicting reasons to evil intent, which truly detracts from Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character, to one of mere crazed bully, in need of great help, at being healthily and happily integrated, with the female species. In moments, Ethan's resentment towards Davian is equally vicious and crazed. Hoffman is such an excellent actor, but as is the case, his evilness is portrayed at a lesser value, debasing it to incomprehension, unfortunately. A simple point to remember is that, just as much as I want to know why someone is good, I also want to know why someone is evil  the root, lack of love.There are some great bells and whistles, that inspire the camera, raising our eyebrows in interest  an exotic Asian woman, in a sexy red evening gown, a bright orange Ferrari, that is set for wonderful detonation of self-disposal, and lest one not forget, the modern and vintage downtown landscapes of China. But frankly, for all the physical work Tom had to do, I would have polished him up, in something other than a priest's habit, at the Vatican. In the second half, I might, as well, have been watching War of the Worlds. It was all a little too 'Go Army,' for me. Yet, the close-up shot of him in the black and white suit, among the green landscape, following Lindsey's funeral was sweet. I had a piano, that photo could sit on top of it. Personally, a little more James Bond portrayal would have been sweeter. So, it's not Hallie Berry coming out of the ocean in a bikini, it's Tom Cruise, in some nice trunks, beaching it with his new wife, sipping on tropical drinks, with little umbrellas in them. Maybe another scene with Tom zipping through tight streets on a moped, rather than an x powered Harley. In this film, he is always in need of a truck, not a motorcycle. If I was him, I'd say put the honeymoon scene in first, and then I'll do the picture. Some men ought to have smarter women dealing for them. That's what I would have pushed. So, I am talking a little less explosive and a little more naturally refined. James Bond meets Ethan Hunt, viola! You have probably near the perfect hero! Every hero has to have some special vulnerability, related to female sensibilities and charms. Bond, as we know, probably has too many, maybe Hunt, too few?Movies are a chance to shape physical action to the script's story. For the painstaking, if not punishing stunts that Tom performed, both action and story were typical and unmemorable  missing charm, creativity, and most of all opportunity, to captivate an audience in the way that they could be, by more deeply portraying good vs. evil. Maybe the rabbit's foot was really nothing, but a story once told, nevertheless a reason for Davian to say that he must have it. And in the end, the elusive rabbit's foot, could have been quite possibly a story, a folk tale. One woman died a brutal death, and one walked away free, with strength and belief enough, to save the hero's life. And from that lesson and that result, good prevailed, and the love of mankind, and the sanctity of peace and care.",1,15,32,9 May 2006
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity - A Cave Man Does it Better - Got Geico Car Insurance?
","This contemporary CIA film was something like the French version of Pirates of the Caribbean. In the end, our protagonist, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) really only wants some high adrenaline, the girl, and some gold and silver.But before he hits the jackpot, we've got to rock out with this curious George. He really does monkey climb his way toward self-identity. Spiderman he is not, but he does hang from high places, reverse rock climb on the side of a building, though more like a tree frog than a monkey. That's o.k. It looked very scary. He's not really a frog. Trying to shake off amnesia from his enemy captors aboard a stormy ship off the coast of France, he makes land successfully. For a $20,000 payoff to a frustrated single girl named Marie, she quickly becomes his ally, his x for thrills and chills. Meanwhile, he retrieves a lock-box of his essentials, numerous passports, one by the name of Kane, that leads him to a luxurious Paris flat. From authorities, he learns that Kane is declared dead from a transportation accident. In the newspaper, Jason reads that he is an assassin. Marie and Jason return to the road, arriving at Eamon's quaint countryside home, along with his two small children. Who is Eamon? Marie's brother, lover, ex-husband? The superficial contrast between idyllic pastoral life and gun toting sniper chases only sours our identity for Bourne. His untimely home invasion, at Christmas, to Eamon's is simply an annoying artifice. He looks more bumbling than Bourne all through out this film. And that is being nice. I could say that he looks like one of the witch's evil monkeys from the Wizard of Oz. Is he an ant bully or just simply a pirate in search of his booty? CIA Director, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper) is like the Witch's chief monkey ready to pole dance at Bada Bing's. (Shrug) Maybe that is really the better gig Chris? At monkey command central, Conklin going ape over his astray monkey, Jason finally captures the bugger. Conklin's assistant, Nicky (Julia Stiles) has placed her drive thru order: one chicken patty, extra-make-up, pickle, onion, hold the lettuce and the tomato, fries and a carton of milk. And like Dr. Evil, Conklin (finger to chin) reminds Jason, that Jason is really a $30 million dollar super spy for the CIA, whose been making way too many mistakes. Bourne can't stand pressures from chief monkey Conklin, goes ape and breaks away, yet again a free monkey 'at last.' Still Bourne is chased, by what alliance, we're just not sure anymore. But we do know that Bourne is running for his life, not his death. Where in the wheel does he land this time? Another quaint scene, in a tropical café situated on a beautiful scenic blue-skied European coast, where Marie now conveniently resides. Uhh Ohh! Are you thinking what I am thinking? It's the Bourne pastoral tip-off! Is he going to tell Marie that she's run from danger, flee the café, jump off the cliff into the ocean, or instruct her to immediately head to the basement, if there is one? He's in her arms, but for how long? Who is Jason Bourne? A reverse rock climbing evil monkey? A thorn in some lion's side? Or is he a teddy bear dressed in a Nic Cage snakeskin bomber jacket, or a leprechaun smoking a cute little brown pipe? The more interesting question might be whose world is more entertaining  Wayne's World or Bourne's World? The film is directed by Doug Liman, but be forewarned  this film is closely aligned to how Jerry Bruckheimer does gay Paris.",1,8,19,31 January 2007
Collateral," Hero, Hit Man, or just your ordinary Joe making a living?
","What happens when a hero plays a hit man? Persuasion, but not belief, that Tom Cruise (Vincent) could possibly be born from the killer's mold, at least not in 'Collateral,' at least not from just departing from his huge previous role, as Nathan Allgren, in 'The Last Samurai.' If anything Tom remains the hero, even as the villain, since he executes his acting assignment, with his die hard passion and professionalism. Regardless of these two strengths, I am never believing Tom, as Vincent, to be so evil, as he is directed to be. Yet, undoubtedly Tom makes the most of this character, carrying the role as far as he possibly can, within the designed framework presented.With unfortunate holes and fragments in the script, Tom's jump from 'The Last Samurai,' to 'Collateral,' is too Olympic for me to believe him, as the completely uninhibited hit-man, Vincent. Yet, it still does not mean that this film does not possess solid attributes. What I did experience in this film was a sense of commitment from every actor to carry out his role, with duty, unity, and a seasoned maturity.In the film, Tom plays a somewhat sallow and gaunt faced L.A. hit man, whose job it is to kill off a prosecutor's list of crooked witnesses, involved in the illegal drug dealing business. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Annie, the smart and probably I imagine typically overworked prosecutor. She is the first person to ride in Max's (Jamie Foxx) taxi. She and Max exchange typical life conversation. At the end of the ride, he gives her his treasured island post card, and she, in turn, gives him her business card, with a gesture of gratitude. Meanwhile, in just a moment, Vincent steps from inside of the airport, to any cab outside along the curb. He randomly chooses Max's cab. Likewise, Max and Vincent make small talk. At this moment, the actors are in full swing with their roles. The conversation sounds so unscripted, that I am wondering at times if it is, at times. Vincent tells Max that he is having to make several stops, collecting signatures for some sort of real estate transactions. I thought it humorous that Vincent, Anne, and Max knew every inch to streets and directions around L.A., that it became an exaggerated after thought of mine.  From this point forward, Vincent forces Max to be his assistant, in executing the completely emotionless killings, like simply pulling weeds from the lawn. They make various shooting stops, including a Jazz bar and a Japanese style dance club. Mark Ruffalo, as the ever skeptical Detective Fanning, is assigned to solving the string of murders and soon has to work with alleged Federal Agent, Pedrosa (Bruce McGill) and crew. This scene moves so fast that I am not completely sure if Pedros is really working for the FBI or really for Felix, Vincent's client. When Max has to confront Vincent's client, the story begins to unravel for two reasons. First, the script begins to reveal too many unwanted holes. For example, we gain little knowledge into understanding Vincent's client Felix (Javier Barden) and the hit list of witnesses. Obviously, too many details may detract from the larger story, but too few details falls short of supporting a credible story line and cast of characters. Also, too many supporting cast members are just immediately tossed into scenes without more consideration to feature film length form of development. In a completely developed script, the viewer should not have to be needing more plot information to identify with the chain of events set before them. Secondly, a solid fast paced film will always reiterate some key plot facts to its audience, knowing that they may miss a piece of elemental information, among all of the action and activity. This concept particularly applies to murder, mystery, and action films.Mark Ruffalo plays with all of his eerie and far at sea-like sensibility, but like many in the film, at moments, I feel an underlying sense of the actors' conflict between wanting to deliver their lines and having to deliver them. I, myself, on many occasions have been pinned down to take jobs, with logical reluctance. But, at this point, I know it to be just a fact of living life. Regardless of how everyone 'gets the job,' everyone involved acts with total commitment to performing. The script is not what makes all of these humans hero's, rather it is their adapt willingness to play out the roles, as directed.Out of all the scenes, the duality unfolding in the Japanese style club was most unique. In my college and early post college days, I walked through that scene more than I like to have to admit. I wonder if Tom was thinking and feeling what I once was, in the days trying to convince myself, that I could actually socialize, in smoky bars and new wave/age dance halls/clubs, like the majority of the people. Every place was so crowded and loud, as my eyes were only searching for some imaginary someone, to share my quietness, peace, and space. Repeatedly, I was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and so was Vincent. Yet, when Tom pulls out his back on the floor gun maneuver, I responded like a teenage boy, thinking to myself, cool, wow, only in the movies, and his rock solid actions instantaneously shift the mood. I have to remind myself that he is the villain, in this role, but also an actor who truly has command, reflex, and skill to completely shift the scales of extreme, in this scene Whether or not you like this script and story line, you will not be disappointed in the depth, commitment, and common unity each actor willingly offers to portraying his role.",Null,0,0,8 August 2004
Meet the Fockers," Meet The Fockers - Feels retro...Feels fun!
","Meet the Fockers is a continuing saga of Meet the Parents. In this film, Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) parents, Dina and Jack, (Blythe Danner and Robert Di Niro) meet Greg/Gaylord Focker's (Ben Stiller) parents, Roz and Bernie (Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman). Greg, Pam, and Dina all road trip in Jack's custom RV, which looks more like a music band touring bus or 'liberty coach' bus, accompanied by hidden CIA spy gadgetry. Roz and Bernie live in an eclectic tropical themed Miami home. Roz is a senior sex therapist, and Bernie is a retired trial attorney, who has found his touchy feely side, probably through his wife's advocacy of verbally and physically, expressing the emotional self. Barbra plays the role super. I feel like if she was asking me the intimate questions, like Dina, I actually wouldn't have any problem giving her answers, since her nature presents itself easy and helpful. Any over analysis would make me laugh in a good session of comic relief.When the families meet, it is sort of like the Flintstones  Wilma and Fred (Fockers) meet the Bunkers  Edith and Archie (Byrnes). As for Bernie, he is so out in left field that I can't quite pass shock before finding laughter. But really, I still find laughter. The last movie I saw him in was Confidence, so it could have slowed my creative leap reflexes. Dina is the usual attention starved wife, from her husband Jack, who now appears to have an obsessive/compulsive fetish, with caring for their grandchild, little Jack. I wish Dina had a stronger role, possibly showing how she can rise above pouting over her husband's lack of obvious intimacy, and finding something that she likes, that will in turn, somehow have him take a better notice to his failings, in intimately recognizing her, sort of in that Vanessa and Austin Powers type of mode. Greg is portrayed as too much of the underdog, by Jack's regimented routine and his mother's free sex style questioning. Further, he thinks that he might be the father, to the exotic Hispanic cook, Isabel's (Alana Ubach) son. Even his Dad's homemade Greg wall shrine completely embarrasses Greg. Poor Greg. (sounds good in Marsha tone.) We look at him having the most fun when he is injected with sodium penathol, by Jack, since for most of the movie, he is suffering from family idiosyncrasy overload. Poor Greg (in regular concerned tone.) Much of the comedy attempts to center jokes around little grandchild Jack, which seems to be an odd emphasis, and misdirection. Maybe it reflects the situation when parents or grandparents do not have much going on in their own lives, so a child becomes a center to their world, which is an obvious intended comic hook, to the film. But, the idea does not play out all too funny.The feeling of actor improvisation gives the film that more carefree and unscripted vibe, but nevertheless, the script in its entirety, never truly reaches full funny bone status, though good intentions are evidently prevalent. (How intellectually nerdy was that synopsis.) I enjoy all of these actors so much, and even more, for the fact that some having played serious roles, gladly warmed themselves up to moving, yet again, into the comedy role. The film may not have offered complete jelly-belly laughing humor to its audience, but it may have well offered 'senior' sex tips to those in the frozen or frustration zone, thanks in part to the lead instructor, Roz! It's never too soon to start thinking about signing up for co-educational couples yoga.",7,1,10,23 December 2004
Wimbledon," Wimbledon, or Your Local Park ? - The Latter Ain't Too Bad
","Weak Links/Strong Links  Dennis Bradbury (Sam Neil) is not only a weak father, but profiling him, he is just one big pain in the *ss and it's too tedious to see him play it out on screen; he brings the whole film down; what father like that is even credible?  Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) Wimbledon tennis competitor blames her new tennis love Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) for her losing her recent match because he persuaded her to have sex with him the night before. Ehhh  wrong answer Lizzie. Why would you agree to that crummy character trait Kirsten? Lizzie's little tantrum is void by common law; it takes two to tango. She's at least 50% to blame. She didn't complain about his love making. Plus, it was very romantic and Shakespearean of Peter to climb up to her bedroom window, just to be close to her.  Peter never tells Lizzie that he is risking seeing her, against her father's wishes. He should let her know of his pursuits regardless. She needs to know his tenacious heroism.  Peter/Paul  what's up with your goofy tennis playing? Wimbledon or the local park? It's doesn't do justice to Wimbledon or this story-line. That two handed back hand was too much  silliness. Do actors ever review, edit, or proof-view their films? Would you really o.k. that? Anywhoserville, you starred in this film. That says something about something. Finally  Strong Links  Peter's apology scene was almost surreal sweet. It was strangely romantic.  This story and cinematography meant well, despite surrounding underutilized or underdeveloped characters  Peter may not have been a pro, but he had a nice sense of consistent focus and energy, both in tennis and courtship. Very nice, smooth, reasonable, controlled but still very natural, playful (in courtship)  more is even better. Way to go.  Peter really wanted to court Lizzie in a romantic sweetheart traditional sense that all to easily gets lost, neglected, ignored or forgotten in today's dating world. But in this film all of these good intentions were established, particularly by Peter. Kudos to you Mr. Bettany. Despite a not even fair script, your acting still captivated our attention. It is one of your consistent attributes in acting, which I have seen. Thank you.  Kirsten? I think that you do really well with Toby McGuire. I would stick with what works woman. It wasn't the most complimentary role for you, but mean old Sam/Dennis certainly didn't help your character any. Don't we all have some mean old Sam/Dennis in our lives. I know. It's the pits.",6,0,2,5 February 2007
Blood Diamond," Blood Diamond - media tip-off -Under a goat's skin it is bloody diamonds (plural)
","Blood Diamond  One Star Time: 1999 Place: Sierra Leone, West Africa Politics: grave civil war and racketeering, including the diamond harvest for the purchase of machine guns to support the civil war. Stars: Leonardo DiCaprio, as Danny Archer, Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy and Jennifer Connelly, as Maddy Bowen Premise: far out, far fetched as in tunnel vision, not strong enough to vigorously and seriously capture any sane person's attention. Solomon, while sifting for diamonds, discovers a rare pink one, and anxiously wraps it in a torn piece of rag, burying it in the earth. Of course, he plans to reclaim it. What makes it so valuable in his eyes? In England, an awaiting jeweler will buy it for a great sum. He and his family will be free, financially and socially. The most thought provoking question arises. What do we place value on and why? For Solomon and Danny Archer, the West African mercenary, riches and dreams bypass the ordinary for extraordinary by means of this pink diamond. Pursuing its capture and trade for money, each believe that there is everything to gain and possibly everything to loose, including their very own lives.In Robinson Crusoe fashion, this premise plays out. Archer, with determined action pursues the buy out of the mentally scarring and physically taxing practices of diamond racketeering. Solomon, in grave desperation to flee the mass sick persecution, causing great harm to him and his family equates this diamond, just as brilliantly as Archer, a life changing course of passage, to first and foremost, safer land. He and his family are not fighters, maybe naive dreamers, but certainly not people of malice. Tragically, his wife is corralled with others, as prisoner. His young boy, who expressed dreams of being a doctor, is under the spell of the lead guerrilla, a ruthless man, training the boy to kill with a machine gun. Fairly early in the film, Jennifer Connelly's character is approached by Archer. What single man isn't looking to strike up a conversation with a pretty and striking lady, in a place where only relentless pain and toil persist. She quickly says her name. Mage, Meg, Marge, Maddy? She's an American photo journalist who is set to reveal to Europe, America, if not all of the world, the cruel ways in which diamond traders and buyers work. It's a disgrace, but so is her and her character, residing in such a country portraying this war. To the very end of her West African assignment, she persists to interview West African soldiers, like a high school student collecting trivia and data for the school's weekly paper. All I can think is that Harper's Bazaar is calling you. You are completely in the wrong gig. Don't worry Jennifer. We've all found ourselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. But you volunteered and I wondered why, because you looked so absolutely stupid through out the whole film, and painfully stupid at that. How could this premise give credence to your acting?My advice  give up on playing yourself as the liberating feminist, as it not only makes feminists look stupid, but translates to simply female idiocy. In your character's end, it comes across a little too Kathy Bates, from 'Misery'  'Mr. Man.' But again, who am I to say? You were only acting  right? Harpers Bazaar  think about it? It just might tell a closer truth, or at the very least, a better fiction! Question for Leonardo? How would Danny ever literally store a diamond under his tooth and why? That was silly. Also, Leonardo, your goose chase was almost as ridiculous as Jennifer's, with the exception that you are a man, playing in a man's world, an oft times foolish one at that. If you wanted to show such physical prowess to your public or yourself, why didn't you talk to me first? Certainly, if you didn't like what I have already written, I could have designed something more tantalizing and less taxing. Even though your character was Crusoe precarious, you tempted me by all of your earthly wiles and sacrifices. Means by which you through this character dreamily wanted to save your soul, was infinite, not finite. That was impressive, even though the story was not. There was no compromise for you, tragic hero!If Jennifer can have a Harper's Bazaar spread, why can't you have something that reflects Nemo found, something altruistic, like a bow flex, a lovely, cling to lady, and a resort of your choice for three months? Djimon, do you have an education? It's always continuing anyway. What about a scholarship to an American University? You cleaned up well at the end. It's certainly, not automatic riches, but it's knowledge and understanding, less ignorance and laziness. A son of yours really could become a doctor after all, or a jazz musician. Not bad. As the Chinese say, Happy Christmas!",1,9,55,12 December 2006
National Treasure," National Treasure - many of song has sung - themes on finding home.
","Some spoiler material. National Treasure is really a socially driven film, documenting Nic Cage's quest as Ben Franklin Gates, to reclaim the family name and declare independence, by tracking down the legacy of long lost treasure, associated with his family heritage, and with some of the proceeds, buys an estate of his own, in the company of a most lovely lady, Abigail Chase, (Diane Kruger). This film is really about Nic and not Ben, but I am o.k. with that, as long as I accept it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. The title National Treasure peaked my interest, since I wanted to know what Disney's interpretation as to what the National Treasure actually was. I was telling my pretend children that National Treasure is not gold or material possessions, but that National Treasure is your spirit and the love in your heart. I told them that each and every one of us make up the total of National Treasure. Nevertheless, I still wanted to see the movie, so on a Monday morning, after numerous transfers and holds, with Microsoft's Technical Support helpline, I was hoping that National Treasure would be just as productive as an afternoon, at a slow moving, but informative teacher/business seminar. Seminars are great for those people on the payroll who can spend the time with it. Likewise, I recommend this movie to only people who can and want to spend the time.The film begins in Washington D.C., in 1974, with John Adam Gates(Christopher Plummer), as Ben's grandfather, telling little Ben (Hunter Gomez) about the family legacy, of hidden treasure that was smuggled from Europe to America. It was sacred to the Masons and Knights Templar. When you see the size of the alleged treasures, you think, who could have possibly stored them, where they were, without anyone getting word of it. That part is funny. But if we can continue on with the legend, a key element was that the treasure had to be protected from British invaders. But then I am thinking. Why just the British? Don't segment a possible threat. Protect the treasure from any and all possible dangers, one's that might be worse than just a British invasion.Jerry Bruckheimer, as most known producer, can start checking off his list, 'created enough action, suspense, near death experience, including explosions, with A-list star, Nic Cage. High class, black tie social event  done. Retail shopping experience, with woman  completed.' All of Nic's action stuff, moves at a snappy, groovin' and cycloptic pace, with his goal of not only wanting to be the hero, but the realization that he is the hero, as he moves with stealth, to capture the physical treasure, to compliment, that which already resides in his heart. Ben's assistant Riley, (Justin Bartha) is an intellectual easy go with the flow admirer, to the action hero. Together, they approach Abigail Chase, a pretty, hold her own, seeming unattended to, maybe even a little dusty, Washington D.C. archivist.Ben introduces himself to Abigail, as Paul Brown. He tells her that there is an invisible treasure map, on the back of the Declaration of Independence. She is in disbelief and he walks away deciding that he must steal the map, with Riley's help, in order to find the buried treasure, reclaiming the Gates family name and satisfying his curious needs.Of course, one of Ben's partners, Ian Howe (Sean Bean) turns 'bad guy'on him, fighting to claim the treasure for himself. So the chase plays out between good guys, bad guys, and the damsel in distress, Abigail, who is tossed in the mix, for good measure and of course, romance. ' Check  romance completed, including, unexpected hero/heroine kiss.'John Voight, as Patrick Gates, Ben's Dad, plays the treasure hunter retiree very well. As a widower, we only wish that he had a lady friend, as to not make him look so dour. Harvey Keital, (Sadusky) equally, does a nice job playing out the cop role, reminding Ben, a little too often that 'Someone has got to go to jail for stealing the Declaration of Independence.' Certainly not Ben/Nic, but Sadusky needles him, nevertheless.I am actually disappointed that there actually is a tomb, 'Beneath Parksville Lane,' in Boston, what looks to be a collection of international proportion, of historical treasures from Rome to Egypt. It looks like Disney's old prop and stage storage closet. From the audience's view, it all appears a little too fake, corn ball, and odd ball. I was hoping for a more symbolic treasure, like that of Dan Brown's in, The Da Vinci Code. Maybe Ben, named himself Brown, after Dan, pretending to be his brother. I do not have the answers. I just like to make-up stuff. With some of the proceeds from the treasure sale, Ben buys his country estate for Abigail and him, and Riley, with the prospect of more action work in front of him, settles on the red sports car, what looks to be something like a Dodge viper. I think some of the bruised British egos would have laughed if the film shot Ben's and Abigail's country estate wedding. Then, the movie really would have come full circle and Jerry could have checked off his list, 'touch of British charm and modesty  completed.'The clues for the treasure hunt are well established, like those I recall from my childhood Birthdays, and in the end, Ben, Riley, and Abigail are awarded prizes. Yeah! That is nice. Maybe the film should have been called Ben Gate's Birthday Party  everyone's invited, even the mean kids. As you can see, I have mixed emotions on the male driven process, to which Nic feels he has to or wants to act out, in order to achieve the underlying theme of love, peace, and capturing the girl's heart, or being captured in the heart, by the girl. Really, Disney could have saved loads of money by making a deal with HG t.v.  Hollywood Stars Go House Hunting. Nic could be the guest star and the show could insert clips of Valley Girl, probably my all-time favorite teen movie, (even then, I was more like the guy, punk guy that is, rather than the cream lacy bloused girl, who had totally cool parents, and was adored by the boys, including the lead star. I had the short hair cut, style, and family gone wrong. I guess that is why I identified with his awkwardness and out of place, as so charming.) and a few other retro-feel Cage films, to personalize the segment. The Star House Hunting program would be a less timely and a more accessible form of programming, for those people who do not have the time to do the seminar format, like myself. At the film's conclusion, I was sentimentally sad, since Jerry seemed to be like an overworked Jewish man, turned Santa, checking off all the tasks to accomplish on his list. I guess that was the only way to ensure all presents were sent and received. Cormac and and Marianne Wibberley were like Santa's elves, assembling just the right Christmas gifts. Yeah! Maybe Jerry, crew and cast should read John Grisham's Skipping Christmas book. I have not read it, but I am sure that it must hold some relevancy to the feeling of Christmas burn-out. In my mind, I make up my own imaginary ending, with Jerry and cast, in front of the estate, waving and saying, 'Merry Christmas to All, and to all a good night,' with winks and sparkles in their eyes.",Null,0,0,23 November 2004
The Da Vinci Code," A most intriguing fiction speculating popular belief! Bold and Excellent Investigation!
","Most movie viewers probably read the book before seeing this movie. Hence, suspense and mystery are naturally lessoned. The book reads more thrilling than watching the film. In the film, the controversy of good vs. evil is dull, flat, and formulaic. The test: would it appear less so, had one not read the book? Answer: Not really, just more confusing, as the treasure hunt for the Holy Grail, resting place to Mary Magdalene is too rapidly paced. Whether you read the book or not, the script is too mechanical and superficial, and the character's personalities are too simple, boring, and inanimate, of course with the exception of Silas (Paul Bettany). Nevertheless, even his character is somewhat superficial. We know his psyche acts out with self-inflicting pain. How does he arrive at such state? We want to know. In the book, it says that he shot and killed his father, a drunk. If we saw a Silas flashback to his tormented childhood, we might be more fully engaged in comprehending his self-infliction. We might even internalize his pain more. All of the characters are designed too distant from our sensibilities. As a result, our attention wanes more than it should. This movie is just as much work for us, as it is for the actors, therefore, I would give it seven stars, but due to such interesting historical inquiry, I give the film eight stars. It deserved ten plus. As for author Dan Brown's happiness, in no way is it to be associated with the stars that I assign the film. As an author, he knows what I am talking about. You might say, that it is the 'writer's code.' Where was the entertainment value that could have strengthened our interest not detracted from it? It was missing. This film is not a documentary but plays itself so, on the book's behalf. It had entertainment potential by bringing greater human expression, interaction, and animation to the screen, but its greatest mistake, ironically is too closely following the black and white of the book. These characters could be more lively, interesting, and emotionally layered, without sacrificing the fiction's storyline. As a reinforcement, poetic license could be more generously utilized. By evidence, it is under utilized, downgrading our mental engagement and enthusiasm, for such a potentially interesting, intellectual, and mystical ancient story of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and the Holy Grail. Such intriguing inquiry is only threatening to selfish, greedy, and unadaptable religious 'experts.' If the autobiography of Jesus was available, it would probably be the world's number one seller of all time.Again, Paul Bettany plays his role under the skin of the character. Everything about him is creepy, from scars to buns of steel. For his next role, instead of 'Shallow Hal,' he should play a fat boy, in 'Shallow Sally.' Between Paul and his infamous, Academy Award winner wife, Jennifer, have they sacrificed mainstream intelligence for redundant extremist role play, possibly settling for assignment, rather than soul searching for one? Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Alfred Molina, Ion McKellen and a host of others are o.k, but not challenged enough in the film's dry and flat adaptation. As for location cinematography, it is excellent, but lacks dimensional light and varied wardrobe by actors. It is a little too sleepy-eyed X-files, another reminder that I can't retire to the empty heaven of sweats. The film has enough shortcomings, but undeniably does not fall short of clearly laying out the book's story, clue by clue, scene by scene.",8,3,8,23 May 2006
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds - People toying with humanity and nature.
","War of the Worlds is a science fiction film much more comprehensible than the poorly depicted book by H.G. Wells, upon which the film is based. Mechanical, laser cutting, liquid spewing, long tentacle armed aliens prey upon unsuspecting people of the east coast, including New York, New Jersey and Boston. It appears they suck human blood only to spill it out, making things of nature, like vines on trees, grow at an insurmountable rate, all in red blood.The movie begins with Ray Ferrier's (Tom Cruise) taking care of his two children Robbie ( Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning), while their pregnant mother, Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) and her second husband, Tim are making a trip to visit parents, I believe. Tom's role as lower-middle income father, is quite possibly more credibly evil, than his last summer's character, Vincent, in 'Collateral.' He is careless with petite, but strong, Rachel and flat out rude to teen son, Robbie. With Rachel, he neglects to help her out of the van or to thoughtfully watch over her at home, even telling her to order take out for dinner, from his, what looks to be battered lazy boy chair. And with Robbie, he simply throws the baseball, a little too hard in play, possibly thinking that he can toughen up or make his son 'a man,' on one pitch. But regardless of his poor fathering skills, ultimately he hawks over his children, at the onslaught of an alien invasion and will stop at nothing to protect them.Even with the east coast under alien siege, the film manages to clearly and methodically focus upon one family's struggle to escape the quite seriously deadly attacks. But one cannot deny that there are just a few unanswered questions that distract us from events feeling authentic, such as why does not the news media arrive at any scene much sooner, if only for a moment, until with more precise accumulated actualized drama, we see for ourselves that the power is lost? Or why doesn't Ray turn on the TV., at his ex-wive's house, to find out what is transpiring around him? Why does his vehicle work, but no one else's does? Is it because he has an older model van, without an electronic key lock? Certainly, he couldn't be the only citizen driving an older manual door lock vehicle? A CBS news woman finally presents herself in the film, but it is too little and too late to capture our minds, as any real experience. But beyond some obvious questions, without logical answers, we are still intrigued by a never seen before alien invasion upon the community, and specifically the stars of the film, the Ferriers. Dakota Fanning doesn't just get a gold medal, but something more like a diamond ring, for having to act out every heart-racing scene, for which she is a part. Robbie, something like her would be alter ego, on the other hand, is just taking the invasion as it comes, stepping out of the circle of reaction, just to be in the midst. The special effects and the action scenes are really incredible. When the ferry turns over, and the family falls first into the water, followed by a car spilling fast right into them, we can't imagine this family surviving, but they do. For them, scenes such as this one, must be like Fear Factor, to the nth degree.In one part, Ray and Rachel, Robbie now left for dead, take shelter in the basement of a man's home. Olgilvy (Tim Robbins) is dueling with his psyche, wanting not to be hurt by the aliens, but at the same time, wanting to madly make a show and fight them, above ground. It is his carrying on delusional state, which puts them all in jeopardy. Ray, analytically minded must silence him, in order to protect, first and foremost, as he states, his daughter. When Olgilvy finally strikes Ray with a shovel, he puts an end to this impending sadly dangerous threat. From dumpy dad to something of his own healthy heroism, he turns. Ray blindfolds his daughter and behind closed doors, we can only imagine, but do not know for sure, that he has terminated Olgilvy's life. Now it is quiet, a place that will not attract the carnivorous and human flesh eating aliens. Steven Spielberg, it appears, uses his strength to let the actors really infuse their own spirit and authenticity into each role, which gives breathing room to creativity. Although sometimes we feel that the actors are struggling too much in their own lives, and instead we're watching them, rather than the characters that they are portraying, which detracts a little from that of becoming and playing another character.It is not without the help of ground force army troops that civilization has a chance to survive. Do aliens take over the east coast, or does humanity prevail? Watch the film and discover for yourself, how justice is served, in a mind bending metaphor.",8,1,8,5 July 2005
