The King's Speech," A real Royal performance - 91%
","You can always tell when we are in the middle of awards season as most films at the cinema will either be excessively worthy efforts to appeal to Academy members or dross destined to failure. There's not an explosion to be seen anywhere and few films will be considered to be 'blockbusters'. Amid the likes of 'Black Swan', 'Hereafter' and 'True Grit', I couldn't quite believe that a film about a prince with a stutter could really hold its own but thankfully, I have been proved wrong. And while I fully understand the plaudits being heaped upon the lead actor, it is grossly unfair to forget the efforts of everyone connected with one of the best films of the last 12 months.It is the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Exhibition in 1925 and Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth) is to deliver his first speech via radio to all corners of the British Empire. But a terrible truth emerges - he is unable to deliver his speech due to a horrendous stutter. Retreating into the shadows in shame, Bertie is happy to let attention fall on his elder brother David (Guy Pearce), especially when he becomes King Edward VIII. But when his brother abdicates in favour of marrying the divorcée Wallis Simpson, the crown falls to Bertie who must overcome his speech difficulties as the country is in urgent need of leadership in the face of the growing menace of Nazi Germany. In desperation, Bertie's wife Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham-Carter) turns to a Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), whose unconventional methods ruffle a few establishment feathers along the way.In the same way that 'Monster's Ball' belonged to Halle Berry, 'The King's Speech' belongs to Colin Firth. For years in the UK, he remained most famous for playing Mr Darcy in the BBC's adaptation of 'Pride And Prejudice' in the mid 90's - but no longer. He is simply magnificent in this film, leading a class of real acting talent at all levels from the leads down. Every facial movement, every jagged line of dialogue is just faultless and I honestly cannot recall a better performance from any actor in any movie I've seen for a long time. Supported by fantastic turns by Bonham-Carter, Rush, Derek Jacobi, Jennifer Ehle and Timothy Spall (frankly amazing as Winston Churchill), this feels like a quality product. And the tale of the tortured prince struggled with his internal demons and external pressures grips from the get-go - my bag of sweets and bottle of drink remained untouched through the whole movie, which is pretty much unheard of. Something else I have rarely seen in a cinema was the audience applauding during the end credits and in a time of financial crisis like this, our theatre was packed for this movie.A few minor historical inaccuracies aside, there is very little to criticise 'The King's Speech' for. Every scene is beautifully played, every shot is directed with confidence by the fairly inexperienced Tom Hooper. Being British, I find myself drawn to the underdog in any situation but one thinks of the triumph experienced by 'The Hurt Locker' at the Oscars last year. I genuinely feel that while Firth should be a shoo-in for Best Actor, this film should pick up many more in other categories but time will tell. This film deserves to be recognised as it's heartbreaking, humorous and hugely entertaining - and serves as a powerful reminder of the legacy of the now discontinued UK Film Council.",9,0,2,6 February 2011
The Mask," Nothing like the comics but a huge blast of zany fun - 81%
","I actually watched this about two weeks ago but have been busy honeymooning and other wonderful things. In fact, I actually remember this movie vividly because it was the first movie I got on VHS for Christmas many years ago. I remember it for its groundbreaking CG work, inventive and original story, the jaw-dropping debut scenes of Cameron Diaz and the zany face-pulling brilliance of a young Jim Carrey. And ignoring the frankly diabolical sequel, I find it strange that no-one else was able to produce a decent follow-up because this still makes me laugh more than 15 years later. It may little to do with the much darker source material and anyone who doesn't like Carrey in Robin Williams-tribute-mode should run for the hills but this viewer rates 'The Mask' as a real class act.In case this somehow passed you by, the film introduces us to everyday loser Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) who works in a bank in rundown Edge City with his self-styled Lothario friend Charlie (Richard Jeni) and lives alone with his dog Milo and a vast collection of cartoons. But when Stanley discovers a mysterious wooden mask, he finds himself transformed into the larger-than-life ladies man he wished he could be. With a seemingly limitless supply of powers, The Mask begins tearing Edge City up but not without incurring the wrath of local hoodlum Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) and the sour-faced Lt. Kellaway (Peter Riegert).The only things ruining 'The Mask' for me is the feeling that if the movie hadn't strayed this far from the original comics and retained the edgy darkness thereof, we would still have a decent movie worth watching. Having said that, you would be a complete clot to ignore this film altogether because this is still a brilliantly entertaining family film, filled with enough humour for children and adults alike. Made when CG was still in its infancy, it's incredible to realise how well the technology has been utilised. From cartoon-headed dogs to mischievous alarm clocks, this is a film with a great deal of thought behind it. But the old school hasn't been forgotten either - Max, the dog that plays Milo, is actually the best of the lot and his performance is the funniest by far! Certainly, he's funnier than Carrey whose wide-eyed mania begins to grate after a while. The other performers do well maintaining a straight face throughout the mayhem, Diaz probably leading the pack as Dorian's reluctant moll.But this is Carrey's film and whether you'll enjoy 'The Mask' depends largely on whether you enjoy Carrey in whirlwind mode. Personally, I prefer Carrey to the likes of Robin Williams or Jack Black and he certainly does a better job than *spits* Alan Cumming did in the retched sequel. What's surprising about 'The Mask' is that despite the emerging talent on show and the then-not-quite-perfect science of CGI, this is still a hugely watchable film that most viewers will enjoy. I'm not sure why IMDb's rating (6.6 at the time of writing) seems so low, maybe there are more fans of the comic out there than I anticipated and I imagine they were disappointed with this. But never having read the comics, I find this a wonderfully quirky family film alternative despite the occasionally edgy humour. Sssssmokin'!",8,1,1,17 August 2009
Mission: Impossible III," Bond and Bourne have nothing much to worry about - 67%
","As Jason Bourne and James Bond fight it out for the prize for 'Best Spy Franchise', one almost feels sorry for poor old Ethan Hunt. I dare say that third place is an unusual position for sofa-jumping superstar Tom Cruise to be in, no doubt accustomed to the success he has had throughout his career. But I've felt that since the first film came out way back in 1996, the 'Mission: Impossible' series has had a nasty habit of letting people down. The first was pretentious and confusing while the bullet-laden second film was pretentious and shallow, albeit more enjoyable. So what we have this time is a happy mixture of the two, offering plenty of high-tech gadgetry and explosive action alongside a typically tense tale of spy-versus-spy.Cruise is, as you might expect, the super-spy Ethan Hunt once again and now on the verge of settling down with his new fiancé Julia (Michelle Monaghan) who has no idea what her husband-to-be does for a living. Informed by the IMF of the kidnap of a protégé of Ethan's (Keri Russell) in Berlin, Ethan is lured out of semi-retirement in order to bring her back. But things take a turn for the worse when the disappearance is linked to a vicious arms dealer called Owen Davian (a brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman) and treacherous IMF agents searching for something code-named the Rabbit's Foot. Forced into action, Ethan must prevent the Rabbit's Foot falling into the wrong hands before his old life threatens his new one.First off, let me emphasise how good Hoffman is. He is just wonderful, a perfectly sadistic foil to Cruise's clean-cut goody-two-shoes secret agent. Something else that is also impressive is the direction the franchise has been taken in by J.J. Abrams, the third director to try his luck with the series. Given his experience with TV shows like 'Alias' (which this closely mirrors), it's not surprising that Abrams knew what to do with the source material and he has crafted a highly enjoyable action spy blast with the right amount of brains behind it to engage all but the dumbest of viewers. It might have a bit too many explosions and gun fights for fans of the old TV show but this actually *feels* a lot more like 'Mission: Impossible' than the slow-mo nonsense of part two. So far, so good. Right? Well, not quite. You see, there is a sense of having seen it all before. When Hunt sneaks his way into the Vatican using the old quick-descending rope trick we've all seen in the first two films (and uses it fairly early on as well), you can feel yourself stifling a yawn. New director, different background cast, same old film as before. And to be honest, the other agents didn't really feel part of the story besides Ving Rhames and he's earned at least a few decent lines over the series. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the pretty (wooden) Maggie Q and an allegedly comedic cameo from Simon Pegg don't really serve any function though Russell and Monaghan are actually quite good. Cruise can play the part in his sleep now and at times, I think he might have been having a quick nap on screen instead of making us cheer for the good guys. Worse, the film veers horribly towards 'Transporter'-levels of logic in the action nearer the end and aside from the opening and closing credits, I can't recall hearing the famous theme music once in between. In a weird way, I actually prefer watching the second film to this one because although it's more of an all-out action film instead of a twisting spy flick like 'Mission: Impossible 3', it's just more fun.",6,1,3,19 October 2007
The Sound of Music," Probably the last of the great Hollywood musicals - 87%
","If you're reading my reviews in chronological order then you'll probably laugh at the contrast between this and the last movie I talked about! But sometimes, you have to let the Better Half dictate the viewing and so it was here. Given that it is a widely adored piece of cinema and that it is a musical (which is one of my least favourite genres) then there is a good chance that my views won't sit too well with some of you. But bear in mind that I went into this trying to ignore my prejudices and forgetting that it is almost fifty years old.Salzberg in Austria in the dying days of the 1930s. Rebellious trainee nun Maria (Julie Andrews) has stepped on the toes of the Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) one too many times and she finds herself shipped off to be the governess of one Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children (Charmian Carr, Heather Menzies, Nicholas Hammond, Duane Chase, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner and Kym Karath). At first, she struggles to fit in to the fabric of the family which is strict and joyless but Maria's zest of life, love and song soon melts the heart of the Von Trapps as the gathering storm of the Nazi threat swirls at the fringes of the story.Camp and colourful it may be but only the most stone-heartened of viewers would argue that 'The Sound of Music' is all gloss and no substance. The story, while clearly nonsense, is a winner and performed with enthusiasm and gusto from the cast. Andrews is a revelation, being both a glorious singer as well as an emotive actress. Plummer is equal to the task and the scenes between them are simply magical, full of chemistry that you rarely see on screen these days. The soundtrack is also a winner - each song is memorable and even if you've seen it before (as my Better Half has), you'll be helpless to join in with them. But it is also surprisingly evocative. Even I struggled to suppress the lump in my throat at times and as the Nazi element grows, the film takes a dark twist towards a genuinely tense finale. The other thing I loved was the cinematography - it is a wonderfully pretty picture with sweeping panoramas of the Alps and the lakes between them.Assuming that this hasn't passed you by completely then the chances are that you would have had some exposure to 'The Sound of Music', whether you record it at Christmas or go to the Singalong showing dressed as a nun. To be honest, I struggled to keep my cynical comments to myself when I watched it as it is impossible to take it seriously. But even I, who was ready to hate this, can't deny that this is a wonderful feel-good movie that allows you to let your hair down and just enjoy yourself. It won't be to everyones tastes and I personally would have liked more songs rather than the same six or seven repeated over the course of the film. But those that are there are like the rest of the film, joyous and youthful and completely deserving of your attention.",8,1,7,25 October 2011
The Longest Yard," Cornier than a veggie burger but still fun - 68%
","My Better Half has been raving about this film for some time and so it was that I ended up spending damn near the rest of my store credit getting this on DVD. I'd be lying if I said that I was enthusiastic as movies and American football tend to go together about as well as Naomi Campbell and Spanish housekeepers. But despite a blip with one film which I still don't like, her recommendations have usually hit the right spot so I wasn't too bothered. And believe it or not, she's done it again! Perhaps she should get into the movie reviewing business, even if her typing needs improvement! Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a former NFL star who has fallen on hard times. Kicked out of the league for throwing a game and busted for drink driving (on national TV), he finds himself in a Texan dustbowl prison under the supervision of a football-mad warden (James Cromwell) who quickly conjures up a plan. He needs to get his team of sadistic guards up to speed and quickly so he arranges a game between the guards and the inmates, believing it to be little more than a one-sided massacre. But Crewe gradually assembles a worthy opposition of convicts with the help of fellow cons Caretaker (Chris Rock) and Coach Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) and realising that they could have a game on their hands, both teams resort to every trick in the book (as well as some new ones) in order to win. Cameo fans will be in seventh Heaven with at least three wrestlers, Nelly, Michael Irvin and Courtney Cox all in there somewhere.First of all, this is a sports movie and therefore, it is as hackneyed and ridden with clichés as they come. Performances are varied, as you'd expect from such a rag-bag cast of actors, rappers and wrestlers but nobody tops Burt 'The Ham' Reynolds for the worst performance. The good news, however, is that despite some dodgy delivery and an unashamedly predictable script, the film still works despite all the odds stacked against it. The comic touches hit all the right marks (even if some of the gags are somewhat crude) and the rivalry between guards and prisoners descends into an entertaining all-out war. But although this is basically the same as 'The Mean Machine', you still leave the movie with that uplifting feeling that most sports movies strive for but rarely attain.So can I recommend 'The Longest Yard'? Yes, I feel I can. By it's very nature, it isn't going to change the world or be remembered as a classic but it does what it does very well indeed. Like I say, it ticks the box for every prison movie and every football movie cliché in existence but that doesn't stop 'The Longest Yard' from being a fine example of a sporting comedy. Let's face it, name another one. Personally, this strikes me as being a perfect rental movie in which you can watch and enjoy it but probably forget about it the next day. So it's good but not what I'd call a classic. Think of it as a touchdown conversation instead of a two-pointer.",6,0,2,10 April 2006
Ghost," One film that should live forever - 84%
","Some films tend to live far longer than their quality suggests, either due to key scenes which are firmly lodged in our collective memories or because they are frequently copied or parodied. 'The Matrix' is one example although given the quality of the (first) film, it was always going to become a hit. 'Ghost', it seems, is one that has been damaged by comic imitation - 'Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear' almost ruins it on its own - but the fact is that this film is about so much more than The Righteous Brothers and THAT scene. It remains a powerful, emotive tear-jerker in the finest traditions of Hollywood and despite looking understandably rough around the edges these days, it is still worthy of your attention if you're in the mood for a modern classic love story.Patrick Swayze plays Sam, loving partner of Molly (Demi Moore) and banking business partner of best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn). Life, it seems, is pretty much perfect and as the film opens, we see Sam and Molly moving into a new apartment. But nothing lasts forever and Sam is shot and killed in a street mugging. Finding himself stuck as a ghost, Sam continues to spend time with Molly who is deep in mourning and unable to see or hear Sam's ghost. But Sam quickly finds that his death was not as random as it appeared but what can he do when no-one can see or hear him? Only with the help of an apparent medium (show-stealing Whoopi Goldberg) can Sam help save Molly from the danger that is still out there waiting for her.Plot-wise, it's pretty weak and the supposed mystery behind Sam's untimely demise is about as deep as an episode of 'Scooby Doo'. And despite the Oscar-winning performance by Goldberg, Swayze is disappointing as the dewy-eyed, square-jawed spirit. It also has to be said that the special effects are somewhat dodgy but nothing too serious - a special edition DVD release could probably sort that out. So if it's a predictable mystery with a poor lead actor, why is it such a popular film? Simple - despite being a comedic love story with a supernatural twist, it actually acquits itself very well. Swayze and Moore make a great couple and have real chemistry on screen, making their parting all the more painful. It is a classic love story and one which appeals to women more than men - not enough Demi for me. It is also a chilling ghost tale with scenes that are genuinely disturbing such as the 'shadow people' who drag souls into Hell with an unearthly scream.Despite looking very dated in places and the fact that you know what will happen in the end, 'Ghost' remains a film that no self-respecting romance fan should be without. It has its detractors and the minute 'Unchained Melody' starts playing, you'll struggle to suppress a wry smile. But I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movie which I swore was cheesy and needlessly gushy when I watched it years ago. If you watch with a loved one then it will almost certainly result in tears but in a good way, for once. 'Ghost' is one film that deserves to live forever in our collective minds because it is a real winner.",8,3,5,29 May 2006
Deja Vu," Enjoyable but ultimately forgettable - 60%
","Recently, I've been spoiling myself by rewatching some absolute gems on DVD. Reacquainting myself with the likes of 'The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy and 'WALL·E', it's easy to forget that not all movie are stone-cold classics. Take this middling effort from a couple of year ago. Despite having a big-name lead actor, a director with a proved track record and a superstar producer, it just failed to excite and entertain me in the way I expected. To be honest, I had high hopes for this (certainly the excessive publicity around the time of release suggested this was a corker) but ironically, I suppose hindsight is a wonderful thing.Denzel Washington plays AFT agent Doug Carlin, called in to investigate a massive explosion on a New Orleans ferry. But after meeting FBI agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), Doug is offered a unique opportunity. Using the latest technology and advances in surveillance, the team use a window into the recent past to uncover the bomber and investigate the murder of a young woman (Paula Patton) who appears to be connected to the bombing. And as Doug begins to develop feelings for the woman, he starts to wonder if he can really change the past for the better.It's difficult to specify why 'Deja Vu' isn't the runaway hit I thought it would be. The plot, while clearly nonsense, offers enough to keep the viewer interested thanks in no small part to Washington as the increasingly perplexed agent. The problem is that like nearly all time-travelling movies, the plot ultimately lets itself down. This isn't a problem with stuff like the 'Austin Powers' movies which don't take themselves seriously but 'Deja Vu' takes itself very seriously indeed. Personally, I felt a strange sense that nobody was really trying. The action, when it eventually comes, never felt like it was pushing any boundaries and the story takes a long time to get going. At no point did I go 'oh, that's cool' or see anything that I felt I hadn't seen before. In a weird way, it reminded me of another Denzel flick 'Out Of Time' which wasn't a classic either but through good story-telling and another magnetic performance from Washington, it was eminently watchable. 'Deja Vu' is just that, a fine film to watch on TV if nothing else is on but nothing more.Maybe I've been spoiling myself with classic DVDs too much but in truth, 'Deja Vu' isn't in the same league as what I've been watching. Yes, Denzel gives another performance that reminds us why he has a Best Actor Oscar on his mantelpiece but with a typically confused time-travelling plot and lazy direction, it doesn't match the performance Denzel gives it. Like 'Out Of Time', he is a big fish in a small pond. With a little more effort and a better ending (which badly let the film down), this may have been the classic I thought it was but sadly, this is a wasted opportunity that's gone by begging. Damn.",6,0,1,4 September 2009
Finding Neverland," No need for Tinkerbell, this film is simply magical - 91%
","For the longest time, I was wary of watching this. It struck me as being quite Oscar-friendly and very much a period chick-flick. Therefore, I'd like to extend my deepest sympathies to 'Finding Neverland' and everyone connected with it because this is a sublime picture that is full of zeal and enthusiasm. It is also the first movie I've seen that accurately shows what it is like being a writer (as I am one myself) with glorious flights of fancy that are both wonderful to witness and (at last!) do not detract from the film as a whole.Johnny Depp puts in one of the finest performances in his career as the author of Peter Pan, J.M. Barrie. After his latest play flops in London's West End, Barrie begins a friendship with the four children of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and finds his inspiration for his next play, a story about a boy who never grows up - 'Peter Pan'. But the relationship between the Davies' and Barrie puts a tremendous strain on his wife (Radha Mitchell) as well as Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie).It is truly staggering how different Depp is here from his role in 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' - here, he is controlled and graceful and his Scottish accent is impeccable. But Depp faces strong competition from the four child actors (Freddie Highmore, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud & Luke Spill) who are also fantastic as the Davies' children. The film also looks superb, with a relentless turn-of-the-century feel for the most part and a surreal dream-like quality during Barrie's flights of fancy when his and the boys' imagination takes over. And while a film based on how a play is written doesn't sound that gripping, it never fails to captivate and hold your attention. My one gripe is that it's a bit too similar to 'Shakespeare In Love' but given how extraordinary that film was, that is hardly criticism - indeed, it is mighty praise for a film that surprised and entertained me for every minutes of its duration.I'd happily recommend this film to almost anybody. It's imaginative, emotive and gloriously realised - such a shame that it didn't win more Oscars because this is one of the best films to be released this side of the millennium. It's one of the finest pieces of escapism I've seen and I defy anyone not to feel choked at the end. It's a great date movie as well as fabulous family entertainment, although young children may find their attention wandering. Most of all, it's an intelligent and beautifully produced 'writers' movie which, if we're honest, don't come along very often. If you haven't seen it then believe the hype - this is one movie you simply have to see, even if you're not a fan of period dramas (like myself). Depp does it again.",9,2,3,16 May 2006
In Bruges," A sure-fire cult classic - different but very good - 85%
","From the off, this had the look and feel of a cult movie. Being neither an out-and-out comedy nor an action thriller, I personally feel that this movie was mis-marketed - however, at least the PR machine made me want to watch it in the first place and I'm glad I did. Feeling like a cross between 'Father Ted' and 'The Bourne Identity', this is a beautifully shot film full of humour and pathos in equal measures. It's also the first film I can recall seeing where Colin Farrell isn't a huge disappointment.'In Bruges' introduces us to two Irish hit men - child-like Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are ordered to lay low in Bruges (in Belgium) for two weeks after a job in London while awaiting further instructions from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Ken enjoys his time while Ray can't wait to get out until he meets Chloë (Clémence Poésy), who is working on a film with dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice). But after botching a job and finding himself the target, both Ray and Ken struggle to deal with the consequences of their actions...There will be few who would argue that 'In Bruges' is anything original as it is rather reminiscent of a Guy Ritchie gangster flick as the characters and plot tangle with each other in unexpected ways. The balance of humour and drama also matches Ritchie's output though due to heavy Irish accents, you sometimes struggle to hear all of the fabulously witty dialogue. But 'In Bruges' does offer some crucial differences, the biggest being Farrell who produces the goods in a way I never expected he could. He and Gleeson exchange some brilliant dialogue as they come to terms with past mistakes and choices. Fiennes is also very good as the urbane killer with a family life and a potty mouth. The other surprise is Bruges itself, looking every inch like the medieval dreamscape it feels like in the movie and provides not only a rich backdrop but also another character interacting with the actors.However, the plot itself is pretty standard gangster fare (albeit, set in Belgium) and there are still questions left at the end of the film. But these don't distract you from what is an extremely good, low-budget movie that offers big dollops of laughs, action and soul-searching amid a picturesque Gothic town in Belgium. No doubt about it, this is a difficult movie to pigeonhole and I know some people who'll watch this expecting something different and going home disappointed. Probably the film closest to this in feel and style is the equally cult 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' and that didn't do too well at the box office either. But if you're in the mood for something different but still entertaining then this could be exactly what you're looking for. Give it a go but leave your expectations at the door. Then book a flight to Belguim...",8,0,2,16 December 2008
Erin Brockovich," Roberts & Finney superbly lead this true-life drama - 84%
","If you were to ask my Better Half what her favourite type of movie is, she'd probably say 'true-life movies' but personally, I have a very real problem with movies of this type. Most are made for TV and decidedly crummy, for starters, but seeing as they are also as predictable as your average Nativity play, there is no attraction in watching it in the first place unless endless stories of how odds are overcome are your thing. You'd think, therefore, that 'Erin Brockovich' is not what I would consider a good movie and you'd be right. But like that other great 'true-life' movie, 'Alive', this is one film which has rock-solid performances from the leads and an almost documentary feel to it. But after being paid $20 million for her appearance, I'd expect nothing less from Julia Roberts.Roberts plays our erstwhile heroine who has reached the bottom of the barrel. Struggling with her three kids and no man to help her, she even fails to win suitable compensation after being involved in a car crash. Desperate but determined, she forces herself into the employ of her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) but with her foul language and slutty clothes, she can't help but make the wrong impression. But after stumbling across what appears to be an administrative mistake, Erin's curiosity gets the better of her and she soon uncovers a huge hushed-up industrial accident by Pacific Gas & Electric which polluted the water supply of a nearby town to such a degree that it causes a variety of life-threatening conditions in the townsfolk. Enraged, Erin and Ed decide to take on the corporate giants with the help of the townspeople but sometimes, doing the right thing isn't always the easiest thing.There can be few who'd argue that Roberts didn't deserve her Oscar - watching the extras on the DVD, you can see what a great job she did of portraying Ms Brockovich. But the actor who impressed me the most is Finney, giving the sort of performance that has me scratching my head wondering why Hollywood isn't using him more often. He is faultless and together with Roberts, they dominate the picture with the ease of two professionals at the top of their game. By contrast, Aaron Eckhart (who's no amateur either) looks flat and almost uninterested in proceedings as Erin's biker boyfriend George. And however well publicised the story has been, you still can't quite believe that it all actually happened. It did feel slightly sugar-coated at the end as I felt it didn't reflect the true outcome of the case (a quick look at the trivia section of IMDb or Wikipedia will explain all) and I also would have liked some feedback from PG&E themselves but the story won't allow it, instead permitting the sort of one-way information traffic normally the preserve of Michael Moore.But all things considered, this is still a fine example of a true-life movie that doesn't suck. It can be easy to dismiss stuff like this as lazy movie-making that only geared towards making Oprah talk about it but that's doing 'Erin Brockovich' an injustice. Brilliantly performed with enough good lines to keep most viewers interested, it's another reminder that even the loneliest individual can make the biggest impact on the lives of so many. Roberts may take the plaudits but Finney is every inch as good and if you're looking for a film with two fantastic leads then either this or 'Training Day' are pretty much as good as you're going to get.",8,0,1,7 October 2008
The Big Lebowski," A darkly humorous noir with two of cinema's biggest losers - 91%
","Films by the Coen brothers I often find a little intimidating. Everyone agrees that they're not for a mainstream audience but you certainly need your wits about you - basically they are films for connoisseurs and as much as I enjoy my movies, I've always considered myself to be a casual movie-goer. It has taken me a long time to get around to watch this movie - as it did with 'Fargo' - but as with their other movies, I enjoyed this immensely. It is genuinely as interesting as it is amusing, littered with faultless performances and a classic film-noir style plot that twists and turns around the quote-happy dialogue.Jeff Bridges plays Jeff Lebowski, a pot-smoking slacker living in LA and preferring to go by the name of The Dude. Spending his time bowling with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi), The Dude is the victim of a vicious beating by two clueless goons who mistake him for Jeffrey Lebowski, the millionaire. Seeking compensation for his ruined rug, The Dude quickly finds himself drawn into a complex kidnapping case and begins to find himself out of his depth. With an ever-growing list of people seemingly intent of manipulating him to their will, The Dude finds his laid-back attitude sorely tested as well as his friendship with the quick-to-anger Walter.While my suspicions that this film's plot would be complicated were right, at no point did I find my attention wandering or my understanding of the story diminished. This is story-telling on an epic scale, reminiscent of classic noir movies like 'The Big Sleep' and 'Double Indemnity'. But there is a black-as-night streak of humour running throughout the film, mainly from Goodman as the borderline psychotic Vietnam veteran, that's brilliantly pitched. With dynamite performances throughout the cast, it's difficult to pick out any one actor but Bridges rightly deserves the plaudits as he is utterly convincing and oddly lovable as the bearded waster bumbling his way through the film with a child-like naivety. The only possible downside that I can think of is that it does need multiple viewings to get the most out of it and as I've already said, you definitely need to give the plot your full attention.'The Big Lebowski' could arguably by described as the ultimate 'stoner' movie but seeing as that brings to mind stuff like 'Dude, Where's My Car?' and 'Harold & Kumar Get The Munchies', that is doing this movie a grave injustice. This is a movie with real depth and charm - a classic detective story with the most unlikely sleuth imaginable. It may be complex and 'high-brow' but don't let that put you off as this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen for a long time - it's much lighter than their other efforts I've seen like 'Fargo' which was quite dark. It actually reminded me of 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' but this is much funnier and more entertaining than that - Bridges and Goodman are a much better pairing than Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer. Forget any trepidation you may have - this is the Coen's at their absolute best and even if you're a casual movie goer, you owe it to yourself to watch 'The Big Lebowski'.

Unbreakable," Great thriller let down by a weak story - 57%
","Having had both 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Village' ruined for me by various people telling me the famous Shyamalan twist, I was left to watch this uninterrupted and unspoiled. By pure chance, it is also the only M Night Shyamalan film I have any interest in watching (the less said about 'Signs', the better) so I snapped up the DVD without too much debate.Hardly any wonder to find the star of 'Sixth Sense', Bruce Willis, back but this time as David Dunn, a former college football star and now married to his childhood sweetheart Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and father to Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). But David is not happy. His marriage is failing and his dead-end security job is getting him nowhere. Then one day, his life is flipped upside down after a major train crash. David is the only survivor - indeed, he walks away completely unscathed. Shortly afterwards, he is contacted by eccentric comic collector Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson) who believes that David may have incredible powers. Initially sceptical, David is eventually forced to confront Elijah's theories and ask himself some difficult, repressed questions about himself.There is quite a lot not to like about this film. Obsessive comic book fans will probably not like the performance of a big wigged Jackson, wide-eyed stare and grandiose dialogue. Willis does his whispering trick again like he did in 'Sixth Sense' and sadly can't portray the emotional turmoil needed for a character like David. Much better are Clark and Penn as David's son and wife, both of whom find themselves questioning David as much as themselves. But the biggest let-down is the story which I found disappointing and not anything like as original as 'Sixth Sense'. But the atmosphere and tension are built up well and the obligatory twist at the end is well written and well disguised. But at no stage did I ever find myself believing this film and anyone looking for a metaphorical meaning will be disappointed as Shyamalan states from the beginning that this is about comics. I suppose one could say that the film teaches us all to be heroes in our own way but I don't think Shyamalan tells fables, only stories.However, perseverance is the key here. 'Unbreakable' never fully hits its stride until the end but when it does, it proves a terrifically tense thriller full of the quasi-supernatural imagery that Shyamalan loves. Willis' hooded poncho standing in the rain makes our hero look like Death himself and I truly respect Shyamalan's ability to show the everyday as being full of symbolism and myth. It's such a shame that the story couldn't be slightly stronger because there is a great film here somewhere and it deserves to be given a chance. It was never going to be another 'Sixth Sense' and disappointing box office returns scuppered plans for an obvious sequel. After all, the best comic book films usually have much more mileage than studio bosses allow. One needs only to look at the 'Spiderman' or 'X-Men' franchises to see how far they can run. 'Unbreakable' could have been one of them but falls just short.",5,0,0,5 May 2005
Memento," Complex, intriguing, amazing - an essential film to watch - 92%
","Like many fans of the 'Batman' movies, I had doubts about the new film 'Batman Begins'. Christopher Nolan is a director with an impressive but very short CV and I confess, I had doubts. So I figured a little research was needed before I cough up the cash to go to the cinema and what better than his critically acclaimed smash 'Memento'? I was a little concerned about not being able to follow the famously non-linear plot but all concerns evaporated quickly as I was soon absorbed in this original and intriguing thriller.Guy Pearce plays Leonard, the victim of a vicious assault where he was attacked and his wife was raped and murdered. As a result, Leonard has no short-term memory - he remembers everything before the attack but he is incapable of forming new memories, meaning he has to write down every important detail or tattoo it onto his body. Determined to find his wife's killer, Leonard soon finds himself assisted by waitress Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and garrulous individual Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But can he conquer his condition to bring the killer to justice? 'Memento' is a very strange movie, filmed backwards but interspersed with the present, filmed in black and white. As a consequence, you quickly discover who the killer is and the clues reveal themselves instead of being formed. They just pop up in Leonard's pocket - a photo of a person or a new tattoo on his chest - but the film follows the reasons behind the clues rather than what the clues lead to. Once you've got your head around this unusual complication, 'Memento' is a simply stunning film and a remarkable achievement. In terms of writing, editing, directing and acting, this is one of the best films that I have seen for many years. It is utterly captivating, drawing you into it's myriad story lines from the first frame. I can think of few other films with a better opening and due to its nature, it refuses to let go of your attention. Things like toilet breaks and food don't matter all of a sudden! Guy Pearce has done a fantastic job of bringing Leonard to life, surely the role of a lifetime and proves that 'LA Confidential' was no fluke. Pantoliano is typically brilliant but Moss is a real surprise, providing depth and mystery to a character that would just be another love interest role in the hands of a lesser story-teller. Almost enough to banish memories of a certain cat-suit! The only thing I could criticise is the number of plot-holes but seeing as that universal plot-discrepancy device (a dodgy memory) is used, you could say that this isn't really a great point. The other thing is deciding how far back do you go - I still had questions at the end of the film but then again, so would Leonard. 'Memento' demands your concentration and admiration in equal measures. It is a wonderfully complex and interesting thriller and offers some hope that Mr Nolan can resurrect the Dark Knight once again like Tim Burton did before him.",10,1,3,16 June 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Diet 'Lord Of The Rings' - 65%
","It has taken some time but finally, the right time and film came along to mark my 200th film review. I had bought this for my Better Half for her birthday in April but we hadn't watched it until today, when we shared a lazy Sunday morning in bed together. Having fond memories of the BBC TV adaptation in the Eighties, I had high hopes for this. It also seems determined to mimic another recent fantasy outing filmed in New Zealand and one that I enjoyed from start to finish. But while 'The Lord Of The Rings' has a more adult feel to it, 'The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' is strictly aimed at younger viewers and has a more kiddie-friendly feel than Peter Jackson's stunning trilogy.The first 'Chronicle Of Narnia' focuses on the four Pevensie children Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, Anna Popplewell and William Moseley respectively) who are evacuated during the Second World War to the home of a reclusive professor (Jim Broadbent). During a game of Hide And Seek, Lucy discovers a strange wardrobe which leads to the white wintry world of Narnia. Before long, they are all caught up in a titanic clash for the future of Narnia between the dark forces of the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and the amassed armies of Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). Can they all survive the battle ahead, especially when it appears that there is a traitor in their midst? As if further proof were required, New Zealand is the place to go for shooting films with jaw-dropping scenes of snow-capped mountains and rich, lush forests. And, as 'Lord Of The Rings' also proved, CG creatures have come a long way since Jar Jar Binks. From Aslan to Mr Tumnus (James McAvoy), each and every creature looks fantastic and believable. Sadly, there are moments when there are slight gaps in the CG sheen where it becomes apparent that characters are stood in front of a green screen instead of a beautiful sun-drenched valley. Make-up and costumes are also of an extremely high standard as are the performances of the four main actors. Henley is probably the best of the four, proving to be the equal of her older contemporaries.The problem this film has is mainly one of pacing. Whereas 'Lord Of The Rings' has the luxury of spreading itself out over three massive films (and still not get everything in), 'The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe' has to cram everything in during its 140 minute duration and it sometimes feels rushed or like it doesn't have time to explain things - for example, it never explains that you don't find your way into Narnia if you're looking for it. It is also trying too hard to be 'Lord Of The Rings' - thrown in Gandalf and you'd honestly never know the difference. And while I agree that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, director Andrew 'Shrek' Adamson displays precious little imagination when it comes to telling this story which is a shame, given the vivid imagination of the original author, C.S. Lewis. But while this is basically Diet 'Lord Of The Rings', this is still a fantastic film and one which tells this classic tale better than it ever has before. It's bright and thrilling and exactly what a children's adventure movie should be. Don't wait until you've hit 200 movies - go and get the special edition DVD and treat the kids.",6,1,2,18 June 2006
Madagascar," More fun than a barrel full of monkeys - 68%
","I have to admit that 'Madagascar', the latest film from the makers of 'Shrek', didn't really appeal to me. From the trailers I'd seen, I thought it looked too kiddie-friendly to me but as my Better Half wanted to watch it, I found myself renting the DVD along with 'Team America: World Police'. I had already seen the short Christmas film with the penguins and that was very funny and that had made me change my mind a little. But I was pleasantly surprised to find this an unexpectedly witty and genuinely funny family film, although one which doesn't really seem to go anywhere plot-wise.'Madagascar' begins in New York's Central Zoo where the star attraction is the lion Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller). His best friend is Marty (Chris Rock), a zebra who dreams of one day going back to the wild - much to the chagrin of Alex. So when the pair are apprehended after a daring escape plan, along with Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and a hypochondriac giraffe named Melman (David Schwimmer), the four are soon shipped off on a transfer. But they are accidentally washed overboard and find themselves in a tropical jungle populated by dancing lemurs. But is this a blessing in disguise or will they realise that there is no place like home? It has to be said that, technically, this is the best looking film that Dreamworks Animation have produced so far. The ocean effects are particularly realistic but the characters maintain a traditional cartoon feel - eyes bulge and necks stretch in typical Tom & Jerry fashion. And despite Schwimmer struggling to escape Ross, the voices are also perfectly cast with Stiller taking top honours. My initial opinion that it was too kiddie-friendly isn't too wide of the mark, however, with a lot of the comedy being slapstick in nature. But there are laughs to be had, such as the wonderfully funny penguins hijacking the ship and trying to reach Antartica. If anything, the ships aren't the only thing the penguins hijack - they are just brilliant and thoroughly deserved their own short film.Although 'Madagascar' is a wonderfully bright colourful family film, I can't honestly say that I'm raving about it. Schwimmer is very disappointing as Melman and I wonder if he will ever escape 'Friends' during the rest of his career. The plot itself, although it starts promisingly enough, quickly runs out of steam once they arrive in Madagascar and the lemurs get involved. But there is still plenty to enjoy in this film and it is much better than I was expecting. It won't change the world and it certainly isn't as much fun as 'The Incredibles' but 'Madagascar' is yet another worthy winner from Dreamworks and another blow to Disney, who will be ruing the day that Pixar went their own way.",6,11,17,7 January 2006
Pirate Radio," A killer soundtrack searching for a film to match - 69%
","I seem to recall that this was one movie that really divided the critics upon release. Not the critics themselves but their views - that this was a silly, puerile movie with a cracking soundtrack - didn't marry up with what most audience viewers experienced which was a rollicking comedy with songs to make you dance and performances that really delivered. Personally, I think they're both right. This is a film with little real plot and surprisingly little humour but one that you still enjoy immensely.In the Sixties, young Carl (Tom Sturridge) is sent by his mother to his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy, having the time of his life) on-board his pirate radio station moored in the North Sea. Sadly, Radio Rock is not exactly the best place to send an impressionable young man as it is the unruly home to the likes of American rock god The Count (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), sexy Lothario Gavin (Rhys Ifans), bespectacled Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and the rest of the motley crew of rule-breakers and pop players. But as Carl realises the real reason behind his abandonment on-board, the British government is becoming increasingly concerned about their influence and task Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) and his unusually named assistant (Jack Davenport) with bringing pirate radio, and Radio Rock in particular, to their knees.Richard Curtis films usually have a great soundtrack, something which isn't obvious in the likes of 'Notting Hill' or 'Love, Actually'. But he has excelled himself here, providing an audio feast for your ears. Every scene has a groovy Sixties beat behind it and it rarely intrudes into what's happening in the scene, which is a good thing. Because, and this is going to sound harsh, there is very little else to keep you interested. The story, such as it is, is told in fits and starts and never really convinces anyway. Take Davenport's character, for example. By giving him a name that IMDb won't allow me to print here instantly reduces him to a one-dimensional baddie and the same goes for Branagh's amalgamation of every villainous politician you've ever seen in movies. Nothing surprises you about the film aside from the antics of the crew in one ridiculous scene to the next. By the time the ending rolls around, you're almost shaking your head in disbelief. It's a real shame because the other actors do a great job of impersonating certain other real-life pirate DJ's... I mean, breathing life into their characters. Ifans is brilliant as the reptilian dandy who keeps pushing the boundaries and Nighy is simply having fun.It's difficult to be overly critical of a film I still enjoyed and I honestly did. Yes, it's daft and silly and the soundtrack is second to none. But I always felt it was a soundtrack in search of a film and sadly, 'The Boat That Rocked' doesn't stand up well as a period comedy. The best scenes are when the various DJs are broadcasting in their own style but away from the mic, it felt slightly boring and flat. It's the Sixties through rose-tinted specs, with a knowing wink in the director's eyes. I wanted to like this more as did my Better Half but the pair of us were just slightly disappointed in the end. It's not exactly a shipwreck but it's hardly sea-worthy.",6,1,1,22 August 2010
Superbad," Not my cup of tea but a good teen comedy nonetheless - 76%
","I've never been a huge fan of the teen comedy genre, primarily because they are all essentially the same. Bunch of hopeless losers get together and have a wild, crazy adventure in search of sex, drugs and/or drink. 'Superbad' sticks rigidly to this formula so in essence, this is no different to 'American Pie', 'Porkys', 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' or any other teen flick you could mention. But seeing as it features Hollywood's form actor - Seth Rogen - not only on screen but also on the screenplay, I figured that maybe this might have something to it. And to be fair, there are some laughs to be had and the unfamiliar cast certainly do themselves a power of good but personally, this isn't my cup of tea.Best friends Seth (Johan Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) have been inseparable throughout high school and are preparing to spend their last few weeks together before separating for college. But after a chance invitation to a party, Seth hatches a plan for them to provide the party with enough booze in order for them to get it on with two girls (Martha MacIsaac & Emma Stone). Roping in fellow geek Foggell (newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and his fake ID, their plan quickly unravels after two inept cops (Rogen & Bill Hader), a homeless drunk and Foggell's bizarre new identity (McLovin) threaten to scupper their plans. Can they get hold of the booze? Can they get to the party and pop their cherry? And when will Hollywood change the record? It's unfair to judge 'Superbad' on sticking so close to the teen comedy stereotype because that's what it is - a teen comedy. So it's packed to the rafters with all the crude language, sex jokes and two dimensional eye candy in miniskirts you'll ever need. What 'Superbad' has in reserve is what separates it from the seemingly never-ending supply of teen flicks spewing from Hollywood. First, it has a killer cast. They isn't a weak link in the chain anywhere, although all three leads are shown up by Rogen and Hader who are simply brilliant as the completely hopeless cops. There is also a surprisingly epic feel to the thing, like a juvenile 'Lord Of The Rings' as their supposedly simply quest gets ever more convoluted and impossible. But there is also a sting in the tail, an ending that was not only heartfelt but plausible too.So while it doesn't bring anything new to the party, 'Superbad' is still welcome all the same. It wasn't the laughter-fest I was expecting but like I said, I'm not a fan of this type of film. If you enjoyed 'American Pie' or any of its witless sequels then I suspect you'll get more out of this than I did. I just wish that something would come along and not rely on massive amounts of swearing and revolve around a bunch of losers trying to get laid - is that really too much to ask? Maybe 'Pineapple Express' might appeal to me more but I'm not in any great rush to see that either. All I can say is give 'Superbad' a chance but only if this sort of malarkey appeals to your teenage sense of humour.",7,7,16,2 June 2009
Juno," A smart, sassy and brilliantly written comedy - 89%
","I've always said that if I can write a movie half as good as 'Pulp Fiction' then I'd be happy. But as great as Tarantino's opus is, it still feels artificial. Vincent and Jules would never exist in real life and Mia's overdose would be all-too-fatal - in short, none of it feels like real life, however entertaining it may be. But this film, from debuting screenwriter (and first-class name-holder) Diablo Cody, manages to feel not just entertaining but almost autobiographical. With scalpel-sharp dialogue and blistering performances, this makes one of the best-written film I've seen become one of the very best.Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a sixteen-year-old high school student who discovers she's pregnant after one night's experimenting with her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After fleeing from an abortion clinic, Juno decides to go through with the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption to a nice couple. Meeting up with musician Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) and his wife Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), Juno has no qualms at all about going ahead with the plan and relies on the help of her parents Bren (Allison Janney) and Mac (the always wonderful J.K. Simmons). But as the seasons pass and Juno's delivery date gets every nearer, will things ever be the same again for her, Paulie, her family or the Lorings? It's easy to spot an actor or actress giving brilliant performances and while 'Juno' is full of them, Page is simply superb as the quirky teenager, firing off one-liners like they're going out of fashion. Feeling like a living version of MTV's 'Daria', Juno is smart, sassy and remarkably the most level-headed character on screen. Cera handles the role of the bewildered father-to-be with excellence too while Simmons and Janney have real fun with some of the lines - Bren's sparring with the ultrasound technician (Kaaren de Silva) is a rare scene that's performed to such a degree that not only did I wince at the verbal sparring but wanted to cheer for her afterwards! The film's soundtrack is also fantastic, scored by the artist Kimya Dawson who I'm not familiar with but will try to track down now. Her songs and lyrics have a beautiful simplicity to them that flow through the film like the changing seasons the characters find themselves in and turns what might have been a depressing story into one filled with a positive, life-affirming message.So why does it miss out on a hallowed 90%+ score? I kinda felt that it lost its way a bit. I found it difficult to sympathise with Garner's overly enthusiastic mother-in-waiting and the ending didn't feel right either - at least, the adoption part. But by and large, this is a brilliantly written, directed and performed comedy about the various trials and tribulations about growing up faster than you'd wish for. It feels quite female-orientated and yet, I still would happily recommend 'Juno' to anyone who enjoys an intelligent and all-too-plausible film that is the polar opposite of something like 'Knocked Up'. This has a sensitivity, a heart that governs not just what happens to the characters but has enough left to get its pro-life message across without being overly preachy. Page is a star with a real future ahead of her if this is anything to go by and I personally feel the Academy got it wrong by snubbing Page's Best Actress nod. It might be a bit 'indie' for some people but 'Juno' is a film to be enjoyed, understood and celebrated for years to come.",9,1,1,28 July 2013
L.A. Confidential," Evocative and thrilling, this is a cop movie with real class - 89%
","For years, I was brought up to believe that the books were always better than the movies. And for a while, it made sense. I've read books like 'Jurassic Park', 'The Lord Of The Rings' (which I'm currently making my way through) and even the 'Star Wars' novels are exciting, if a little basic, books. So when I spotted the Elmore Leonard's original on sale, I purchased a copy almost wholly on the reputation of the film. Big mistake - the language and prose ran all over the place and I just couldn't get into it at all. It still lays around, unfinished and probably always will now that I have the movie on DVD. And where words fail, pictures and sounds combine to tell the blistering story of corruption and determination in LA's police department.Set in the golden age of the early Fifties in Hollywood, 'L.A. Confidential' introduces us to three very different cops with very different methods. Wonderkid Ed Exley (Guy Pierce) is the newly-assigned rookie, holding to the ideals of justice for all and playing the game by the rules. At the other end of the spectrum is 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe) who is little more than a suited thug with a badge and the support of his superior, Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell). Somewhere in the middle is Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), technical adviser to hit TV show 'Badge Of Honor' and reliant on investigative reporter Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) to tell him what's going down in Hollywood, so he can turn up and arrest the suspects for the cameras with a smile on his face. Between them, they must investigate the apparent robbery of the Nite Owl café in which a former cop was slain.Despite the complex story and multiple protagonists, 'L.A. Confidential' remains a captivating film which never lets go of your attention. The film is a wonderful recreation of a typical noir setting, bright and colourful on the surface but rotten to its corrupted core. Indeed, it seems like Exley is the last good man alive as the case gradually grows to encompass political corruption, seedy dirt digging and prostitution rackets - which brings us to the Oscar winning performance from Kim Basinger as high-class hooker Lynn Bracken. Considering that she has rarely been given an acting role as opposed to simply looking good on screen, Basinger is stunningly good as she raises her game to new heights and holds her own alongside the respected ensemble cast. But she is not alone - Crowe, DeVito and Cromwell are all superb and even former 'Neighbours' star Pierce is exception as the increasingly desperate cop trying to hold onto his morals when everyone else threw theirs away long ago. The story twists and turns throughout and the ending was one I didn't see coming, which makes so much difference when you consider how many cop films end exactly as you predicted.There is no doubt at all that this film is special. From the cracking soundtrack to the authentic dialogue, evocative costumes to the picture-perfect view of a Hollywood that Raymond Chandler himself would be proud of. 'L.A. Confidential' does everything right though, for me personally, I would like to have seen a new series of films in this style with Philip Marlowe (Chandler's private detective and star of many books) because that would quite possibly be one of my favourite films of all time. However, it doesn't feel right to criticise this film because it deserves all the praise I can offer. Compulsive, tense and gripping - everything a good cop movie should be. 'L.A. Confidential' is a movie of timeless quality and a quantum leap ahead of the last film I watched last night on Channel 4 (the bloody dreadful 'Guest House Paradiso').",9,0,2,4 April 2005
Blades of Glory," Not quite a 6.0 but still highly entertaining - 81%
","Have to say it, I'm still not convinced by Will Ferrell's ascension to A-list comic genius. The only film of his that I'd rate is the so-goofy-but-still-funny 'Anchorman' but his woefully unamusing turn in the disappointing 'Bewitched' was toe-curlingly bad. In fact, Ferrell had a lot riding on this for him to regain my good favour but thankfully, he had played an absolute blinder. For once, the shouting mania of his usual performances has been replaced by a controlled and brilliant turn that pays off with what might be the best film of his career.Ferrell plays Chazz Michael Michaels, an ego-driven ice skater who lives fast and hard. Developing an intense rivalry with the virginal genius that is Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) that comes to a head at the World Championships in 2002 when the pair are banned for life after a fist-fight at the top of the podium. But after an apparent loophole is discovered, Chazz and Jimmy find themselves swallowing their pride as they team up to compete in the pairs, much to the surprise and disgust of everyone else. But they seriously worry the brother-and-sister team of Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) and their non-skating sister Katie (Jenna Fischer), who soon captures the heart of MacElroy.Like 'Anchorman', 'Blades Of Glory' picks a soft target and goes straight for the jugular - with hilarious consequences. Ferrell is perfect as the sleazy, sex-addicted idiot whose passion for gold is matched only by his hatred of his rival. And Heder tries his best to match Ferrell and he does well enough but this is Ferrell's show. The annoying shouting and over-acting have gone and been replaced by a faultless comic performance. It's surprising that nobody else has picked ice-skating up as a victim for spoofing but the lurid campness and faintly pornographic moves are replicated without much amplification and there is no getting around the fact that this is a funny film. Towards the end, it loses its way just slightly as it veers towards the wrong end of surrealism but because 'Blades Of Glory' is about as silly and implausible as you can get, it's no great deal.So what's not to like? Well, to be honest, not a great deal. The humour sometimes steers away from being too 'family-friendly' but that's like saying 'Casablanca' is rubbish because it's in black-and-white. I'd happily recommend 'Blades Of Glory' to almost anyone except ice-skaters who take themselves too seriously. Everyone else will get the joke and enjoy this movie. As for Ferrell, he's back on form but he needs to be more consistent in his roles and his acting to justify his A-list status. But at least this is a step, jump and double-twist in the right direction.",8,3,6,1 September 2007
Nacho Libre," Like nachos themselves, this film's too cheesy and not satisfying enough - 55%
","Finally being able to get back online after a brief absence, my first duty was to come here and tell you all about a most strange little movie. Starring everybody's favourite bearded psychotic dwarf Jack Black, 'Nacho Libre' had enough good praise behind to sink the Bismark but for me personally, I felt like I was missing the joke. Perhaps Black should stick to mocking rock as one half of Tenacious D because this doesn't really do enough for me to honestly recommend it.Black plays Ignacio, a bumbling cook in a Mexican monastery who dreams of leaving it all behind and becoming a luchador. When his dreams overtake his duty to the orphans he feeds, Ignacio is forced to become the wrestler of his dreams - Nacho Libre. Teaming up with worryingly thin street urchin Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez), they face off against some of the more bizarre opponents Mexico has to offer. Sadly, Nacho and Esqueleto aren't up to the standards of the mighty Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez) but spurred on by his forbidden love of Sister Encarnación (the gorgeous Ana de la Reguera), Nacho is determined to become the greatest man in stretchy pants.Black, it has to be said, never convinces as a Mexican at all - his accent veers from scene to scene and the dodgy facial hair looks ready to fall off at a moment's notice. I think that ultimately, whether you'll like this film or not depends almost entirely on whether you enjoy Black's shouty performance. He's like Jim Carrey but without the face-pulling, coming across as little more than a barrel of TNT ready to explode at any minute. With a plectrum in hand, this is ideal but with a weak script, Black's brand of mania isn't quite what is required. To be honest, most of the humour comes from the wrestling scenes which capture the oddness and whirlwind comic violence of professional wrestling perfectly. The rest of the cast gamely try to keep up with Black but ultimately fail.Maybe I'm missing the joke but 'Nacho Libre' didn't really set my world alight. It's far too hit-and-miss, much like Black's career, to be a really funny film because I do think there was potential here. At best, this is a unusual kid's movie but I'm still not sure whether they'd get the joke or not. Wrestling movies aren't that common but what's the point in spoofing them when they are already pushing the boundaries of reality back as far as they can go? The same applies to spy movies trying to mock James Bond - anybody who watched 'Die Another Day' will know how far the real thing had left the tracks. 'Nacho Libre' has flashes of laughter but for me, I'd rather go toe-to-toe with Rey Mysterio.",5,0,1,26 May 2007
Gone Baby Gone," An under-rated surprise, if a tad dark and depressing - 75%
","If I say 'Ben Affleck' to you, what's the first thing that comes into your mind? 'Gigli'? 'Daredevil'? J-Lo? Probably not what first brought him to wider attention, coming up with the Oscar-winning screenplay behind 'Good Will Hunting' with fellow thesp Matt Damon. Thankfully, he's in serious-mode here behind the camera and has directed a chilling but gripping drama that, sadly, was overtaken by real-life and as a result, criminally overlooked.When a young girl goes missing from a tough Boston suburb, the girl's aunt (Amy Madigan) hires local private detectives Patrick Kenzie (Ben's brother Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to assist the police investigation. Hoping their experience in the neighbourhood will pay dividends, Patrick and Angie begin to uncover a maze of deception and darkness that lies at the heart of the case which threaten not only the girl's safety but also their own lives in ways neither expected.With its release delayed in the UK by the tragic abduction of Madeline McCann, chances are that most film goers won't be too familiar with this movie and that's a shame because this is a terrific film. The story, while feeling that it has one twist too many, has a palpable sense of realism to it that I've not felt in a movie since 'Training Day' and makes the unfolding drama all the more unbearable. Credit must also go to the cast who all add to the authenticity. Probably the best of the bunch is Ed Harris as detective Remy Bressant, despite the presence of the always excellent Morgan Freeman. But what makes 'Gone Baby Gone' really stand out, for me, is the wonderfully written climax which not only provides the viewer with something to think about but also means that this is one movie that might challenge your expectations.This is not an easy movie to watch - I was surprised it was only a 15 certificate given the amount of swearing, violence and gore - but 'Gone Baby Gone' is a film that you should see. There aren't too many thought-provoking dramas that can hold your attention throughout but this is certainly one of them. It does feel slightly too long and like I said, I think it had one twist too many but that doesn't stop this being a great movie, even if it's not exactly a date flick. It's harrowing, chilling and disturbingly real and while it may not be to everyone's tastes, you cannot argue with a film that was much better than you expected it to be. Here's hoping Ben Affleck has ditched his pretty-boy airhead persona for good - can we have more of this, please?",7,0,2,21 April 2009
"Monsters, Inc."," A Pixar masterclass, one of their best - 90%
","Many, including myself, will be lamenting the fact that Disney and Pixar are no more - or at least, no longer working together. In the last ten years since 'Toy Story', they have consistently produced high quality animation that pulls off the one trick Disney rarely could. Pixar films entertain parents and kids alike and it doesn't matter which film you take them to see because all of them stick to the magic formula of being as much fun to everyone as they can. Having re-watched 'The Incredibles' last night, I still say that film is one of my new favourites and it was with eager anticipation that I watched 'Monsters, Inc.' today. I wasn't disappointed but then again, I wasn't expecting to be.'Monsters, Inc.' takes a premise that should be as child-unfriendly as you can imagine and reworks it. Monsters, you see, emerge into our world through the door to your closet (or whatever, seeing as we don't have closets in the UK) in order to provoke screams. They need screams because they use them as energy, powering their homes and businesses in Monstropolis. However, monsters are generally afraid of children as well, believing them to be toxic and deadly to the touch. So when a cute little girl called Boo (Mary Gibbs) makes her way through into Monstropolis, all sorts of panic and chaos arises. It soon becomes apparent that Boo is being looked after by top-scarer Sully (John Goodman) and his one-eyed companion Mike (Billy Crystal), who must return Boo to her bedroom before evil monster Randall (Steve Buscemi) finds her.Words generally fail to do justice to how well 'Monsters, Inc.' looks. If you thought 'The Incredibles' was as good as it got, think again. Sully is a joy to behold, a large blue yeti-type creature with each of his 2.32 million hairs all flowing and looking unbelievably real. Boo too is brilliant, capturing the movement and garbled speech of a child to perfection. If you don't fall in love with her and her innate ability to wander off and cause trouble then I'd go to the doctor because something is clearly wrong. Goodman and Crystal are probably one of the funniest and unlikeliest double acts to emerge in recent years, squabbling with each other and bursting through their monstrous visages (no offence, guys!) with enthusiastic relish. The ideas that run throughout this film are just glorious, from the frankly genius explanation of Monstropolis to the little bits and pieces that litter the cinematic landscape. A restaurant called Harry Hausen's - fantastic! Though it isn't as much fun as Pixar's latest, you'd have to a heart of stone not to enjoy 'Monsters, Inc.' For whatever reason, this film doesn't seem to get as much praise as it should because this really is a fine piece of work, one of Pixar's very best and the best thing Disney have released since 'Aladdin' (excluding 'The Incredibles'). There are moments when the humour falls a little flat, such as the incompetent co-workers who sound denser than a bag of bricks. But the humour is fresh, the ideas are astonishingly original and the vocal talents of all involved (can some mad scientist keep little Ms Gibbs at the age of six forever and give her a microphone?) are perfectly suited to their roles, as if anything less than perfect would do for Pixar. To miss out on this film would be nothing short of disastrous. Get a copy and play to your kids, because you'll all love it. And if you don't have kids (like me) then watch it by yourself and still enjoy. It will be out little secret...",9,1,3,30 March 2005
"I, Robot"," CGI dominates an otherwise entertaining sci-fi tale - 77%
","I actually bought this on ex-rental DVD about a month ago but the thing was so badly scratched that I've only just got it back in mint condition again (thanks to the boys at my local rental store). And it couldn't have come at a better time - a surprise day off work and really crappy weather meant that it was film time and 'I, Robot' would fit the bill perfectly. Essentially, it's an intelligent sci-fi film with a higher action quota than something like 'Minority Report'. If you're the sort of person who preferred 'Star Wars' to 'Star Trek' then you will probably enjoy this as much as I did.Will Smith, in his first decent film for ages, plays Detective Spooner who is a technophobic cop living in the near-future Chigago. Unlucky for him but mega-corporation USR are about to launch their latest model of robot, designed to be a perfect home-help to everybody. The clincher is a fail-safe within each robot, known as the Three Laws. 1) A robot can never, directly or through inaction, allow a human to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey any command given by a human, unless it breaks the First Law. 3) A robot is permitted to defend itself using any means necessary, unless it breaks the First and Second Laws. Spooner is unconvinced and when prominent scientist Dr Lanning (James Cromwell) is found dead from an apparent suicide at USR HQ, Spooner's natural instincts begin to bear fruit. Accompanied by Lanning's skeptical colleague Dr Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner must find a way of convincing those around him that the seemingly impossible is now very probable.I mentioned 'Minority Report' deliberately in my opening paragraph as this film closely resembles that one. Futuristic highways ride over dirty forgotten streets and every gadget and gizmo currently pluggable is plugged (Spooner's insistence on wearing the latest Converse sneakers is plain tacky). In terms of story, this film is more like a much older sci-fi classic - 'Blade Runner' - in that it poses theological questions regarding robots. Do they have a soul? Can they dream? How human is human? That sort of thing. Based upon author Isaac Asimov's work, 'I, Robot' manages to successfully balance a well-written story with high-explosive action which probably would meet with disdain from Asimov (were he alive) but more than satisfies your average cinema goer.Smith is impressive as Spooner, still retaining much of his physique from 'Ali' but he injects a touch of humour in places. All other actors are pretty anonymous, truth be told, although Alan Tudyk does well as the renegade robot Sonny. The technique used is the same that Peter Jackson used to bring Gollum to life in the 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy but it doesn't work as well here because the robots aren't alive. They look like robots instead of capturing every detail that Andy Serkis did with Gollum. And because quite a bit of the film takes place in front of green-screen CGI, suspension of belief is never fully achieved and that is a shame. There is a great movie here trying to get out but CGI stomps all over, dominating every scene and distracting the viewer's attention when the focus should be on the actors and dialogue.There are no real surprises in 'I, Robot'. Once the scenario becomes familiar, it follows a well-trodden path until the conclusion. Not to say that this isn't a good film - it's a great slice of futuristic pie and possibly one that will appeal to non sci-fi fans as well as the geeks. I just feel that it isn't as good as it could have been. A little less CGI would have been welcome and I'm definitely taking one star off for the blatant product placements that litter this film. Asimov probably would hate it but then again, I doubt that I'm as smart as him. This is a well-produced slick piece of entertainment that will leave you wanting more. It's not the perfect mix of brawn and brain but it's considerably more watchable than 'Bicentenial Man'.",7,0,0,2 March 2005
Wanted," Nowhere near as good as it could have been - 64%
","Haven't the Wachowski brothers got a lot to answer for? It seems that hardly a day goes by without another new action movie appears, created on a computer using footage shot in front of a green screen in a warehouse somewhere instead of using actors on location. And blow me, as if to illustrate my point, here is another one! Chock-full of all the ridiculous action you associate with CG-infused action flicks, this is one film that doesn't look too good if you peel away the pixels and gawk at what's left.Wesley Gibson (a miscast James McAvoy) is a bored, weedy office worker who feels trapped in his dull and repetitive life. But before he can scoop up another handful of anti-anxiety pills, he bumps into the oddly-named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who throws him headfirst into a bullet-fuelled adventure. It turns out that Wesley is the son of a super-assassin, a member of a secret society called the Fraternity, who recruit Wesley in order to hunt his father's killer - a rogue member called Cross (Thomas Kretschmann). As Wesley's skills improve under the tutelage of Fox, the Fraternity's leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman) monitors the situation closely as Cross's personal crusade against the Fraternity threatens the organisation's very existence.It sounds like it should have been an absolute winner but 'Wanted' is the architect of its own demise. For example, I can go with the concept of the Fraternity and its thousand years' worth of assassination to 'maintain stability in an unstable world'. But why do the victim's names appear in weaving from the Loom of Destiny or whatever the damn thing was called? How did they appear before weaving was invented and why did it change to secret messages in textiles and why hadn't they updated it to something more 21st century? Never mind, the pretty CG provides enough distraction to stop you from looking into the plot too deeply while Jolie does her bit by pouting endlessly and occasionally flashing the flesh. As for McAvoy, he is not the sort of actor for this role - the first half of the film is spent whining and screaming a lot then when he realises he's actually a bad-ass, the abs come out and he can't go anywhere without a faintly silly grimace and a gun in each hand. The action, where it comes come, is certainly exciting but only possible in the mind of someone thinking in CG - vehicles don't behave the way they do here and I refuse to accept that you can make bullets go around corners by flicking your wrist when pulling the trigger. Nothing in this movie feels believable - granted, do any of these action films have the faintest whiff of reality to them any more - but when something is so fantastic and so 'garnly', it stops being exciting and starts being stupid. Remember when you were a kid, racing your toy cars around the living room and crashing them into stuff? If you still do that then welcome to your dream film! There are things to commend, however - the CG, while dominating almost every scene, is well done and director Timur Bekmambetov has a terrific eye for the amount of bloody violence shown on screen and how best to shoot it. There is a certain amount of enjoyment to be had, especially when the plot twist arrives and the film really seems to kick into gear but I can't help feeling that 'Wanted' is a massive disappointment, that it should have been a film to rival 'The Matrix' - something 'Wanted' desperately to be - but ends up as yet another wannabe. The reasons for the failure are quite simple: the wrong leading man, excessively silly action scenes and a plot with more holes in than Katie Price's range of knickers. What it needed was a bit more restraint, a brain to tell the inner-child that cars don't flip as easily as they do here and a brief shot of Jolie's wet butt shouldn't be the sole recommendation of a movie. Sadly, with 'Wanted' that's exactly what you do get but unless your taste in movies hasn't evolved since the time of your early teenage years then you'll probably find other films more worthy of your time.",6,0,2,3 April 2012
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," 'Walk Hard' should jog on - 42%
","I can't exactly remember why I bought this DVD many months ago. I think I may have been taken in by the trailer or noticed that this was the product of the same man behind 'Superbad', Judd Apatow. I do remember thinking how good it was that one of the most overlooked men in Hollywood, John C Reilly, finally had the lead in his own movie. Sadly, there was one thing I had forgotten. What exactly is the point in watching a movie spoofing the likes of 'Walk The Line' if you haven't yet seen 'Walk The Line'? However I suspect that even if I had, it would only have been slightly funnier. It felt too bizarre and contrite to be properly funny, despite Reilly's cracking performance.Reilly plays music legend Dewey Cox whose songs strike a chord with America in the early days of rock and roll. Cast out by his disapproving father (Raymond J Barry), Dewey finds himself on the road touring with his band and succumbing to a variety of temptations - drink, drugs and women all lead Dewey away from success on a road to Hell whilst his accidental murder of his brother Nate (Chip Hormess) continues to pray on Dewey's fragile state of mind. But through it all, his on-off relationship with backing singer Darlene (Jenna Fischer) is Dewey's best hope of tasting success once again.Reilly pretty much saves this movie from being a complete wash-out. He is loving every minute of 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story', stretching each cliché to breaking point and gaining maximum comic potential from each scene. Sadly, the film's humour is far too scatter-gun in nature to be consistently funny - a few scenes raise a faint titter but by and large, this was pretty disappointing. Most rock & roll stories are, by their very nature, excessive so no matter what lunacy happens on screen (pet giraffes, shooting acid with the Beatles, 22 kids and 14 step-kids and more besides), it's simply too ludicrous to be funny. Reilly is also pretty much on his own among the cast as well - Jack Black and Paul Rudd's cameos as Lennon & McCartney were genuinely funny as was Tim Meadows as Dewey's drug pushing band-mate Sam but everyone else overacts or is pretty unmemorable. Speaking of cameos, there are a wealth of famous faces in there but none of them are funny (other than those I've mentioned) and the last time I checked, this was supposed to be a comedy.I'm almost annoyed that 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' is such a waste of promising material and talent. It never seems to get beyond first gear, trundling along and minding its own business while this viewer waited for the mercifully short duration to go by. I did want to enjoy this but I simply couldn't - it's not funny enough and like other dreadful 'spoofs' being released lately ('Dance Flick' and the like), it feels too niche to appeal to most viewers. Perhaps if you've seen 'Walk The Line' or 'Ray' then maybe you'll see the funny side but if, like me, you haven't then I recommend looking elsewhere for a good old giggle.",4,1,4,6 October 2009
Ratatouille," Still tastes good but Pixar forgot to add the final ingredients - 75%
","As much as I love Pixar films (and believe me, I do), there is a nagging sense that nothing will top Brad Bird's superhero masterpiece 'The Incredibles'. 'Cars' gave it a good run for its money but I felt that it just wasn't as colourful, entertaining or fun as the adventures of Clan Incredible. Having said that, 'Cars' was a lot better than I was expecting despite having what I thought might have been a dodgy premise. Sadly, their latest effort reverses that trend - maybe I was expecting too much or maybe the premise was too bizarre to pull off but I just felt that there was something missing from this recipe.'Ratatouille' (pronounced 'rat-a-too-ee') introduces us to Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat with highly developed senses of smell and taste as well as a fascination for humans and the art of cooking. After a disaster which separates him from his family, Remy finds himself in Paris and at the doorstep to the famous French chef he idolises, Gusteau (Brad Garrett). But things aren't going well at Gusteau's restaurant - after a viciously cruel review by critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), the great chef has passed away and the restaurant staff are now bullied by fiery midget head chef Skinner (Ian Holm). Striking up an unusual partnership with the restaurant's garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano), Remy takes it upon himself to turn the fortunes of Gusteau around.It's not worth me talking about how beautiful this film looks - each Pixar picture gets better and better in terms of visual splendour and 'Ratatouille' is probably the best yet. In fact, the sheer processing power required for the chaotic final reel alone is enough to give me a migraine thinking about it! Paris at night shimmers with a wonderful glow and everything looks and feels as it should, as you'd expect. You'd also expect a top-notch vocal performance and indeed, 'Ratatouille' doesn't disappoint either. Holm is superb, almost unrecognisable as the main obstacle to Remy and Linguini's success. Even John Ratzenburger's obligatory appearance is well disguised - I had to look it up on IMDb to see who he played! It's also funny although not as funny as 'Cars' or as much fun as you-know-what. And this is where I feel things start to unravel. 'Ratatouille' has a highly unusual premise which I felt worked against it - it's just too weird for it to be credible enough to enjoy. The pace is a little slow in the middle and it is too long so younger children may find their attention drifting before the frenetic buzz of action before the end.I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy this film, nor that it is a bad movie. It's fantastic - a country mile better than almost any other non-Pixar animation you could think of, if you haven't already forgotten about the likes of 'Open Season' or 'Barnyard'. It's just that I didn't enjoy 'Ratatouille' as much as I thought I was going to. Maybe my expectations were impossibly high but for me, this film isn't as good as 'The Incredibles'. It is better than 'A Bug's Life' and 'Finding Nemo' but overall, I thought that they might have taken the foot off the gas a bit. I do hope Pixar aren't running out of ideas because they keep me entertained for endless hours. But dare I say it, are Pixar starting to rest of their laurels? A brilliant family film but not the strongest effort from the masters of modern animation.",7,1,2,4 November 2007
Tropic Thunder," Nearly but not quite - 72%
","I've always maintained that Ben Stiller has only ever made one great film, the increasingly dusty 'There's Something About Mary'. But given the amount of hype and good press behind this movie, maybe this was one that broke the mould. However, I wasn't so sure. You see, the whole 'actors-doing-their-parts-for-real' movie seems to come around every ten years or so - remember 'Galaxy Quest' and before that, 'Three Amigos'? So in truth, this is still a good movie but not the great side-splitting comedy I was expecting.Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, a fading action movie star drafted in to play the lead in a big-budget Vietnam war epic alongside low-grade comedy actor Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and multiple-award-winning method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr). After being dropped into the jungle by rookie director Damian Cockburn (Steve Coogan), a series of accidents leaves the stars together with rap star Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson) and up-and-coming actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) to fend for themselves. Convinced that they are still shooting a movie, they soon find themselves in real trouble when heavily-armed irate locals arrive.Given that Stiller is the brains behind the screenplay and the camera as well, it shouldn't be a surprise that the humour in 'Tropic Thunder' can get a little close to the knuckle at times. Whether it's the trouble with acting 'full retard' or scratching your head at Downey Jr blacking himself up, I sometimes felt a little uneasy. Not to say I didn't laugh because I did, though it isn't a riot from start to finish. The problem I had is that it's a film within a film that later becomes a film within a film within another film! The other problem is that Stiller isn't as funny as his co-stars - even a heavily disguised Tom Cruise is funnier, given that he's not known for his comic timing. It also badly loses its way towards the end plot wise and although the action scenes are exaggerated, there still isn't anything original in there worth getting excited about. 'Galaxy Quest' was funnier and more entertaining and that was back in 1999.Maybe I'm being unfair but I just felt that this wasn't the laugh-a-minute, all-action blast everyone was talking about. It's good for a night in with the lads and a few beers but seasoned movie-goers probably won't get much out of it. It ain't difficult to spoof a war movie and yet somehow, no-one has done it really well yet. This feels more like a loving tribute to the likes of 'Rambo' and 'Platoon' instead of the barbed parody it would like us to think it is. It even spoofs 'Heart Of Darkness', the documentary about the making of 'Apocolypse Now' but if you haven't seen that then what's the point? So has Stiller made his second great film? No but at least he gave this his all. It's good but hardly a classic but it will go down as another 'Dodgeball' or 'Starsky And Hutch' - a wasted opportunity if ever there was one. Try harder!",7,1,2,27 July 2009
Meet the Fockers," One-gag comedy - 52%
","I'm not normally one who watches sequels without watching the original but when your new flatmate (one of three) plugs in her DVD, why not go with the flow and enjoy what gets thrown in the tray? Thus, it was that I sat down and watched 'Meet The Fockers', the sequel to the enormously popular comedy 'Meet The Parents'. Stiller has never recaptured his form from his best film 'There's Something About Mary' but here, he is completely upstaged by three old timers, two pets and a baby.Stiller reprises as the bizarrely named Gaylord Focker, the hopeless klutz engaged to Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner). Her parents, former CIA agent Jack (Robert De Niro) and long-suffering mother Pam (Teri Polo), were 'met' in the first film so here, Gaylord takes his future in-laws (together with Pam's baby nephew Little Jack) and his future wife to meet his parents. But there is a problem. Obsessive Jack believes that Gay's father Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) is a high-flying lawyer and his mother Roz (Barbara Streisand) is a therapist but it isn't quite like that and to make matters worse, Dina discovers she's pregnant.In truth, 'Fockers' is a very undemanding sequel which is basic in its approach to humour and fairly low in its ambition. However, it does this with such skill and slapstick fun that you fairly quickly get swept up and enjoy it. 'Fockers' has so many gems that hit the target, such as the toilet battle between the Focker's dog and the Byrnes' cat. It certainly helps if you've seen 'Meet The Parents' (which I haven't) because I simply found each character too exaggerated to be really funny. And the humour is simple - people falling off chairs for no reason and frequent repetition of the name 'Focker'. But slapstick humour is a dying art and when it's done as well as it is here then you welcome it with open arms.Despite being the lead, Stiller rarely stretches beyond his 'wide-eyed loser' role. De Niro shows an unexpected comic flair as the buttoned-up, anally retentive father-in-law from Hell but Hoffman is his equal, visibly enjoying himself in screen as the polar opposite of Byrne. Streisand launches an unbelievable comeback as the kooky sex therapist and probably gets the acting nods because she simply hasn't done any for so long. 'Meet The Fockers' is a strictly low-brow affair but one with such enthusiasm and energy that you'd be hard-pressed not to be taken in by it. Funny and enjoyable but ultimately shallow and not that deep. Still, it's better than a Einstein glove-puppet...",5,1,2,14 June 2005
Drive," Stylish, brutal thriller with little actual driving - 82%
","Just occasionally, a film comes along and does its best to stump me. Not through a convoluted plot but more because I struggle to understand precisely what the film is trying to say. Maybe it's me being a bit thick but this is one film that works very hard to break free from normal Hollywood conventions and has me scratching my head. It's an easy film to admire - very well made, a killer electro-pop soundtrack and stacked with actors giving quality performances in a classic noir tale - but I can't help feel like I've missed something.Pretty-boy Ryan Gosling plays an unnamed stunt driver based in LA who doubles-up as a getaway driver for Hollywood's criminal element. Maintaining an air of enigmatic mystery, he begins a relationship with his neighbour, waitress Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son (Kaden Leos). But when the boy's father Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison, he identifies the driver as a fellow professional and ropes him in to help him with robbing a pawn shop. But it quickly descends into a violent battle of wits against mobsters Nino (Ron Perlman) and Bernie (Albert Brooks), a battle that the driver seems destined to lose...Anyone expecting a rip-off of 'The Fast & The Furious' will be deeply annoyed because 'Drive' is way more cerebral than any of that series. In fact, there aren't many driving sequences in the film although what is in there is brilliantly shot and have a old-fashioned, visceral feel to them. 'Drive' is more about the characters than the cars - take any of the scenes where Mulligan is making gooey-eyes at Gosling where dialogue is forsaken and stark lighting illuminates their faces like passing street-lights. Gosling does a grand job of playing the driver who switches between cool, calm professional to loving, surrogate father and the relationship between him and his neighbours is believable and organic. But Brooks is just as good, playing very much against type as the brutal gang boss who can seemingly turn anything into a weapon. There is an underlying dark current to the picture that clashes with the possible romance brewing as viciously as the driver deals with anyone who get in his way. His is a classic anti-hero and combined with the retro-sounding music and neon-pink opening credits, 'Drive' has a strong Eighties vibe to it that makes it feel reminiscent of other movies like 'Bullitt' and 'Vanishing Point'.Dark, brutal and as enigmatic as its lead, 'Drive' is a high-quality curio that never fails to let go of your attention. For example, there is a shot of Gosling in his car where he just sits there, sun setting behind him and it took a good few moments before I realised that I was holding my breathe with anticipation. I just wish that I was smart enough to fully appreciate it because the ending felt like an anti-climax and the violence felt grimly excessive at times, such as the scene in the lift. What I do appreciate is the film's undeniable style and look - director Nicolas Winding Refn has pulled out all the stops to fashion a film that has a gritty and yet still beautiful feel to it - as well as the cast who do a fantastic job and the soundtrack which is worth tracking down. But like a Booker Prize winning novel, I just wish I had a bit more smarts about me to 'get it'.",8,1,3,10 February 2014
P.S. I Love You," An emotive, implausible romantic movie with real chemistry - 76%
","My Better Half had been bugging me to go and watch this since it was released and yesterday, I finally relented. Mind you, I wasn't completely reluctant - this film has been receiving a great deal of good praise heaped upon and frankly, I was surprised it was still on at the cinema after being released ages ago so it must have been doing something right, I figured. And it does - this is a real emotional roller-coaster of a movie and is the first film I've seen in ages that has a real tangible chemistry between the two leads.Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler play Holly & Gerry Kennedy, a happily married couple of nine years struggling to make ends meet in a tiny apartment and limited income. When Gerry passes away due to a brain tumour, Holly's world falls apart and she becomes increasingly isolated and withdrawn from her mother (Kathy Bates) and her friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon). But a surprise letter on her birthday arrives from Gerry and it's the start of a long healing process as each letter arrives and helps her overcome her grief.Personally, I felt that the plot was too convoluted to be believable - whilst undeniably romantic, the timing of each delivery was simply too convenient. The camera also had an annoyingly shaky temperament, reminiscent of 'The Blair Witch Project' although nothing like as bad, which also put me off slightly. However, what cannot be denied is the powerful performance from Swank as the grieving widow failing to cope with her loss. Butler is also very good, totally different from his bare-chested machismo in '300'. The scenes between the two are far and away the most entertaining and the most plausible - my Better Half was laughing during the opening moments, claiming that they were just like us! And she was right - the chemistry between Butler and Swank is incredible and really makes the movie far better than it has any right to be. But away from the romance and tragedy, there are several lighter moments that also work well, though nothing gut-bustingly funny. Harry Connick Jr has the best lines, though Kudrow pushes him as the man-eating Denise.I wasn't expecting that much from this but 'P.S. I Love You' is a real gem of a film, providing laughs and tears in equal measures and is thoroughly recommended. It isn't often that a film can cover multiple genres and do them justice ('Shaun Of The Dead' is probably the best example I can think of) but this is a happy surprise. It's unconventional, brilliantly written and wonderfully shot - viewers not used to sweeping shots of rural Ireland are in for a treat. It's a shame the camera-work is unnecessarily wobbly and the supporting cast are largely anonymous - Gershon is barely noticeable next to Kudrow. But you'd be quite daft to miss this movie which deserves every bit of good praise heaped on it due to terrifically emotive performances from the leads, a romantic (if implausible) plot and genuinely amusing scenes. Maybe I should start listening to my Better Half a bit more...",7,1,2,3 February 2008
Stardust," A modern pantomime but without the wooden scenery or acting - 75%
","Having tried (and failed) to get my Better Half interested in the brilliant 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, I was somewhat surprised that she wanted to see this so badly. A number of our work colleagues had recommended it which is normally enough for us to catch a bus into town and head for the cinema but having missed it, she wasn't about to let the DVD go the same way. Feeling very much like an English version of 'The Princess Bride', it is a fantasy adventure with its tongue firmly in cheek but for those of us who prefer serious fantasy films, 'Stardust' might not satisfy those die-hard fans missing Peter Jackson's genius.The film introduces us to Tristan (Charlie Cox), a young man living in the English village of Wall which, unknown to most, borders a magical world called Stormhold. Watching a falling star with the object of his affection Victoria (Sienna Miller), Tristan promises to bring the star back to her to prove his love for her and sets off into Stormhold to bring it back. But unknowingly for him, the star is actually a beautiful woman called Yvaine (Claire Danes) whose life is in mortal danger. Pursued by an evil witch (Michelle Pfeffier) and a villainous prince (Mark Strong), Tristan finds that achieving the impossible is really quite difficult.Essentially, that's the plot in a nutshell but what I neglected to mention is that the story allows for a seemingly endless list of cameos that nearly puts 'Ocean's 13' to shame. Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, Rupert Everett, Dexter Fletcher, Mark Williams, Adam Buxton, David Walliams - admittedly, not all of them are household names but this is one of those films where you'll recognise (or think you recognise) almost every character in the film. Sadly, the biggest cameo is also the most unusual and the biggest let-down - Robert De Niro as Captain Shakespeare didn't really feel part of the story at all and, personally, was a bit of a disappointment. But what makes 'Stardust' work is that it covers all the bases for a decent family movie. It lacks the visceral brutality of 'Lord Of The Rings' but makes up for it with plenty of comic touches such as the collection of ghosts commentating on proceedings. There are one or two moments to scare them as well but that's why we hide behind the sofa, isn't it? 'Stardust' isn't perfect - the whole thing feels disjointed like it's merely a collection of scenes with different characters. In essence, this is a million-dollar pantomime complete with stereotypical villains and plenty of broo-ha-ha and if that's what you're looking then you probably couldn't do better. However, I will hold my hands up and confess that I am a serious fan of fantasy. I don't go to conventions and I don't believe that early Eighties nonsense like 'Red Sonja' are genre highlights. I just want a film that feels authentic and believable and in all honesty, the only films to do that are... you've guessed it, 'Lord Of The Rings'. A tad unfair, perhaps because 'Stardust' plays the same game with different rules. This is a fantasy film for those who don't like fantasy, for those who haven't the time or patience to cope with more weightier material. This is a film, then, for my Better Half.",7,2,2,17 March 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Stunning film but hindered by slow pacing and excessive duration - 86%
","Working yet again on Valentine's Day meant that I had to surprise my Better Half the following day and seeing as she'd been keen to see this, I bought two tickets and we went for it. Judging by the reviews, it seems a real Marmite picture - some love it while others hate it. In truth, it isn't as bad as some have said but this is a real achievement of a film. Everything from acting, direction, story and soundtrack is spot on but somehow, it just fails to come together. It felt like a pocket watch, relentlessly telling its story with absolutely no change in pace at all.At the end of the First World War in New Orleans, Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is born in unusual circumstances - his new-born frame has all the features of a eighty year old man. Abandoned by his father Thomas (Jason Flemyng), Benjamin is raised in a nursing house by the kindly Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) as an old man but soon, he becomes stronger, taller and the symptoms of his 'old age' start to reverse. As Benjamin Button grows younger, he meets and falls in love with a flame-haired young girl called Daisy (Cate Blanchett) and eventually, he sets out to discover more about life, the world and the people around him.Essentially 'Forrest Gump 2', 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' is one of the movies cleaning up during this awards season, at least if 'Slumdog Millionaire' wasn't. But it's easy to understand why - this is a true epic, lasting a bum-numbing 3 hours plus and covering some ninety years of (mostly) US history. And in case you were worried about the look of the thing (like me) then worry not. The sheer amount of effort that went into making the characters age was not wasted and not one character suffers as a result. Naturally, Pitt is getting all the plaudits but in truth, the entire cast is near flawless led by Blanchett, Henson and Jared Harris as Captain Mike. And all of the cast are helped by a stunning script that rarely lets your attention wonder, despite the excessive duration. However, it is very predictable - at no point does the script deviate from what you expect. But as a study of love, life and death then this will be hard to top.My problem, besides the over-long duration, was that it was way too predictable. Like a clock, you knew what was happening next and when it was going to happen. It reminded me of a car journey I once took in Scotland where we were following the coastline of various lochs and weaving around mountains, forests and white-water rivers. It was all very pretty and very enjoyable but it took us about five hours to get to where we were going, by which time I'd had enough. 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' is exactly like that. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand why it is getting awards and nominations and the like but if only it was better paced and more surprising, this would be a stone-cold classic. But it's still a great film that serious film fans would do well to watch - just make sure you go to the toilet first and stock up with snacks.",8,2,5,16 February 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Like a bag of sweets, kids will get more out of it than grown-ups - 64%
","Many accuse me of being a Pixar snob, biased towards the originators of feature-length CG films and dismissive of the works of others. On the face of it, this would appear to be sound. But there are Pixar films that are weaker than others ('Cars 2' springs instantly to mind) while many studios are catching Pixar up with efforts like 'Despicable Me' and 'The Lego Movie'. It isn't as cut-and-dry as they might imagine and lo, here was another film I was told would be a challenge to Pixar's previously unimpeachable dominance. While it might be a technical tour de force, it veers wildly from emotive family issues to a kung-fu kicking roast chicken and frankly, there is a lot of stuff that doesn't stick.In the sleepy Atlantic island haven of Swallow Falls, wannabe inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) has been testing his latest venture - a machine which can turn water into whatever food is programmed into it. But like his spray-on shoes and rat-bird hybrids, the prototype goes wrong and ends up blasting itself into the upper atmosphere. But to Flint's amazement, it begins raining food which delights the residents and the mayor (Bruce Campbell) in particular, who sees the bizarre climate as an opportunity to relaunch the island as a tourist destination. But Flint isn't happy - his disapproving father (James Caan) wishes Flint would simply work in his fishing tackle shop while Flint's attempts at wooing weather reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) are as disastrous as his inventions. As the greedy residents demand more from Flint's creation, the town is swamped with food falling from the sky and before long, Swallow Falls is in danger of being wiped from the map altogether and only Flint can save the day...'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' may be food-based fun for the little 'uns who love the idea of their house covered with ice-cream and burgers covering their school but where the film disappoints is when it comes to keeping adults entertained. And aside from casting Mr T as a cop, it did little to put a smile on my face. Most of the humour is derived from the madness on screen and to be honest, a lot of it doesn't look great either. Flint is a mass of hair, nose and flowing lab coat while his father is all eyebrow and meat. The whole thing looks like a cartoon which sounds obvious but compared to Pixar's output at the time ('Up' and before that, 'WALLE'), it looks quite primitive at times. Busy, full of colour and hyper-kinetic certainly but still primitive. The voice casting are also a let down - why do studio insist with flooding the cast of animated films with recognisable stars who never appear on screen and aren't right for the part? Only Campbell and Mr T shine as the rest of them fade into obscurity and to be honest, could have been anybody.Anyone can make a film that kids would enjoy (although an alarming number still get it wrong). Going to the pictures should be an occasion, seeing as decent family time is increasingly rare these days. The huge screen and volume, the enormous bag of pick-n-mix sweets and the giant Slushee you can dunk your head into - why shouldn't kids be entertained in cinemas? Trouble is, only Pixar seem to be able to create true family entertainment. A good family film will keep the kids quiet for a hour or two but a great one will hold the entire family in the palm of its hand and make you want to watch it together again. 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' isn't that great a movie, offering kids plenty to watch and probably some freaky dreams (I suspect I'll be dreaming about being chased by a giant hot-dog rolling down the street tonight) but next to nothing for the grown-ups. If you want a great family movie that isn't Pixar then feel free to watch Gru in 'Despicable Me' which still feels like a cartoon but at least Mum & Dad can have a laugh as well. As for me, I'll stick with... yep, those guys...",6,0,1,23 August 2014
Caddyshack," Below par - 52%
","Here's another one of those movies I'd seen years ago and fell in love with. But now, in the cold and harsh light of adulthood, I somehow find myself wondering what the fuss was about. It has its highlights but never feels like an actual movie, more like a series of golf-themed comic vignettes from the stars of the early Eighties. Speaking of which, I can think of few movies as dated as this one - it is as resolutely Eighties as Mr T, Joan Collins' shoulder pads and Kenny Loggins who (surprise, surprise) pops up on the soundtrack.Welcome to Bushwood Country Club, an exclusive resort with a golf course and spa facilities. Owner Judge Smails (Ted Knight) likes to maintain the club's high standards and is deeply put out when obnoxious new member Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) comes along for a round or two. But Smails has other concerns beside Czervik - a troublesome gopher continues to evade the best efforts of deranged grounds-keeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) while semi-pro Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) tries to teach young caddie Danny (Michael O'Keefe) a few lessons about life and love, possibly involving Smails' flightly niece Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan).'Caddyshack' is a frustrating film in many respects. The undoubted highlight is Murray's battle against the gopher which seems to be the only constant throughout the film. For example, I got the feeling from the opening that Danny the caddie would be the film's focus but as the film goes on, I got the feeling that the script lost interest in Danny and focused more on Webb and Czervik. And sadly, the film's fatal flaw lies in its pro- and antagonist - Knight is too stuck up but is nothing like as annoying as Dangerfield who you're supposed to root for, which is something I simply couldn't do. He delivers his lines way too fast and overacts as though its the only thing he knows what to do which I can believe. The true stars are Murray and Chase and personally, they aren't in it enough for me to enjoy the film any more.I have other issues with it as well - the comedy only really works in fits and starts and the main characters in the plot don't engage you in the same way that Murray and Chase's do. There isn't a real plot line in the movie which also doesn't help things and the humour is mostly childish and toilet-based. It also seems mildly sexist in its treatment of female characters and Dangerfield is a colossal waste of space - lots of people find him funny but I find him about as funny as a famine charity appeal. Maybe I enjoyed as a child because I was a child...",5,15,31,17 November 2011
The Piano," A brilliantly filmed and performed love story that's a bit different- 86%
","Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists.Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything.You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like 'Training Day' and 'Monster's Ball' both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in 'The Piano' is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself.It might not be everyone's cup of tea but 'The Piano' gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, 'The Piano' is just such a film.",9,3,7,10 May 2012
Shrek 2," A good laugh but not exactly a classic - 75%
","Thanks to the continuing brilliance of Pixar, the animated feature has enjoyed a huge resurgence of popularity recently, buoyed by jaw-dropping CG, decent scripts that strain to distance themselves from the overly-preachy Disney fairy tales of yore and a vocal cast to die for. But just as Disney dominated the market for decades, Pixar's dominance has been near-total. In fact, the only real pretender to the throne was Dreamworks' hugely successful 'Shrek' so it was no real surprise when this sequel duly arrived and did even better, despite Eddie Murphy's shameless scene-stealing.Picking up where the first film left off, ogres Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) return from their honeymoon to their swamp where Donkey (Murphy) has been squatting. But just as they are about to settle down, they are invited to Far Far Away by Fiona's human parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) who wish to toast the happy couple. Trouble is, they have no idea what has happened to Fiona or exactly who she has married and before long, the scheming king and a troublesome Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) are cooking up a whole load of trouble for our heroes in the shape of the not-so menacing Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas).Essentially 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner' in green, the plot isn't anything like as strong as it was in the first film although it is still an entertaining picture. Adapting the Pixar approach of appealing to young and not-so-young viewers, the movie is so crammed with characters and references that it's impossible to take it all in at the first viewing. But the references are very knowing, almost winking at you in a 'look how clever we are' fashion and to be honest, it started to grate after a while. Much like Murphy does, although his part is not as prevalent as before which is a relief. No, the true star of 'Shrek 2' is undoubtedly Banderas as Puss In Boots who expertly sends up his 'Zorro' persona with genuinely funny one-liners and a comic touch that the other characters seem to lack. Saunders, Cleese and Andrews are a disappointment but none more so than Rupert Everett as Prince Charming who is underused and not especially funny.'Shrek 2' has plenty of enthusiasm and energy but sadly, not enough ideas to make it a cast-iron classic. It's still quality entertainment and still much better than recent efforts ('Igor' and 'Space Chimps' spring to mind - avoid if you can) but still not enough to make Pixar worry just yet. As the franchise rumbles on to a third and eventually a fourth movie, one wonders if they've peaked too soon. The original 'Shrek' was different from the others, unburdened as it was by Disney's strict supervision and daring to be a little subversive - shackles that Pixar themselves have now broken free from. If anything, 'Shrek 2' is too conservative and not challenging enough. The story is pretty traditional shtick for animated features and the constant references (check out IMDb's trivia section to see what I mean) are only sporadically funny. I'd still recommend most Pixar films above this franchise - 'The Incredibles' is the most fun I've ever had watching an animated movie and 'Wall-E' is so good, I could wax lyrical all day long. But if Pixar's magic doesn't work on you then stick with 'Shrek' or 'Shrek 2'. It just needs a little more fairy dust sprinkled on it...",7,0,1,11 February 2009
Blood Diamond," The noisiest lecture I've ever seen but brilliant nonetheless - 90%
","Despite having been in my film collection for a long time, I can't really explain why I haven't watched this before now. The only other movie to suffer a similar limbo-like existence is 'Jackie Brown' which I left for so long that I traded it instead of watching it. Still, better late than never and with a film as great as this, I'm glad that I gave it a chance. Remembered mainly for Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, this is an extremely rare action in that it manages to both entertain and educate at exactly the same time. And yet somehow, it has maintained a quiet, under-the-radar aura that belies its quality.Welcome to Sierra Leone in 1999, where the rebel forces of the RUF - funded by the illegal trade in conflict diamonds - engage in a bloody civil war against the government. Amid the chaos, fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is separated from his wife and family and ordered to mine for diamonds by RUF commander Captain Poison (David Harewood). After uncovering a huge pink stone and burying it, Solomon is arrested and finds himself working alongside mercenary-with-a-past Daniel Archer (DiCaprio) and American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) in order to recover both the stone and his son, captured by Poison and brainwashed into becoming yet another child soldier.As I said, 'Blood Diamond' is an action film that works on many levels. Not only is it an explosive action film with war scenes reminiscent of stuff like 'Black Hawk Down' but it also acts as a strong message about the hidden costs of conflict diamonds and the ugly greed that captivates so many. Not only this but the acting in this movie is almost in a different league to other films in this genre - DiCaprio is simply brilliant (take it from someone who works with a lot of people from that part of the world - his accent is faultless) but he is matched every inch by Hounsou as the tortured everyman caught up in a seemingly endless nightmare. The storyline between Archer and Bowen was a tad predictable but other than that, this was an old-fashioned adventure movie with fantastic action sequences and lit up with quality in the casting.It might not be the easiest film to watch - the scenes of carnage brought by the RUF, especially, are savage and brutal - but like 'Black Hawk Down', this is a simply unmissable movie for any action fan. But by also highlighting the numerous problems with conflict diamonds and the terror they are responsible for, 'Blood Diamond' is a lot more effective at bringing the issue to your attention than any song by Kanye West. And also like 'Black Hawk Down', this movie seems to be rather under-rated and forgotten about for reasons I can only speculate on. This was nominated for five Oscars not that long ago and yet, I can't remember hearing anyone tell me how good this was. Maybe it's sitting in everyone else's film collection and they haven't got round to watching it yet. If so, take it from me - this is a magnificent film and one that you'll kick yourself for missing.",9,2,4,15 March 2011
Men in Black," Slick, polished and very entertaining - 76%
","With the third installment now out in cinemas, it seems like a lifetime ago that I went to the cinema to watch this. One thing that did strike me watching it today was how rough the CG looked but I suppose a Blu-Ray special edition can probably fix that. Other than that, there is very little I would change as this remains a highly enjoyable sci-fi comedy that isn't afraid of laughing at itself although it laughs too hard at times.Tommy Lee Jones plays K, an undercover agent with a mysterious organisation that monitors all alien activity on Earth and, if necessary, cleaning up the mess. So when cocky NYPD officer James Edwards (Will Smith) encounters an alien on the streets of New York, K takes it upon himself to recruit Edwards into MiB. But once Edwards has become the black-suited J, their section chief Z (Rip Torn) has an assignment for them - a nasty bug in the ungainly form of redneck farmer Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) has made his way to the Big Apple in order to wreck an intergalactic peace conference between warring species - a war that now has Earth in its sights.This isn't a movie to think about too much because all you'll find are plot holes. Instead, what you'll find is a damn good blockbuster with all the special effects, pyrotechnics and one-liners you'll need to satisfy most tastes. There's even a damsel in distress in the shapely form of Linda Fiorentino but what really makes 'Men In Black' stand out is its tongue-in-cheek nature - when a screen showing known alien activity appears and one of the subjects is Sylvester Stallone, you know that taking this seriously simply isn't an option. Jones has rarely been as good as he is here, maintaining a humourless and unflappable face at the digital chaos around him. Smith provides most of the laughs, as you'd expect, and his interplay with Jones is also good. It's almost a shame that the CG swamps everything else although it is looking a touch dated in places. The short aliens with the coffee and the little green one inside the dying old man do look somewhat crude these days, no doubt something that the new film is happy to address.My only real issues with 'Men In Black' are the all-too-short duration which crowbars the plot into place and which make the film feel rushed and the highly polished feel to the thing. Every scene, prop and line of dialogue feels sanitised as though director Barry Sonnenfeld went through about fifty takes of each shot until it felt right. MiB headquarters, for example, felt less like a busy hub of technical innovation and administration and more like a forgotten set from some Sixties sci-fi show. None of it felt genuine or real and suspension of belief was almost impossible. But as I said, that's what you get if you look at 'Men In Black' from a critic's point of view instead of a ticket-purchasing member of the audience, which I was all those years ago. This is still worth taking a look at because in terms of entertainment, 'Men In Black' does a perfectly good job and if nothing else, it is a humorous riposte to an all-too-often serious genre so if you're not bothered by the likes of 'The X Files' or 'Millennium' then give this a look.",7,0,0,6 June 2012
How to Train Your Dragon," A great film but better than 'Toy Story 3'? Really? - 82%
","I remember reading, with growing anger, about some dissenting voices during the last Oscar ceremony who were whinging about Pixar claiming the Best Animated Feature yet again with 'Toy Story 3'. They reckoned that this should have got it instead but having seen it, I can't really see what the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong - it does give Woody and co a good run for their money and this is probably the best Dreamworks animation produced so far. But by sticking too closely to the usual story lines these films adhere to, it just falls short of greatness.Young Viking Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) has a problem - actually, he has a few. He is a constant disappointment to his father Stoick (Gerard Butler) who is an enormous Viking warrior. He finds the love of his life Astrid (America Ferrera) is way out of his league. But worst of all, his village is plagued by dragons in all shapes and sizes. But after an encounter with a deadly Night Fury dragon, Hiccup quickly finds himself becoming friends with the beast. As time goes on, Hiccup discovers that everything he thought he knew about dragons is wrong but can they work together to combat the village's prejudices and an evil far greater than anyone imagined? Dreamworks do things a little differently to Pixar - for example, they get a stellar cast to do the voices whereas Pixar get the best voices to fit the part. Thankfully, 'How To Train Your Dragon' has a fairly small cast and they all do justice to the film. With the small cast, they probably had a few more pennies to spend on the animation which is truly beautiful. This is possibly where Dreamworks have the edge over their bitter rivals and honestly, this looks better than some non-animated movies. Water and fire look much wetter and hotter than they did in 'The Last Airbender' (which damning this film with faint praise) and I understand that the 3D is also much better. For my money, this is the best looking animation I've seen since 'WALL·E'.My gripes, in truth, are fairly trivial but they still distracted me somewhat. As my Scottish wife eloquently pointed out, the Scottish accents shouldn't have anything to do with Vikings from Norway and while I'm on the subject, the fact that adult Vikings spoke with a Scottish accent instead of a Californian accent like the children gave the impression of half-heartedness. The other let-down is the story which is yet another tale about a unlikely hero trying to be something they're not but after being true to himself, finds that he's more powerful than anyone supposed. In short, this is 'Kung Fu Panda' in a Nordic setting and if that's what you're looking for then great. This is a really good family film, full of all the fun and excitement you could wish for and comes highly recommended. However, I just wanted it to move me like Pixar can and it didn't. But like I said, this is still a very good movie and one which you'll enjoy if you catch it.",8,1,1,2 November 2011
Pretty Woman," A romantic pantomime with real chemistry at its heart - 85%
","Rom-coms are, generally speaking, not a great genre favourite of mine. It may be a tricky balance by having to have both comedy and romantic elements but there are a dozen examples I could name that fail on either one or both counts - 'The Accidental Husband', '27 Dresses', 'Fifty First Dates', 'Never Been Kissed', 'Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason' and so on. Being married, it is almost inevitable that I will watch a romantic comedy at some point but occasionally, she picks an absolute corker and I'm delighted to add this movie onto the 'good' pile. It might not be a realistic picture in any meaningful sense but as a pantomime, this is as good as it gets.Richard Gere plays corporate shark Edward Lewis, hugely rich and successful and visiting LA to seal his latest acquisition. His personal life, however, is a mess and after borrowing his lawyer-friend Philip Stuckey's (Jason Alexander) Lotus and getting lost in Beverly Hills, he meets hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts) and asks her for directions. Thus begins an unusual arrangement where Vivian agrees to spend the week as Edward's escort for $3000. While Edward struggles with his increasing attraction to Vivian, she struggles for acceptance amid the high-society she now finds herself in.Despite being a pumpkin short of being a straight-up adaptation of 'Cinderella', 'Pretty Woman' is an unashamed romantic flight of fancy fuelled by conversations about nothing in particular and long stares full of meaning. As a fable, it is a winner but as a serious character study, the film is found wanting. Roberts never convinces as a prostitute at any point in the film, looking far too clean-cut and well-fed although she has plenty of sass and her biting back at the snobs around her is quite amusing as are her scenes with Hector Elizondo's hotel manager. Gere, for his part, has little to do but seem distant but available which is exactly what he is. But we never seem to find out why he is the way he is other than being focused on his career. Instead, we get snippets of personality such as the scene at the piano but nothing to explain why he likes playing it to complete strangers. It's maddeningly short when it comes to the details but then you remind yourself (and indeed, the movie itself does) that this is 'Cinderella' and like all fairy tales, they don't bear up to well to things like plot scrutiny. I never heard anyone voice the suggestion that Cinderella is the only person in the land with that particular shoe size...So this is one of those rare films where I can forgive the faults and just enjoy the damn thing. It isn't perfect - Roberts just isn't the right actress for the part and Gere needs a serious charisma transplant - but because it's a winning story, you can sit back and go with the flow. Whether its the romance with real chemistry from the leads or the battle-of-the-classes subplot, you buy into it in a way that most rom-coms can only dream of. Certainly my Better Half had that look on her face that said 'Go on, girl!' during certain scenes, although she prefers 'Dirty Dancing'. I can see where she's coming from - that too has problems at its heart but the soundtrack just about rescues that film for me personally. This is much more enjoyable but whatever you do, don't take it seriously and don't question the plot too much.",8,0,1,28 May 2013
Inside Man," Lee-Lite but still a damn fine movie all the same - 75%
","Being new to the work of Spike Lee, I do feel like someone who has turned up late to someone else's party. Like all movie fans, I was aware of his influence and importance to modern cinema but maybe I was scared off in some way - being a white English guy probably moved me out of his target audience. Thankfully, Lee decided to give us his most mass-appeal movie yet so the uninitiated like me can admire his work and trust me, I do admire this. A twisting and thrilling heist movie with brains to match, 'Inside Man' could well be a contender for the most under-rated movie since 'Road To Perdition'.Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, a master criminal who openly brags about planning the perfect bank robbery. At first, his plan works brilliantly - his gang commandeer the bank with ease and he sets his plan in motion. But it's not long before the cops arrive, led by Detectives Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who become ever-more determined to end the siege of the bank as the hostage crisis escalates. But it isn't as straight forward as that - the bank's owner Arthur Case (veteran Christopher Plummer) has some secrets buried deep in the vault and hires the mysterious Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). Has Russell pulled off the perfect heist or can the cops stop him? Absorbing and beautifully shot, 'Inside Man' shows a film-maker of real class at work. Everything from the quality of the performances (Plummer is simply great to watch) to the perfect subtlety of the soundtrack illustrates exactly how a film should look, sound and feel. Lee even manages to find time to squeeze a little humour from his stellar cast whilst simultaneously making some points on the nature of violence, racial tension and greed. Where I do feel 'Inside Man' comes undone is the final act where I found my belief in the story tested as credibility is stretched too far. There were too many unanswered questions for me in the end, I thought, and it left me feeling curiously unsatisfied. I did feel as though I'd watched a lesson in film-making from a master of the art but maybe the tale was too convoluted to be told successfully.It's a pity that 'Inside Man' loses its way towards the end because I can't recall the last time I was so impressed with a film. It draws you into its multi-layered story and doesn't let go for an instant. It is - rejoice - a taunt and tense thriller that actually delivers. If you wish to see how film-making should be done then I suggest you check this out. Ignore the 15-rating, though - the language is strong and frequent but assuming these things don't matter to you, I would happily recommend this utterly absorbing movie. Respect!",7,3,5,31 May 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," One marriage in real trouble - 53%
","Relationships can be tricky sometimes, as I'm sure you're aware. Take the uncommonly good-looking Mr Pitt, for example. While his relationship with the box office is stronger than ever, his relationship with critical success seems to have turned sour of late. Nowadays, he seems more concerned with being Brad Pitt than being an actual actor and who can blame him – it's not like he needs the money or anything! And that, ultimately, is the problem with this film, which will go down in history as the moment when Brad met Angelina (if these things matter to you at all). It's a shambolic waste of a good idea that runs out of steam before the end and the impressive action scenes are eclipsed by the off-screen antics of its two stars.Deep in an American suburb, a married couple have run into trouble. John Smith (Brad Pitt) and his wife Jane (Angelina Jolie) have lost the spark after five or six years of marriage and both have kept secrets from the other. Both of them are top assassins working for rival associations and have kept the other in the dark about their true profession. But once they encounter each other on the same job, they both have to face up to a choice that has always been there – do they remain professional and take the other out or can they resolve their differences and save their marriage?It is certainly different, despite the hackneyed implausibility of it all. It's like watching James Bond being married to one of Charlie's Angels and while it's intriguing, I don't really know if that's enough of an idea to sustain an entire movie. Pitt and Jolie sizzle as only they can and a few comic moments stand out but by and large, this is a really schizophrenic patchwork movie. The first half is pretty dull and the second half quickly descends into a bizarre supermarket-based shootout that doesn't feel as if it fits in somehow. There are good ideas here but they are completely obscured by the presence of Pitt and Jolie, who you never take seriously anyway. Jolie doesn't even look like a housewife, an aspect demonstrated in one scene in particular when she is left holding a baby and has a look of complete disdain on her face (how's that for irony?).I can't help but feel slightly disappointed, even though the warning signs were there. Plenty of DVDs on the 3-for-£18 shelf and a lack of credible reviews on the back on the box give the game away all too easy. It's not a bad film but it could have been brilliant and perhaps if the 'Brangelina' phenomenon hadn't been spawned behind the cameras, both might have been more focused on making this film much better. Actor couples rarely work on screen (remember 'Gigli' with 'Bennifer' or 'Days Of Thunder' with Cruise and Kidman?) and although this isn't the worst of examples, it does highlight what can happen when events off-screen prove more interesting than events on-screen. Only Vince Vaughn impresses in what is little more than a cameo because screen time is restricted due to the overwhelming presence of Pitt & Jolie. Basically, 'Mr & Mrs Smith' has only limited entertainment value and is not really worth spending your time or money on. Still, you get what you pay for – maybe I need to look harder on the 3-for-£18 shelf next time",5,0,3,7 May 2006
The Departed," Shows Guy Ritchie to be the amateur that he is - 93%
","Wow. Not since Michael's Mann 'Heat' has a movie surprised me with its brutal, visceral and completely enthralling vision of the eternal battle between good and evil and how it affects all of us, whether we want it to or not. I confess, this was my first Martin Scorsese film but I completely understand why this was the one that famously got him that long-awaited Best Director gong from Oscar. Suffice to say, this ain't gonna be my last Scorsese film either...Things are going pretty good for Boston crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). His gang of Irish hoodlums pretty much own the streets, his empire is secure and neither the police or the FBI can seemingly touch him. The reason for this is he has a mole working within the Boston police department, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). So senior detectives Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) decide to plant a mole inside Costello's gang, local officer Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio). But when both sides discover that they are being infiltrated, the race is on to not only bring Costello down but also just to survive.Normally, there are some things I can criticise about a movie. Even 'Pulp Fiction' (my personal favourite) has its flaws but the only one I can think of is the development of Vera Farmiga's character Madolyn, which felt a touch too contrite to be believable. Everything else is fantastic. The performances from the jaw-dropping cast, surely one that only Scorsese could assemble, are faultless. Nicholson looks to be having a ball as the vile Costello and quite frankly, it's great to see him back. The script never lets you go from the first scene through to the explosive finale and this sprawling, epic tale is told over an unexpectedly brilliantly soundtrack - just needed a few more Rolling Stones tracks for my tastes! And because this is Scorsese and you know through reputation that this is his yard, the whole thing feels horrifyingly authentic - not just the violence (which is brutal enough to satisfy any action film fan) but the feel of the thing. If it wasn't so entertaining and didn't have big name stars all over the place, you'd think you were watching a documentary and not a remake of Hong Kong classic 'Infernal Affairs'.This is probably the best gangster film to emerge since Scorsese's heyday in the Eighties and early Nineties and yet, nobody seems to be raving about 'The Departed' in the same way they were about 'Goodfellas'. I can only assume that this is for two reasons. The first is that they haven't bothered to see this because he hasn't made a good movie since 'Goodfellas' (apparently) and reasoned that this wouldn't be any good either. Fuggitabutit, this is the real deal - a welcome homecoming for a director who stuck to what he knew and came up trumps. The other reason why this film isn't getting the praise it should is due to age but given time, this will become a classic if it isn't one already. It is a movie of real, grade-A class and any doubts or questions you may have about it will be dispelled pretty quickly. Be a wise guy and go and see it.",10,2,5,20 February 2009
War of the Worlds," Disappointing sci-fi dross - 53%
","I like to think that most film audiences receive some sort of idea about whether they're likely to enjoy a film or not. In this regard, it is perhaps understandable that although I got the DVD for Christmas, I only felt the urge to watch this updated version of H.G. Wells' classic yesterday. Alien invasion films have been around for donkeys of years but 'War Of The Worlds' has that extra something, a deep-rooted sense of apocalyptic menace and hopelessness in the face of a superior enemy. I'm still traumatised by Jeff Wayne's musical version, which my Dad played for me as a kid and which may also play part of my reluctance to watch this film. But once you're used to the prevailing sense of doom, this is little more than a special effects-laden science-fiction horror but one with all the usual Spielberg sugar.Tom Cruise plays Ray, a New York dock worker with an estranged wife (Miranda Otto) and two kids who don't really get on with him (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin). After his wife drops the kids off before heading off to Boston, a strange storm captures everyone's attention. Before long, huge alien Tripods emerge from the ground and begin laying waste to everything and everyone, forcing Ray and the kids to flee in terror. As they join the large number of refugees, Ray struggles to keep his family together as the aliens continue their extermination of mankind.I always thought Spielberg was an odd choice for director for something like this. The material is too dark for him as this is as far from 'ET' as you can get. Personally, I would have liked to see David Cronenberg have a go but there you are. As it is, 'War Of The Worlds' is little more than the standard familial drama but set at the end of the world. And there is no doubt that the effects are spectacular as America is (yet again) witness to destruction on a massive scale. Imagine 'Twister' mixed with 'Independence Day' and you're not far off. But after the initial burst of the aliens arriving, the film sags badly as they rest in the basement of trigger-happy Tim Robbins and doesn't really pick up again until the final reel. As far as acting goes, nobody really has a great deal to do but the cast scream and feign fear well enough.It's a shame that despite the high production values and effort, there isn't really a great deal to enjoy. We've all seen endless films where mass-scale destruction is the order of the day, from 'Godzilla' to 'Independence Day' so watching New York getting torn up once more, there is a feeling of déjà vu. Something else that seems critically damaged was the script as there are massive gaps in logic and credibility, such as Ray finding the only car in the state that not only worked but also had the keys in the ignition and the horribly predictable ending which is so ridiculous that I immediately took a mark away on the score for that alone! 'War Of The Worlds' deserved to be much better than it actually is, although there are plenty of scares and the novel's famous sense of dread is thankfully intact. But the pacing and script needed much more work and the sheer amount of effects means you find yourself wondering how much of it is simply computer graphics and how much of it is 'real'. It's more of a technical showpiece than a movie classic and that's a real shame, given the strength of the story.",5,1,2,6 April 2006
The Reader," One of the best films of 2008 that's utterly captivating - 88%
","I've been let down before by DVDs that promised much but delivered very little, the most recent example being the decidedly average 'Duplicity'. Who hasn't? But honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this. Yes, Kate Winslet finally got her Best Actress nod from Oscar for her role but I was expecting another 'Training Day' - a meaty and very talky drama with all the crying and monologues that Hollywood's finest could muster. But this is so much more than that. It's thought-provoking, emotive and full of the heartbreaking characterisation that typifies Stephen Daldry's work.Berlin, 1995. A middle-aged Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) reminiscences about a long-ago love affair with a mysterious woman called Hanna Schmitz (Winslet). As the pair spend more time with each other, the young Michael (David Kross) finds himself reading to Hanna more and more before she strangely disappears, leaving him heart-broken. As the film progresses, Michael continues to remember the next time he saw Hanna - on trial for war crimes during the Second World War's Holocaust.It may be too Oscar-friendly for some but both my new wife and I found 'The Reader' to be a superb movie. Once the story begins, it's difficult to tear your eyes away from the screen as its loaded with so many talented and flawless performances that it is utterly believable. Winslet may have got the plaudits but Fiennes and Kross particularly are just as brilliant. What separates this from other war-based love stories is the rare opportunity to see the aftermath of conflict from the defeated side. Most Hollywood war films are excessively glamorised and heavily focused on the Allies. Mercifully, this isn't - it's dirty, grubby and anything but glamorous. The tipping point, for this viewer, came when Kross is walking between rows and rows of stolen shoes taken from Jews executed in the camps only for the camera to move and zoom out to reveal a staggering number of identical cages, equally stacked. This is one film, like 'Schlinder's List', that really hammers home the horrors of what happened during those dark days but crucially, it also deals with the collective conscience of a nation struggling to understand how they could be capable of shocking inhumanity.'The Reader' may have raised eyebrows with its explicit sex scenes (which aren't that gratuitous, to be fair) but it should have been talked about as one of the best films of last year. It's not easy to watch at times, largely due to the strength of the performances on show. A lot of films will be described as 'thought-provoking' but in this case, it is true - my wife and I spoke at length after the film finished about what we had seen, even discussing why the characters made the choices they did. I have never known any film to do that with this viewer or my wife but it perfectly demonstrates why 'The Reader' is an essential film and one of the best war-based love stories I've ever seen. First class film-making.",9,3,5,18 August 2009
Lord of War," Cage shines in a film that could have been brilliant - 70%
","One of many things my Better Half and I share is a deep-rooted respect for Nicolas Cage. Personally, I find it hard to think of a movie he's done that I haven't enjoyed in some way – whether he's in blockbuster action fluff like 'The Rock' or in seriously heavy dramas like 'Leaving Las Vegas'. OK, I can forgive anyone 'Con Air' and Hell, every rule has to be broken at some point. From the moment I first saw the trailer, I could tell that this wasn't Cage in wide-eyed Elvis mode. 'Lord Of War' is something that screams to be taken seriously, despite the near-the-knuckle humour and deep implausibility of it all. This is a very modern war film and an original one, delving into a world seldom explored in movies.Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian gun-runner who takes us on a journey from his early days living in America to his rise to the top of the pile. In the beginning, he trades Uzis to local gangsters with the help of his younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) but soon eclipses the efforts of his British idol, the veteran arms dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm). But for all of his money, he is morally bankrupt - his trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) is unaware of Yuri's other women, his son grows up without him, his brother descends into a drug-fuelled hell and the dubious nature of his business continues to eat at Yuri's soul. As if this wasn't enough, he is constantly forced to outwit federal agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who is getting ever closer to catching Yuri.While 'Lord Of War' is an excellent character study of a thoroughly disgusting human being, it isn't what I would call an entertaining film. It has a streak of wickedly black humour running through it but because the truth seems so improbable (at least, I hope it is) and because Yuri is so vile a person, you don't sympathise with him at all. Cage is typically brilliant as the slimy arms dealer and Hawke is a perfect foil for him. But the story is one that you rarely identify with, set in a world that is both horrifying and reprehensible. The fact that many do this for real - a fact hammered home by the end credits - and often with the blessing of their respective governments can't help but anger those of us with a conscious.'Lord Of War' strikes me as being one of those 'cult' movies that come along every now and again. It's not a laugh-a-minute and anyone who saw the trailer (like I did) may feel slightly disappointed (like I am). I do feel that the film was marketed as something that it wasn't - maybe the studios felt that a serious war movie with a moral ending wouldn't have made much at the box office. I noticed that no American studio would fund 'Lord Of War' and I wasn't surprised, given the US's current love for all things trigger-based. I respect the fact that this is a well-made, intelligent film but for me, I prefer something with a more overt anti-war message such as 'Black Hawk Down'. By comparison, 'Lord Of War' comes across as a darker version of 'Jerry Maguire' and to be honest, that's not what I'm looking in a war film.",6,0,2,21 June 2006
Music and Lyrics," Retro-feel romantic comedy that sticks doggedly to the formula - 60%
","Here in the UK at the moment, the pop charts seem to have been invaded by a vast collection of nubile, blonde young women grinding their hips and wearing not much. It's difficult for someone like me to keep track of them all but even harder to take them seriously as musical artistes. Trouble is, the other current trend is for various groups to reform and produce new stuff and unless rose-tinted spectacles are firmly in place, the Eighties weren't much better either. Beneath the facade of being a rom-com, this film offers a happy (if implausible) mix of the two featuring two stars who aren't exactly pushing their boundaries too far.Washed-up former pop star Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) has a comfortable existence living off the royalties from his Eighties heydays in Manhattan and occasionally performing small-scale gigs with his manager Chris Riley (Brad Garrett). But when he's recruited by current pop sensation Cora (Haley Bennett) to write a potential new single for her, Alex senses a possible comeback on the cards. But he has a problem - he cannot write decent lyrics but against Chris's decision, he brings in his gardener Sophie (Drew Barrymore) who has a gift for writing lyrics. But Sophie isn't without her own baggage...It's about as contrite as any rom-com you can think of and it's certainly not going to win any awards for unpredictability but 'Music And Lyrics' is a little different from the norm. The first thing that lifts the film is the music which perfectly captures the vacuous nature of Eighties pop music - the opening video, for example, is spot-on. Grant and Barrymore, whilst not exactly testing the limits of their acting, provide a decent enough couple on screen despite the plot not being believable at any point during the film. Sadly, the comedy is not frequent enough for the film to be anything more than a gentle titter, especially seeing as most of the film's humour is so obvious that Stevie Wonder could spot it a mile off. But both are supported by Garrett and Kristen Johnson as Sophie's sister Rhonda, though they struggle to escape their sit-com pasts.Yet despite its flaws and my preconceptions, I kinda enjoyed 'Music And Lyrics'. There are some laughs to be had and it has enough of the slushy stuff to keep your other half interested as well and it's this combination that makes it a half-decent rom-com. Sure, it's lightweight and utterly forgettable and I doubt anyone will remember it in ten or fifteen years time. But when I was watching it, I was recalling other rom-com films Grant & Barrymore have made over the years. 'Never Been Kissed', 'Two Weeks Notice', 'Lucky You', 'Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason' - I'd happily throw myself into the Atlantic with concrete shoes than watch any of those movies whereas 'Music And Lyrics' isn't anything like as bad. Rom-coms aren't really my thing and rarely score more than a six so this is a pretty good score, all things considered. Maybe music in the Eighties wasn't that bad after all.",6,0,0,23 September 2009
The Queen," Helen Mirren leads a faultless cast in an absorbing and unusual biopic - 85%
","Movies based on a true story usually fall into two categories. Those which can't fail to stir the spirit with a rousing tale of triumph over tragedy ('Alive', for example) and those which end up on some commercial cable channel in the middle of the afternoon. Movies based around living people are even rarer and even more hit-and-miss. But I'm happy to say that this is a real masterpiece, dominated by Helen Mirren and rightly so but it would be hugely amiss not to mention the rest of the cast who are pretty much faultless throughout.'The Queen' focuses on the week immediately after the death of Diana, Princess Of Wales in a car crash in 1997. The newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) leads the nation in their grief - primarily at the bidding of spin doctor Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley) - but the Queen (Mirren) is determined to keep things low-key and private, despite the increasing amount of public opinion against the Royal Family. As she struggles to hold her family together at Balmoral, she faces a crisis of confidence when she realises how badly she has handled matters.It may be fairly short but 'The Queen' is an astonishing piece of film. Based loosely around real events, it conjures up a mixture of fascination and sympathy for the Royal Family as well as memories of that fateful day. At no point is it tacky or intrusive - the crash itself is only partially seen and primarily made up of news reports from the time, making this almost seem like a documentary. A feeling amplified by the simply stunning cast. The only real (slight) disappointment is James Cromwell as Prince Phillip but the entire cast can look at this movie and be rightly proud of their performance. Mirren and Sheen match each other line from line, not only looking and sounding like their real-life counterparts but managing to evoke real sympathy for both characters. The scenes between Tony Blair and his anti-monarchy wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) arguing at home over the breakfast table are surreal to watch and I suspect that the character of Alastair Campbell was himself 'sexed up' to make him slimier and nastier in the movie than he was/is in real life.I honestly thought I wouldn't like this film but nothing makes me happier to be proved wrong on this occasion. It's not something that will grab the attention of everybody but for sheer acting brilliance, you'd be hard pressed to beat 'The Queen'. Being believable and captivating in equal measures is no easy feat for any 'true story' flick (though 'The Queen' is only half-based in fact) but with a killer screenplay and wonderful performances at every level, this is one movie that every serious film fan should watch. It won't be to everybody's taste (my Better Half found it slow and boring, though she too raved about the acting) but because it's so unusual to see these people on screen, talking about events that are still very much in the minds of the audience, it's remarkable how well the film pulls you in and refuses to let go. Good on you, ma'am!",8,1,2,12 July 2008
Amélie," Unusual and different but a classy romance in any language - 90%
","Subtitles, as I've said before, are either a passport or a barrier to the rest of the world - cinematically, at least. My Better Half, bless her cotton socks, cannot get along with subtitles whereas I find them much more agreeable and have no problems whatsoever. In short, you either love them or hate them and when they are found in a surreal movie with a quirky lead character then the chances are that many casual movie goers may be put off. But those of us with broader horizons will enjoy this modern and unusual love story with its wonderful cinematography, beautiful performances through the cast and a very strong Gallic flavour. It may as well wear a string of onions around its neck and smoke Gitannes.Audret Tautou plays Amelie, an innocent single woman living alone in Paris and working as a waitress. On hearing the news of the death of Diana, Princess Of Wales, Amelie accidentally discovers a hidden box of boys toys left by a previous occupant in her flat. Determined to return them to the rightful owner, Amelie decides that she will spend her life enriching those around her - from the down-trodden greengrocer's assistant (Jamel Debbouze) who serves her to the equally lonely artist living opposite her with brittle bones disease (Serge Merlin). But when she falls in love with the equally-odd Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), Amelie's scheming begins to get the better of her. Will she eventually be as happy as those whose lives she touches? 'Amelie' feels like a very traditional movie at its heart, filled with the usual rom-com moments we're used to seeing thousands of times before but this time, with a very French twist. The first thing that strikes you about this movie (besides the French narration) is the details that the story goes into, making the whole thing feel dream-like and surreal. This is the image of France that we'd like to see more of! Performances are superb across the board and Tautou deserved the increased exposure she has since received. But without a solid supporting cast, this could easily have been rubbish and 'Amelie' is not a rubbish film by any stretch. It also constantly surprises you as characters dissolve into water and shine like angels, almost as stunning as the imaginative and unconventional camera-work. It's difficult to stress how interesting and different this movie is from almost anything else you can think of, although it is easily the most 'French' movie I've seen since 'The Fifth Element' and only you, dear reader, know whether this is to your own tastes or not.I know a lot of people who will not like this film but quite frankly, they're missing out. This is a quality movie that challenges and delights in equal measures and if you give it a chance then I'm sure it will work its magic. It won't be to everybody's taste - I won't deny that - but 'Amelie' is an experience worth trying and sticking with. Proof that not all French films need Luc Besson or Jean Reno to succeed - this has more heart and intelligence in it than any Hollywood film I can think of and for that, we should all be grateful.",9,1,4,17 January 2008
Heat," An outstanding crime film and certified modern classic - 94%
","Man, it's been a long time since anything impressed me as much as this stunning film from the brilliant Michael Mann. For a director specialising in stylish crime flicks, this is a fantastic film from a man clearly at the very top of his game. If you thought 'Collateral' was good (and trust me, it is) then this will blow you away completely and not just because of the much-hyped meeting of Pacino and De Niro. It's searing realism and authenticity should mean that this remains one of finest examples of a cop thriller this generation has ever seen.'Heat' starts with the professional robbery of an armoured truck on the streets of LA which quickly turns into a triple homicide. Led by career criminal Neil McCauley (De Niro), they quickly regroup and prepare for the next big job - the one that will mean their retirement. But tracking them down is Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino), as driven and determined to catch them as McCauley is to see it through. As they each strive to gain the upper hand, their lives run parallel as each struggles with the demands of their partners and become ever more focused on their goal.Despite dominating the film between them, Pacino and De Niro are the chocolate sauce on top of a knickerbocker glory of acting talent (if you know what I mean). Career-bests from Tom Sizemore and Ashley Judd as well as able support from Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman... actually, to good through the entire cast would take too long but suffice to say that the casting is almost universally spot-on. Kilmer is shown up for what he really is next to the greatness that surrounds him but even he can't detract from what is a brilliantly written and sharply executed action crime thriller. Captivating from start to finish, it is almost refreshing to see a crime film that relies on brains and acting instead of bullet-ridden set pieces to see it through. Not that 'Heat' is a slow, plodding drama - the action sequences are some of the best I've seen, full of adrenaline and yet still able to tell a story without resorting to tired Hollywood clichés like a car chase or a fist-fight in front of some grand scenery in the background.I find it staggering that more films don't mimic 'Heat' more closely as this must be the template for future crime dramas in the years to come. Despite running for three hours, your attention never wavers and you're never entirely sure which heavyweight actor will come out on top. The confrontation in the diner between De Niro and Pacino is rightly recognised as a classic but it's just one scene of this faultless master-class. Assuming you're the forgiving sort and you can forget about Kilmer (who's merely OK instead of outstanding), 'Heat' is the sort of film that reminds you why you watch movies. No CG, no animated creatures from Middle Earth - just good, old-fashioned, proper movie-making. Mr Mann, I salute you!",10,1,3,17 August 2007
Jackie Brown," Everything in place but the magic - 73%
","For many years, this was the big one - the one that got away. As much as I enjoy Tarantino's movies, this one never really seemed to bother me much and so I was happy to give it a miss. I even bought it on DVD and traded it before I watched it. So using the benefits of a Sky+ box, I could finally give it a fair hearing but after all this time and given the fact that it is the follow-up to one of my favourite films of all time, could it really hope to compete? Taking his cue from riffing off other genres, 'Jackie Brown' is Tarantino's take of Seventies blaxploitation and introduces us to airline stewardess Jackie (Pam Grier), who should be doing better but finds herself increasingly held back by past mistakes. Her other source of income is running money for arms dealer Ordell (Samuel L Jackson) but things are about to take a turn for the worst. After being busted by ATF agent Nicolette (Michael Keaton), Jackie finds herself caught up in their plan to catch Ordell or face a long stretch behind bars. Trouble is, anyone double-crossing Ordell ends up dead pretty quick. But Jackie is a resourceful woman and begins making plans of her own, possibly involving her bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster)...There is technically nothing wrong with 'Jackie Brown'. Performances are universally brilliant - even Chris Tucker's brief appearance isn't annoying - and almost as good as the funk and soul mix of the soundtrack featuring legends like Bobby Womack, the Delfonics and Randy Crawford. The soundtrack, you expect to be faultless in a Tarantino flick but his usual antics of playing with the chronology are kept to a strict minimum which means any who didn't get 'Pulp Fiction' will not be confused by the plot here. The story, based on an Elmore Leonard novel, has the usual twists and turns but ultimately doesn't offer too much in the way of surprises which felt a little disappointing. But in truth, this is a great crime movie with brilliant performances and all to a fantastic soundtrack. What's not to like? Well, Tarantino's films have a reputation for being close to the edge, for pushing boundaries and taking things to the extreme but 'Jackie Brown' is none of this things. It feels too safe by Tarantino's standards as if he's afraid of offending anyone and as a result, it lacks the usual zing and verve of his other films. And while it keeps the Seventies vibe going, I never personally felt it was a blaxploitation tribute as strongly as 'Pulp Fiction' paid homage to crime thrillers. I wanted to be gripped but I only stuck with it for fear of losing the plot. It's an easy film to admire but a difficult one to love and to be honest, I just didn't feel the magic.",7,1,1,7 November 2011
Sin City," Disturbing, uncompromising, brilliant - 91%
","Every now and again, I stumble across a film that makes me wonder why I'm not into graphic novels more than I am. I'm not a huge fan of graphic novels but whenever I see things like 'Road To Perdition' or this simply amazing film from Robert Rodriguez, I can't help but think what I'm missing. Like his good buddy (and guest director) Quentin Tarantino and his best film, Rodriguez has fashioned a truly memorable picture out of multiple stories brought together in a black-as-Hell modern film noir and the result is pure gold. Already, I'm running out of superlatives and I haven't even explained why this film is essential viewing, providing you have the stomach for it.'Sin City' is set in Basin City and it is a dark and twisted place – the sort of urban nightmare where only the sick and the twisted live. Amid the darkness and perpetual rain, honest cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) refuses to retire until he's protected stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) from one of the true evils of the town. Over in Old Town, disturbed cop Dwight (Clive Owen) is plunged into a war between the ladies of the night – led by matriarch Gail (Rosario Dawson) – and the cops. And across town, the hulking man-monster Marv (Mickey Rourke) mourns for a dead prostitute, murdered beside him in his bed. But soon, his drive for revenge takes him on a blood-soaked journey through town to the very top and a farm on the outskirts of town, which has seen some truly vile crimes What is truly spectacular about this film is that it is, in every sense, the graphic novel filmed. Every shot is exactly as it was in Frank Miller's original and the vision is pure and true. And what a vision it is, an extraordinary ensemble cast led by Willis and a resurgent Rourke appear in what may well be the darkest film noir ever made. The black-and-white look also matches the graphic novel (complete with milk-white blood and occasional flashes of colour) and the whole thing is a joy to behold. It must be said that due to the strength of the source material, 'Sin City' is strictly adults only and a strong stomach is a must. Some of the scenes in this make 'Saw' look like a Disney production. Even without the film's stunning appearance, blacker-than-black humour and rock-solid scripting, every actor gives their role their all and boy, does it pay off. Owen is fantastic as Dwight and shows what he could have done had he got the Bond job ahead of Daniel Craig. But Rourke has never been better, tearing the place up like a hurricane in a trench coat but with a black sense of humour and a wry smile.This is, without a doubt, Rodriguez's opus – a film of such stunning brilliance that it is the equivalent of Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'. I know that sounds a bit much – 'Pulp Fiction' is still one of my favourite films ever – but the style and feel of the piece is very similar. It's blacker and more ambitious, using a bigger budget to great effect in bringing 'Sin City' to life. It's one of those rare movies that sticks in your mind and you remind yourself of key scenes or lines of killer dialogue (mainly Marv's) with a smile on your face. It isn't an easy film to watch, by any means, but it is a huge achievement and one that any fan of noir will kick themselves for missing. From the fantastic opening sequence where you struggle to keep your jaw from dropping, 'Sin City' remains a film of consistently high quality and should deserve to be remembered and treasured for a long time.",9,2,4,8 September 2006
True Romance," Great film or missed opportunity? Discuss - 77%
","Question: is this a great film or one of the biggest missed opportunities in movie history? Having heard both sides of the argument in recent days, it's little wonder that it has taken me the best part of a week after viewing to reach this conclusion (if you can call it that). Given that it has possibly one of the best casts ever assembled, a typically brash and brilliant script from Quentin Tarantino and a veteran of countless action movies at the helm, this really should have been one of the best films ever made and perhaps, if Tarantino had kept his hands on it, it might have been. Instead, we have an incredibly slick and entertaining crime film that I felt needed a bit more pace and consistency to become a true classic.In arguably his best film, Christian Slater plays Clarence who is an odd-beat loser working in a run-down comic shop in Detroit with an unhealthy interest in Elvis. After meeting the beautiful call-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette), they both fall hopelessly in love and the newly-motivated Clarence decides to free Alabama from the grip of her pimp Drexel (Gary Oldman). But stumbling across a suitcase full of cocaine, Clarence decides to take the drugs to Hollywood and fund their new lives together. But unfortunately, the Mob are hot on their heels and soon discover what our lovestruck heroes have planned...This really is classic Tarantino territory - a contemporary crime thriller with tonnes of funky dialogue, more big-name actors than the entire 'Oceans' trilogy and oodles of retro charm. And yet, 'True Romance' certainly doesn't feel like a Tarantino film - the pace is all wrong (it feels much slower than 'Pulp Fiction', despite being shorter in length) and dare I say it, I found myself losing interest. But just when I was about to give up, somebody new steps into shot and delivers another faultless performance. I have rarely seen acting of such quality from so many individuals, despite the fact that most are only in for a couple of scenes at best. Personally, I found James Gandolfini's portrayal of a Mob hit-man utterly convincing and it certainly ensured he'd be typecast for the rest of his career. Hell, even Val Kilmer doesn't suck! But all the time, I found myself wondering how truly brilliant this film might have been if Tarantino had never sold it. I understand his reasons why - I'd forgive almost anything for giving us 'Pulp Fiction' - but I feel Tony Scott didn't quite know what to do with it. Exhibit A - the ill-judged and misplaced scene on the roller-coaster.It's not that 'True Romance' is a bad film because it isn't and I'd happily watch it again sometime. But I just feel that Scott wasn't the right director, although he has worked miracles with the cast who are all supremely good. PBs for Kilmer, Slater and Arquette while Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper share one of the all-time great scenes like two giant beasts tearing each other to shreds. But 'True Romance' isn't the bone-fide classic some people think it is. It's too slow and the ending is far too predictable, ruining what should have been an absolute stonker of a movie. And it should have be - all the ingredients were in place with the exception of the director. So is this a great crime film or a wasted chance?

","Going over the last few movies I've seen, I noticed a worrying pattern. 'PS - I Love You', 'Monster's Ball' and 'The Horse Whisperer' are very female-friendly, dramatic movies with little room for light humour. So I was looking forward to this as nothing says 'light humour' more than tap-dancing penguins and once you get used to the rather unconventional set-up, 'Happy Feet' reveals itself to have a traditional fairy-tale at its heart and a stark ecological message wrapped around it. Oh and lots of funky musical numbers.Elijah Wood voices Mumble, a fluffy Emperor penguin who is unable to sing like all the other penguins in his community. His parents Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) try their best to encourage Mumble to sing but his real talent lays in tap-dancing which upsets the elders who then force Mumble into an icy exile. Stumbling across a group of Adelie penguins with Hispanic accents, Mumble finds his gift for dance is treasured instead of feared and his quest for acceptance is complete. But Mumble isn't content with that - determined to win the heart of Gloria (Brittany Murphy) and the acceptance of his own kind, Mumble and his new amigos are joined by Rockhopper penguin Lovelace (Robin Williams) in a quest to discover the reason for the shortage of fish which threatens the extinction of all life in the Antarctic.Like I said, it's an unusual world we're introduced into but once you're used to the sight of singing penguins and Broadway-style dance numbers, 'Happy Feet' has plenty to offer for viewers of all ages. Kids will love the fast-paced action scenes, the comic touches between the Adelie Amigos (primarily supplied by Robin Williams as Ramon) and the sheer energy and enthusiasm of Mumble as he taps, moonwalks and boogies his way through the film. Whether the message that being different is OK will go down is up to them - it's pretty much rammed down your throat from the off so only the stupid can miss it. Adults will appreciate the ecological moral of the story as well as the truly fantastic levels of animation. At times, it's impossible to tell what is live-action and what isn't - until the montage of bickering humans appeared, I thought it was all animated. It's so good that you forget its a cartoon and although I'm reluctant to admit it, it looks better than anything Pixar has so far produced including their latest effort 'WALL-E'.It might be 'The Ugly Ducking' on ice but 'Happy Feet' is as good a family film as I've seen in recent months. The music is superb and performed with reasonable competence though Murphy's voice cannot match that of Freddy Mercury during her version of 'Somebody To Love'. But unless you're in a straight-jacket, you'll find it impossible to stop yourself tapping your feet or even singing along with our feathered friends on screen. It's cute, it's smart and it looks absolutely fabulous. The only real issues I have are with character recognition - nearly all the penguins look the same with the exception of Mumble, Lovelace and the Amigos. The other problem is with Williams - voicing two characters in the same film was always going to lead to them sounding similar and throw in his trademark machine-gun delivery and it's very difficult to understand what he's actually saying - Ramon is practically incomprehensible though Lovelace is much clearer. But 'Happy Feet' is still a quality family film, filled with enough adventure, excitement and reflection to satisfy younger viewers and their parents.",8,2,2,3 March 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Boyle's best for many, many years - 90%
","A word of warning for those who like their Oscar winners - having seen it, I have to question whether this film is a deserved winner of eight Oscars. I don't think it's that good but this certainly is one of the best films of last year, fuelled by a fantastic story and frankly superb performances from every level of the cast and a director with a real passion not just for film-making but also the subject and setting. So it's a great film, OK? Just not a absolute time-defying classic.Newcomer Dev Patel plays the 18-year-old Jamal, a slum-dwelling street kid who gets onto Indian's version of the TV quiz show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. To everyone's amazement, he is just one question away from winning the jackpot when he is arrested at the request of the host (Bollywood legend Anil Kapoor) for cheating. Interogated by the police, Jamal explains how his life led to the answers through his childhood with brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and his pursuit of the love of his life, Latika (Freida Pinto).One thing I can confidently say is that 'Slumdog Millioanire' does for India what 'Lost In Translation' does for Japan - it immerses you so completely in the culture that you feel you're almost on holiday. Not that India is all curries and the Taj Mahal - you get a sense that this is the real India, undiluted and as raw as you'll find on film. Thank director Danny Boyle for maintaining his vision and keeping the film grounded in reality to such a degree that the various dream shots (slow-mo and staccato effects, of which there are plenty) don't interfere too much. The non-linear storyline may confuse those with a short attention span as will the subtitled Hindi but again, because the younger actors are flawless in the roles, it still holds your attention despite the jumps. And to those who say the story is too much of a fairy-tale to be believed, that's never been a problem in movies before. I've never heard anyone criticise 'Casablanca' for being too melodramatic or predictable, after all.It might not be the all-conquering movie-to-end-all-movies some of you may have expected but that doesn't stop 'Slumdog Millionaire' being an essential movie to watch. Boyle has fashioned an incredible film out of something that, on paper, really shouldn't work and that IS worthy of an Oscar. I was expecting more of a cheery Bollywood feel to it and aside from the closing number, there isn't any of that - Boyle did do 'Trainspotting', remember. But the best film are often the simplest and given the love and affection this picture earns from director to best boy, this is a film of class, colour and quality. It might not float your boat straight away but like a good chicken Madras, it slowly creeps up on you before blowing your head off. Brilliant.",9,2,8,14 September 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Like an extended episode, making this a fun outing for fans -83%
","What is it about 'The Simpsons' that has endured them to audiences the world over for the last twenty-something years? I suspect that instead of the deeply glamorous or perfect families normally seen on TV, the Simpsons and their various supporting cast are much more identifiable - everyone can relate to at least one character (personally, I know Comic Book Guy). It also offers a gentle sideswipe at US culture (or lack of it) and isn't afraid of picking targets, much like its imitators 'South Park' and 'Family Guy'. So after much delay and time wasted in development hell, this belated movie has a lot to live up to and especially considering that a lot of TV-based movies aren't that good. Thankfully, the seasoned pros behind 'The Simpsons Movie' have delivered a corker although at times, it does feel like an extended episode.Springfield is in crisis - the pollution in Lake Springfield is reaching dangerous levels of toxicity due to incessant dumping in the lake and despite the efforts of plucky Lisa (Yeardley Smith) to draw attention to the problem. After the town deciding that enough is enough, the dumping stops. But after Marge (Julie Kavner) orders him to dispose of a vast silo of pig waste that he left in the garden, Homer (Dan Castellaneta) desperately drops it into the lake and the resulting pollution forces President Schwarzenegger into dropping a vast dome over the whole of Springfield. Driven by the crazed EPA official Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks), the US Government soon decide to blow up Springfield and kill everyone in the dome - meaning that America's favourite family must flee from the angry mobs outside their home, prevent the destruction of the whole town and make Homer realise the error of his ways - which is harder than it sounds! The plot, naturally, is pretty far-fetched and doesn't offer as much as I was hoping - for example, can anyone tell me what happened to the pig once the Simpsons were on the run? In truth, this felt like a celebration of the show as characters old and new are in there somewhere, catchphrases are all present and correct (mostly) and the bigger screen allowed the animators to fully utilise CG and other technical toys so the film looks a lot smoother and more professional than the TV show. Vocal talent is as good as you'd expect from a cast performing the roles for so long - Kavner, in particular, is superb as Marge during a surprisingly emotive monologue. And rather than lapsing too much into self parody like 'Die Another Day', it retains enough composure to gently mock almost every aspect of American life like the public's apathy towards environmentalism, the media's insistence on sensationalism over reality and the rare success for the FBI when they actually get something right.But (and I'm afraid that it is a big one) it never pushes things too far like the shows that followed do. It's like it's afraid of offending anyone - the Simpsons have never been controversial since the early days when there was nothing else like it on TV. Now, the likes of 'Family Guy' and 'Team America: World Police' offer something with real teeth and a serious political agenda whereas the Simpsons remain firmly stuck in the family-friendly mould. It has undoubtedly lost some ground but the truth remains that this is still worthy of your attention. It's funny in its own way and if you're a fan then this movie will be right up your street. I did enjoy 'The Simpsons Movie' a great deal but find myself questioning why it took so long, why wasn't it a bit bolder and why was I slightly underwhelmed.",8,0,1,30 October 2012
The Wizard of Oz," Magical - 92%
","I have to say, first of all, that 'The Wizard Of Oz' simply isn't my sort of film at all. I thought it was too dated, too camp a musical (*shudders*) for me to enjoy at all. Oh, I understand how important a film it is and I understand why people do enjoy it but I just felt that it wasn't for me. So imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch this before Christmas, only to find that I DID enjoy this film very much indeed. A big slice of humble pie for me, I feel! Just in case you are completely ignorant about film and its long history, Judy Garland plays Dorothy Gale, an innocent farmer's daughter in Kansas whose best friend is her dog Toto. But her life is soon turned upside down when a vicious tornado lifts her home into the sky while she's still inside. When she wakes up, she finds herself in the mysteriously colourful land of Oz surrounded by dancing midgets and told by the Good Witch Of The North (Billie Burke) to visit the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan) in the Emerald City. Rather than questioning her sanity, Dorothy soon meets others needing to see the Wizard - a lion (Bert Lahr) without any courage, a scarecrow (Ray Bolger) needing a brain and a tin man (Jack Haley) needing a heart.It is strictly story-telling by numbers, almost pantomime in its delivery and the ending, though well known, feels like the precursor to soaps like 'Dallas' and 'Sunset Beach'. But even today, this still comes across as a massive leap forward for film-making - remember, this was originally released before the Second World War. The transition from sepia-toned Kansas to bright, dazzling Oz is a revelation and sets the tone for the film. Everything in this film raises the standard for films to follow, from the disturbing flying monkeys to the costumes and special effects. And although it naturally looks dated these days, this film is still something special to watch. It's akin to listening to the Beatles or the Sex Pistols for the first time - it doesn't sound as fresh as it did but you still understand why it made the impact it did at the time.I'm still of the opinion that this film is too camp and colourful a musical (*shudders*) for me to enjoy fully but if you enjoy a feel-good classic then you should either watch this film as soon as possible or you will have already seen it. It is undeniably a landmark film and one that should be appreciated as much today as it was then. It isn't for everybody - any fans of stuff like 'The Terminator' or Steven Seagal are unlikely to get much from this - but if it melts the cynical old heart of a curmudgeon like myself then maybe, it can for you too. 'The Wizard of Oz' is simply movie magic, end of story.",9,2,4,18 January 2006
Dodgeball," Patchy effort lit up by show-stealing Rip Torn - 65%
","I always felt that this was one of those films that looked funny in the trailers but was actually a load of rubbish. Sport-based films tend to follow a very strict plot line and structure and this is their fatal flaw - an actual game where the underdogs win is genuinely exciting whereas the opposite is true if shown in movies. Increasingly, sport movies rely on comedy to help them through and 'Dodgeball' is yet another of these tactless, in-yer-face comedies that are about as PC as Bernard Manning at a Women's Institute meeting. But sadly, it isn't as funny as it wants to be and is saved from total ignorance by a blistering performance from a veteran actor in a supporting role.Vince Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur, a regular everyman running a dilapidated gym called Average Joes opposite the corporate mega-structure of White Goodman's (Ben Stiller) Globo Gym. When Globo Gym threaten to take Average Joes over, Peter and his plucky group of losers find themselves entering a dodgeball competition in order to secure the prize money needed to keep them in business. But ego-maniacal fitness freak White is determined to get his way and enters his own team in the tournament. And given that both guys are chasing corporate lawyer Kate (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor), the clash is given an extra edge.Given that this is the basic plot, you can probably see the movie's ending from here. In fact, the film very nearly falls apart midway through as it just gets sillier and sillier the longer it goes on and it's not that clever to begin with. 'Dodgeball' is, at times, an idiotic incoherent mess that does nothing new or remarkable at all, despite a few glimpses of genuine laughs. So why isn't it a total failure, I hear you cry. Well, it's all down to Rip Torn's hilarious appearance as wheelchair-bound veteran dodgeball coach Patches O'Houlihan who has all the best lines, the best put-downs ('You're about as useful as a c***-flavoured lollipop') and all the best scenes. He easily steals the film and when he's not there, the film really suffers although Stiller is also good as the obnoxious Goodman.With a tighter script and more consistent laughs, this could have been fabulous. But being kept firmly on the sports-plot railroad merely adds to the film's problems. It's daft and only sporadically funny, relying on Rip Torn to carry it through. Like 'Anchorman', it can't maintain the humour right the way through and by the time the film ends, the whole thing feels cobbled together rather amateurishly. It's a great pity because Rip Torn is simply brilliant in 'Dodgeball' and probably deserves his own show. But nothing else can keep up with him. Even if you're familiar with the 'sport' of dodgeball (which we aren't in the UK), this film won't completely bowl you over. 'Dodgeball' - you're out!",6,0,1,19 May 2006
The Island," Schizonphrenic sci-fi actioner that ultimately disappoints - 62%
","Ever since 'Minority Report' brought the science back into sci-fi, there seems to be a shift away from the mindless dross that has plagued us for the last few years into more thought-provoking, intelligent dramas. However, director Michael Bay is not known for thought-provoking or intelligent films and at least he has a real go with this. But sometimes mixing brawn with brains isn't necessarily the way to go and I do feel that this film is part water and part oil. Let me explain.Ewan McGregor plays Lincoln Six Echo, a young man living in a strange community where everyone wears the same clothes and there is a 'Big Brother' thing going on. Aside from being utterly suppressed in every way, Lincoln's only respite comes in the beautiful form of Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) and his jittery companion Jones Three Echo (Ethan 'Nelix' Phillips). Told that the outside world has been contaminated, their sole aim is to win the lottery prize of going to the Island - the last contamination-free part of the world - and repopulating the human race. Sounds good, right? Only Lincoln isn't so sure and desperate to uncover the truth, he finds that the god-like Dr Merrick (Sean Bean) has more terrible secrets than he ever imagined, forcing Lincoln and Jordan to go on the run.To say any more would give the game away but needless to say, the plot twists one way and another. The film certainly looks the business though I'd like to think that the future is more advanced than hovering trains, flying highways and relentless product placement. McGregor and Johansson provide a solid leading pair but once the story really gets going, it's almost as though they lose enthusiasm. When the action kicks in, the characters seem to take a back seat as the whole thing descends into car chases and gun fights. Oh dear. Bay's instinct for action remains undiminished (he even recreates the car chase from 'Bad Boys 2', substituting cars for train wheels) but it doesn't really fit in with what has gone before it. In truth, the action didn't really get the blood pumping as one would have hoped - in fact, the closest my heart came to skipping a beat was when you first see the Cadillac Cien concept car and that was largely due to excess speeds racing the thing on 'Gran Turismo 4' on my PS2.And ultimately, this is the problem with 'The Island'. It takes a long time to get going and when it does, it never fully engages with the viewer. While it doesn't do anything wrong, it never really stretches itself to the degree you'd hope it would. Personally, I felt that the scenes before the chase begins were actually the strongest and there was still much to explore in that regard instead of resorting to tired action clichés that Bay knows off by heart. Instead of creating a credible and commendable sci-fi film, Bay spends the whole film trying to make another 'Bad Boys' but then again, what did you expect from the director of the cursed 'Armageddon'? This could have been something special but in the end, chalk up yet another wasted opportunity. Ho-hum.",6,1,3,27 March 2007
