Requiem for a Dream," Drugstore Cowboy did it better...
","I must admit that I was somewhat surprised to see that this film is rated at #46 (at time of writing) in the IMDB Top 250. While it was a good film, I don't think that it was powerful enough to rate so highly.Perhaps it's that there are relatively few drug-culture films around and that the viewer is not accustomed to the shock that the inevitable downward spiral finishes at. Or maybe it just got a much wider audience than many of those that came before it.In any case, the film is a good watch, but the highlight by far is the story of the mother and her obsession with dieting. I found myself drawn into her story far more than that of the other three characters.Overall, I'd give this 7/10. If you liked this, check out Drugstore Cowboy - I think they did it better...",7,5,8,20 November 2003
Minority Report," Thought provoking but a couple of minor flaws
","I was impressed with this adaptation of a short story by Phillip K.Dick. The story is thought provoking and complex, and leaves anumber of ethical and philosophical questions for the viewer todiscuss long after the movie has finished.On the whole, the movie was very solid, but there were a couple offlaws that I found a little glaring.In any case I would highly recommend this film.SPOILERS BELOW!!!!One of the things that bothered me the most about this film wasthe fact that Tom Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) had beenaccused of the future murder of another man, yet still retainedsecurity access to pre-crime headquarters and even to themaximum security prison for future criminals. I would have thoughtit a matter of course that his access rights would be revoked assoon as he became a suspect, though it it possible that hisaccess was 'arranged' due to other elements of the story. Still, Ifound it a little difficult to imagine that such a  'Big Brother' societywould miss this fairly important security step.",8,0,0,23 June 2002
The Mummy Returns," An enjoyable ride on the coat-tails of the first
","I didn't really know what to expect from The Mummy Returns. On one hand, it had the potential to be a work of art, taking what was built from the original movie and adding to it. On the other hand, it could be another tired rehash of the same film. In the end it was a bit of both.The film certainly looks very nice. The special effects (with the exception of the Scorpion King) are superb and really convey a sense of power. Imhotep and his effects are handled very nicely.There is very little, if any, character development in the film. That said, a lot of background information left out of the original is provided and some questions about the first film are answered. This is a lot of fun for those who like tie-ins to other films. However, a lot of the jokes used in the original are reused here (homage, or rehash?)The plot premise is believable and the scriptwriters did a good job of providing everyone with a reason to be in the film. Plot inconsistencies are rare. I've seen a lot worse lately (e.g. Red Planet).If you're an action fan, look no further. This film is non-stop. In fact, there's almost too much of it. We don't get the chance to stop and take a breather for much of the film. Unfortunately, that means that the journey is largely glossed over in favour of hacking and slaying (not that that's a bad thing).Overall I felt that it was a good film, provided that you've seen the original. Those seeing this alone will probably not get as much out of it. 7/10",7,0,0,13 May 2001
Shrek," Adult comedy you can take the kids to!
","Shrek is not just a kids film - don't be fooled by the rating. It's extremely funny and entertaining for audiences of all ages. Like the Simpsons, the kids will enjoy it a lot, but will have more than a few jokes go over their heads.Simply put, this is a classic fairy tale with a wicked twist. You'll see a lot of classic characters in there, but not in the way that you might think. One of the great things about the film is seeing just what they've done with all of the classic fairy tales to fit them in.The performances by all 4 main voice-actors were excellent (Eddie Murphy being the jewel in the crown) and the graphics were amazing.  I don't know if I should really say any more than that - I don't want to give anything away!It should really come as no surprise that this film is doing so well and is _killing_ Pearl Harbour at the box office. Hollywood needs to take a long hard look at this film and work out what the rest of their scriptwriters should be aiming at. See",10,0,0,23 June 2001
