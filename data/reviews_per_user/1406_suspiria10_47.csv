Saturday Night Fever," S10 Reviews: Saturday Night Fever (1977)
","Tony Manero (John Travolta) is 'Tres Cool' spending his days at the local Brooklyn paint shop slaving away and supporting his parents and siblings. But when the sun goes down he puts on his polyester leisure suit, throws on his chains and spruces up his platform shoes to head down to the local discothèque where every woman wants him and every man wants to be him. There he is the king of the night-time world. Manero and his hoodlum friends aren't all that nice but they ooze gutter cool when the mirror ball starts to spin.I am not fond of disco music so I figured I would hate the film with a passion. But I was wrong. 'Saturday Night Live' is now like a time-capsule of the late 70's music scene which is surprisingly interesting. Travolta does a great job of making his flawed and ultimately unlikable character, likable. The production is a flashy musical-hybrid at it's' roots but it has a surprising dramatic sophistication when you see Manero working his way through the mess of his life. Obviously a movie about disco can't be made without it. So I forgive them that fact. But I won't be getting the soundtrack. Can you dig it?",7,0,1,23 April 2005
Mission: Impossible III," S10 Reviews: Mission: Impossible III(12006)
","Ethan Hunt (the returning couch grinder Tom Cruise) returns now retired from field work and teaching newbie's the art of the spy game. But when his first student finds herself off the grid and captured Hunt is brought back in to help rescue her. But the plot grows deeper still as a nasty arms smuggler (Philip Seymour Hoffman) emerges and takes a serious disliking to Ethan and uses Hunt's status as a new hubby to get what he wants from him. Big mistake! J.J. Abrams (Alias) takes over the director reigns in this action packed installment of the franchise. The production may have had trouble getting off the ground but the third time is the charm and it makes for a good, solid start to the 2006 summer movie season. Not as outlandish as the second part or as dry as the original, M:I III manages to beat out the previous two installments with better acting and refining the action down to the finer points of popcorn munching cinema. 4 of 5",8,0,2,6 May 2006
The Ring," Awesome Creepfest!
","I just got back from the theatre and must say WOW... This is one of the best horror films to come out in a while. In the end it almost doesn't seem fair to brand it with a horror label. Under the surface their is so much more at work. It's more like a murder/ mystery, heavy on suspense and loaded with chills. Heavy atmosphere and nightmare sequences that would send anyone over a cliff. Bravo to all those involved this is a excellent remake and I hope to see this story continue.",Null,0,0,18 October 2002
Star Trek," Star Trek (2009)
","Star Trek (2009) Rating4 / 5 GenreScience Fiction, Redux, Classic TV DirectorJ. J. Abrams StarsChris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Leonard Nimoy, Eric Bana, Bruce Greenwood, Karl Urban. Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Ben Cross, Winona Ryder SynopsisA distress call from the planet of Vulcan sends Starfleet into action as the newly launched USS Enterprise lead by Captain Pike (Greenwood) attempt to head off a Romulan menace (Bana) hell-bent on destroying the United Federation of Planetsplanet by planet.ThoughtsProducer / Director J.J. Abrams (producer of Lost, Fringe, Alias and Cloverfield) was given the unenviable task of bringing the Star Trek brand back to the big screen. Nothing could be a harder, more daunting task than trying to please a roomful of Trek fans while attempting to draw a new generation into the fold. But Abrams was a wise choice will the success of the great Lost series (and the up and coming Fringe), Abrams has established a knack for cerebral science fiction like few have in the last decade or more. With the new Star Trek adventure Abrams and his technical crew have managed to pull off a story that is a sequel and a prequel not to mention a relaunch of the long running series that can now even break new territory while being respectful of the classic voyages of yesterday. I think even the late Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry would be impressed. The smart storyline evolves in such a way that they managed to pull off and bring in Leonard Nimoy for one last appearance as the pointy-eared, neck-pincher Spock (still my favorite Trek universe character). Now came the hard part. The job to assign new faces to the roles of the original series must have been amazingly tough and for the most part the producers pull it off surprisingly well. The holy trinity of Kirk, Spock and McCoy (the heart of the series) could have easily sent the project down in flames quickly but Chris Pine (Just My Luck, Smokin' Aces) manages to channel the cockiness and spirit of William Shatner's Kirk while taking the role and making it his own. Zachary Quinto certainly pulls off Spock's look and mannerisms even though he is a bit off sounding like him (Nimoy, who has done narration for many projects in the past has an unmistakable voice) but for me Karl Urban (with many genre projects already under his belt such as The Lord of the Rings) did old Bones so convincingly that it gave me flashbacks and a huge smile. With the main trio locked down next came the second tier characters the new Scotty (Pegg of Shaun of the Dead and Spaced) is spot-on and as funny as ever. Zoe Saldana (Guess Who, The Terminal) makes the role of communications officer Uhura her own and is uber-sexy doing it too. John Cho (of Harold and Kumar fame) and Anton Yelchin (Terminator: Salvation, Alpha Dog) round out the cast as Sulu and Chekov, Cho certainly looked the part but again he wasn't able to give his Sulu the unmistakable George Takai voice. Chekov was for me the only sore spot in the casting. Yelchin just didn't do it for me. He didn't look like Walter Koenig at all and his accent was horrible. While the production design was excellent minor things cropped up here and there. The CGI was plentiful and over-powering and ranged from the awe-inspiring to the ho-hum. Was the green cadet chick Kirk was macking a CGI effect. Either way it looked terrible. To round out the Trekker nit-picking, the music soundtrack was lacking. Even though the use of the original show's theme was excellent it lacked the memorable presence of the Jerry Goldsmith years.In ConclusionMinor quibbles (or is that Tribbles?) aside the new Star Trek has more-than-enough to please many of the most hardened of fans (my Mother even loved it). The end product is admirable and easily accessible by those new to the series and just a fun romp through the universe. They plotted the correct course and warp speed ahead.",8,3,11,9 May 2009
Akira," Akira (1988)
","Rating: 5 out of 5Genre: Anime, Science Fiction, Comic BookDirector: Katsuhiro ÔtomoStars: Mitsuo Iwata, Nozomu Sasaki, Mami Koyama, Tesshô Genda, Hiroshi Ôtake, Kôichi Kitamura, Michihiro Ikemizu, Yuriko Fuchizaki, Masaaki Ôkura, Tarô ArakawaSynopsis: Based on the beloved Manga comic 'Akira' takes place thirty-one years after the nuclear exchange of World War III, neo-Tokyo is beseeched by civil unrest and biker gangs. Kaneda, the leader of one such gang tries to help his friend Tetsuo after he gets mixed up in the Akira government project. The project involved the study and development of heightened brain functions. Thoughts: What can I say that hasn't been said before? 'Akira' is an absolute classic of Japanese anime and a benchmark. It may have not been America's first exposure to the popular genre but it certainly brought it out of the underground. I saw this first in high school and it blew me away. In Conclusion: This is the perfect place to begin if you are new to anime. Many agree that there is none better in the anime world and I'd be hard pressed to disagree. The new Blu Ray is phenomenal and a must for fans.",10,3,6,3 March 2009
Dawn of the Dead," When Hell Freezes Over...
","Wow what an awesome flick. I'm sorry I doubted them. If you thought the Chainsaw remake was good just wait until you see the light of Dawn. A ragtag group of survivors fortify their position in a spralling mall. They enjoy their surroundings while dealing with the Hell on earth around them. Sounds familiar huh... That pretty much ends the similarities. What you get is a somewhat high gloss but down and dirty re-imaginingof the sacred 1978 Romero classic, by a first time director and the scriptwriter of Scooby-Doo. Go figure.They succeed in making one of the best remakes I have seen and they deliver all the bloody good. ===possible spoilers=== Fast moving zombies, thousands and thousands of the undead and zombie babies to boot. Great cameos by Savini, Reiniger and it was so cool to hear Ken Foree say the lines that he made famous again. ===End Spoilers==== ...all that and a killer swing rendition of Disturbed'ssong The Sickness. The film pays homage very well to the Zombie classics of yore and bites out a chunk of its'own for the future. My only minor beef was that at times they relied a bittoo heavily on CGI, but the effects are done well and with such a solid cast and respectful and fanatic creators I enjoyed this totally. As a die hard fan of the original, I must say. Kudos guys and gals....you done good.",8,0,0,21 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," S10 Reviews: Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp channeling Keith Richards), a deposed and left for dead pirate joins blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on the hunt for the cursed Black Pearl, Jack's former ship until his lecherous first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wrestled it away from him and left him stranded on an island. Jack wants his ship; Will wants the jewel of his eye the lovely Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) now held captive by the scurvy Barbossa. But these mean hombres are a bit harder to crack than usually thanks to a nifty curse that turns them into the undead. Arrrr! It seems that Walt Disney Company somehow had gotten their memos crossed when they sent 'Pirates' sailing into production (the ride comes AFTER the film, not before). But no matter what is cranked out by the Bruckheimer machine is a fun romp through the spray of the Caribbean. Director Verbinski (hot off success with 'The Ring') creates an action packed walk down the plank that occasionally gets a bit long in the tooth but you know the next big sequence is right around the corner. A lot of nifty effects (the dead crew of the Black Pearl for instance) round out a nicely created production and design. On the acting front while Knightley and Bloom are fine in their roles Depp (as often is the case) steals the show as the staggering Jack whose a crafty sort but more lucky than anything. Rush chews the scenery in his own right leading up to a knock-down, drag-out with Sparrow. Good fun for the family, just keep your hands in the car.",8,0,4,8 July 2006

","Two American friends and an Icelandic buddy take a backpack tour of Europe before settling down to the rigors of grad school. Their constant pursuit of booze, babes and dope in Amsterdam cross their paths with a local who tells them of a hostel in Slovakia where the women are amazing and do it all. When they get to Slovakia it is everything they had wished for. But when the group starts disappearing it becomes clear that something devious is going on and their little slice of heaven becomes hell.'Hostel' is a very decent follow-up to the director's debut 'Cabin Fever'. It does take a bit of time before the action really kicks in but one may be distracted by the ample flesh to not take too much notice to it. The ending is nice and sick with a nice amount of gore. There's even a tense bit or two.

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010)Director: Mike Newell Stars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, Ben KingsleyThe titular prince (Gyllenhaal) is a wanted man after being accused of murdering his own adoptive father following the siege of a hallowed city. Now on the run, the prince and the princess (Arterton) of the conquered city must protect a special dagger which has the ability to affect time and destroy the world.Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney looked to fill holes in their blockbuster schedule in between 'National Treasure' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' with this video game inspired initial salvo. But its lackluster box office may have put a damper on their plans. This expensive adventure film has some decent moments. It occasionally conjures up the epic scope of say a 'Lawrence of Arabia' and the adventure of 'Indiana Jones' and quirkiness of the aforementioned 'Pirates' series. But that's kind of the problem. The feeling we've seen it before. Director Newell does what he will with the script being a graduate from the Hogwarts' directing chair so you know he has experience in big screen fantasy. The overabundant CGI set-pieces now smack of 3D gimmickry which just ends up worsening those aspects of the film. All in all 'Prince' is an OK popcorn muncher but just like it is when you get to the bottom of the bucket the last few kernels are a bit stale and leave you wanting a fresh bucket, oh and you really need to go.

Oldboy," S10 Reviews: Oldboy (2003)
","Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) one day on his daughter's 3rd birthday gets picked up for a drunk-and-disorderly charge. When a friend comes to bail him out his life takes a bit of a strange detour that has him kidnapped by anonymous cretins who put him away for 15 years. During his 15 years of captivity Dae-su manages keep track of the outside world through television while the captors do weird things to him. One day he is just set free and he will need to find the answers he needs and the vengeance he craves all while finding the remnants of his shattered life.This crazy Korean flick has had the scene abuzz for months and after viewing it I see why. 'Oldboy' is a pretty twisted take on a standard 'You done me wrong' style revenge flick that will keep you engaged and on your toes to the end. 'Oldboy' is wonderfully shot from its maniacally paced action scenes to the New Zealand landscape in the finale. Min-sik Choi does an amazing job in the lead. He runs practically the whole gamut of human emotion, all in a hyper-convincing matter. You can't help but feel for the guy when he finally gets all the answers and the plot gets uber-evil. A must see for Asian enthusiasts and for exploitation fans alike. The ending is way twisted and one wonders how the American remake will handle it.",8,10,79,4 September 2005
The Fifth Element," Multi Pass.
","Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich star in this wonderful sci-fi tale. Chock full of killer performances and excellent effects.Korben Dallas is your average ordinary New York taxi driver. Fresh out of the military, unlucky in love and this close to losing his job. One day the ultimate fare literally falls into his lap as Leeloo enters his life via the roof of his cab. Leeloo it seems was genetically manipulated to be the ultimate weapon against pure evil but her beauty and butt-kicking hide a more fragile nature that Dallas and a host of others will have to step up and help her save humanity.This amazing sci-fi adventure from Luc (Leon) Besson has a little something for everyone. Beauty (the gorgeous Jovovich with orange hair even), action and gun-play, excellent acting, amazing visual effects, romance, creative sets and costume design, dynamic and interesting music and a mildly annoying but funny Chris Tucker. You name itthis film has it in spades. 5th Element is hands down one of the best science fiction films ever.I've seen it many times and always want more. I highly recommended it.",Null,387,458,23 January 2005
Alexander," S10 Reviews: Alexander (2004)
","Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell  Phone Booth) was a man of great passion. By the tender age of 25 this Macedonian king had conquerored 90% of all the known lands of that time. By the time he died (of mysterious causes) at age 33, Alexander had shaped the very destiny of the world and became immortal like the gods of Olympus.'Alexander' is probably Oliver Stone's (Natural Born Killers / Platoon) most polished film. A bit flashy at times, it lacks a bit of the manic intensity that be brings to many of his projects. Is it a bad film? No. 'Alexander' is an exceptionally photographed film (the DVD really shines) that is very compelling and well acted. The Vangelis score was wonderful and as I stated before the photography was simply gorgeous. Although a fine cast (Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto, Christopher Plummer, Val Kilmer, etc.) Farrell seemed an odd choice for the part of Alexander but after awhile he seemed to come into his own. One does wonder if Stone could have done better for his lead. I must admit that although Miss Jolie looked stunning as ever, she too seemed out of place. My only real quibble with the film is that we only get to see two battles but the battles were immense with superb sound design. 'Alexander' is much better than Warner's other2004 epic (Troy) but doesn't hold a candle to the 'Braveheart's' and 'Gladiator's' of yore.",7,1,5,8 August 2005

The eye-candy this time around needed a bit more time for polishing. Some of the effects look pretty bad but don't take away too much from the disastrous fun. But an eerie echo settles down in light of the recent tsunami disaster.Good mindless fun that provokes a bit of thought as you see the Hollywood sign obliterated and ships sail down New York City. Oh and there's a little father and son story too for those who like a little meat with your fat.",7,0,1,23 January 2005
Cloverfield," S10 Review's 'Cloverfield' (2007)
","Its 1-18-08. The virally advertised monster simply known as 'Clover' has finally been loosed upon the cinema screens. Good old fashioned monster stomping has joined the 21st century.Suckered into taping testimonials, Hud (T.J. Miller) blinders his way around a party interviewing attendees of Rob's (Michael Stahl-David) farewell party before he leaves for his new Vice-President Job in Japan tomorrow. Just as the personal drama reaches its crescendo the fun begins. A loud boom shakes the Manhattan apartment like an earthquake. As people make their way to the streets and roofs they are witness to a building exploding barely in the distance. Debris rains down from the heavens and with more explosions and panic the shocked crowds see Lady Liberty's head skittering down the avenue. Through the smoke and haze, shaky hand-held camera and news reports we learn that out of the Atlantic has come a monster and those unlucky enough to to be caught on the island maybe in for a war the likes no ones has seen. First up if the shaky camera-work of 'The Blair Witch Project' made you want to hurl than this one won't be for you. Once the monster action begins it gets really shaky and hectic at times. The characters of the film in the end are irrelevant I mean after all what we want is destruction right? But they do manage to create some decent characters in the first 25 minuted before the maelstrom. They even manage to generate sympathy for their plight, a key ingredient for a disaster flick. Script-wise you can't really say much. Due to its nature most of the dialogue was probably improvised and much the same can probably said for the direction. Told with a hand-held camera 'Cloverfield' adds the 'Blair Witch' element to a typical 'Godzilla' style romp. It works too. The final hour has plenty tension and suspense and quite a few excellent setpieces. The sound design is phenomenal. All the gunplay and bass grop you smack dab into the action. The creature {which I won't spoil for you) is nicely done and you wisely see only bits and pieces of it until the end. Let's just say that it doesn't stray too far from your typical city stomping monsters, ias a matter of fact fans of classic monster flicks like the Harryhausen films and 'Godzilla' will notice all sorts of familiar parts. The CGI worked well too.In the end I had a grand old time. Monster movie fans should have a blast provided the camera work isn't a problem. It is definitely played for terror and an interesting discussion may be had in the post 9/11 world. You can debate it to dust but 10 years ago an Americanized 'Godzilla' put the smackdown on New York City and hardly was not half as effective. 4/5",8,1,5,18 January 2008
Silent Hill," S10 Reviews: Silent Hill (2006)
","Rose is worried about the strange behavior that her adopted daughter has. Strange drawings and waking nightmares are clues to the girl history and a strange little West Virginia ghost town. The town of Silent Hill may hold the answers but they won't come easy because the abandoned town of Silent Hill still has inhabitants lurking in the darkness and it all makes the Twilight Zone seem like a pleasant dream.Director Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) brings the Konami video game series to the silver screen with much success. Wonderfully atmospheric, the gorgeously photographed film is a lot of twisted fun. An unusually decent group of actor's (Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Kim Coates and Alice Krige) for a film like this add dramatic punch to the extremely bizarre monster design. The overall look and design is absolutely nightmarishly brilliant. It unwinds at it's own pace and captures the feel and many aspects of the story from the game well. I did wish there were more scares because I thought the original game was of the best scary games ever but it's a minor quibble at best. Some reviewers have found the film to be perplexing but I didn't have that problem. That might be due to me having played the games though.",8,1,3,30 April 2006
Crash," S10 Reviews: Crash (2004)
","'Crash' is the wonderfully told story of an unrelated group of Los Angelinos who are all quite literally crashing into each others lives. The many stories are finely interwoven with so many fine layers and textures. A black detective is working a case involving a cop shooting who also deals with his drug-addled mother and crook brother. A pair of philosopher car-jackers whose hypocritical musings perpetuate the very things they supposedly abhor, a District Attorney and his spoiled and pampered wife, a Persian shop owner and his family and a locksmith providing for his family. 'Crash' grabs you right from the beginning with Mark Isham's emotional deep and haunting music score. Paul Haggis (whose recent accolades include writing the equally emotional 'Million Dollar Baby') directs and produces his emotional and racially motivated script with amazing skill. Some films with this many stories can lose or alienate the viewer but 'Crash' is written like a page-turning novel, you couldn't stop it if you tried. The ensemble cast (Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraiser and dozens of others give amazing, high-caliber performances. Perfectly cast and wonderfully acted all the way around. 'Crash' is densely emotional and I dare you not to come away moved.",10,6,15,10 September 2005

A radio message is picked up by the ships computer, but is it a greeting or an SOS. Things take a turn for the worse when the crew investigates the signal and its; horrifying cause.
Acting: The acting is all top notch. All the actors make the characters there own with little nuances mannerisms. True some of the minor characters are a bit underwritten but they hardly suffer. Direction / Writing: The direction and writing is spot on with a slant towards early filmmaking: slow build up to kinetic end. Some other threads have said that the film has no scares but I say that an atmosphere is created in the film with punctuation by the occasional boo. Photography / Editing: Vanlint give the film a very claustrophobic feel at times that helps things along. The production designers created one hell of a detailed ship that is amazing in it's' detail. The editing is wonderful. It really shows off the detail of the ship. Sex / Nudity: We are treated to a very sleek and sexy, totally bald @ssed creature, but other than that don't get your hopes up. Sleaze: Here we got nothing either. Ripley in a t-shirt and panties is all you get unless you count the sleazy science officer. Overall / Parting Remarks: I consider this SciFi / Horror hybrid to be a classic. A lot of good stuff was put into this production to ensure its continued success. The film shows its' age just a little with its' computer screens and ending explosion though. Now for the new director's cut. I found it nice to see these added scenes in the film. While not really necessary it does offer more for the fans. Most of the scenes go seamlessly back into the film and neither adds nor subtract anything major. The inclusion of the Dallas scene at the end does kind of slow up the finale a bit but nothing major.",10,1,3,27 March 2004

","Plot: A family taking a road trip to celebrate the mother and father's silver anniversary run afoul of another type of nuclear family, one that is cannibalistic and mutated.Alexandre (High Tension) Aja wrote and directed this remake of the 1977 Wes Craven (who is attached as a producer) semi-classic. It sticks pretty much to the source material story-wise. Almost all of the original is replicated here but a few new wrinkles were thrown into the mix mostly having to do with Jupiter's clan and their origins. A little bit of a political slant is thrown in for good measure but it's not awfully heavy-handed and most will glance over it. The remake turns up the style quite a bit over the original no surprise considering the better budget and change in directors. The gore got bumped up significantly and the family looks more disgusting than ever. Now for the big question, how does it stack up to the original?. I say it did pretty well. The original had it's flaws as well as this one but I think they were both done honestly and Aja did an excellent job trying to pay homage to the original and breathe more life into it. The acting is as good as you'd expect with a pretty good cast. Lovers of the original should be OK with it, I am.Both the original and the remake score a 7.5 or 8 on my scale.",7,23,45,10 March 2006
The Shining," S10 Review's The Shining (1980)
","Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a down-on-his-luck writer trying hard to rebound back. Jack applies for and gets a position as a winter overseer of an old Colorado hotel named the Overlook. With the hotel shut down for the winter Jack will be solely responsible for maintaining it while it lay silent and unoccupied for the winter. A perfect time for a near last ditch effort to revive his career and save his strained relations with his wife (Duvall) and son (Lloyd). But a sinister side to the lovely hotel slowly exposes his family (particularly himself and his son) to supernatural goings on that threatens to make them yet another chapter in the hotels creepy past.Kubrick who revolutionized SciFi cinema with '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) turns to horror with this his adaptation (with Diane Johnson) of Stephen King's best-selling novel. Being a hardcore King fan I've had a beef in the past with how Kubrick had changed certain aspects of the source store. In particular much of the family frisson of the novel seems to be lost in the film. The new ending in the maze is a bit of a let-down next to the topiary from the novel but in the end I understand the change even though you'd have thought that the visual pioneer behind 2001 would have found an interesting workaround. However, petty gripes aside 'The Shining' is a wonderfully photographed and at times can be creepy and unsettling. Nicholson steals the show as he always does when his character destabilizes emotionally and heads toward perfectly maniacal and classic Jack territory. Duvall seems a bit out of place but if the old production stories hold true about how Kubrick terrorizes the performance out of her then maybe it's not entirely her own doing.In short 'The Shining' is a very effective and at times stunningly attractive film that has a rock-solid air of menace that piles up by the conclusion. Fans of the book may develop issues but Nicholson and Kubrick fans will eat this one up.",2,1,7,14 February 2003

All the supporting actors did excellent job, of particular note were the young actors playing theyounger main characters.Written and directed by the duo who wrote Final Destination 2 the script occasion takes giant leaps in logic but the actors sell us on it and strangely the one thing I hesitated the most about (the acting) ends up shoring up the scripts' shortcomings. The direction on the other had is above average and the effects enhance things nicely.The music is a little transparent but adds enough sting to the scenes it needs to. Heavy on songs. A lot of strings convey Evan's longing for his love. The editing is quite good and even though there is not any horror per se, creates a startle now and then.Overview:An above average thriller than conjures up echoes of Donnie Darko and Stand by Me. Excellent acting partnered up with good direction and a decent script made for a Suprisingly good movie. Fans of Donnie Darko check it out.

","When a heat signature from an ancient pyramid is seen from a satellite, billionaire industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) assembles the best technical team that money can buy to investigate why a structure of its' type is located 2,000 feet below the surface of Antarctica. But the reason becomes all too apparent when three Predators stop by to frag some Alien hides as a rite of passage.Paul (Event Horizon / Resident Evil) Anderson once again tackles the sci-fi genre, this time with mixed results. After over ten years of development you'd think Fox would have came up with something better. They try to bridge gaps between the series and tighten timelines but what they throw out is a mixed mess. Some of the action sequences are decent enough but since they went with a teen friendly PG-13 'AvP' suffers from off-screen kills and closely cropped battles that leave fans unsatisfied. The script has the usual weak character development as they are mostly cannon fodder. The most developed character must be the survivor. Right? Sadly they use a lot of CGI when it would have been a lot better and cheaper to use a practical effect. About the only saving grace of the film is an excellent sound design which is showed off well on the DVD's dts track. Very disappointing.",7,1,2,24 April 2005

From his training at the hands of Ra's Al Ghul to his adoption of the mantle of the bat 'Batman Begins' is a fantastic relaunch of the Batman universe.Christopher (Menento) Nolan pulls out all the stops on one of the best (if not THE best)comic book adaptations. Just when the Batman franchise hit is rock bottom (come on Batman & Robin was horrid)Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer bring the Batman back to his roots, dark and menacing. Bale takes over the part and owns it. The cast is near perfect Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson or Morgan Freeman bring class to their roles. Katie Holmes isn't to bad but it's a thankless part to be the romantic foil. The music wasn't as central to the action as say Danny Elfman's original but it does have its moments. The production design is awesome. This is the definitive Gotham City. The city is perfect. The suit is wonderful, gone is the cool but rather stiff original suit. I could just gush on and on.This is the adaptation fans have been waiting for and although Batman (1989) is my sentimental favorite Batman Begins is the best overall adaptation.S10 Reviews: 5/5 or 10/10",8,0,2,3 November 2005

","The Incredibles (2004)Disney  Theatre  D: Brad Bird  3/4Truth be known there is only one reason I went to see the new Pixar flick and that is simply the Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith trailer. Well the trailer hit all the cords it should have and hopefully Lucas may just not be washed up as a filmmaker. But May 19th is still a ways off; I better secure my tome off now. Anywho back to the feature, Incredibles is a clever take on the superhero tale. Mr. Incredible is your typical superpowered do-good-er that is until an overzealous fan helps to bring him down and all the heroes must stop using their powers and get day jobs. The film looks awesome as the Pixar films always do. But as we know graphics and effects only go so far. The clever plot hits a snag every now and then but nothing major. A lot of action with an occasional slowdown, The Incredibles will be a hit with the kids and adults alike.",7,1,2,6 November 2004
The Mist," S10 Review's The Mist (2007)
","One of Stephen King's best tales finally gets a chance at the big screen. Taking point for his fourth King project, Darabont smacks another out of the park. After 'Shawshank', 'Green Mile' and now the 'Mist' I think he shows great command over the great literary world of King.The story follows a group of small town residents trapped in a supermarket after a massive storm levels the area. But things go weird when a mist engulfs the town and the monsters within threaten to bring the apocalypse.'The Mist' is an excellent and mostly faithful adaptation. Of course there are tweaks and embellishments here and there most notably a different, darker ending. Darabont assembles an ensemble of recognizable faces (even if you can't quite place a name to them) and several are even King film vets (Thomas Jane from 'Dreamcatcher', Bill Sadler of 'Shawshank Redemption', Jeffrey DeMunn of 'The Green Mile' and Frances Sternhagen of 'Misery' and 'Golden Years'). This gang knows how to pull off King and they do it well. The effects for the most part are excellent the CGI scenes are often helped by the mist but a few of the clear scenes in the market were a bit off. Mix the fine production, acting, atmosphere and more than adequate effects together and you get an adaptation that is faithful to the source and a damn fine scary time at the gigaplex.",9,2,7,25 November 2007

His father agrees to help him out with the car and after grabbing a slightly beat up Camero, Sam's well on his way. After several weird incidents it becomes apparent there more to the car than meets the eye. It turns out that Sam has an intricate piece for a puzzle that brings a group of Autobots (robotic shape-shifting beings) to Earth. Lead by Optimus Prime, the Autobots must find the all-spark cube to restore life to their destroyed home of Cybertron. But the evil Decepticons led by Megatron want it for themselves and will destroy any city to get it.Pure popcorn fodder 'Transformers' could be nit-picked until the cash cows come home. This one has it all: silly script, annoying comedy relief, over blown CGI. You name it and it's here. But that's beside the point isn't it? What you want is robot-on-robot action tearing up the landscape. You do get a generous helping of it here with Bay's usual over-the-top MTV styling. The story does lag at times and only really works when the 'Tranformers' are on screen but again that's typical. The end result is a film that works perfectly for the little boy that lives inside many of us and that's about all you can hope for.",7,0,1,4 November 2007

Weird happenings and a phantom force plague the students once they stumble across the Book of the Dead. It seems that the previous tenant of the cabin was a man working on translating the book. His translation opens a doorway unleashing a force that they may not survive from. This film was shot on less than a shoestring. What we are given is an amazing film that builds slow to a wicked ending and a cult status that is second to none. This film was a labor of love by all those who worked on it. It may look `amateurish' but that is part of its' charm. The camerawork is awesome the effects are awesome. The ending is a killer setpiece. I couldn't imagine this film made any better than it was. True, if you pay close attention the continuity is pretty bad. But since the film was shot over a two year period so it is easy to see why these problems would happen. I rate this as a classic. 10/10",10,3,6,4 May 2003

","The game: six seemingly unrelated people are thrown in a dilapidated house with two hours to figure out how to get the antidote to the poison gas that has infected them. Only a detective with a major stake in the action can unravel the mystery. The jigsaw is back and his game is even more intricate and twisted this go around in this sequel to the highly successful sequel to the 2004 highly imaginative original. I deliberately avoided reading stuff about the flick (thanks to an incident on the Horror board last year that revealed the twist of the original) so I would enjoy this one hopefully more. It would be hard to replicate the original since the cat's out of the proverbial bag and the novel approach to Saw (2004) was unrepeatable. But the filmmaker's do a good job continuing the story of the first one. The games are more intricate and the action is bloodier. The look of the film is pretty much the same as the original, dirty and grimy. The grit and grain cover the whole canvas which adds to the action. They did go a bit overboard with the choppy editing (especially in the final reel) but that's the brakes. The acting is pretty strong with several recognizable faces: Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer with Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell returning from the original. The action gets pretty intense at times and some of the death traps are pretty gnarly (ugh, needles) and to no surprise there was a twist ending (supposedly five endings were shot to hide the true ending) and could spin this into a full blown franchise.In short this is a fine sequel and if you're a fan you will dig it. It channels many things from the original so that would be a wise place to start but if you've not seen you could probably see this one. 3/5 or 7/10",Null,1,2,3 November 2005

Woo brings his bullet ballet style to the franchise with some spectacular action setpieces and stunts. It's interesting to see Anthony Hopkins and Tom Cruise in their few scenes together (Hopkins glorified cameo seems almost like Hannibal eyeing a snack sometimes) but I think Newton gives the best performance of the film, Cruise seems to move in two modes: determined and cocky.

","Rating: 4 out of 5Genre: Horror, Vampires, Comic BookDirector: David SladeStars: Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, Danny Huston, Ben Foster, Mark Boone Junior, Mark Rendall, Amber Sainsbury, Manu Bennett, Megan Franich, Joel TobeckSynopsis: '30 Days of Night' is an adaptation of the 2002 Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith comic book series about Barrow, Alaska. Barrow is as about far north as a town can get and as a result during the winter the town spends thirty days in complete darkness. The remaining townsfolk must fend for their lives when the town comes under the attack of a band of nasty vampires looking to drain the town dry. Will the Sheriff (Hartnett) help the survivors who are cut off from the rest of the world by paying the ultimate price? Thoughts: Director David Slade (fresh off the popular 'Hard Candy') creates a nicely stylized adaptation of the popular graphic novel. The grimy, disgusting vampires make for a wonderfully tense time as the darkness and setting make for some quick and fun gruesomeness. I'm not the biggest Hartnett fan but he and the rest of the cast do a fine job conveying the terror and the lead vampire is particularly nasty to behold. In Conclusion: '30 Days of Night' is a wonderfully welcomed change of pace to the tired vampire genre. It has plenty of excellent technical design should give vampire fans something to sink their teeth into and the comic fans to be happy about.",9,14,27,3 March 2009

After a rousing success the Jedi head back for their next assignment but not before Padme reveals in secret to Anakin that she is with child. In the time between films the Chancellor and Anakin have grown closer but all takes a turn for the worse as Palpatine offers Skywalker his knowledge of the Dark Side to prevent Anakin's premonitions of Padme's death in childbirth from coming true. Confused the young Skywalker reveals the Chancellor's identity to the Jedi council and Mace (Samuel l. Jackson) and company head in to shut him down. But Palpatine has manipulated all for one purpose, to create the first Galactic Empire and with Anakin's allegiance proclaimed to Palpatine he seals the fate of the Jedi and destroys all those around him.It's been said a lot so I'll say it one more time, Lucas finally redeems himself. After releasing two decent but lackluster prequel's the circle is now complete with 'Sith'. Still high in eye candy, Lucas finally amps up the drama and delivers better dialogue (but still lacking) to turn out a film that is easily the best prequel and seats itself close to the original trilogy. 'Sith' is full of some excellent set pieces including the opening space battle, the Order 66 sequence, and Anakin's march on the Temple and of course the Lightsaber duel to end them all not to mention the return of Vader. Grievous was a letdown as was John William's score (it lacked anything that really stood out) but the ways that Lucas tied in the new trilogy to the Classic trilogy were priceless.

It wasn't as freaky as I would have liked it but I watch too many horror flicks anyway.

The invention of the 'Real D' technology helps to sell it even more with an absolutely jaw dropping experience. So jaw-dropping in fact I don't think that it will translate too well in 2D and the small screen. Being a huge Neil Gaiman fan and having loads of respect for Roger Avery I was even more interested in it but the screenplay is big on sight gags but a little weak otherwise.

Stryker wants revenge against Xavier and will go to any lengths in order to achieve it. All the team is tested to the limits of their abilities.

With a rip roaring beginning we start off this second chapter in the X-Men saga. The effects and action sequences receive an adrenalin injection with some killer set pieces and a surprisingly dynamic and dramatic plot. The overall tone is darker and more foreboding than the original and bares the classic `middle-film-in-a-trilogy' feel. The production design is awesome. The direction and script are rock solid. Some may complain that it takes too long in between action sequences but I thought that during these dramatic moments the actors rally shine. All the characters line up like ducks in a row to have their `big moment', and with that I have my only minor gripe. The X-Universe is chock full with awesome characters, so unfortunately some of the character arcs suffer due to not enough space to tell their stories. But in the end that is the only beef I have and that can always be fixed by a whole slew of prequels and sequels. So watch, watch and watch some more. 9/10",Null,0,0,2 May 2003

His last assignment follows the trail of a11-year-old who was kidnapped and possibly murdered by a sadistic child molester who happens to be a senator's son. The second tale (and the best) features Marv (Mickey Rourke, hands down the best role of his career) on the hunt for a silent killer who took out Goldie (Jaime King) a kin-natured prostitute who showed poor stone-faced Marv a good time. There will be hell to pay and Marv will settle the score. The third and final tale concerns Dwight (Clive Owen) a thug with a new face who is set on reclaiming his woman and will put the hurt on the joker who had put the beating on her. That story winds down in a prostitute town that cleans up their messes and solve their own problems through the brute force of Miho (Devon Aoki).'Sin City' is possibly the most faithful comic adaptation that you'll see. The film is quite literally a comic panel come to life. The stark black and white photography (with bits of color) perfectly captures in vivid detail the world of 'Sin City'. Every aspect of the film is near perfection from the strong musical score to the editing (which seamlessly jumps around the tales but never leaves you in the dark) and the cast.
