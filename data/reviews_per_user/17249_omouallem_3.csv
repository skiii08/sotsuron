Requiem for a Dream," The best cinematic experience of 2000.
","Allot can be said for writer/director Darren Aronofsky who's debut sci-fi Pi shook the independent film scene forever.  Though Aronofsky has little experience in cinema, his unique flavor plays out like a pro.Requiem for a Dream, which carries the very rare NC-17 rating, is a compelling drama about four people, closely related, all dealing with drug addiction.There is the story of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) an elderly women addicted to diet pills who dreams of being on TV, dressed in her fabulous red dress, with fabulous red hair.  The tale of her son (Jared Leto) Harry's heroin addiction, who hopes to save enough through dealing dope to one day open up a fashion designing business for his talented girlfriend Marianne (Jennifer Connelly).  And the story of Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) who's dream is similar to Harry's, and addictions as well.Of all four outstanding performances, Ellen Burstyn's acting stands strongest.  Nominated for an Academy Award, Burstyn's lovable character compels the viewer into a state of worry.  One must tip their hat to Burstyn who plays most of leading performance by herself in her apartment; hyperactive, but then gloomy and depressed frightened from a living refrigerator.Another surprise was Marlon Wayans as Tyrone C. Love.  Wayans, who has never given a believable or even respectable performance, takes drama to new heights.  His supporting role plays well with Leto at hand, as an anxious and worried friend.If you've seen Aronofsky's Pi, you're going to remember the mind blowing pill scenes.  The psychedelic frame shots played frequently through the film are used in Requiem as well.  The characters hallucinations are genuinely portrayed as either beautifully felt or horrid and terrifying.Darren Aronofsky's well performed and very well edited movie is only the beginning for this young director.  He has signed on to direct the next Batman epic due in 2002. But for now Requiem for a Dream serves as a reminder of the desperation drug users are thrown into.  Requiem is the best cinematic experience of the year.* * * * * out of 5",10,0,0,24 May 2001
Remember the Titans," Well worth a trip to the theatre.
","We seem to have set a similar standard for sports movies these days.  A team in doubt gets a new coach, and suddenly their self confidence is boosted. The players go on to win a few games and advance to the finals.  You see the tension when they off on the wrong foot, but in the end, they always win. Thankfully, this is not the case Remember the Titans.  Well, maybe a little.Titans, a Jerry Bruckheimer production, is the true story of African-American high school football coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), who had to build a football team from the roots of racism. Boone's first inference is that half his players are white, and the other half black.  The players, ignorant to the other kind, refuse to even cooperate with each other.  This sends Herman Boone, along with Assistant coach Yoast (Will Patton), on a mission to force his players to get along. Through extensive exercising, and a lot of prep-talk, Boone manages to create one talented -- and most importantly Â–- colorless team.What separates this film, from most sports movies, is has less to do with football, and much ado with the ignorant community.  The locals cannot even begin to understand how two opposing races can work together.  Ignorance from the white residents tries to dissolve that black coach they've heard about, and prevent their kids from playing with those `monkeys.'All this works well with the actors, though young and inexperienced, give fantastic performances.  However, the movie falls short of great with it's questionable dialogue (`Who's your daddy?' asks Coach Boone) and the failed attempt to make a story out of the coach, and assistant coaches daughters. Yoast's daughter Sheryl, a tom boy, disrupts the screen with her annoying yelling and dull character.  Another flaw would be the unsatisfying film work on the field.  Director Boaz Yakin game action is too simplistic, offering nothing new, and nothing surprising.Washington, as always, is great.  His charisma plays well with the audience. Overall, this film works great with Disney, and is well worth a trip to the theatre.* * * 1/2 out of 5",7,0,0,24 May 2001
City of God," Unforgettable
","City of God's central story revolves around two opposing drug-rings in the title city. These two rings, although related to one-another, divide the city in tyranny, gangs, wealth, power and in the end moral stance. These rings are run by Little Ze and Carrot, two hoods who have grown up murdering, stealing, and influencing others. Each ring is composed of kids, (infants really) teens, and young adults, all waiting to become the next Lord of their city.Oddly enough, our narrator, our eyes throughout the movie, does not play much of a direct influence on either side of the war. He's definitely involved, but his story focusses on survival and choosing the correct path, one of individualism.The style of this movie can only be described as cool.  It is very much a product of the Tarrantino generation-and proof, once again, of North America's influences over other cultures.  In a sense, the film is very much like the character Benny, who decides he wants to start looking `groovier' and more seventies-orientated.  City of God dresses itself in the fashions of another culture in order to stand out amongst a crowd of replicates.When we first see the story unravel through the 1960's, the rio slums are portrayed as a gold-saturated and content world, not luxurious or perfect, but still has a chance for hope.  By the end of this film, it is tinted blue, gritty, puddles of blood cover the concrete.  It is no place to be alone.We are tied to the story by one neutral character, Rocket, who, although inactive through most of the film, is the most empathetic since he never pulls a trigger.  He is virtually the only character to not take the life of another.Roger Ebert described the film as a masterpiece, `One of the best films you'll ever see!'  Of course this is a very bold statement, but City of God is definitely a movie you will remember.If there's one thing that makes this movie so unforgettable, it is the dramatic reality we witness.  Using real people that more or less act as themselves, directors Katia Lund and Meirelles have created a documentary in the sense that what we see happened and continues to happen in slums like this all over the world.",9,0,2,26 July 2004
