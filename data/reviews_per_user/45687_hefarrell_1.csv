Hereditary," DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE
","When I decided to see this film, all I wanted was to get a little scare and be on my way. But this movie did the opposite. Yes, it was scary, but it made me feel violated in a way. The way it ends made me feel truly guilty for even seeing it. I think the point of the movie was to bring a shock factor, which it brought, but I left feeling disturbed. What you see in the advertisement does not show all you will see in the film. So I truly do not recommend this movie.",3,10,25,10 June 2018
