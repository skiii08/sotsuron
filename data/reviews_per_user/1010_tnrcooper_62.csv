The King's Speech," God Save the King's Speech!
","This is a really entertaining movie - a great story of triumph and an interesting glimpse at the common man interacting with royalty. I doubt the King and his speech therapist were on first-person terms with one another as we see in the movie. That said, the relationship between the speech therapist and the royal is interesting. How Lionel Logue and King George VI interact and address the distinction between their class standings makes for some interesting interplay. My favorite scene was when Logue's wife comes home and finds out unexpectedly that the new King is in her humble house. She is completely shocked but keeps her composure. The challenge that public speaking presents for King George VI (Colin Firth) is huge. He stutters badly and this proves a great liability as radio becomes a more influential medium. He is embarrassed and when he faces the prospect of having to address the world more as he will expect to be King, he is dreadfully scared. He has tried many methods of speech therapy, none with great success and then he encounters an Aussie in Donal Logue (Geoffrey Rush) are founded on the belief that stuttering originates ultimately from a lack of self-confidence. As a result of his belief in the ability of people of any standing to believe in themselves, he doesn't allow the King to assume airs while he is treating him. When the King protests, he stands up to him. Again, I wonder if this is strictly true, but regardless, I'm sure there was some breaking of decorum in the King's treatment and so the positing of them as being on an equal footing is tolerable.There is some fantastic acting in this movie. Firth plays a very popular and admirable monarch. The King seems an extremely honorable and decent person in contrast to his playboy brother Edward VIII (Guy Pearce) who famously abdicated the throne to be with his twice-divorced wife. Pearce captures the posh British accent perfectly and imbues Edward with a royal's obtuse combination of callousness, wildness, and hypersensitivity. Helena Bonham-Carter bears an eerie resemblance to the Queen Mother at that age and delivers a typically excellent performance. Michael Gambon is good as the father of two Kings, worried about his health and the future of the monarchy, and Derek Jacobi is great as a very prickly Archbishop of Canterbury, upset at the impudence of a commoner who wishes to use 'his' cathedral in order that the King can rehearse his speech.The plot, focusing on the time period starting with his disastrous 1925 radio speech to the Commonwealth until his coronation in 1937, is well-framed. The direction is confident and light, and the acting enhances the power of the movie. This is a great, thoughtful drama for adults.",9,0,1,14 February 2012
Black Swan," High minded schlock
","This film would have you believe that it is a high-minded meditation on art, the ego, and mental illness. However, if you polish a turd, it's still a turd. Same goes for this movie. It might look nice and deal with some important topics and seem quite serious, but to me, this was high-minded schlock.Nina (Natalie Portman) is a repressed, reserved ballet dancer. She wants the chance to perform in 'Swan Lake' and the troupe director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel) tells her that he can't see her playing both the black and the white swan. She takes extraordinary measures to convince him to cast her. She can't seem to embody the darker side of the role, however, and ultimately her drive to convincingly tap into her darker side drives her over the edge. On the way she rivals Lily and it seems her mother (Barbara Hershey)'s intense drive for her to succeed comes from the fact that she sacrificed her own career when she gave birth to Nina. Nina and her mother clash as Nina comes out of her shell in trying to capture the nature of the Black Swan. Nina also has a love-hate relationship with her alternate Lily who may have it out for Nina.There is an awful lot of C-grade melodrama in this and while there certainly is some rivalry and dysfunction in the arts, the depiction of the ballet world seems very stereotypical and grounded in the broadest stereotypes about the arts. Aronofsky seems to wallow in the notion of the cattiest rivalries, the shrillest stage mother, the most fragile of divas, and the douchiest of directors. I could see Nina's fate from a mile away and it really is a shame that this movie had to be so sensationalistic. Aronofsky made a fantastic film in 'Reqiuem for a Dream' but here he indulges the lowest of beliefs about the art world. Depicting artists as mentally fragile and grasping is a low-end way of depicting this world and it's a shame because Aronofsky is a talented filmmaker.I thought Mila Kunis was very good in this film. She very much fit the part created for her. She seemed very at east in it. I thought Portman's character was rather one note and while Portman was not bad (she's incapable of being bad) I didn't think this was one of her more noteworthy performances. I enjoyed the music but this was truly a very self-indulgent picture made by Aronofsky and for my money, extremely overrated.",5,18,28,26 November 2011
Walk the Line," Electrifying
","This is a thoroughly engrossing film, wonderful for its music, for its acting, for the direction of James Mangold, for its costumes, and for its examination of only a portion of Cash's life.The music is Cash's music but all the performances which we see Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do belong to them. Their performances are not lip-synched performances of Cash and Carters' renditions. Phoenix captures Cash's gravelly bass fantastically. Cash's voice was so deep and is so distinctive that it is truly a credit to Phoenix that he could do a credible version of Cash. He captures the huskiness, the throatiness, and the depth of Cash's voice wonderfully. Phoenix has charisma to burn and in his embodiment of a man who gets caught up in the excesses of the 'rock 'n' roll lifestyle', is haunted by the loss of his brother and whose conflicted relationship with his father maddens him, Phoenix captures a big-hearted, generous, soulful man who is vulnerable to the temptations available to him on the road.Phoenix is phenomenal throughout the movie - from his early desperation to support his wife which leads him to perform an inspired version of 'Walk The Line' for Sun Records founder Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), to a scene in a diner in which he has a lengthy chat with June Carter (Witherspoon), to a scene in which a down-on-his-luck Cash stumbles on foot through the rain to Carter's house outside Memphis to beg for her affection, to a scene in which he figuratively thumbs his nose at the warden of Folsom State Prison and fires up the inmates by performing with extra vigor when the warden had asked him not to.Reese Witherspoon is not to be outdone though. June Carter was as big-hearted as her husband but stronger than him - unwilling to tolerate his carousing or pill-popping. She is obviously attracted to him but keeps her cool until he gets his act together. The whole time, she deals with being a divorced single mother in a conservative area where she is subject to the judgment of locals about some of the life decisions she has made and all the time she remains upbeat. Reese Witherspoon is as convincing in her role as Joaquin Phoenix in his. This truly is a masterclass in acting from two very talented actors in which they fully sketch out the interior lives and inhabit their complex subjects. They are not alone in fantastic acting. Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny's long-suffering first wife shows great patience but also exasperation in dealing with his many problems. Also great is Robert Patrick as Johnny's taciturn father, Ray Cash, Shelby Lynne in a small part as Johnny's mother Carrie, Sandra Ellis Lafferty and Dan Beene as June Carter's parents, and Waylon Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis.The direction and screenplay from James Mangold are amazing. To elicit such great performances from so many, to have the film look so good, and to capture with such depth and feeling a crucial part of a great American artist's life are the highest tribute to Mangold's film.I said that it was a great film for showing only a portion of Cash's life. That it focused on his start in the business until the time he kicked drugs allowed Mangold to capture what he thought was Cash's search for redemption. I found the dramatic arc which concluded with his quitting drugs and committing to June very satisfying in a way it wouldn't have been had it ended with Cash's death or a less dramatic latter moment in his life. Truly this is an amazing film.",10,0,1,5 January 2006
United 93," Heartbreaking film-making
","This is a powerful film. The absence of big names and the minimal use of music to suggest how we should feel ensures that this film portrays the events of that horrible day in the respectful manner which they deserve. I kept on trying not to think of the passengers as characters but as real people. However, there is some degree to which the characters have become larger than life and their story so familiar that there is catharsis in watching them unite to fight against fate. Director Paul Greengrass was the right man for the job. He got approval for his picture from many families of the victims of flight 93 and I think rightfully so.It was heartbreaking to watch the segment tracking the characters before the hijacking. As viewers, we know what happens and one hopes against hope that somehow the inevitable will be avoided. This obviously does not happen and it's heartbreaking. We watch the passengers preparing in the relatively unperturbed way in which we all approached flying before 9/11. One wants to yell at the screen for the characters to leave, to fight, to avoid what we know will happen. I felt a great deal of sympathy for the air traffic controllers who didn't know that they were working on the day of the worst terrorist attack in US history. I also felt a lot of sympathy for the military personnel who were trying to secure approval for scrambled planes to mobilize in order to head off a hijacking.The film is based on documented information detailing what happened on that fateful flight. I found the section of the film in which family members made final phone calls to their families extraordinarily moving. Again, the hindsight which allows us to know that indeed these passengers would not leave the plane alive is what makes this section so moving. Greengrass never plays up the emotional gravity of anything, even at points at which a lesser film-maker might have succumbed to the temptation to secure a greater emotional pay-off from a directing decision, such as when Todd Beamer said 'let's roll'. This is to his credit. Greengrass offers no comment on the actions of the authorities, the passengers, or the terrorists. I don't think any movie could pay tribute to the events which transpired on United flight 93 than this film.One final note. If you have the DVD release of this film, watching the 45 minute featurette Greengrass made discussing with United 93 family members the making of this movie, including the cathartic meetings between family members and the actors who would portray their lost loved ones, is must-see viewing as we see family members several years after the tragedy, dealing with grief which never goes away.",10,2,4,25 April 2011
In Bruges," Fear and loathing....and horse tranquilizers...in Bruges
","This is exactly my sort of film. If you like edgy, minimalist crime capers, this is your sort of film too. If you liked 'The Limey' and/or 'The Matador', I think you'll like this one. Really I thought I'd like this one, but didn't expect it to be as satisfying as it was.Colin Farrell really should be considered for an Oscar for this performance. He plays Ray, a troubled hit-man who is struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of a hit gone wrong. While some commenters have noted Ray's erratic behavior, few have mentioned his quite profound crisis of conscience. Some might say he has no conscience but that is undercut by the moral code to which the hit men in this film adhere. This one act has thrown him completely off-course and he acts out in anti-social (and very funny) ways. He insults other tourists; he is excessively irritated by minor things. He is completely disinterested in sightseeing in the beautiful medieval city (it's in Belgium) where he and and his laid-back accomplice, Ken (the ever professional Brendan Gleeson) have been sent with instructions to lay low until they get their next word from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes playing a character whose job and demeanor seem very similar to those of Ben Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast.' That said, Fiennes, makes this role his own with his passion and intelligence).Director Martin McDonagh, as mentioned, has a flare for capturing the ultimately sad human essence of hit men. He does not glamorize them but captures them at their most mundane. The laughs seem all the funnier for their very universality. That said, he never loses sight of the fact that this story is really about hit men attempting to come to terms with what they have done. It lends the story a sobering undertone which ensures the movie will stay with you for a long time. Farrell is absolutely at the top of his game. Fiennes is (like Ben Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast') scarily psychotic, and Brendan Gleeson is, like others have said in comments, the moral center of the film. The conclusion is satisfying and appropriate and I cannot wait to see what McDonagh does next.",10,21,33,2 March 2008
Gravity," George Clooney Is Now a God
","Appearance-wise, acting-wise, music, a fantastic film. However everyone should have died in this film. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) has such an impact on Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) that his wonderfulness pierces her consciousness as she drifts toward death? What about the daughter she's lost? What about her family? Nope - Kowalski (who seems an awful lot like a lot of what we read about Clooney)'s charm and rakishness and his stories about misadventures in bars in 1987 are what tell her, nope, I have to do this so Matt's wonderfulness will not be devalued in the slightest. As I said, the acting, music, and the appearance are incredible. One feels one is in space...one feels the vastness of space. However this seemed like the cult of George finally taking over, once and for all.",5,0,2,24 December 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," very well-written and acted comedy
","This is a very funny film, as noted, extremely well-acted and written. I do wish that Hollywood had a broader net for comedic incubation but that said, many of the films which Judd Apatow is involved in are very funny. I enjoyed 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' though I found 'Knocked Up' to be a bit harsh on women. I found 'Pineapple Express' loopier but 'Superbad' overly reliant on bad language. Apatow did not direct all those films but has had an influence on all of them. This film I really enjoyed. It is written by Jason Segel who also stars in the film. Segel has a great sense for how people act and interact and his dialogue bears this out. There is some great acting from Mila Kunis as a helpful, thoughtful hotel staffer. Jack McBrayer and Maria Thayer are truly hilarious as repressed newlyweds, Kristen Wiig is very funny as a passive-aggressive yoga instructor, Paul Rudd is almost unrecognizable as something like a human 'Nemo', and Da'Vone McDonald is very funny as an opinionated and helpful staffer at the hotel. Among the leads, Jason Segel is fantastic as a sad-sack TV show music composer whose life becomes very complicated when the TV star who he breaks up with (Kristen Bell), is at the resort where he is trying to escape from her. Segel communicates a great deal of humanity and seems very likable which makes us more sympathetic to his plight. Russell Brand absolutely steals every scene he is in as an over-sexed but not very talented music star. The songs which Segel wrote for Brand are hilarious and Brand absolutely steals the film with his full-throated depiction of his inane, over-the-top music star.The writing and direction are very good and the performances, as noted, are wonderful. There is lots of profanity and quite a bit of male nudity which is quite funny in and of itself. At times it seems a little forced but only a bit and it doesn't distract from the essence of the film. This truly is a fantastically written film. Segel could have quite a career as a writer. I have to admit I found Jonah Hill quite annoying. I generally find him annoying and his 'I'm overweight and a nerd' schtick has worn thin and never more in this film. I thought it was funny how friendly hotel staff was, but these are tiny reservations. I highly recommend this hilarious film.",9,0,2,4 February 2011
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Rich, generous adaptation of the book
","While I'm not too familiar with the book or the faithfulness of the film to it, I'm told by reliable sources (my sister) that it is faithful in important parts-such as the death of Aslan. I found the film very enjoyable and rewarding. While living in England as a little boy in 1981 or 1982, I saw the original BBC adaptation of the book and was blown away by it. Now I'm very curious as to what it was I saw that so amazed me as a little boy. Perhaps it will appear quite hinky or cheesy now-perhaps not. Be that as it may, this film I found very enjoyable. Adamson, the director of Shrek, uses special effects as they should be used-judiciously. While the effects were sometimes unconvincing-such as one shot in which the children are standing in the foreground with the sky behind them-possibly while the children were walking toward the White Witch's home. By and large though, I found the film to be an exuberant and lively endorsement of the adaptation of books. The book is such a classic but yet it seems to have been quite happily received. I found the director kept the essence of the story-between good and evil-in focus and this holds the focus of the story quite clearly. Adamson keeps the compelling story front and center and does not get waylaid by the temptation to animate or enliven a film with flashy but ultimately unnecessary special effects. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch deserves an Oscar nomination, in my opinion. She was so effective that one can imagine that she might get hate mail in which her character is confused with her real personality. She seems scary and that is the sign that an actor or actress has fully inhabited a character. One really dislikes her and roots for Aslan and the children. Ultimately though, I would give immense credit to director Adamson for restraint in the creation of this film. He could have easily submitted to the temptation to enliven the film with special effects but he realized that CS Lewis had already written a book that, if adapted quite honestly, would play powerfully by itself. This is a wonderful and inspiring film.",10,4,5,26 December 2005
"I Love You, Man"," Enjoyable but not pioneering comedy
","This movie was very enjoyable. It's about a man named Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd at the top of his game) who's engaged quite happily to his fiancée Zooey (the lovely and charming Rashida Jones of 'The Office', 'Boston Public', and 'Parks and Recreation') and whose life seems to be coming up roses. Their plans for their wedding are going quite smoothly until Peter overhears his fiancée chatting to some of her girlfriends about the fact that Peter doesn't have any guy friends. This sets him off on a quest to make some guy friends. It's in the course of this quest that the somewhat uptight Peter meets Sidney Fife (Jason Segel, fantastic as a guy guys would want to hang out with and who women love also). The two characters bond over Rush, masturbation stations, and unpicked up dog poop. They eventually have a falling-out after their relationship becomes a bit too close for Zooey. This is not a movie with too many aces in its pocket though and the ending is not particularly surprising. That said, the casting is good, although it seems as though we see the same faces again and again in comedies these days. That said, Paul Rudd is excellent as is Jason Segal. Jamie Pressly and Jon Favreau are hilarious as a couple who are constantly sniping at one another. Amy Burns is quite funny as Zooey's friend Hailey who is becoming increasingly desperate to find a man. It's always wonderful to see Jane Curtin in movies and she and JK Simmons are quite funny as Peter's parents whose interaction at the dinner table sometimes shocks (although in many recent comedies, we have encountered the 'wacky' in-laws who specialize in providing an off-beat comic foil to the younger couple trying hard to make their relationship work) their younger relatives. Rob Huebel, as Peter's id-driven co-worker also deserves credit for his work in trying to bring out the necessary flair Peter will need to sell Lou Ferrigno (The Incredible Hulk)'s house.The screenplay is very hard to dislike. It is well-written and it is essentially the mirror image of the typical romantic comedy in that Peter can't find a male friend after several valiant (and ultimately predictably wacky) 'dates' but finally finds 'the one'. After a period of bliss, it seems that the relationship may crash on the rocks, but this is not a movie for sad endings. That said, the screenplay, by John Hamburg who also directed (and who introduced us to 'The Fockers' and 'Zoolander') creates a plausible world in which a man is a little insecure and tries to fix what he perceives is a shortcoming on his part. At times the humor is quite derivative and juvenile, but there is undoubtedly a heartbeat lurking beneath the immature exterior and one senses that this movie could even have explored in greater depth the concept of platonic male friendship while not sacrificing laughs. That said, this is still a very enjoyable movie and superior to most humor on the market. It should play well to people through a broad range of ages even if it is a bit coarse and juvenile at times. Ultimately, its heart is in the right place.",8,0,0,23 January 2011
Superbad," Way overrated
","Drop an f-bomb a billion times, have Michael Cera deliver everything with his lack of emotion, Jonah Hill is a severely maladjusted, possibly Tourette's suffering character who had a 'hilarious' compulsion to draw penises when he was young, two cops who have never made cops look more unprofessional, and a kid who thinks that getting a fake ID with the name 'McLovin' is plausible. This is a really, really, really stupid, annoying film. And don't tell me this is the new 'American Pie' or 'Porky's'. American Pie had its melancholic counterpoints, its awkwardness (Jason Biggs being caught wacking off with a sock on his dong) which allowed us to sympathize with its characters growing pains. Chris Klein's jock was a little bit soulful. They didn't need to use stupid forms of profanities every other word. These guys, yes, there is intelligence behind the script, and Seth Rogen captures the painfulness of being an awkward, insecure, a-bit-too-intelligent-to-be-really-popular kid, but does he need to use SO much profanity? I would say no.American Pie was funny because the soulfulness was counteracted with the moments of cringeworthy embarrassment. I didn't have any interest in these characters. Their backstories either didn't exist and they weren't particularly likable characters. Honestly, Seth Rogen needs to learn that you don't need to use an 'f word' every other word to make people laugh. I have no problem with it, but if coarseness and profanity is your only method of trying to make me laugh, I'll pass. This movie annoyed me within about 5 minutes and never really let up. In addition....just one more thing.....really....cops who bumble, play with guns, don't know how to collect basic information, and make utter folly of their commitment to protect and serve? Again...I have no problem with making fun of cops....but this was ridiculous. It went overboard and it was so obviously overboard that I didn't find it funny. Honestly, rent American Pie, watch Airplane, watch Monty Python, watch Naked Gun, watch Police Academy....but until Seth Rogen can come up with something other than nine uses of the eff word in one sentence, he's got no more shots in his locker.",4,3,6,11 December 2010
The Great Dictator," Chaplin vs. Authoritarianism
","Charlie Chaplin turns his comic focus on the dictators of his time - Mussolini and Hitler. He mocks their mien, their speech, and their policies. Chaplin shows himself to be brave and shows again that he is a comic genius. His imitation of Hitler and the scene of Hitler hanging from a moving plane shine in this film as Chaplin's shoe eating did in 'Gold Rush'. In contrast to the dictators' policies, he offers a beautiful vision of the future.Chaplin obviously is a comic genius and was deeply committed to opposing tyranny. He used the talents he had to oppose it, and for that he should be commended. Hitler is seen as blustering and Chaplin hilariously lampoons his overheated style, practically spitting into the front row so overwrought does he become. The speeches are comic gems because of his use of pseudo-German, some actual German, and that aforementioned overwrought style. His advisors Garbitsch (Henri Danielle) and Herring (Billy Gilbert) are oafs and psychopaths by turn. Garbitsch, obviously modelled on Goebbels, is the psychopath. Danielle chills the blood with a stark, cold depiction of a man whose quiet confidence about extermination only re-enforces the psychopathy of the Final Solution. Herring is an oaf who can do nothing without making a fool of himself. By mocking Goebbels, Goerring, and Hitler so mercilessly, Chaplin gives us a release from the stress that comes from hating people.On the other hand, there are residents of the Jewish Ghetto who live fearfully owing to Naziism's escalating oppression. They have tough lives but live with dignity and self-respect. They are routinely harassed and badgered by roughneck SS officers. One day however, a chance World War I encounter between a Nazi officer and the barber brings some of the harassment to a close, at least for some time. The difference between Hitler and Mussolini on the one hand and the Ghetto residents on the other is stark, but given the horrors that Hitler and Mussolini inflicted on the world, they turn out to be prescient. There are some good performances from Paulette Goddard as a humble resident of the Ghetto, and Reginald Gardiner as an informal leader in the community. They bring humility and decency to their characters.As usual, Chaplin's comic gifts shine through in set pieces. In this film, the set piece of Chaplin hanging from the wing of a moving plane is hilarious. Another hilarious scene is that of a bumbling crew messing up the debut of a new weapon. Neither shoe might hold up to the famous shoe eating in 'Gold Rush' but they are worthwhile rivals.The film comes to a head as the Ghetto barber as well as arrogant dictator Hinkle (both played by Chaplin) are mistaken for one another. The humble barber must address an assembly of Hinkle's most brainwashed followers and the unexpected speech leaves the crowd shocked.As a statement opposing authoritarians it is very powerful movie. It is a pity more artists haven't used their power to condemn authoritarianism. It is a bit pie in the sky but at the time, the Final Solution hadn't yet happened and so what we see in retrospect was not inevitable. Chaplin's movie offered the world a beautiful vision of the future, but if idealism isn't expressed, it doesn't even stand a chance. Chaplin showed his cards and stuck his neck out and as I said, I have a lot of respect for Chaplin making a movie that was obviously deeply felt. It might not have happened but it's a beautiful, as well as very funny, vision to aspire toward.",8,1,2,11 July 2014
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Don't tell my g/f
","but I enjoyed this film. McConaughey and Hudson bring appropriate energy to the film and really keep the action going. Yeah, it's a chick flick and the film develops more or less as you'd expect, but as long as you recognize those two factors (not crimes in and of themselves), the dance is fun. It's an entertaining film and I guess disposable candy entertainment, but all the same, both characters remain honest to the objectives their characters have and they handle their feelings for one another in attractive ways. However the film doesn't seem to be manipulating the viewer's feelings which is always a deal-breaker for me. Charisma of Hudson and McConaughey and a clever comedic/romantic hook keep this movie ticking along nicely. I've seen a few rom/coms...never of my own free will....but this one really was not terribly unenjoyable.",9,0,1,13 November 2005
Hot Fuzz," droll, funny, but also very satiric film
","This movie, from the creators of Shawn of the Dead, plows some of the same territory, but adds some acerbic social commentary to the mix. It is a clear homage to the buddy cop movies which have proliferated over the past 20 years, but it is also a comment on the sometimes corrosive, excessive, civic pride, almost incestuous in its intense devotion to all things local, in England specifically in this case, but it could be translated to other communities anywhere. It is very very funny and pointed, but this satire was not at all hinted at in the movie's marketing. The tribute to the banal buddy buddy cop movies of the last while is sometimes so broad and obvious that it is sometimes almost a re-make, but that said, it is nice that someone (director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg, who co-wrote the movie with Wright) recognize the pervasiveness of the genre. The story is that London police officer Nicholas Angel (a rather playful and unlikely name played by writer Simon Pegg) is exiled to the countryside because of his overly industrious ways and the fact that his industriousness revealed the laziness of the police. Once out in the countryside, he disrupts the routine of small town life by cracking down on small-time crime. He also, however, investigates a series of gruesome murders which the locals attempt to downplay but which he believes (correctly) are related. In so doing, he treads on the toes of many of the locals who have lived there for a long time and who feel they have some claim on the life of the community, to a much more literal extent than he might have anticipated. The acting is fine. No great performances are required. The satiric script drives the film and it is a very intriguing and clever plot. It is an interesting and amusing film with more layers to it than is suggested by the marketing.",9,7,13,3 June 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Fabulous film
","I'm curious to see Crash having seen this film. I have a hard time believing it was better than this one. This film is masterfully adapted from an Annie Proulx short story. Ang Lee directs and once again impresses with his range. He has directed ancient Chinese epics (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), 1970s epic scale dramas (The Ice Storm), big-budget blockbusters (The Hulk), Civil War epics (Ride the Dragon), and British 18th century literary adaptations (Sense and Sensibility). The first film, which gained him the attention of Hollywood, was 1993's The Wedding Banquet. The ability he showed in making that film convinced execs that he could bring Sense and Sensibility to the screen in a winning and convincing manner. And he did not disappoint them. 13 years down the line, Lee continues to impress. The main attribute in allowing him to tell such a wide range of stories is a lesson that many lesser directors would do well to remember: it's about the story. And now this. Lee's ability to find the emotional center of all these stories explains his success in making films that have made money but have also retained their stories' essential integrity. It doesn't sound like particularly ground-breaking advice, and indeed, it isn't. However it always serves him well in telling a story that has a thesis, that has a point. Most people realize at least that Lee has a mastery of his material and that he wishes to tell stories that will connect with many. This is certainly the case with Brokeback Mountain. Lee has fantastically adapted the Annie Proulx short story, focusing on a forbidden relationship between two men (Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist-played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, respectively) over 20 years, from roughly 1961 until about 1981. The men meet and get along during a cattle drive in Wyoming, and engage in a sudden, unexpected passionate clench. They do not address the forbidden love during the remainder of the cattle drive although they continue to get along quite well. When they come down from the mountains, both try and find their ways in life, Ennis marrying a reserved local girl named Alma (the fantastic Michelle Williams) while Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal, excellent as the needier of the two men) finally marries the assertive daughter (Anne Hathaway, very good as a capable businesswoman increasingly remote from her husband) of a prominent agricultural equipment salesman. Twist meets his wife in Texas and settles there while Ennis remains in Wyoming, working intermittently as he is able. However, he and his wife live an austere life. They have two girls and although he is a good father, the family's financial insecurity increases the stress between the parents. It is several years after Ennis and Jack's original encounter that they meet again. A postcard from Twist alerting Ennis about his impending arrival is received with a jolt of excitement and their re-union ignites the connection anew. Over the next sixteen or seventeen years, the men meet with some regularity, seemingly more as time goes on. Both marriages suffer as a result. However the relationship is not fulfilling for either man. Both men consider the opportunities they might have missed and whether they should have made more of a commitment. Ennis' marriage breaks up although it is perhaps more owing to stress bought on by financial insecurity than to his affair, which his wife is aware of. Ennis cannot form a new relationship with women which speaks to the depth of feeling he has for Jack while Jack becomes increasingly needy and shrill in condemning Ledger for refusing to make a stronger commitment to the relationship. The film chronicles with heartbreaking austerity the pain in their forbidden relationship. The relationship is not fulfilling for either man but at the same time, both derive much pleasure and satisfaction from it, which keeps it going. Lee has a mastery of the material and knows that the long- term heartbreak is more searing than occasional moments of passion. The film stays with you and the sense of regret that characterizes it has an undeniable emotional heft. The acting, in particular from Ledger and Williams, is fantastic. Both are from traditional, conventional homes and both are well-mannered. The toll that poverty takes on their marriage is rarely spoken of and when either lashes out, the words are all the more cutting for their rarity. Both are likable characters and one wishes the best for them and as one sees the toll that Ledger's infidelity and the scarcity of money has on the couple, one feels sadness as surely as one does in any film. Lee allows his actors to act and does not constrict them with manipulative aesthetic elements such as musical cues or cinematographic choices. The cinematography is sparse and simple and the music is similarly low-key. Both choices re-enforce the essential loneliness underlining the film. Fantastic film and although I have not seen Crash, I find it hard to believe that it is better than this film.",10,19,23,26 March 2006
Juno," It's good...but a little too precious in places
","I feel a lot of people here, having read several pages of comments, are going a little over the top about the significance and hipness of this film. That is not to shortchange some excellent acting, most especially from the revelatory Ellen Page as the title character, from Jason Bateman as the possible adoptive father who is struggling with the never-ending male yearning to regress to age 17, Jennifer Garner giving a nuanced performance as a woman (Vanessa Loring) who really wants to be a mother but whose feelings may be driving her husband (Bateman, as Mark Loring) somewhat away from her. Garner has not received enough credit, in the rush to attribute credit for this film. She balances the most intense desire to be a mother but is having difficulty keeping the equilibrium which she has esablished with her husband. This is a tough line to straddle and Garner does it fantastically. I don't know if she has received an Oscar nomination but I don't think it would have been out-of-place for both she and Bateman, as Mr. Perpetually Arrested In Development (no pun intended) to have received them. JK Simmons offers a warm, rich performance as a supportive if somewhat baffled father (but then again, who isn't?) Juno's best friend Leah is also brought energetically to life as a somewhat hyper, smart, horny, smart-alecky teen by Olivia Thirlby. Michael Cera, I believe may have some difficulty extending his range if he does not soon do something in which he plays something other than the shy, reserved, sensitive male part. He is decent but his character's emotional palette is sometimes almost one note.Screenwriter Diablo Cody has written a witty, whip-smart script, but at times it seemed a little too clever for its own good, attempting to out-'Fargo' 'Fargo' by dwelling on the specific upper-midwestern locale and the 'folksiness' of all. This is not a major criticism, but it is a criticism. My primary beef is with Alison Janney's character who at one point when she and her husband were discussing Juno's just-revealed pregnancy said something along the lines of how do we rectify this sh*tpile of a situation. The dialogue just seemed at times to strain a little too much for our approval. That said, a scene in which Janney's Bren critiqued the x-ray technician for her unsolicited opinions on the frequency with which teens get pregnant was very funny and Cody has a fantastic ear for dialogue. I just found at times it seemed a little too precious. The film really would not be a quarter of what it was without such a wonderful script. This is a good, funny movie, but as some other commenters have noted, in addition to some reservations about the preciousness of the dialogue, I don't think Cody recognizes the transcendent changes which ALL women, regardless of how hip, undergo, when pregnant. That said, I'd see this film about 42 times before I would see the vast majority of the dregs out there which currently pass for films.",8,1,5,19 February 2008
Match Point," didn't buy the hook-up but......
","Having read many comments and agreeing in principle with most, this movie really is a thoughtful and fairly intriguing film about a poor boy from Ireland faced with an age-old problem, the stable, attractive woman, or the more combustible, but gorgeous.....(oh who am I kidding? I wish my choices were that good) woman. For me, I had a bit of a problem with the premise on which one of the relationships is premised. Without giving too much away, it seems that one affair seems to have begun rather reluctantly, indeed, it seemed to me inexplicably given the initial resistance. That said, if you can get past that seeming unlikelihood, Allen has hit on a very nice film. In addressing the role that luck plays in life and the pressures on a poor boy to make good, Allen has tapped into a rich vein of material addressing class, gender roles, and sexual politics. The acting is quite good although the setting, a rather tony British social circle seems quite exclusive. That said, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Emily Mortimer as a naive but sweet lady, and Scarlett Johannsen who seems effortlessly to inhabit her somewhat troubled, provocative character. She is very talented-do not underestimate her abilities on account of her good looks. (That admonition may be directed at me as much as anyone :) ) Seriously though, Johanssen is a very very very talented actress. She creates and seems to meld with the characters she plays effortlessly. I found the soundtrack (early Italian opera originally recorded on 78s (not sure if that's how they're transferred into the movie)) excellent and it foreshadowed throughout the film. I thought his selection of this extremely visceral, emotional music was quite fitting for story arc. Really, Allen is an excellent director and I would imagine he thought he needed to take a break from New York. Really though, this is a very good film and it will be interesting to see what he does next.",7,1,2,9 January 2008
Crash," Overrated, over-simplified look at life through just one lens
","I don't understand why so many people think this film is so insightful. It suggests that people are incapable of seeing past race when other features-socio-economic class, gender, everyday life, shared humanity-make life a lot more complex and richer than would be suggested if one was to take one's impression of what life in Los Angeles is like if one did not know anything about it and viewed only this film. To suggest that once someone gets in a car crash, as happens at the beginning of the film, between Jennifer Esposito and, I believe Wendy Rhee, a Korean woman, and both women start spewing racial epithets almost immediately, or that Ludicrous, if self-aware enough to appreciate the difficult circumstances into which he is born, as a black man in America, as he does early in the film, but then blindly acts in ways which re-enforce such stereotypes, is ridiculous. To suggest that a racist cop would see the error of his ways so suddenly-or even that a racist cop would so brazenly exemplify this racism in such an ugly manner in his personal life in addition to his racist treatment of people on the job-is ridiculous. If someone has been that racist so unrepentantly for that long, it is difficult to imagine that he would change so quickly simply on account of one interaction with one person-is ridiculous. If the racist cop (played by Matt Dillon) was truly that racist, perhaps he would be racist, but not in the over-the-top, obscene manner in which he is. Even at the LAPD, and certainly in his personal relations, he would not have developed as he did, were he so unevolved. In addition to that, the notion that one cop would have two lengthy encounters with the same person on two consecutive days with such emotional weight, in a city the size of Los Angeles, is ridiculous. The chances of that must be in the billions or trillions. That director Paul Haggis would focus on a wealthy white woman (Sandra Bullock-very good)'s racist attitudes to the exclusion of any other elements of her character, or that we would focus on the racism of Don Cheadle or Jennifer Esposito or any of the other very good actors in this film, to almost complete exclusion of any other considerations-is ridiculous. Another scene which was ridiculous in the film was Ryan Philippe's intervention on behalf of Ludicrous' gangbanging character. The complete disregard for police rules of engagement is simply crazy. Perhaps if only one or two of these elements were the case, the film might be more believable, but Haggis' continuing and unstinting consideration of race as the only issue acting in our lives in Los Angeles is ridiculous. I understand the desire of people to want to praise this film and the conclusions are interesting. However, it seems the screenplay and idea for the film is enormously simplistic and would require perhaps fewer characters and attention to the effect of factors other than simply race. Haggis' motives, I'm sure, were pure, but this to me, is offensive to the behavior of anyone who attempts to act in stressful situations in a decent, reasonable manner. Many people, millions and billions of times a day, make choices which would refute Haggis' contention that when faced with stressors, humans revert to unevolved prejudices against which, apparently, any reason is helpless. This movie is greatly over-simplified and offensive.",4,6,9,8 March 2008
Knocked Up," Deserves Oscar for best movie...or at least most enjoyable
","This is a very very very funny film. I really can't say how funny it was. I'd have to include about 18 'very's which, as Ace Ventura said about three poisoned arrows, is 'too many'. Director and writer Judd Apatow has a unique and welcome take on comedy. He does not attempt to hew out its coarseness. All the sometimes gratuitous profanity which one might typically encounter in the course of a day is included in the movie and Apatow does not shy away from supposedly taboo or off-color topics. In so doing, Apatow and his talented cast have again struck a chord with people who appreciate the everyday nature of his movies.The heart of the movie is quite simple. An unlikely couple, after a little too much fun out, has sex and the woman becomes pregnant and the couple, the charming and beautiful Katherine Heigl as up-and-coming TV producer/host Alison Scott and the beefy and very funny writer/director Seth Rogen as laid-back stoner Ben Stone have to decide how they will proceed. First of all, will the child be aborted? Will Stone be involved in the child's upbringing? Will the couple marry? Will they stay together? This classic challenge makes for a rich vein of humor which Apatow mines very well. Apatow does not sugarcoat or mislead about the very real challenges facing this unlikely couple. But his characters seem so plausible and have such airs of reality about them that the challenges they encounter do not seem unreasonable. As said, his two co-stars are very talented. The one reservation I had about the plausibility of the film was the difference in their appearances. To be quite blunt, Alison is gorgeous and Ben is quite pedestrian looking. Of course, the reasons for which they were together tend to minimize the importance of that difference, but still and all, if couples who look so unconventional do exist, I have not seen them. That said, Heigl is very likable and one roots for her and Rogen delivers in spades on the promise of his one-liners and throwaway digs as one of Steve Carell's co-workers in The '40 Year Old Virgin'. He improvises much of his work here, as do many of the actors. Rogen has an inventive comic mind which he used to help Sascha Baron Cohen work on 'Da Ali G Show' and his quick mind is quite evident in this movie. Some of the best scenes are loosely written frameworks of scenes in which Ben and his goofy friends sit around and riff, in addition to scenes including both Rogen and Paul Rudd who is also clearly in his element improvising comedy. There are some other excellent performances, most notably Leslie Mann (Apatow's wife), as Alison's somewhat neurotic and insecure but protective older sister Debbie In particular, Jason Segel as perhaps the slickest of Ben's friends, Jason, a guy who is very smooth with the ladies in spite of his pedestrian looks. As mentioned, Rudd, as Debbie's music scout husband is also very, very good and seems to have developed a good collaborative relationship with Apatow, having worked with him on his last two movies.It will be interesting to see the success of future Apatow projects given his obvious abilities and accomplishments thus far and it will be an enjoyable anticipation.",10,0,7,16 July 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Dark but very well done.
","I should preface my comment by noting that I had no knowledge of the basics of the musical other than that it involved a murdering barber. And boy, how he does murder. However, in reading a lot of the comments here, it seems many of the devoted fans of the musical seem not to realize that this movie was not made in their interests. Yes, it may be a little too dark, or the music is unsatisfying, or some of the performances may not match up to your expectations.....but this movie was not made for you. The vast majority of people who have seen this movie are not such devoted fans as you are. Anyway, I found the movie very dark but really something of a morality tale. It is about the former Benjamin Barker who has returned to London after 15 years away, sent away by venal judge Turbin (Alan Rickman typically excellent, and at his sleazy best) on false charges. He comes back to London angry and sets up as a barber above a pie shop (run by a very good Helena Bonham Carter's pragmatically calculating Ms. Lovett). Depp is very good and delivers one of his better performances, comparable to his work in 'Ed Wood'. Bonham Carter also deserves recognition as an amoral but realistic small business owner. She knows her pies are not great but if people are willing to buy them, she will sell them. Sacha Baron Cohen is very good as a former cohort who now works in a rather seedy milieu. Timothy Spall, as in 'Secrets and Lies', is very good as Beadle, Judge Turpin's homer. The film is quite dark but is saved by its sense of humor and the dark amorality of Ms. Lovett and Sweeney's collaboration. It is very bloody and if you don't like blood, this might throw you. It is SO bloody, however, that the frequency of the appearance of blood may diminish its dramatic impact. But maybe not. Anyway, consider yourself warned. Todd is determined to get his revenge on Turpin and along the way there are many twists and turns, both in his efforts to reclaim his daughter and in his relationships with some of the key figures. Burton is at his best with dark material-note his work with 'Nightmare before Christmas' and his work on the first two Batman films. This film and Victorian London are shot in gorgeously moody black and London except for a whimsical sequence in which Ms. Lovett expresses her desires for stability with Sweeney. Cinematography is beautiful in this film and the darkness of the material is not understated. There is some material which is very dark and Burton does not shrink from it so that the dark nature of the film is not lightened at all. However, it is always leavened by the bone-dry humor which serves to remind us that...it's all just a joke.The conclusion of the film is a propos, I'll leave it at that. Just remember that this film is very bloody and if blood makes you a little weak in the knees, you will not want to see this film. But Burton, Depp, and Bonham Carter are really at the top of their games here.",9,1,2,21 January 2008
The Town," Fair-to-middling heist/drama
","This is a fair heist movie. Ben Affleck again shows a light touch in teasing good performances out of actors, in pacing movies, and in writing a movie with a fair degree of sensitivity. He is very good as a director. I wouldn't say that this is the best heist/drama that I've ever seen. However, it's a fair way to spend a couple of hours and this isn't a film that is a great waste of time.Affleck gets some good acting from Jeremy Renner as his best buddy James and from Blake Lively, a down-on-her-luck girl supposed-to-be-the whore with the heart of gold. He is also quite good himself as the cool, tough leader of his crew which is composed of long-time friends who have worked in that group for a long time. Jon Hamm is serviceable, though not particularly notable as FBI investigator Adam Frawley. He's a competent, focused detective up to the task of tracking down very skilled bank robbers. Affleck is Doug, the leader of a successful, accomplished bank robber crew composed of longtime friends who have operated as a group for some time. The group's security is compromised when, in a heist gone wrong, Doug takes a hostage, but then, in order to insure that the hostage does not give away the crew, he tracks the hostage down but then becomes involved with her (Rebecca Hall of 'Frost/Nixon' as Claire). This relationship ultimately puts the crew in Frawley's cross-hairs.Ultimately, Doug and Adam are both sniffing around all available options, looking for clues as to whether their opposite number knows what they are up to. I found myself comparing the film unfavorably to 'Heat' in that the crew was not as sophisticated. I also thought that the plot of 'Heat' was more byzantine and brilliant, but that said, this is a serviceable crime drama with good performances, fair writing, and an interesting plot. I think that Affleck has again shown himself to be an excellent director although I do think his crime drama here is a bit derivative.",7,1,2,16 April 2011
Closer," Tired formulaic drama enlivened by excellent acting (J.R. excepted)
","To be honest, I was a bit disappointed by this movie. It was rich, stupid people acting stupidly and self-indulgently and then wondering why they hurt. That said, the acting, Julia Roberts excepted, is cathartic and rescues what could be a dull, particularly inert, self- indulgent film. From glancing over several of the comments, this film apparently first existed as a play. This seems sensible; the film is set in close quarters and thereby its existence as a play seems sensible. Two of the characters I found sympathy for and two of them I found really abhorrent. Julia Roberts' Anna is an artist who has very little will of her own. Jude Law is a deceitful, manipulative con-man struggling journalist named Dan who will engage in almost any ruse to get a woman in bed. Natalie Portman's Alice is a free-spirited stripper who is open-minded but ultimately lonely and while she might be able to maintain her independence and playfulness for some time, makes bad decisions in the end based on her need for companionship. Finally, Clive Owen's Larry is a blunt-speaking doctor who is possibly honest to a fault. He outlines his love for a woman also too early and his seemingly deep wells of passion possibly unnerve women who look for an ulterior motive when he is really just a straight-shooter. Initially, Dan charms Alice and they stay together for some while. However, on a routine errand, Dan becomes involved with Anna and while she seems uncomfortable with the arrangement, they nevertheless become involved in a high-wire particularly explosive relationship. Larry is a rock but flirts with Alice after learning where she works from speaking to Anna. Their interaction is flirtatious and electric, indeed, this reflecting on the stellar abilities of Owen and Portman, but not combustible. This is just flirting by people who are very good at it. Their relationship is consequently not as fiery or combative. In contrast, the tempestuousness of Dan and Anna's relationship and their dishonesty with their partners takes a toll on them and their relationship. The endgame seems to be a fair resolution of their behavior up to that point. The performances are all fantastic, except, as mentioned Julia Roberts. She seems to have only one mode in this film and it is morose. While of course that is fine for some of the film, there are electric moments of transcendence and passion when it would seem that her million-dollar grin and some of her famous charm might have made more of a display. Clive Owen lends a great deal of honesty, charm, and possibly desperation underlying it all, and Natalie Portman is electric as a vivacious and charismatic, if achingly insecure girl. Jude Law has never played such a deplorable character. His character is such a chauvinistic, two-faced cad one wonders that any woman would be deceived. However, it is testament to the desperation of the female characters in the movie and Law's considerable charm that he is able to sell this combination of characteristics as a successful ladies' man. Again, the story is rather formulaic-successful if conflicted people who behave as though they own the world and take chances with other peoples' hearts and then are surprised when they find themselves in pain and hurting others. However, as mentioned (and the directing is good. Mike Nichols allows his talented actors to work their magic here and lets the story tell itself) the galvanic acting ultimately distinguishes this film.",8,1,3,2 May 2007
Shutter Island," Excellent, well-made thriller
","While I thought some elements of 'Shutter Island' were a bit overplayed in order to superficially ratchet up the suspense (I most specifically refer to the ridiculous music at the beginning which suggests something particularly ominous is about to happen, although in how many films does something particularly ominous happen at the five minute mark?), overall, I found the film a worthwhile application of Scorese's encyclopedic film knowledge to the thriller genre. His decision to do this is comparable to his doing 'Age of Innocence' or 'Cape Fear' – it is a bit out of his comfort zone. But this is why Scorsese is a great director. As accomplished and critically acclaimed as he is, he is not afraid to push boundaries and attempt to tell a story in a different way, or even to work in an almost completely different genre, than he has before-and while perhaps 'The Age of Innocence' is not his best work, it was not terrible, reminding us again how well-versed in films, and also how talented, he is. Admittedly, he is certainly not a newbie to suspense. 'Cape Fear' was a fantastic re-make. I can't think of many better re-makes of films. It scared the pants out of me and I don't scare easily. In that film, he used a terrifying protagonist (portrayed memorably by one of his prime muses, DeNiro) to increase the suspense surrounding a judge who began to fear for his life when a convict he had sentenced completes his term and returns to try and make the judge's life miserable. Scorsese in that film didn't need to use any actual violence or gore in order to scare viewers. Our knowledge that DeNiro's character was out there, determined and fearless to exact revenge on the judge who had put him away, is enough to scare us. In 'Shutter Island', Scorsese delves into an admittedly different area in order to scare us, but once again, the fear of what we don't know far outweighs the terror of some gratuitous, splashy act of violence. In this instance, the film is about a US marshal approaching the eponymous island in an attempt to find a woman who has escaped. As DiCaprio and the excellent Mark Ruffalo's marshals seek answers from warden Ben Kingsley (at his most reptilian) and Max Von Sydow (who, seeming to have discovered the fountain of youth, becomes ever more chilling) about the whereabouts and the particulars of the woman's disappearance, they become increasingly enmeshed in a murky, shadowy world in which motives and simple sequences of events become more and more baffling. The cast assembled by Scorsese is fantastic, and he gets some wonderfully including some of the creepy performances from all of the leads – from Michelle Williams at her most opaque to the most detached Patricia Clarkson, from Ted Levine as an eerily vanilla warden to Elias Koteas as the lunatic Laeddis. For my money, this is not one of DiCaprio's best performances. It is fair, but his dramatic range in this performance doesn't seem to capture the true breadth of a man who is this troubled. His palette of emotions seems strangely mute for such a volatile character. That said, it is not his worst performance either. Compared to the rather thin presence he summoned in attempting to be a gang leader in 'Gangs of New York', this is excellent work. It isn't his charismatic tour-de-force in 'The Departed' or even his chameleon-like work in 'Catch Me If You Can', but he does convey a man who is ill at ease. That said, credit for the success of this picture has to go to Scorsese. His technical proficiency and ability to originally and excitingly tell a story are used masterfully here. The film was originally a book by Dennis Lehane (also the author of 'Mystic River' and 'Gone Baby Gone') and apparently (though I haven't read the book), Scorsese's re-telling of 'Shutter Island' is quite different from Lehane's. That it is so well reviewed and not too harshly criticized by devoted Lehane fans is a credit to the originality and quality of Scorsese's interpretation of the book. Many fans have said they saw through the final twist from the get-go and I don't deny that is possible. As for myself, I'm not interested in trying to out-think a director. I watch a film and take in the action without trying too much to anticipate what will happen. Perhaps you are one of those who saw the twist coming. If so, more power to you, but if you weren't trying to figure out what would happen, and were just letting the film wash over you, you shouldn't be criticized. Scorsese has originally re-interpreted an excellent piece of fiction and it's rare when a movie isn't significantly overshadowed by a picture. Again, not having read the book, I can't comment on that, but this is a well-made, somewhat scary film, so credit to Scorsese for that.",9,2,6,30 May 2010
Full Metal Jacket," Astonishing war movie
","The comments by many vets on this site, saying that this film to some degree reflects the nature of war, should be the highest praise for this film. I scanned the reviews looking for the comments of vets and found, in the first 14 pages, 6 vets stating that key elements of this film mirrored to some degree their experiences in Vietnam. I found this movie amazing. I agree with many of the more widely-held conclusions about this film. R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman is incredible, as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the tragic Pvt. Pyle. There certainly are two sections to this film, but the inspiration for both parts come from the same book and so, if both parts of the movie can be inspired by the same real lives, then it seems we should accept that both parts reflect different aspects of the military experience. I think that is fair. Capturing the emotional and psychological brutality of bootcamp, along with the horrors and the banality of war seem to be reasonable things to include in the same film.If anyone thinks that this film glamorizes war-from the death of Pvt. Pyle to the predicted destruction of the unit charged with taking out the sniper, as well as the sniper at the end of the film-they must be a psychopath.",10,3,3,6 December 2010
Gone Baby Gone," life is complicated
","...in contrast to the impression you get from much infotainment. 'Gone Baby Gone' reflects this complexity. I was mildly hopeful about this film given the intrigue of 'Mystic River'. 'Gone Baby Gone' looks deep into all of our souls and asks whether we will choose life or death. The reviews seems to capture the essence of the film very well and I haven't got much to add, but I would also like to recognize Ben Affleck's direction which I think became more assured as the film went on. I think at times he overstated the local flavor of the film at the beginning, as though there aren't a lot of other places in the country that can't boast similarly....and there was a part early in the movie in which I thought the climax had come too early. But the mystery just deepens and Ben Affleck grows more confident and at ease with some very delicate moral areas. As noted, Casey Affleck is...well yes, perhaps there is the whiff of nepotism, but in addition, he's really really really good. He is misread as a pretty boy throughout the movie when he actually has a quite clear moral vision. The challenges he and his detective partner and lover Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan playing her character as loving but reserved and professional, perhaps to retain some distance from the horrors of the world) face are endlessly astonishing; I like films such as this, like Mystic River and LA Confidential in which it seems the double-crosses never end, but I didn't see the depth of the horror here coming. The acting is, as also stated by many other posters, excellent. I found the flawed mother Helene McCready played very capably by Amy Ryan. Ryan captures the dangerous flaws of a very troubled woman for whom there may or may not be a lot of hope. Ultimately however, it is questionable whether her sins are more serious than some other characters'. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are typically able and Amy Madigan is perhaps the most conventional character in the film. Dennis Lehane's novel provides the source material for a wonderfully gritty movie, as it did for Mystic River and apparently another upcoming film, 'Shutter Island' which Scorsese has signed on to bring to the screen, and in which Leonardo DiCaprio is starring. But Ben Affleck's cool, assured direction is most crucial to translating this complex and soulful novel to the screen. This is a modern film in which the value of a human being is recognized.",10,1,4,26 November 2007
American Hustle," It coulda been a contendah!
","It's a very good film about ABSCAM, but the real scam is why he tries to tack on a love triangle to it. David O. Russell seems to want his film to be everything to everyone. This could be a great drama given the inherent drama of ABSCAM. I would have liked a more straight ahead drama because ABSCAM is a fascinating case whose innovative law enforcement work and colorful villains would make a great movie in and of themselves. There is some great acting in this film. Jeremy Renner conveys a lot of heart as the mayor of Camden. Robert DeNiro absolutely steals his scene as a mob boss' right-hand man. It's the best role he's had for some time. Christian Bale is so versatile and is able to completely inhabit the characters he plays. He is one of the best actors working these days. Jennifer Lawrence is great - very brave and passionate. Shea Whigham is very good in a small role business associate of Bale's character. Elizabeth Rohm is great as Renner's wife. Amy Adams is fair but she doesn't command attention in the way that Lawrence does. I don't think Bradley Cooper showed a lot of range in Silver Linings Playbook or in this. When he tries to convey anger, he just sounds desperate. The film is well written and the final twist is great, but this seems like it should have been divided into two movies. The tone of the film is so uneven that I can't give it a higher rating. The plot has a lovely twist at the end, but for me, the love triangle plot line was a big distraction. Some of the awkwardness among the characters is even played for laughs which also seems to detract from the possibility of showcasing how ABSCAM was investigated. David O. Russell is a fantastic director. I have enjoyed all of his films, but to me, his earlier films - most especially Flirting with Disaster and Three Kings showed his great ability to establish a consistent tone throughout complicated movies better than his last two. He needs to simplify a bit.",7,0,3,12 March 2014
Léon: The Professional," If you don't like this, we can't be friends.
","Somehow I missed this incredible film when it came out. I was in college and studying pretty hard. Anyway....better late than never. This is a film that conveys how amazing humans are - from sadistic maniacs to tender hit men. The complexity of the behaviors, the abilities of the characters to make largely believable choices based on their moral codes, and some astonishing performances from some incredible actors make this a film you must like if we're ever going to see each other again.The principals give us some incredible performances. Jean Reno as Leon is astonishing. His ability to convey a million feelings with a blink of his eyes, a stiffening of his shoulders, or even the intake of breath make him someone I could watch in anything. I loved loved loved him in Ronin and this has only increased my love of the guy. I'm not gay but if I watch Leon enough, I might soon be! I will have to check out more of his work. His modesty, loyalty, decency, complexity, his tenderness and firmness with Mathilda (Natalie Portman), his steadfastness, and his courage make him one of my favorite movie characters in any film. I thought I wouldn't need to use any more superlatives for Natalie Portman having watched Heat about 50 times but she was younger in this film and she gives a performance with even more range than she showed in Heat. I'm happy to be able to see her work (even though I thought Black Swan was pretentious, predictable, melodramatic pablum). Her ability to convey anger, fearfulness, tenderness, confidence (I loved her peremptory dismissal of the four boys trying to protect their claim to neighborhood turf), and burgeoning sexuality (fortunately this part of the film doesn't quite take the film off course though I was worried for a second) while most definitely being a kid (she loves cartoons!!!) is amazing. Having said that, the best thing about Mathilda is her resilience. She is a survivor and this trait is Mathilda's baseline characteristic. Portman is just an incredibly gifted actress and her performance here is almost enough to leave me speechless.Danny Aiello is fantastic as Leon's loyal friend. He is a rock for Leon and asks no questions. He can always be trusted. Aiello conveys the sense of a man who cannot be shaken and is a true friend. He's probably heard it all and yet he's still there for his friend. Honestly, I thought Oldman was a bit over the top in his role. Obviously he is supposed to be out of control but I thought this was self-parodic, even for him. Luc Besson is never better at the helm and as a writer. His steady hand is much in evidence in keeping such a wild plot on pace and finding the emotional and moral centers of the film. The script is fantastic - a hit-man with a heart of gold, a precocious tweener, and a psychotic, crooked cop. Really, if you don't like this film, we can't be friends.",10,4,6,6 December 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Nice but a bit by the numbers
","Having read a lot of comments here, I didn't realize the similarity between this film and a National Lampoon's film (Summer Vacation?). I've seen part of that film but I'm not versed in its popularity and certainly didn't know it well enough to identify the similarities shared by 'Little Miss Sunshine'. This is a decent film. The acting is really top-flight. Greg Kinnear is astonishingly underrated. He is great in 'The Matador', 'As Good As It Gets', and certainly in this. Alan Arkin is at his acidic, grouchy best. As another commenter noted, he could have done this in his sleep-but it doesn't make his performance any the worse. Toni Collette is brilliant. She is as consistent as Kinnear-check out 'About a Boy' for a fabulous performance and of course 'The Sixth Sense'. Also, she was really really good in 'Priscilla's Queen of the Desert'. Abigail Breslin-well, as children's performances go, I think this is an excellent one. She does not attempt to play up her cuteness-and this just makes her all the more lovable. I'm not an expert on actors, but it would seem she has some great acting instincts. Paul Dano is very very good if a bit underused. Steve Carell I knew was very very talented from the range he showed in doing fake news reports on 'The Daily Show' and also the realistic undercurrent to 'The Forty-Year-Old Virgin'. He is very good here too although to me his character seemed a little stereotyped. I would say the same thing for Kinnear's. C'mon-a motivational speaker who...surprise surprise....isn't as good as he thinks. Wow. I'm shocked. Shocked. The encounter of Carell's character with the man who had been favored by his crush, and whose rejection had prompted Carell's character's suicide attempt seems unlikely to the extreme. I think we, if we live long enough and have fairly eventful lives, might meet someone we know a little, perhaps in an unlikely place, but, in the middle of nowhere to meet the person who was with the man who had something to do with your suicide attempt? Really really really pushing the grounds of credibility. I must say that I wanted to dislike this movie. However, the acting is so good that if you can tolerate the cardboard thin stereotypical 'indie' characters I've mentioned and some other rote situations, the quality of the acting and the conviction which the actors bring to their performances should at least win over some of your good will by the end of the film.",7,0,0,8 March 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Generous, funny film
","This is one of the funnier films to come out of Hollywood since perhaps Being John Malkovich. Steve Carell as Andy Stitzer plays a fairly normal but shy and reticent about getting involved with women after being rejected as a youngster. Still, he is not, as I mentioned, particularly unusual unless you think that riding a bicycle in Los Angeles and collecting toys is particularly unusual. However he gets along well with other people and has perhaps even a plausible apartment in Hollywood given how he pays nothing on a car. He has a decent job but seems quite happy in his life. This is one difference between this and other films about someone trying to connect with someone, ore even make sexual conquests (American Pie, Porky's etc.). He doesn't seem like he ___needs___ this contact, but after a couple of hilarious missteps (a terrifying ride with a drunk and extremely needy woman (Leslie Mann) as well as a flirtation with a wild bookstore clerk (Elizabeth Banks)) he finally connects with a woman who has a business across the road from the entertainment superstore where he works, the Best Buy-Smart Tech (the immensely talented Catherine Keener). The film plot in itself is quite pedestrian, but as so often is the case, the devil is in the details, and the film is plotted out quite carefully and with many colorful supporting characters. Foul-mouthed Mooj (Gerry Bednob), thoughtful Jay (Romany Malco), smooth and just maybe obsessed David (Paul Rudd), stoner Cal (Seth Rogen), and sexually frustrated store manager (Jane Lynch) are not cruel to Andy when his secret is discovered. However, his unease is certainly lampooned and he is not immune from the gentle barbs and good- natured ribbing of his co-workers. However, it is always just that-good-natured. In the tradition of American Pie and Animal House, debauchery without malice makes this film lovable and also very funny. The writing is very funny and there are sequences such as Jay's face off with another black man, David and Cal's claims as to why the other is gay, and Andy taking Cal's advice on simply asking women questions. There are some very funny scenes in the film and it is very, very, very funny.",10,1,2,16 January 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Movie unsure of its identity
","Like they say, the truth is stranger than fiction. There's a reason this movie is not invented wholly out of someone's imagination but is based on the Whole Earth movement of the military in the '70s and early '80s. After the failure of the US military in Vietnam, it's not surprising that the Pentagon would put everything on the table and look for alternative methods to improve its fighting abilities. Yes, using mind control and 'remote viewing' and psychic abilities might seem unlikely, but given the zeitgeist and the general disillusion with how things were at that time, it's not completely implausible. The Internet did originate from the Pentagon so if you can poke your friends on Facebook, you can thank the military. Anyway, I found the backstory-told in flashback by milquetoast midwestern reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan MacGregor) more interesting than what was being done in the present with the information. The different non-traditional methods of warfare had been conceived by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) who had a revelation when he realized how much his men instinctively did not want to kill a fellow human being. His research was funded by the Pentagon and he traversed various counter-cultural groups during six years during the '70s, acquiring information which the Pentagon thought might be useful in fighting in a less traditional way.Cut to the present and reporter Wilton arrives in Iraq and meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) who Wilton had heard of during the course of reporting a story. They set to complete Cassady's work as a contractor and after freeing themselves from some dicey situations in which they are able to use some non-traditional methods of fighting, they finally encounter Django, working for one of Cassady's rivals, Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey). Working for Hooper, Django has been co-opted in order to use his non-traditional methods to actually kill the enemy.The plot at this point is quite weak. I found the last 35 minutes or so quite meandering and very unfocused. It seems director Grant Heslov (who also wrote the excellent 'Good Night and Good Luck') wasn't sure whether he wanted a goofball comedic work or a road trip movie, or a film with tougher social commentary and ultimately he got none. The movie seems to peter out, to me. There definitely is a good film here, but this is not really it. George Clooney gives a dynamite performance, deadpanning such goofy responses that one can't help but grin. MacGregor's character is a bit bland to begin with but he certainly does not enliven him. One can't really blame his wife for leaving him. Kevin Spacey performs very well. Jeff Bridges has charisma to burn and his work here reminds me of the spacey Lebowski in the cult 'Big Lebowski' film. He is an extremely talented actor and conveys well the not-frequently-portrayed character of a counter-culture soldier.This is an enjoyable film-the script is quite good, the acting is solid, and the very fact that something similar to the events that happened in this movie occurred is amazing. However, the film ultimately tries to be too many things at once and fails.",5,2,4,12 December 2010
Tropic Thunder," Clever Hollywood parody but Downey's role was poorly thought out
","Ben Stiller's satire on the movie industry is a very entertaining, if somewhat troubling movie. I say somewhat troubling because I do find the famous decision to have Robert Downey Jr.'s character (typically excellent as high-minded Australian actor Kirk Lazarus) be made-up to appear black. This does not seem right to me. While the intent may have been to parody the pretentiousness of actors who believe there is no role which they cannot depict. Perhaps Stiller intended Downey Jr.'s part as mocking arrogant actors, but many viewers will see simply broad satire by a white man made up to look black and which might bring to mind the idea of minstrelsy. I do not think it was a good idea while I don't believe that Stiller really intended offense.This major reservation aside, the film itself is quite a well-directed parody at many sacred cows of Hollywood, including self-important, rather strange agents (Matthew McConaughey having a great time playing against type), egomaniacal, profane studio moguls (Tom Cruise also enjoying mocking the power of which he is a prominent symbol), dopey movie franchises (don't miss the fake trailers at the beginning of the film, they are hilarious), drug use among stars (Jack Black's character, Jeff Portnoy is a serious drug addict and star of some very dopey films and whose habits lead to some very inventive, funny, scenes relating to his effort to beat the addictions), the extravagant demands of stars on shoots, stars sad efforts at serious movie roles, and many other Hollywood institutions ripe for satire. There are quite a few pointed, self-mocking cameos which elicited some of the biggest laughs of the film. I found Cruise quite funny in his role but I am perhaps not as impressed at his turn parodying power because his role in 'Magnolia', nearly 10 years ago, was not terribly different. That said, the parody of the many elements of Hollywood directed by Stiller is very well-done. Jack Black is funny as the aforementioned irredeemably drug-addicted action star. Downey Jr. is, as mentioned, typically excellent, in spite of the offensiveness of the material. Nick Nolte also enjoys his part as the soldier whose exploits the crew were attempting to bring to the screen before the movie production, to the ignorance of some of the cast, became a real battle.",5,2,5,24 August 2008
Enchanted," Intolerable
","As if regular life isn't tough enough...and expectations for men to be Prince Charming aren't demanding enough, now women have movie-inspired notions of a supposedly more realistic fairy tale prince....if of course, your supposed real-life savior is Patrick Dempsey from Grey's Anatomy. Supposedly this is how things would play out if someone came from a fantasy land to NYC. (Seriously...haven't we seen enough of NYC? Why not Topeka? Or Louisville? Or Milwaukee? Or Pierre...anywhere but NYC) Only this person doesn't know, or doesn't seem particularly concerned with trying to figure out, or explain where this fantasy land (titled Andalusia for the movie) is. This girl, played with the fairy tale airiness of a princess quite well by Amy Adams somehow emerges in New York and doesn't seem even to have any worry that she can't get home or that her family might be concerned or that she can't call them, or other mundane concerns. All she is concerned about is that her prince Edward find her. I won't give away any more of the movie, but this mixing of fantasy and reality is really insidious. To suggest that New Yorkers would treat people running around, quite clearly without any irony, fighting chivalric fairy tale battles, wearing faux-medieval garb and stabbing people-or that such people-if indeed they were people, would not be a bit more concerned about their immediate safety and how to get back to where they came from, is idiotic. And now, supposedly, we have a recipe for a 'more realistic' fairy tale. We have no such thing. There is no such thing and women should come to terms with it...this just raises expectations. Yeah, you can say I'm taking this too seriously, and that's fine, maybe in some ways I am, but let's not pretend that entertainment doesn't have an effect on young tweener and adolescent girls. This just muddies the waters further and confuses expectations for young girls...and really, how can men compete with McDreamy? Yeah, I didn't like this movie.",3,13,49,24 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," Coens bringing their A-game
","Wow, if you want to see some talented filmmakers operating at the top of their game, check this one out. The unusual thing is that, uh, I think one can make a case that they've been operating at the top of their game-well, I suppose it depends on how much you like their work. Certainly I'd say since Fargo; I can't comment on films too much before that because I am not as familiar with their work before that time. Anyway, this film is a cold-eyed, intellectually honest, unshrinking parable of the bleakness of life in the US these days. The film is set in 1980 but its coldness and cynicism would seem to ring true today. It's based on a Cormac McCarthy novel which I must read. As has been widely documented, there is a lot of violence, but also healthy servings of trademark Coen brothers humor. The film is about the aftermath of a drug-smuggling transaction gone wrong and how welder Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin-in a performance for which he should receive an Oscar nomination and an award would not be out of the question), a hard-eyed, perhaps in over his head Regular Guy who realizes he's very lucky and perhaps also realizes how much trouble he is in, even if he doesn't want to admit it to himself, is caught in the crosshairs of a lunatic bagman (Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh in a role to, uh, kill for) who is trying to retrieve the money. Bardem's hair is, as many others have noticed, styled rather ubiquitously. His coldness and focus is identified by Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson, who turns in a fair performance, but whose acting range seems limited) who is hired to attempt to retrieve the money for the other side but whose manner is much more laconic. It is difficult to think of more intense characters than Chigurh in recent movies. His intensity may be a symptom of desperate times, but Chigurh displays some humanity in a scene in which he engages rather more intensely in convenience-store banter than is normal. The inevitability and fury with which Chigurh pursues the money is broken up by his philosophical encounter at an out-of-the- way convenience store.The Coen brothers keep the plot moving along briskly and they refrain from music which might tip their hands as to how the audience should react. The movie is ultimately a metaphor for a rather fractured and lonely era in the United States and the seeming inevitability of disaster in the film is only broken by random, seemingly insignificant scenes such as a good deed Llewelyn which is thwarted early in the film, and by a scene featuring Tommy Lee Jones (perfectly cast as a world-weary and mystified sheriff, aghast at the untrammeled evil with which he has to deal) as Sheriff Ed Bell and his wife (Tess Harper). Jones also provides narrative framing of the film which sets the tone of horror at the depths to which people have sunk. The Coen brothers really pace the movie beautifully though, enabling it to progress without dwelling excessively on one scene. As a parable for the modern era, this film cannot be beat. Come Oscar time, it's quite possible that Brolin, Bardem, the Coens, and their breathtaking film, will be honored.",10,1,8,7 December 2007
Batman Begins," Vastly overrated
","Liam Neeson as a zen-spouting Asian crimelord (who has told Batman he's a master criminal, but yet Batman continues to trust him)? Katie Holmes remains typecast. A romance to forget. However, Morgan Freeman is excellent. I liked the idea of his revelation of how Batman's gadgets worked. And Michael Caine could not have been better cast as Alfred. However, again, the Neeson spectacle. Neeson with a Fu Manchu moustache.....yet curiously, speaking English devoid of the rough N. Ireland accent.....and then lecturing Batman about how he was unready for the challenge of fighting the evils of....what? Especially since Neeson had already told him, when they first met, that he was to be initiated into some sort of elite criminal organization. Yeesh. And all that Zen stuff Liam was spouting. I think Liam was perhaps stuck in character from the Star Wars flic. Oyyy. I think the days of Irish people passing for Chinese, simply by virtue of sporting Fu Manchu moustaches, should be long over. If you really wish to see Liam at his best, check out Rob Roy or Michael Collins or Gangs of NY or of course Schindler's List. This really isn't one he should promote notably on his resume. I really didn't see any advice that he gave to Batman that might have been convincing in transforming him into some sort of fearless warrior. A lot of the most pat psychobabble. And really, claiming his father didn't do all he could seemed a lame and illegitimate effort. Besides, the kid was of the age that he would have known what was going on-you'd certainly remember an event like that and I think if anyone calls out your dead father in such an insulting manner, you'd tear them limb from limb. Anyway....and lovely insensitive comment from the hospital staff in writing off his parents in front of the little kid. That was truly a special touch. And the pat romance was truly nauseating. So supposedly the Katie Holmes character has yearned for Batman for seven years. However, when they meet, can you say anti-climax? I've met friends after such a length of time and it's hard for either of us to avoid tripping over the words of the other, we're so eager to speak. Yet she basically just speaks of a bit of regret of what might have been. She doesn't even find out what he's been doing. To his credit, Christian Bale was excellent. Only Val Kilmer has not been that good as Batman. I think Bale is very good. Kilmer wasn't very good. Keaton was terrific and understated. Still, it's unfair to compare this film to the first two Batman flics and Michael Keaton and Tim Burton. This is a total sell-out in the sense that it offers a pat romantic relationship to supposedly fill the void and some nonsensical 'mentoring' by the leader of some sort of underworld organization. And the action scene at the end is a serious anti-climax. I tried sleeping through the last 20 minutes of the obligatory fight but the theater was too loud. Nevertheless, some good ideas. Ultimately very disappointing attempt to capitalize on the big-movie summer event sort of film when this really could have established Batman's backstory. Oh well, my brother and sis-in-law enjoyed it. Still, big step down for Chris Nolan after the vastly underrated Insomnia and terrific Memento.",4,0,2,26 July 2005
Cars," Another great Pixar film
","Cars takes the themes of maturity and development and, with Pixar's usual grace and wit, animates them in the context of a world of anthropomorphized cars. The animation is so realistic that you would swear that the skies and cars in some scenes are photographed. The science of animation has advanced a long way since Toy Story (1995). However-and this is perhaps the ultimate irony about the success of Pixar -as inventive as the animation has been-and it has been fantastic, their films have been most characterized by intelligent and witty storytelling. This might say as much about the paucity of intelligently written films currently but nevertheless, Pixar has become well-known more for the intelligence of its screenplays. Some animated films succeed without good stories, and some fail without them, but the common thread among Pixar films has ensured that the films have usually been critically lauded, if not always (though the majority of the time) financially successful.This film is very enjoyable although I do not think it is Toy Story quality. The film is about a car in the heat of a championship race with one classy, legendary car, The King (Richard Petty playing some version of his real life persona, presumably) and a tough, hard-nosed and also quite successful car, Chick Hicks (a wonderful Michael Keaton) in the prime of his career who intends to concede nothing to the brash up-and-coming star, Lightning McQueen, a rather oddly-named car referencing the connection of Steve McQueen to race-car films, voiced by Owen Wilson, who imbues the car's, um, character with a youthful cockiness which is tamed somewhat over time as he learns some tough lessons about his abilities and about how to relate to others. Wilson conveys a wide variety of emotions that convey the transformation which his, um, car's character undergoes. The end of the film is not predictable but is in keeping with the remainder of the film. Bonnie Hunt is fantastic as the love interest in the film, a car, um, lawyer named Sally Carerra who made a lot of money as a big city lawyer but yearned for the more relaxed pace of life of a town named Radiator Springs which she came across while vacationing. While the town is considered backwards by some, during the film its inhabitants are depicted as good, decent people and the value of people over superficial attributes is determined. Several actors depict a wide range of varied characters, with particular credit due Cheech Marin, Larry the Cable Guy depicting a somewhat slow lifelong resident of Radiator Spring, Jenifer Lewis as the energetic general store owner, and also recommended performances from Paul Newman as the city's de facto leader, a man who has a secret unknown to anyone in the city, and George Carlin as a rather tired conglomeration of '60s clichÃ©s. As said, the animation is amazing and on many occasions, it seems an animated scene is real. There are lots of clever references, as is usually the case in Pixar movies, to real events and figures which gives the film a sophisticated undertone that will entertain adults while the animation and colorful characters will certainly amuse children. While this isn't Toy Story, it's nevertheless a very, very good film and better than the vast majority of mainstream fare during the summer.",9,0,0,24 July 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The kids are (maybe) alright
","Gorgeously shot, well-acted battle over the soul of a talented, aristocratic young martial artist, Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi). Her petulance is matched by her martial arts gifts which have been honed at the foot of the evil Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Cheng). Jen's petulance and her abilities create all sorts of complications which Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) solve with magnanimity and grace. The masters have dedicated their lives to mastery of their chosen art and Jen tests their every ounce of skill and patience.The direction is calm and assured and the look of the film is glorious. The fight scenes are otherworldly and the acting, from all major players is excellent. Beneath the surface of the story are hardly kept-in-check passions and the acting, from the leads to Cheng Chang as Dark Cloud, Pei Pei Cheng as Jade Fox, and Sihung Lung as local respected elder Sir Te captures the controlled passions well. The story of a girl whose talents warrant a lot of patience is gorgeous, melancholy, and well- done by everyone involved. The subject matter is of universal interest so this is a movie you could watch and re-watch.",9,0,0,27 October 2013
The Lives of Others," Incredible study of corrosive effect of eavesdropping
","This film won the Oscar for best foreign film in 2007 and from my point-of-view is quite deserving of the Oscar. I hear Pan's Labyrinth was fantastic and I heard also that 'Water' was very good. That said, I do not think it would be a pox on the judgment of the Academy in the future that Das Leben was awarded the Oscar because I imagine it compares favorably, or at least is in the same class, as two of those other films, and probably the other nominees as well. The film covers the lives and activities of those on both sides of the Stasi (East German secret police) from 1984 over a period of several years and then tracks the fallout from this activity through the period around the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the early 1990s. The premise for the film is intriguing and unlike anything I have ever seen before. It follows one East German Stasi agent named Wiesler (a very controlled and seething and fantastic Ulrich Muehe) as he eavesdrops on the wiretapped apartment of a prominent playwright, Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) who the Secret Police wants to oversee because of concerns about his loyalty to the state. The do not have more specific suspicions than that, but the Stasi is feeling more pressured to uphold the image of Communism in East Germany and so they are cracking down on supposed heterodoxy in whatever form it takes. As time goes on however, Wiesler becomes increasingly disenchanted with the surveillance which he is implementing for the Stasi and questioning of its purpose. He starts to wonder whether the surveillance of Dreyman and his girlfriend Christa Marie (Martina Gedeck) an artist who may or may not be as committed to resisting the pressures of the Stasi as he is Dreyman becomes increasingly involved in revealing a health problem in East Germany. This health problem is not widely known in the West. It is a complex and riveting movie about the changing loyalties and devotion of people to differing points-of-view. It is a film not to be missed about the development and changes of people. The direction by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is fantastic. The subtle shift in change of attitude for Wiesler, becoming more personally sympathetic while covering his tracks and prohibiting his advancement minded boss, the slithery Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur in a fantastically precise performance), in the hands of the wrong director, could easily change the tone of the film to the point that his opposition became obvious and the Stasi took obvious, punitive, humiliating retaliation against him. But von Donnersmarck is more interested in the subtle change of attitudes over time. Wiesler changes so subtly, that it is some time before the Stasi recognizes it and precisely because if his change of attitude happened very quickly he would have been eliminated instantaneously.The film is an interesting study of the effects of surveillance not only on its targets and how their lives change, but also on those who do the surveilling. It is a reflection that surveilling exposes the agents to supposedly revolutionary beliefs and there is the chance that they will be changed by the people and beliefs that they are attempting to surveille.",10,1,2,2 May 2007
I Am Legend," Smith, resolution of film are good
","I gotta say, I was all ready to sneer at this movie for mythologizing the last man on Earth (like, would you really be most upset that someone ate your bacon when you haven't seen another human for three years? Would you really be that upbeat and have your wits about you to that degree after three years without human contact? Would you be so hard-headed as to separate yourself from your young family and solve a probably intractable problem as Smith's character does?) but in the end, I found that the resolution of the film made it worthwhile. If you can accept that someone could survive as they do in New York in that state for three years, I think you can appreciate the manner in which the film is resolved, in a positive, but realistic tone. Smith is very good although not much is asked of him. That is no diminution of him though and he as charismatic and compelling as ever. However, the director structures the action and plot well, identifying the manner in which Smith's character lives when he is supposedly the last man on earth, then introducing some challenging elements to his way of life. Smith's character looks into the threat posed by some disturbing creatures and finds out how the human race might continue. An enjoyable diversion.",7,0,2,6 January 2008
Kick-Ass," Great self-aware superhero movie for superhero fans
","If you see every superhero movie, if you appreciate Superman more than the average bear, if you get the sense that you have a little too much faith in superheroes, this might just be the movie for you. However, it'd probably be best if you like a film like 'Pulp Fiction' and/or the 'Kill Bills' too because there is lots of violence and lots of filthy language in this one. Confused yet? This film is about some regular-that is to say anonymous-high schoolers, who are frustrated in understanding girls, they like comic books, they mercilessly insult one another-but in a friendly way. Well, one of these boys, Dave (Aaron Johnson-likable in a shaggy-dog way and well-chosen for the part), in the midst of one the endless neurotic, intense conversations that teenagers have about the course of their lives, about members of the opposite sex, about things they like, concludes that there's no reason why a superhero shouldn't try and save the world. So he sets out to be that superhero, making his own hilariously tacky superhero costume and finding himself in over his head when he realizes that knives will still injure him. It's inspiring the degree to which he believes one person can make a difference and quite funny but as audience members, we obviously know that he doesn't really have any superpowers and that if his attempt to disarm the bad guys fail, that he will be seriously injured. Dave's sweet naiveté is the very trait however, which buys him the good-will that ensures we will root for and follow his adventures throughout the film.Like Tarantino, this film combines some rather mundane characters and some rather outrageous escapades. However, because the characters' reactions are so sensible and identifiable, we don't squirm or root against them. The things that they do and say seem like sensible responses to events which occur in their life. It is precisely the earthiness of the characters that keeps the plot from seeming exploitative or outrageous. As the movie continues, Dave knows that his superhero powers are limited but it doesn't diminish his desire to do some good. However, he is more realistic about the challenges he can surmount and after he lowers his expectations, he is able to do some good. In doing some good, he crosses paths with another young, would-be superhero, Hit-Girl (played with ruthless cuteness by the talented young actress Chloe Moretz, who I'm sure we will be hearing more of) who gallivants around town, attempting to right wrong although it turns out, her actions are not motivated simply by a desire to impose moral order in the world. Her father is Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage playing with abandon and panache and reminding us once again just how talented he can be when he decides not to cash in for an easy check) and he's the most immoral father you have ever seen on screen, I'd venture to guess. Also excellent in the film are Frank D'Amico as ruthless mob boss Mark Strong and his needy son Chris D'Amico (played with a wonderful playfulness by Chris Mintz-Plasse of 'McLovin' fame). The supporting roles are also filled quite adequately by a variety of lesser lights. The tone of this film might be the most impressive thing over which director Matthew Arnold has control. On the one hand, the violence is so graphic that if one were to allow it without leavening it with fairly mundane characters, the film would be rather sensationalist. On the other hand, if he allowed his characters to talk and be neurotic too much, it would be just another neurotic fanboy film about teenagers much too obsessed with superheroes. As it is, the director has struck a nice balance, playing the naiveté of teenagers off the wild, anarchic results of some sensible decisions. The movie feels like a Tarantino film-intelligent people who like to discuss things combined with some graphic violence. Like Tarantino's flics, the choice of music is crucial and helpful in establishing the direction of the film also.The screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Arnold, and the (presumably) excellent comic book by John Romita Jr. and Mark Millar are, as said, very good. It would have been very easy to go wrong with the tone, and that Arnold captures regular people who recognize their limitations but who strive on all the same, often to hilarious and clever results, is a tribute to Arnold's management of the tone and direction of the film.",10,5,13,30 May 2010
No Man's Land," War - what is it good for?
","Nothing. This movie certainly makes that point. There's not a whole lot that comes off smelling like roses in this movie except the gallows humor of Serbs and Bosnians, the general competence of the grunts and one determined French officer. There is a self-important, oversexed general, disinterested, uninformed troops, disdain, racism, disputes over command, misinformation for the public, and ambitious reporters, among other things. Definitely not a PR pic for war. There are no winners. Good acting, a fantastic script and direction.....absolutely riveting viewing.Director Danis Tanovic also wrote the film and his bleak view of war certainly resonated with me, and obviously Oscar voters as this won Best Foreign Film in '01. All soldiers should be required to watch this before signing up.",10,1,6,18 March 2014
Million Dollar Baby," Excellent film from a true Renaissance man
","Congrats to all responsible for the film. I'm writing this a couple hours after Oscars finished- yup, that's right, it's now 2008. Nah seriously, this is an excellent film. One wouldn't know what the film was about from the previews. Not that one should. Nevertheless, typically accomplished work from Clint. And this time, he wrote the music too. If he could film the movie and be in it at the same time, he could cut down on salaries to people by minimizing the number of people in the production. All that said, Morgan Freeman is excellent, though really the Oscar is a bit of a typically Hollywood, guilt-ridden, let's-right-wrongs Oscar. That being said, he's one of the best, and he's as good as ever. One's tempted to take him for granted, he's that good. I think I'm going to have to go back and see 'Unforgiven' again to see him collaborating with Clint again. Hilary Swank is excellent. She didn't deserve the Oscar, I'm sorry. Obviously, much of the Academy hadn't seen 'Vera Drake' or she wouldn't have gotten it. I haven't seen 'Maria Full of Grace' so don't know how that lady's performance measured up. All that being said, Swank really is a very talented actress. The film itself, well, some nice elements to it. Swank conveys winsomeness and determination as well as any actress this side of Jodie Foster. The characters tend toward stock, but really, they are nicely colored to the point that the story is not disabled by their blandness. Clint takes what might be a straight-forward sports biopic and makes it something so much more. This is a very enjoyable movie.",9,5,8,28 February 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Perfect
","This film is that good. Another reason why you just make the film you want to make and get out of the way. 93 minutes. Tight, well-constructed, and wonderful. Clooney depicts another time, but yet the film resonates oh-so-strongly in this era. I thought several times of Bill O'Reilly or Tucker Carlson or some such pinhead in the role of 'the junior senator from Wisconsin' but unfortunately, as another commenter mentioned, and has been well- documented, there really isn't a media figure of Murrow's stature in this day and age who has the nerve to, as the saying goes, 'speak truth to power'. Murrow's coolness under pressure, nerve, knowledge of his obligations, and the opportunity that he had seem to be sorely missing in this day and age while America craves an anchor or media figure with such integrity. The choice of Murrow's opening speech in which he foresees a dim future for for television if it isn't used wisely is quite prescient when one considers just how much garbage has been featured in the last 50 years. The broadcast of Murrow's celebrity interviews were particularly amusing in that after them, and after the program wrapped, while the staff congratulated him, he just reclined and took deep breaths of smoke (seeing an anchor smoke was funny) and inhaling deeply while he considered just how useless the piece had been. I'm not old enough to have seen Murrow or have any memory of the period but I am aware at least of his name. And it's very interesting to see Murrow taking his journalism so seriously and his consideration of what was important. He recognized that McCarthy was essentially a bully and that if bullies are challenged directly that their 'ideas' will not stand and they certainly won't. So it was with McCarthy. Murrow recognized that McCarthy was going to come after him personally as that was all that he had. This was the problem for the newsman (Don Hollenbeck-played as heartbreakingly sensitive by Ray Wise) who couldn't abide the criticism of his reporting-when really all he should have done is realized who was criticizing him and that he did not have much integrity-either that or not read the reviews, as Murrow suggested. All the same, the film seemed to me to have a lot of relevance for today and I think Clooney, notwithstanding his well-known liberal sympathies-made this film as a means of reminding America, and particularly media movers and shakers-of their responsibility to use their power for good. The performances were very good, particularly the astonishing David Strathairn. While, as mentioned, I didn't remember this period of American history and Murrow's demeanor, other commenters have noted Strathairn's accuracy in his depiction of Murrow and it would seem that with such particular mannerisms and demeanor that he was going for a something very specific. In any case, his very economical, efficient performance seemed to capture the integrity and reserve of Murrow. Robert Downey Jr. is truly one of the best American actors, in spite-and maybe because, of all the things he's gone through. He was great in Chaplin 14 (wow, 14) years ago and he's still very very talented. Frank Langella is wonderful as the CBS President Bill Paley who feels put-upon by advertisers and the government but yet protects editorial independence. Again, I was concerned that no network President would today have the editorial integrity that Paley had. The inclusion of Dianne Reeves' vocals, not to mention the almost omnipresent smoke and clean black and white cinematography seems to enhance the clear moral dimension underpinning the film. Clooney himself is excellent and his direction, as mentioned, keeps the film moving along briskly so that it clocks in at a lovely 93 minutes. You will want to see this film again and again. I haven't seen Brokeback Mt. or King Kong or Syriana, but I can't imagine that Brokeback would be better. Syriana...well...anyway. I would certainly favor Mr. Strathairn for Best Actor.",10,3,5,21 January 2006
The Departed," Fantastic tense, complicated, well-acted, dark mob movie
","Great movie. Scorsese back on familiar footing. We are definitely seeing him from his good side here. He even uses 'Gimme Shelter' in the soundtrack as he did in 'Goodfellas'. If it ain't broke right? And he elicits Leo DiCaprio's best performance since.....well, from what I've heard though I haven't seen it, The Basketball Diaries ('95). Anyway, the movie is a re-make of a Hong Kong flick named Wu jian dao (2002), English title 'Infernal Affairs' and one of the screenwriters in the original, Siu Fai Mak, gets a writing credit in this one too.The story is about two moles, both undercover, one in the mob (DiCaprio), and one in the police force (Damon). They come to learn about one another, not their specific identities, but at least of the existence of one another, and they become gradually more intent on exposing the identity of the other knowing that their identity might soon be revealed. It is a fantastic movie, nicely nuanced and appropriately complex without losing the thrill of the chase. Scorsese paces the movie energetically and with enough regard for fleshing out his characters as well. Jack Nicholson is fantastic, revealing all of the characteristics that have made him so vulnerable to parody in recent years but simultaneously offering those very features which have made him a legend. This is a fine performance and he deserves an Oscar nomination, as does DiCaprio, who, playing the young man from the wrong side of the tracks, ultimately shows himself to be more upright than Damon (excellent as usual)'s widely respected, but ultimately treacherous cop. Fantastic supporting turns from Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Vera Farmiga as the woman caught between the two moles.This film was deservedly placed on many Top Ten lists of the best of the year pictures. It is a fantastic movie and stands up to repeated viewings which you will most likely desire in order, possibly, to trace the machinations of the movie. The movie is not that complicated though, so you may just want to go to recognize some of the best movie-making around.",10,1,3,11 January 2007
There Will Be Blood," Fantastically ambitious and ultimately successful depiction of greed in America
","Having read a lot of reviews of this movie from other users, it seems to me they are missing the whole point of the film. Many decry the movie as not grabbing their attention via the characters, they find the music distracting, they find that nothing happens. I really don't know what movie these people are watching. This is certainly an ambitious movie and sometimes people react against films which they perceive are overly pretentious or ambitious and that is fine if the film does not make a strong case for the truth of its arguments. However I do not understand the questions of many of the critics of the film here-well, anymore than I understand why so many people like so many terrible movies. I found the film excellent. Paul Thomas Anderson (of the fantastic Boogie Nights, the very underrated Punch Drunk Love, and the excellent Magnolia) has adapted the novel 'Oil' by Upton Sinclair to compose a film about the effect of corrosive greed and religious hucksterism on the development of the West and how, while they may prove temporarily beneficial to their promoters, the ultimate effect of such self-interest may take its greatest toll on the very people who are the prime movers of such self-interested schemes. The story turns on the egotism of two key characters-Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis, quite possibly the best actor working regularly in the movies these days) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano perhaps not coincidentally mnemonically-related to one of the most influential evangelists of the 20th century and in a performance which offers a significant counterpoint to Day-Lewis' large shadow, not an easy accomplishment). These two men in the developing West see the interrelated utility of each other's interest, and also, I believe, recognize intuitively, the pre-eminent motivator of their rival/ally as self-interest, setting the stage for the 'blood' of the title. They recognize that the other man's interest can be employed in their interests, but that at some point, a clash between the two interests is almost inevitable, so strong is each man's greed. The film ranges across the dry, open west and some foreshadowing for the eventual confrontation is delineated by the filmmaker. A plot of land heavy in oil is identified for Plainview's purposes by Eli Sunday's brother Paul who extracts a fee for the right to look for oil on the Sundays' property. Plainview duplicitously investigates the land and confirms Paul's tip. In confirming the correctness of Eli Sunday's brother's geological information, foreshadowing of Paul Sunday's wisdom is made. Along the way, Plainview has acquired a child. His parenting methods are unchallenged by associates or the authorities, owing to the wide-openness of the West, and hints about the unethicality of his child-rearing methods are suggested, via the choices Plainview uses to feed his son HW (who is cynically employed by Daniel to convey his trustworthiness to towns whose oil he wishes to get) However, in this unregulated environment, Henry's treatment of his son, which might be considered simply ill-informed given the free-wheeling, unregulated environment of the wild West, veers unquestionably into the unethical. Numerous ethical questions go by the wayside by both Plainview and Sunday. However, the manner in which such issues are overlooked by both men are not done in such a callous manner as to raise the alarms of the community in which they live. Additionally, they are considered leaders and so their behavior might be ignored simply on those grounds. But perhaps more ominously, it is obvious that both men are willfully attempting to obscure such unethical behavior and that these actions will catch up to them at some point in the future.Anderson deserves his Oscar nomination for direction because the tone of the film is such that it could quite easily veer into sneering self-righteousness or unintentional comedy. More impressively, Anderson, from Sinclair's book, has created two strong and very bad characters whose influence and sway during a period of great change in the American west will have ripple effects down through the years and he allows these characters to shape the direction which the film will go. When a director has such bracing characters, one need simply allow these characters to develop along their natural arcs. The use of music in the film is unnerving and compelling. Anderson has gotten a fantastic soundtrack from Johnny Greenwood of the band Radiohead. The dissonant, relentless tone foreshadows some of the horrors which one might vaguely expect but whose exact nature is unknown. As stated, Anderson resists the temptation of becoming overly preachy or allowing his film to become an unintentional parody of the greed and divisive religious beliefs which the key characters of the film promote. The acting, most specifically from Dano and Day-Lewis is electrifying and it is their work, along with a visionary screenplay and capable direction, which makes this a valid nominee for a best picture Oscar in 2008.",10,4,9,8 February 2008
American Gangster," Washington's character not as admirable as advertised
","In reading pre-release materials and anticipatory material about the movie, I heard that Lucas was a complicated, complex guy. I can't say I saw that much in the film. To me he seemed like a money-grubbing, cold-blooded, amoral drug dealer. Yes, he looked after his mother and his brothers, but is that really so remarkable? Joe Pesci loves his mother in 'Goodfellas' but he has no compunction about shooting at the feet of a hobbled waiter or taking out rivals. I don't think there are many out there who do not look after their mothers. The Bible notes that if you love only those dear to you, what more do you do than others? (Matthew 5:47) It would seem that if Lucas was a more complex character, he would exhibit some reservations or depth of character about his role as a high-level drug dealer. That is not the case, however.Washington is fantastic in portraying a determined, capable, but cold-blooded drug dealer, but I do not see any sign that he is concerned with New York City into which he is introducing so much powerful cocaine and heroin. Again, this is not to diminish the movie itself. It is well made although Russell Crowe seems a bit reserved for a hard-nosed Jersey cop and it does seem to drag on a bit. Those criticisms I could jettison completely were Lucas a bit more decent person. However to me there is little to advertise the guy. He imports huge amounts of very powerful, dangerous drugs, coldly kills those who cross him, and, to my mind, does little else that is admirable. The film itself drags on a bit courtesy of a rather dry later-middle part of the movie which tracks the difficulty that Richie Roberts (Crowe) comes across in attempting to tie Lucas to the proliferation of high grade drugs on the streets of New York. Lucas' determination to make a mint comes from his belief that the man with whom he cut his teeth as a younger man Charlie Williams (Joe Morton) gave up too much of his money to middle-men in getting his drugs. It's because of this belief that his mentor gave up too much that Lucas attempts and succeeds greatly in cutting out the middlemen. Lucas is essentially the most cut-throat of American businessman-a greedy man who dislikes conceding any amount of possible profits to those whom he considers to be trespassing on his territory. It is this cold-blooded calculation which makes him a compelling character. That said, I do not find him even close to complicated. Cold-blooded, ruthless competitiveness in the drug trade does not really seem to me justification for making such a technically proficient, nicely scored, and well- acted (particularly Ted Levine, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding as an athlete with a small share of the drug market which has personally addicted him, and Ruby Dee as a not ignorant mother who accepts her son's largesse but is not in the dark. Washington, however, takes the acting cake, depicting a clear-eyed, enterprising businessman who happens to sell drugs.",7,0,6,15 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Sets up nicely for Episode 4...wait, there's already been one?
","As someone else said about this film, there really can't be a spoiler, at least not on the broad plot developments, because it's obvious what has to happen. For me, I'd nearly rather see Jar Jar back again than see Hayden (get a new first name) Christiansen try to convey any feeling more deep than a recognition that Natalie Portman is not unattractive. This guy could not act his way through a prison break if the guards had left and all the doors were unlocked. He is truly dreadful. Forget poor little Jake Lloyd (his forebear as Anakin); kid was John Gielgud compared to the cardboard Christiansen. Anyway....not trying to pile on Christiansen, but he really does stand out (and not in a good way). All the same, the film is very enjoyable. Saw it soon after it was released in the theater and then saw it again on DVD with a friend yesterday. Just a wonderful wonderful film. Ewan McGregor I believe deserves particular kudos, as does the wonderfully evil character given Senator Palpatine by Ian McDiarmid. He is truly astonishing, breathtakingly slimy and devious. Sam Jackson is competent as always and Portman downplays her emotional pain very wisely as it only underscores her love for Anakin (in spite of his bad acting...sorry...) and sadness at his change; really, I'm sure there's not much else to be said about this film that hasn't been said by 2700 other people as of writing other than I must say that it seems that Anakin does flip rather quickly given his initial resistance to the attraction of the dark side. That is partially due to Christiansen, I believe, but also his part could have been better written to reveal his reservations. Other than that, I think Lucas has staged the film excellently and has achieved a near-perfect balance in his use of action and dialogue to propel the film. The variety of creatures are always pleasing to me as one can just see the animators and designers' brains working overtime. The scenery, the music, this really is a triumph for Lucas and his hard-working employees.",9,1,4,13 November 2005
WALL·E," Pixar at its best
","This is a great, great movie. This should be a lesson to the studios and their pre-packaged bilge that verbose and/or run-of-the-mill films should not be made. Put more resources into doing something well, like 'Wall-E' and you will be rewarded.....to paraphrase from 'Field of Dreams' - 'if you make it, they will come.' Be willing to take a chance and you might well come up with a gem of a film like this. This is the story of computer Wall-E, set many years in the future, perhaps the last functioning being in the United States after Earthlings have been forced to take refuge in a spaceship run by mega-company Big 'n' Large (think Wal-mart). It would appear that at the time that the ship left Earth, apparently having extracted all value from anything in New York, Big 'n' Large (BNL) was running (at least) New York City. As the film progresses we see messages filmed by the BNL CEO (played wistfully by Fred Willard) around the time New York City became uninhabitable, informing the residents of New York that the BNL ship would be taking off and that it was the best way for them to survive. This provides us with the backstory as to why the residents of the BNL ship are where they are. The film takes place in the 29th century as the last residents of Earth cross the universe in this ship, their lives on-board the ship exceedingly mundane and boring. They criss-cross the massive ship in orderly lines in little pods taking them from one dull thing to another. It seems they spend a lot of time lounging in huge open plazas, choosing and consuming items that can be purchased via individualized interactive headsets. People seem de-sensitized and bored, which is not surprising given they seem to be touring space seemingly without purpose or point. All of this is beautifully rendered by the Pixar artists. The images of the people and machines roaming the ship are gorgeous and imaginative. One of the surest signs that the Pixar artists are at the top of their game is that they render huge assemblies in the finest detail, depicting thousands of little beings in the most realistic manner, with no diminution of quality in spite of the large number of beings they have to depict. These huge meetings are awe-inspiring and remind me of some of the best animation depicting massive assemblies in 'Antz'.Meantime, back on Earth, Wall-E, apparently the last functioning creature in NYC, fulfills his purpose by organizing all of the discarded junk into massive piles. One of the most enjoyable elements of the film to me, was the manner in which Wall-E employed various items of our modern life in his existence. For instance, a videotape of a modern film was operated by an iPod. Also, Wall-E taped things he found interesting, using a cassette player. When his battery got low, the signal that it was re-charged was the ubiquitous Apple chime which one hears when an Apple computer is turned on. Wall-E methodically and systematically organizes piles and piles of junk, making instantly recognizable junk into large columns by which to impose some semblance of order on his environment. His life is quite dull and mundane. However, this changes one day when a robot named Eve from another ship lands on earth, seeking signs of life. Wall-E falls in love with her and when she is ordered back to her ship, he wants to return with her.From this simple premise comes the whole film. There is not much a lot of dialogue in the film, particularly during the first half, and very few actors involved-among them Jeff Garlin of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' as the bored but intrigued captain of the BNL ship, Sigourney Weaver as the Hal-like robot on the BNL, and a few others. In spite of the paucity of dialogue, Wall- E's affection for Eve is communicated very clearly, their determination to communicate convincingly with the Hal-like robot is communicated with ease, and the malaise which seems to afflict the occupants of the BNL is also expressed without much verbal communication. Perhaps most impressively, we get an appreciation of how much Wall-E enjoys and is interested in finding things which we the audience recognize. He makes only perfunctory, mechanical sounds, but the talented people at Pixar, under the direction of Andrew Stanton who also helped write the scripts to 'Toy Story II', 'Finding Nemo', and 'Monsters Inc', are able to convey the full range of emotions which humans-and in the 29th century, apparently robots-feel. This is a joyous, special film in which one is reminded of the reasons why life and all our opportunities should be cherished. The fact that it captures the breadth of expression and feeling which we as humans experience, as well as the pioneering, creative animation, makes it an acceptable film selection for kids and for adults.",10,3,6,2 August 2008
The Good Shepherd," Very slow but excellently done
","Reviews of this film as slow were not wrong. If you are impatient or can't abide films which don't feel compelled to move along at a crackling pace, this one will not be for you. I enjoyed the film and knew going in that it was supposed to be quite pastoral in pace. Even in spite of this, I thinkthat attributing a bit more color to Matt Damon's high-ranking CIA official Edward Wilson would have helped substantially to inject this film with some energy which might have made the film that much more compelling. That is not to say this movie is bad. It isn't. The acting-from Damon's I-Make-Luke-Wilson-Look-Like-Roberto-Benigni colorless character, to Michael Gambon as a professor whose loyalties to either side in the Cold War are in question, from Angelina Jolie as the weary government wife to Eddie Redmayne as the Wilsons' son seeking approval from his remote father, from Alec Baldwin as a straight-laced gumshoe to the welcome return of Joe Pesci as a larger-than-life mob boss, from Tammy Blanchard as the key to Wilson's heart to Billy Crudup as the traitorous British spy Arch Cummings-based on real-life turncoat Kim Philby, the acting in this film is wonderful. Funnily enough, the one acting turn in this film which slightly annoyed me was that of director DeNiro himself. There was nothing wrong with his acting in and of itself. The fact that the character existed is what annoyed me. His presence in the film seemed superfluous and points to what is, for me one of DeNiro's weaknesses as a director-the need for a good editor. I didn't see the need for his character. I also found the movie dragged on to some degree. I didn't see the need for his character, as I mentioned, and even his romantic travails seem to add distracting layers to a film that has plenty to consider already.That said, DeNiro's use of multiple beautiful locations here was masterly and made for a beautiful film. The use of music in the film was nicely done. Anchoring the early days of the CIA via a scene in which CIA staffers attempt to place a room simply based on information they can deduce via known information grounds the film well, particularly as the film comes to its final act, in which the successful identification of the place will drive the narrative. DeNiro has a great understanding for the importance of plot resolution and providing interesting material to keep the movie ticking along. The plot is masterly and fascinating. It's based on the life of James Angleton, the first head of Counter-Intelligence at the CIA. The screenplay by Eric Roth (The Insider, Forrest Gump, Ali) deserves a great deal of credit.In stories 'based on a true story', I often like a rather non-descript anchor through which the action of the film can flow quite smoothly, but I found Damon's Wilson to be beyond bland. I do think a more animated character might have enlivened the film to some degree and have made it just a little more lively, without sacrificing any of the sense or complexity of the film. That said, if you are patient, there is much to like about this film.",7,1,2,12 December 2010
Stalag 17," A little off-base in depictions of Germans and Americans
","Well, damn, this is the third time I've tried to write my review of this film. Hummmph. Anyway, having read many comments on this film, and despite not having lived through the Second World War, although I must admit that the film is very well-made, the acting excellent, and Billy Wilder's direction and comedic touch second-to-none, it seemed to me that the depictions of the Nazis were a little too generous. The POW commandant seemed comical almost, to me. He seemed as though he'd been drawn from archetypes from rejected Saturday Night Live sketches. His menacing, insinuating monotone seemed to suggest a parody of German commandants rather than that of a real person. Admittedly, commandants might come in all shapes and sizes, but nevertheless, the depiction did seem rather generous. I would have expected a nastier depiction of the German camp leaders rather more fitting than the nearly comedic rendering of the camp commandant that was presented. I don't know if this is just a characteristic of seeing the film 50 years after it was released or if this is a fair criticism. Also, the men seemed rather more upbeat than I might have expected. Obviously they had to keep their spirits up in order to survive, but they just didn't seem very unhappy about being in a prison camp. I might have expected that they might portray the men as a bit more serious and grave. All that being said, Wilder's direction, Holden's acting, the comedy, and how the central plot mystery was resolved were excellent. 7.7/10",7,2,4,20 September 2004
Toy Story 3," I love when things don't disappoint you
","because we know that in life, most things are not as good as they're hyped up to be. Fast food is never as juicy as the commercials make it appear. Cars look as good in real life as they do in commercials for about a month. Medical products show people relaxing on the beach while in real life, many people take one pill to counter the effects of the other pill.Toy Story 3 has no ill-effects. It may cause nostalgia, tears, laughs, generosity, optimism, and happiness. Nothing there that I don't want. There are many films which remain long past their welcome-does anyone like Rocky 6? Saw V? Police Academy VI? Several franchises sustained the energy necessary for three excellent films-among them 'Lord of the Rings', 'Austin Powers' (barely), 'Indiana Jones' (though it slipped severely in attempting to make a fourth film), and 'Star Wars'. Add Toy Story to that list. This film has all the heart, the great story, the fantastic animation, and the great voice work which made the first two films so loved. This film, indeed, flawlessly adds new, well-fleshed out characters while not giving short shrift to characters we have come to know and love.This film sees Andy going off to college and the toys conflicted about their place in his life. They have different outlooks on the possible fates they anticipate enjoying, but ultimately their fate is appropriately decided and again, I really don't see how anyone could have a problem with this film. It should be satisfying to everyone with a pulse.Voice work, as mentioned, from all performers, is excellent, and director Lee Unkrich has paced the story just right. I think the most credit, however, goes to writers John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Lee Unkrich, and screenplay writer Michael Arndt.",10,0,1,17 February 2011
Munich," Good but middling acting
","I was hopeful that Mr. Spielberg would take a stance recognizing the plight of Palestinians, and while not endorsing suicide bombing, understand the circumstances that give rise to it. Again, this is not an endorsement of suicide bombing. It is wrong and harmful and only perpetuates the violence and ensures that more Palestians (and more Israelis...and more Palestinians...and more Israelis....and more Palestinians...and more Israelis) will die. However I was hopeful that, in contrast to many corporate media outlets, that the Palestinain plight, and the political weakness of their position, not to mention their poverty and occupied land, would be recognized by Mr. Spielberg. I had not wanted to hear what happened in this film so that I could watch it with no expectations (somewhat similarly to how one tries to see a film before reading the book so one doesn't compare it (and usually unfavorably) to the book). Unfortunately I heard or read somewhere that Spielberg did depict the Palestinians at least as wronged people and gave some sense of reality to their plights. I must admit, as the Mossaad operatives went about their business just taking people out at great cost and often with others caught in the crossfire also dying, I wondered at what point (and whether what I'd heard was right) that the operatives might realize that bloody vengeance was so destructive and inefficient. I must admit, I was not at all impressed by Eric Bana. I think he had about the expressiveness of the shoes that I have on right now. Yeah, he was playing a stoic guy, an everyman type chosen by Mossad specially because he was so everyman looking. But nevertheless, I found that even when it seemed that the continuous retaliatory killings were going on forever, even when you could see that it was taking its toll on him, while he looked somewhat more gaunt, I didn't think he expressed very much at all. Geoffrey Rush (travelling back in time to look like Henry Kissinger?) was as vicious and soulless a government contact as one could imagine. He was truly, it seemed, incapable of expressing any concern or shades of emotion about the plight of his agents or the worthiness of their mission. As mentioned, it seemed it took a while for the plot to seize one and for the toll of revenge killings to take effect on the men. However I think that Spielberg's approach was fairly successful. I must admit the cloudiness of the motivations of the funders of the revenge hits mystified me. Perhaps the fact that he employed plastic that was stronger than the group had wanted was Spielberg's point-that an open-ended terror mission really can have no positive outcome-but I was a bit puzzled that a man (Avner) who should have known that his was a very nationalistic mission, would trust someone who he knew nothing about, to fund his mission. I'm not sure just who Papa (Michael Lonsdale) could also have been working for. Obviously doing such divisive, controversial work would limit the numbers of parties he could have been working for, but at the same time, if he really believed in Avner's mission, could he really have had so little soul that he would have agreed to fund people who were working in opposition ===to===== Avner? Then again, I guess they were probably that opportunistic. Also, Papa's chat with Avner, the sort of 'don't trust anyone, don't ask too many questions, etc.' seemed amazingly banal and after-school-movie-of-the-week-ish. Also, I questioned Avner's paranoia about Mossad possibly being out to take him out. I guess he might have been paranoid and that might have influenced him but it just seemed that he was extremely irrational. Sure, he knew better than anyone how ruthless Mossad was but that seemed completely nonsensical, no matter what he'd said to Ephrain or how he'd butted into the office of the Israeli embassy. So overall, a good film, powerful, pretty fair; still, I must admit, for such a big-budget picture, Bana was very unimpressive. I think Spielberg makes his points fairly persuasively though and illustrates with his account of one (important) story, the futility of 'vengeance'. Also, the use of the flashbacks as nightmares for Avner was, I thought, an effective way to show the violence of September 1972 and also reveal how such speculation on Avner's part (what he was doing for Israel) might have haunted him. Additionally, OK, before I jabber on a bit more, I think the commitment of Avner to do anything for Israel was not really indicated because it seemed odd that such an apparently mild guy (even though he had been a premier leader) would be willing to sign off on such an open-ended, ill-defined mission. It is reasonable that he would do this but given the depth of character that we see, it doesn't seem believable that Avner was such an ideologue. Again, this goes back to the limited range of Bana's performance. OK, really, I'm done now.",8,1,2,22 March 2006
Heat," The best movie
","Well, it's up there anyway.This is the rare flawless movie, a great movie by Michael Mann during a string of excellent movies, including The Last of the Mohicans, Heat, and The Insider. However, neither of those two films, while both fantastic, can raise a candle to Heat. The two-DVD set of the movie features lots of informative additional material including a commentary by Mann, featurettes about the journey from the screenplay to the screen, a documentary returning to sites visited during the movie, one about the famous scene featuring DeNiro and Pacino together on camera for the first time in their careers. The film itself is worthy of such attention as it addresses the lives of a group of accomplished, high-end bank robbers and the detectives charged with tracking them down in all their complexity, from the toll their careful planning and preparation takes on their relationships and personal lives, to the success of the operations themselves and the duties that the men undertake in their attempt to free $12 million from a bank. The title of the film refers to the proximity of stress, of challenges in a person's life, about the point at which stresses cause discomfort, at which one's comfort zone is disturbed, whether that be, as seems to be the case for the men (primarily) in this film who are work-obsessed, or whether it be through dysfunctional relationships, whether it be via unhealthy work relationships, via affairs uncompleted or something else. It speaks to the idea, finally that one aspect of a life is ultimately inseparable from another part.The film is a nearly perfect depiction of the intersection of the complexities of relationships and work lives and how this complexity affects us. How Mann manages to make such a grown-up, subtly sophisticated movie is almost impossible to know, but Heat is a perfect balance of how lives cannot be compartmentalized forever and how actions have reactions, regardless of how long ago they happened, regardless of the physical distance from the person or the circumstances now. The film is so wonderful, that in summarizing it, I am unnerved that perhaps I might de-value it or not do it justice. The ensemble cast is fantastic, particularly Diane Venora as Justine Hanna, an artist and Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino in a superbly calibrated performance)'s third wife who is tired of being the third wheel in a marriage between Hanna and his career. Pacino and DeNiro are unsurprisingly excellent. Pacino plays, with perfect nuance, an accomplished detective whose job significantly supersedes all other elements of his life his life. That said, he is a good man who is a more devoted father to his step-daughter (Natalie Portman in her second major role) and whose focus is true and untainted by blandishments that some cops might not be able to resist. Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is a world-class thief and equally focused man but is a sociopath in that the loss of innocent life does not detract from his intent to complete a theft successfully. Ultimately, he is self-centered while Hanna is a devoted public servant. In most other ways, however, they are two sides of the same coin. He emphasizes to Hanna during their meeting in a coffee shop that, if circumstances get too hot (another instance of the meaning of the title of the movie), that he will leave the scene. As he puts it, 'that's where the discipline comes in.' However, he has no reluctance about taking a cop or a civilian in the way out, if they interfere with his goal of completing the robbery successfully. Tom Sizemore, Mykelti Williamson, and Dennis Haysbert in particular, are excellent in supporting roles, Sizemore evincing a devotion to Neil McCauley that bespeaks a man who owes a great deal to someone and perhaps the devotion of someone who is in awe of someone while Mykelti Williamson seems the ideal police officer for his compassion but also for his discipline and commitment to upholding laws. He is a tribute to excellent police work. Dennis Haysbert's part in the film is poignant and bespeaks the larger forces, the larger palette against which all our actions take place. He must decide between going straight in a thankless dead-end job for a cold, demanding boss taking one last job on the chance that it will be a big payday. Ashley Judd as Charlene Shihirlis, the wife of one of Neil's crew (Val Kilmer also fantastic, as Chris Shiherlis) is concerned that her relationship is dysfunctional and that her husband is not adequately committed to assuring its success, and that, as a result, her son will not be adequately cared for. She is a woman who, from Mann's commentary on the DVD imagines her as the wife of a high-end thief who grew up rough and had some unpleasant experiences growing up, but just wants to settle down and attempt to live a fairly conventional life. The tension between husband and wife and drives her into the arms of a small-time Vegas crook (the fantastic Hank Azaria who conveys small-time sliminess and short-sighted misogyny better, perhaps than anyone ever has in movie history). Mann must be given ultimate credit for weaving all the strings together so adeptly and conveying the inter-relatedness of the different parts of our lives. His imagination and clear- eyed vision of what motivates and drives us all makes this film an epic, a film ostensibly about thieves and cops, but one which ultimately speaks to the higher purpose which all must find on this earth.",10,0,1,20 June 2006
The Thin Red Line," War as a metaphor for life
","I'm reminded of the sequence in which Witt and Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn)'s response to Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel)'s death at the end of the film - 'Where's your spark now?' in response to Witt's comment to him just before his death that he still had some spark. For Pvt. Witt, the Earth is a beautiful, idealized place. He is like a figure from Plato's famous Allegory of the Cave in which people sit chained to a wall looking at shadows created by things passing in front of a fire opposite them. They believe that the shadows are actual things and not reflections of them. Pvt. Witt believes that the Melanesian island where he goes AWOL is an example of a idyllic, perfect place while in fact evils have already begun to take hold there, had he been paying attention. This is evidenced by his conversation in which he talks with a young lady there and she reveals that she is scared because he is a soldier. He asks her why the kids don't fight and she says that they do, just not when adults are watching. Life is flawed even in places where it seems untouched by worries and problems. The woman on the island already has experience in dealing with the US military, to the point that she has developed a fear of it.So it goes throughout the movie, in many contexts. There is a conflict between nature and man's greed. There is the internal conflict in Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) who abhors his duties and finds them futile, but on the other hand wishes for advancement. There is the conversation between Lt. Sgt. Welsh and Witt in which Welsh says there is no other world, there's just this one rock, while Witt holds that he has seen a more idyllic world. In their final conversation in which Welsh asks Witt whether he's still so idealistic, Welsh seems more tired of war and receptive to a more positive view of human nature but it's too late by then. The change in Welsh through the movie is subtle but clear - from the gung-ho squelcher of the insubordinate Welsh at the beginning to shots of him throughout the film in which he appears more ambivalent about the wisdom of war.One other relationship in the film is also key-that of Staro (Elias Koteas) and Lt. Col. Tall. Staro refuses orders to take a position which the Japanese are holding very securely and Tall re-states his point that he is ordered to do so, in spite of the fact that Tall has made it clear that he finds his professional position abhorrent. Tall is battling against himself - forcing himself to convey orders which he himself finds repellent.The sensuous, lingering shots of nature, followed shortly by brilliantly photographed footage of war are also strong evidence of this contrast between what we are pressured to do and another world. This is masterful film-making. It's war as the antithesis of what is life. It's no wonder Malick doesn't make many films because visions of this magnitude and insight do not come in the length of time it takes to conceive of, write, cast, film, and release 'The Waterboy.'",Null,4,7,21 November 2011
Jackie Brown," Pam Grier!
","What a film! Amazing ensemble, serpentine plot, all based on an Elmore Leonard novel. I enjoyed the film when it first came out but I didn't appreciate its complexity and the caliber of its acting as I did when I saw it the other day. A tired airline stewardess (Pam Grier as the eponymous character) sees a slim window through which she could escape to a more leisurely life. However, she will have to steal money from a nasty small-time arms dealer and convince the Feds she is trying to help them get the dealer. Can she make it work? On her side is bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) who, we think, might want to squeeze out that window with her. However, she has to outwit the venal Ordell Robbie (Sam Jackson) who we see is not the nicest guy in the world. Robbie is assisted by the dim-witted pothead ex-con Louis (Robert DeNiro) and his possibly-smarter-than-she-looks snow bunny Melanie (Bridge Fonda). On the other is the law, in the person of Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) and Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton). She has to convince the Feds she is complying with the terms of her agreement with them and she has to convince Ordell that she is not scamming him. It's a hell of a balance. Can she do it? Great music, typically a-bit-too-clever dialogue as one might expect from Tarantino. Tarantino features LA's grittiness in a way that those of us Angelenos who know that the Southland isn't all Beverly Hills and Hollywood really appreciate. The acting is fantastic. You've never seen Robert DeNiro act like this. He's dopey with a lot of repressed anger. DeNiro gets the essence of a conflicted ex-con. Robert Forster is competent and confident. The chemistry he has with Grier is smoldering. Sam Jackson eats up the screen in his scenes. It's like shooting fish in a barrel for him. Pam Grier is phenomenal as Jackie Brown. You don't know just how honest Jackie is but you have sympathy for her from the get-go. Grier makes her gorgeous, smart, hard-working, sexy, confident, and diligent. It really is a shame that she hasn't had another role even APPROACHING one of this richness. It truly is a great role though and Pam Grier delivers in spades.",10,22,24,17 December 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Fascinating period, fascinating character
","Llewelyn Davis is a compelling character around the time of the folk revolution in New York. He was very talented but also a bit of an abrasive character. He is a conflicted character and so he isn't able to reach his potential as a performer. He is patronizing, elitist, and arrogant which rubs many people the wrong way - most notably when he attends a dinner party and hilariously insults the overly earnest music one of the hosts is performing. However, he's a musician, he is very talented and so bookers must contend with him. This makes him a very compelling character because he acts in ways that are counterproductive to his career or his personal life. The scene in Greenwich Village is recreated with great detail, sometimes hilariously - most notably when a Peter, Paul, and Mary like group is kitted out in some truly horrible sweaters. The costuming and staging adds a great deal in creating the mood of the movie.The most notable part of the movie, however, is the character of Llewelyn Davis, as created by the Coens and realized by Oscar Isaac. He is a charmer with the ladies but much too honest and can't hold his tongue. He has a lot of opinions, most of which antagonize and set people off. While this internal conflict holds back his music career, it makes for great complexity which is the heart of an incredible movie. There is some great work by Garrett Hedlund and John Goodman but Oscar Isaac is really fantastic. The creation of the script and the deepening of our understanding about the start of the 'folkie' scene and how things are much more complicated than we're often led to believe, make this a great movie.",10,0,0,6 April 2014
Her," Not yet
","'Her' deals with possible future situations in which computers are so developed that people have satisfying, fully-committed relationships with them. I think that the premise of the film is intriguing, and I found that the first half of the movie, in which the relationship is less serious, was believable. I had a hard time believing in the depth of the relationship as it developed over the second half. The world as depicted in the movie seems almost current and I didn't believe that such a complex relationship with a computer was possible right now or in the next 25 years. Yes, the computer (Scarlett Johansson) is very smart and obviously scientists in the future, according to this movie, are able to program computers so well, that people engage in relationships with computers. I just found the depiction of this relationship to be implausible and I couldn't believe in the realization of such a film, at least not at this time.Perhaps I don't want to imagine the sort of loneliness that could propel Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) into a relationship with his computer. I suppose these sorts of relationships will be plausible, perhaps within 25 years. Obviously people have Siri on their iPhones and some robots are able to fulfill specific needs in peoples' lives. People value their electronic devices and I don't exclude myself from that group. I just don't like the idea of them as intimate partners. It's a development that doesn't sit well with me. The notion of the autonomy of a computer which understands you enough to submit your writing as a book proposal is disturbing to me. I found the idea of not having any sort of image of the partner disturbing also. The idea of going on picnics with another couple and having your computer girlfriend's voice piped in via the ear feed which practically implants her in your head, is also disturbing to me. Fortunately, I think we're quite a way from this occurring.The premise is fascinating and the idea is intriguing. However, as someone who thinks that in spite of the promise and capacities of computers, there is no replacement for relationship with another human, I am profoundly depressed by this film. I never see the genie being put back in the bottle. Our electronic devices are more intrusive and more indistinguishable from the people who have the technology. The immersion continues apace with this film and it's certainly not a trend I like. Perhaps this movie is prescient, but I hope not.",8,0,1,20 October 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," A bit too credulous for me
","Yes, this is a good film, but for my money it isn't a great film. It's a feel-good film, sure, but to me the good feeling isn't earned in a plausible enough way. 'Oh tnrc75, you're just too bitter, it's just a movie' I hear you say. Well fine, it's a movie, but given the immense poverty in Mumbai and the unfathomable societal problems, I find a movie which is so feel-good is like ignoring an 800 pound gorilla in a room. Yes it's wonderful that the plucky protagonists Latika and Jamal wind up together at the end. It's great that the boys escape from the slavery to which they at one point seemed destined. It's wonderful that Latika (Freida Pinto) escapes the clutches of mob boss Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar) who runs Mumbai. But given the problems and the extent of the problems in India, I found that adhering this feel-good story to such a mass of intractable problems pressed me to suspend my disbelief more than I felt comfortable. It's nice we can find an inspiring (fictional) story....but what about telling the story of the wrenching poverty, short life expectancy, and gross corruption in the government of Mumbai? There is some wonderful acting in the film, in particular from the actors playing the youngest versions of Jamal, Latika, and Salim (Ayush Khedesh Mahekar, Rubina Ali, and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail). Given the tragic nature of the material, I found their performances astonishingly affective. I hope that they are able to remain actors if that is what they so desire. The direction from Danny Boyle is excellent, the cinematography is moving, and the music is great. There are many things to credit in this movie. I just can't find it in myself to give this film a higher rating given the welter of massive problems which beset India. I find that crediting work such as this distracts fortunate Western audiences to giving money or choosing government leaders who will try to diminish the problems which make the ultimate triumph so inspiring to so many.",6,1,2,14 November 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," A nice movie, but the tip of an unpleasant looking iceberg
","This movie is very nice; it's uplifting and makes you feel good. But is that what we need? The problem of homelessness is huge in this country and focusing on one positive story to the exclusion of hundreds of thousands of heartbreaking experiences of misfortune, drug use, bad luck, government disinterest, and general misfortune seems to be misleading. Having been homeless in San Francisco, I know the state of desperation and how unfortunate many people there are. It's fine to focus on one guy's story, but if you really care about homelessness in this country, vote for people who will help make life more tolerable for people.",6,0,2,6 January 2008
Goodfellas," What else is there to say?
","IMDb has been around, what, 8-9 years now? I'm sure many people have said better than me what is so great about Goodfellas. Ain't really nuttin' to say other than if I had maybe five pictures to take with me to a deserted island where I (somehow) had a DVD player, I'd definitely take this one. Joe Pesci in a lacerating, blistering performance of psychosis and self-hatred, Robert DeNiro playing a confident, psychotic, but also ambitious and highly- motivated Mafia hit-man. Paul Sorvino, radiating menace, Lorraine Bracco, particularly in her early scenes where she is intrigued and unsure what to make of up-and-coming don Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). One can sense her belief that perhaps she shouldn't be so entranced by him, but as she says after she hides the gun that Henry her, Some girls would be appalled, turned off, by such violence on their behalf but I found it a turn-on. The use of music in the film is wonderful, the cinematography, particularly in the edgy scene in January 1980 when...well, you know. and yeah, absolutely the best use ever (by a long shot) of voice-overs. Liotta's Hill is the apparently normal guy whose sympathetic narration give the film its connection to a supposedly reasonable person. The story is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the depiction of a Mob in which everything is not peachy keen for those making out like bandits (no pun intended) seems fair (not that I'd know....really..). Anyway, this film is right up there with The Godfather. I'd give it 20 out of 10 if I could.",10,0,0,5 January 2006
The Simpsons Movie," Worth the wait.....
","Like the Hippocratic Oath which says doctors should 'first do no harm', I was just concerned that 'The Simpsons Movie' not de-value the legendary Simpsons brand. It not only didn't hurt the brand, it was worth the wait. As, sadly, a grown-up who was 14 when the show started, it boggled my mind seeing Homer 15 feet tall (or whatever it is) on the big-screen. I haven't been excited about an 'event' movie for some time but as a long time Simpsons fan, I've been excited about this for six or seven months or whenever I knew it would be here this summer. The first half hour was riotous. Lots of hysterical, sharp, witty one-liners. It was cool seeing a bit of profanity, some humor which would not be cleared for the 1/2 hour every Sunday. I really don't want to post a detailed summary of what I saw and enjoyed, suffice it to say that I think the writers captured the rhythm of humor which is necessitated by a plot which has been extended from a half-hour base. The humor satisfied everyone. The kids loved the broad, physical, visual humor while of course the additional levels of humor which make the Simpsons such a widely respected institution on television, along with the pratfalls and the visual comedy, kept the older teens and adults laughing. I think finding fault with this movie is really an exercise in pettiness. I don't know how such a legendary program could have been better adapted for the big-screen.",10,2,7,28 July 2007
Dodgeball," Entertaining trifle
","A supremely silly film from Ben Stiller, this film features the charismatic Vince Vaughn and Stiller's real-life wife Christine Taylor as well as Stiller himself as misanthropic meathead White Goodman whose financial prospects are on the rise, while those of Vaughn's Pete LaFleur are on the descent. Goodman's mustachioed, comedically hyper-masculine gym owner wants to take over LaFleur's gym and convert it into a parking lot for his own gym which he will get the opportunity to do if Vaughn and his small band of hapless, loyal members cannot raise $50,000 within the next month. Gordon (Stephen Root) reads in his obscure sports magazine about a dodgeball tournament of which the grand prize is $50,000.So the band of ne'er-do-wells enters the tournament, not realizing how hapless they look-a man who thinks he is a pirate (Alan Tudyk), a man with no pride (Gary Cole), a man whose prime interest is in the most obscure sports around, and a young man whose cheerleading tryout left him the laughingstock of his school (Justin Long). Will they succeed in keeping the gym open? What do you think? This is cotton-candy thick entertainment. It's good for a few laughs. Justin Long, Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, and Stiller in particular are very good in their roles. If you like some of these actors and a light-hearted, enjoyable film, this one is for you.",Null,0,1,24 August 2011
Up in the Air," Sum not as good as the whole of the parts
","So Ivan Reitman is a very talented director. The film has a lot of good lines. If someone can make you empathize with someone whose job it is to fire people, you wouldn't be surprised that George Clooney was that person. Vera Farmiga as Alex Goran is exceptional and takes full advantage of the rare role for a woman over 35 who is not simply a bitter, lovelorn woman or simply a woman who is simply a woman married to her career. She has a fantastic, nuanced part and she takes full advantage of it. Anna Kendrick is excellent as bright, naive recent Ivy league grad Natalie Kenner. The supporting cast, including Melanie Lynnskey, Amy Morton, Jason Bateman, and Danny McBride are excellent. The subject material is topical. The soundtrack is great. There are some great one-liners. And yet...and yet...in spite of these wonderful attributes, I found myself very disappointed in some aspects of this film. The use of the images of real people reacting to their termination seemed in some ways exploitative and even if this is only a minor critique, I don't know how this makes the film any more real. The film is not real. It's why we watch. Personally I was not comforted to see pictures of my fellow Americans showing how they felt at being fired (newsflash: it sucks!). I found the didacticism of the conversations between Clooney's and Kendrick's characters cloying and naive. I found the notion that Clooney was so detached from his family, considering that he is the same character who counsels Kendrick that she shouldn't expect a lot of understanding from people who are being fired, a little difficult to take. Yes, Clooney's character is obviously a lone wolf to some degree, but he seems to have an exceptionally light touch with people and it seems hard to believe he is so remote from his family. If he enjoys the road, well, more power to him. Also if Reitman wishes to make the point that marriage is more desirable than the single life, he then undercuts his point when he counterposes Jack's living the footloose and fancy- free single life against that of his sister Kara (Amy Morton) who is in a trial separation from her husband. They are depicted in stark contrast initially, but ultimately, it would seem that her decision has not necessarily been for the best.I found the tired preachiness of the counsel that Bingham should connect more with people simply a more polished version of more hackneyed counsel that one might see in less sophisticated, more mainstream fare. It might be more polished, but it's the same old preachiness simply wrapped up in a new package. In the same vein, the metaphor of the backpack which Bingham finally rejects (reminding me of the scene in 'Traffic' when Michael Douglas as drug czar is unable to stomach delivering his own canned speech one more time, finding it doesn't mesh with the thorniness of real-world problems) seemed similarly preachy. Reitman has a wonderful ear for razor-sharp humor and dialogue, but his naivety (in 'Juno' he seems not to understand the seriousness of a teen having a child) is on full display here in his hackneyed counsel about relationships. Ultimately I found this film disappointing because in spite of Reitman's obvious and prodigious gifts as a director, his naivety undoes him.",6,1,1,14 November 2010
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Entertaining and interesting take on the South
","This 2000 film from the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, features the adventures of three southern men criss-crossing the South and encountering different Southern legends and famous features. The adventurers consist of two rather slow, if likable men, Delmar and Pete, (Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, both fantastic in signifying slow reaction times) and a smooth-talking would-be renaissance man, Everett (George Clooney, playing a role which the smooth Clooney imbues his character with naïve short-sightedness typical of many would-be smooth-talkers) cross the south, encountering many archetypes and legends of the area as they go. Joel and Ethan Coen have done a fantastic job of linking many tales of the South and connecting the characters to this voyage by taking as their framework, Homer's The Odyssey in which the characters had adventures all occurred within one day. The film opens with the main characters working on the chain gang and seeming northerner (and coincidentally the schemer?) Clooney concocting a scheme whereby he and some other men can escape and thereby return to his wife (the versatile Holly Hunter, playing Penny, Everett's tough but exasperated estranged wife) before she re-marries. They cross The mythical Crossroads, the site supposedly where guitarist Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil in exchange for amazing guitar-playing abilities where they pick up a man obviously envisioned as a stand- in for Johnson, Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), and with him they perform 'black music' for a blind record producer to whom they tell they tell some sly and very funny lies. Pete and Delmar are baptized and re-born while would-be renaissance man Everett mocks their sudden reverence for what he regards as foolish superstition. They encounter a particularly psychotic religious huckster in Big Dan Teague (a fantastic John Goodman). The Klan is also lampooned hilariously and savagely. Some have critiqued this film for being less than the sum of its parts but I think that this criticism misses the mark. Although the settings might be distinct, the use of The Odyssey to tie these sites together seems to me to provide enough structure to give the film a narrative coherence. And to be honest, even were the narrative of The Odyssey not used, I believe that the examination of many Southern features also provides the film with a thematic constancy. And even were that not so, I believe that the notion that the film is too varied in tone is not really a legitimate criticism. I don't see that there is a lot of criticism of many big Hollywood films which are narratively incoherent, let alone consistent in tone and I believe that the variety of concerns which Coen address make for an interesting and rich film tapestry.",10,0,0,11 July 2006
