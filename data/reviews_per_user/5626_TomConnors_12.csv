The Avengers," 3D Blu-Review
","The Avengers (2012) a movie nearly a decade in the assembling, (yes pun intendedf**k you if you don't think it's funny) is a kick ass movie, through and through, what all the fan boys have been waiting for and showing average audiences why comic-book story arch's are so entertaining and can make exciting movies. The movie begins where Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Thor (2011), Iron Man 2 (2010) and the original movie, and The Incredible Hulk (2008) led us to, an assembly of 'Marvel', a spectacle unlike any super-hero movie, or movie period has before. Loki, Thor's adopted brother, has come to earth via S.H.I.E.L.D tampering with a magic cube known as the Tesseract, which he in-turn steals from the agency along with converting Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) to the dark side with a magic spear he has brought with him. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) see's no alternative to fight this 'God' from another dimension than to restart the 'Avenger Initiative' and bring together the worlds finest heroes, Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), recently thawed out Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and to track the Tesseract with his knowledge of Gamma Radiation, Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), who, just for good measure, happens to morph into a huge green monster when he's aggravated.Director Joss Whedon handles the film with finesse, and the movie lives up to expectations, all around. The 3D presentation is excellent, and really stands out during the climax, which I have to commend Joss Whedon and those responsible for setting it during the day, helping the 3D stand out. So many of these type of movies set the end showdown at night, and it was a nice change besides being beneficial to the 3D.",9,2,6,24 July 2013
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut Blu-Review
","http://filmsnob.blog.comSouth Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut was what really got me interested in South Park, I did see a few episodes before that, but the movie is where I really 'got it'. Most people see the show as low-brow humor, done cheaply, for cheap laughs, but anyone who's really paid attention notices the social commentary and 'nothing is off-limits' angle of the humor to the show, and movie. South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut does pick up between shows, but you can still watch it without seeing the show and enjoy it for what it is, nearly 15 years later it's still funny and relevant, taking a stab at how American entertainment is skewed to allow violence to go to extremes, yet sex and fowl language are very regulated. Co-Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have dealt with the MPAA on several occasions, especially with this movie, which was just a big middle finger to them to begin with. Like bullied victims the South Park movie was a big return upper-cut after tons of abuse and beatings.South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut begins with the boys (Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny-all voiced by Parker and Stone) going to see the new Tarrence & Phillip movie: Asses of Fire. The R rated Canadian movie sets off a fire-storm of trouble when the boys' parents blame the movie for the their potty mouth and the death of Kenny, after he lit one of his farts on fire. With Kyle's mom Sheila (Mary Kay Bergman) leading a group of parents against Canada, war and (literally) all Hell breaks loose. The Oscar nominated music is wonderful, and needless to say the Parker and Stone's craft has come full circle with 'Book of Mormon' musical, the same talent shines through here.As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, once again Paramount dropped the ball, and the new release is hardly worth celebrating, considering the original DVD was bare bones, there isn't much for extras here either, the fact that the Blu-Ray was obviously made from a film-print and not the original digital animation files is beyond me. Makes no sense that a new master for the Blu-Ray simply wasn't ported over, considering the movie and show have always been animated by computer (minus the pilot episode, that was actually done with construction paper cut outs). The last few years of the show look better than the High Definition presentation we are given here. It's not the worst picture ever, but unless it was requested by the creators I don't know why they would chose to master it this way.The only extras are a collection of trailers, a music video of 'What Would Brian Boitano Do' , and a commentary by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, which of course is the reason to get this Blu-Ray. The commentary is very retrospective of course being over a decade since it's release, but they are entertaining of course, the duo does mini commentaries for each episode on the season sets, but they never get real in-depth, so the rare chance to hear them talk about the film and South Park in general in a more candid and open way is a treat and the only reason there is even a rating for the extras on my final grade. It's about half-way there, but this movie screams out for a kick-ass full blown Special Edition, c'mon Paramount!!!RATINGS:MOVIE: 10 out of 10AUDIO/VIDEO: 8 out of 10/7 out of 10EXTRAS: 5 out of 10",10,0,0,24 July 2013
Spider-Man 2," Amazing...
","Raimi's follow up to his 2002 blockbuster Spiderman, is nothing short of 'amazing'. If you don't already know the plot, you're probably living under a rock, and wouldn't be reading this anyway. If you haven't seen the original, do yourself a favor and get acquainted with this series, it's worth it. Spiderman 2 does what very few sequels do, and that is build on the original and top it, with more story, more drama, more action, more suspense, more character, more emotion, and just more. We don't feel like we're a million miles away from the universe created in part one, yet it all feels new and fresh. I'm glad they did not do anything drastic to Spiderman's suit. There are subtle changes, but you really don't notice, yet on multiple viewings you will.I give this film a 10 out of 10, large feat for a sequel.",10,1,2,4 December 2004
Cloverfield," Blair Witch meets Godzilla!!!
","I'm not going to waste much time on this review, as I didn't waste much time on this film, (watching most the later half in high speed, just to get to the ending). My summary above says it all.The problem with this film is the over used, bad gimmick of the cam-corder gag to try and make things 'more suspenseful'. The only place this gag worked was the only good part in 'Signs'. That scene was chilling and looked so real, but it was just a glimpse, not the whole running time of the film.Maybe the film would have been better if the main characters all didn't make such dumb decisions, and the intent of the people to 'document' this happening...just dumb, drop the camera and run.It may have worked better if the movie had started out this way, then went into traditional film...I just got sick of it. Sorry I didn't buy into the hype, much like Blair Witch I was just left feeling cheated, and like I waisted my time.",1,5,10,26 April 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," Enjoyable 3D Blu-Review
","Captain America: The First Avenger's 3-D presentation is almost as good as the 'Avengers' presentation. Chris Evans plays the World War II genetically engineered superhero, as the story begins in that era. Steve Rogers was always small, but wanted nothing more than to serve his country like his friend 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan), and finally got his chance when a German scientist, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) offers him the chance of a lifetime, only to have the project fall short of a 'Super-Soldier Army' thwarted by Nazi ally HYDRA research department headed by Johann Schmidt, also known as the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving). Leaving Rogers the loan subject to be paraded around the country to gain support for the troops, until he gets word that his friend Bucky has been captured, and even though Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) tells him not to, Rogers saves his friend's life along with several other troops. In the wake of this event Rogers is awarded his own team to lead as they go in to clean up Nazi Germany. The film's climax is made up of events that lead up to modern day, and ushers us into the 'Avengers' film. It is still a very satisfying film on it's own just the same.Captain America is a top notch thrill ride, and is what we have come to expect out of Marvel headquarters. Along with a good looking 3-D Blu- Ray, it is well worthy addition to your library.",9,0,2,24 July 2013
"I, Robot"," I, Robot 3D Review
","I, Robot is a sci-fi thriller about a cop, Del Spooner (Will Smith) set in the year 2035, where robots are everywhere, do most labor, and are sub-servant to humans, but he doesn't trust them. After an apparent suicide by Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) a designer at US Robotics, the countries biggest robotics company, Spooner smells something isn't right, and implicates a robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), in what appears to him as a murder, which is against one of the 3 Laws Of Robotics;I recall reading I, Robot,and several other Isaac Asimov's stories when I was younger, the collection of short stories have little to do with this film though, only the 3 laws more or less are important. That aside, I, Robot is actually a very entertaining and clever thriller, with for the most part so-so special effects for decade old CGI, more on par with a video game, and Will Smith doing it 'Big Willy Style'. I like Mr. Smith, I've followed his career since he was only a rapper, and for the most part the man has made his career, and has arguably the most successful musician turned actor since Barbra Streisand. Rising above his urban upbringing and taking acting so seriously that you can watch him progress into a serious contender in the realm of acting Gods over the last couple decades. Now, I'm not saying that I, Robot is a masterpiece of cinema for the times, nor am I saying it's Will's best acting job ever, in fact that brings me to my point I was getting to, after giving credit where credit is due, in this movie, as I said before, Mr. Smith is doing it 'Big Willy Style', and what I mean is, this is a character that Will plays from time to time in these obvious big budget movies. A style interchangeable with a few of his other screen alter-egos. That aside, this movie is fun. That's what counts, it's a pop-corn movie, it's just a little bit better than most. Before you bombard me with slander for comparing this movie to Jaws, it's not in the same league, but the way it's constructed reminds me of how Steven Spielberg took one story and kept the spirit, but gave us something that was much more exciting than had it been a direct adaptation, and this movie is the same way, the spirit of the stories are there, especially with the 3 Laws, but it's a nice tight suspenseful tale that keeps you interested and pays off.All that aside, let's get to the 'meat and potatoes' of what this review is really about, the 3D conversion. It's interesting how the movie has been cropped from it's original aspect ratio down to 1.78:1. making the film feel a tad cramped sometimes, as you are losing some of the picture, but I actually prefer 3D presentations in this ratio normally, even though I do generally prefer a nice full 2.35:1 or more panoramic picture to movies like this, at home 3D movies that are in a smaller ratio tend to lend to the experience better by filling the entire screen. I could go on and on about this all day, and I'm sure if your even still reading you don't care anymore either, the real deal is does the 3D conversion work? Yes and no. It's not going to blow your mind, and probably not going to be the first movie you grab to try and impress your friends with. Most scenes feel like two 2D images just separated from the background, very flat. This is one time i cannot say that the 3D helps with the CGI blending with real footage and it is sad because in films that were older, like Jurassic Park and Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace the 3D conversion helped those films. It's decent enough, and since most places have it reasonably priced, it is a suitable addition to your 3D library. The standard version is on the same disc, and there is a DVD in the combo pack. All the original special features were carried over.",8,0,2,24 July 2013
Van Helsing," what a waste...
","I Can't really do a true review since i ended up having to pay late fees and never watched the whole thing, the effects were stupid, the acting was beyond bad, and the whole story was just beyond dumb. I stopped the DVD about an hour and twenty minutes in. I just had no clue what this was about, why I should care, and who all these bad actors were. Really what was Jackman thinking??? This was such a silly idea, I'm sure that Universal is just crying because of all the money they sunk into this garbage and all it's cartoons and crap. None of the movie follows any of the monster's story lines at all. We spend too much time with too many action scenes, still waiting for the movie to actually start. Normally I wouldn't rate a movie i didn't watch all the way through, but I know there was nothing to save this hunk of junk, 1 out of 10...if only 0 was allowed...waste of 6 bucks...waste.",1,3,6,29 December 2004
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Fun, but not for the kiddies!!!
","Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton play the title duo, respectively, as the grown up versions of the fairy-tail siblings we know. They are now witch hunters, and are called to a small town when several children come up missing, only to discover that something big is brewing with all the witches, and they are part of it. Famke Janssen of X-Men fame plays the lead witch. It is hammy and over-the-top, but it's good fun. It has some good laughs, and some 3D eye-candy, along with a fast paced story, that like 'Dark Shadows', if you don't take it too seriously you will enjoy it. Fun bit of trivia, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are producers.",7,0,1,24 July 2013
Man on the Moon," Snubbed
","I only have one thing to say at this time, and that is that Jim Carrey was ROBBED of an Oscar for his work in this film.  I lost so much love for the Academy when he wasn't even nominated.  I couldn't believe it, this not to long after 'Titanic' beat 'Good Will Hunting'.  I don't know what to think.",10,0,0,20 June 2002
Thor," Better than it had the right to be...
","3D Blu-Review... Marvel has given us a plethora of great entertainment the last few years leading up to the 'The Avengers' last summer, part of that was introducing us to Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger the year before that. Both movies are available in 3-D, and the films actually both good as far as movies go, differ in the 3-D arena drastically. Thor tells us the story of the Norse god himself, living in Asgard, a beautiful world ran by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) father, King Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and protected by Thor, his friends, and Thor's brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). After a break in to the kingdom by what appears to be their old foes the Frost Giants, Thor and his entourage seek revenge for the invasion. Odin thwarts war just in time, and in turn banishes Thor to Earth, hoping he may learn a thing or two about becoming a King, and earn his rightful place on the throne. In the meantime Loki seems to be responsible for the events and is stirring up trouble behind the scenes, leading to Odin falling into a coma, and Loki taking the throne of Asgard.On Earth Thor keeps running into a few scientists, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) who were chasing a storm that seemed to include Thor inside. Thor's friends start to smell something foul and question Loki, and try to find their friend on Earth. The climax ramps up and the action is well paced. Director Kenneth Branagh does good with the 'Aquaman' of the Marvel Universe. I never felt Thor needed his own film, but it works.What doesn't work so well in this film is the 3-D. It is very difficult to make out anything in any of the darker scenes. Some scenes work, but for the most part the 3-D presentation is lackluster at best. The 2-D version of the film is fine, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this movie in 3-D, a first for me.",8,0,1,24 July 2013
Dark Shadows," Enjoyable enough
","Dark Shadows based on a British show of the same name, which I'm not familiar with so cannot compare, but was enjoyable enough. The movie stars Johnny Depp as a vampire named Barnabus Collins, suffering a witch's (Eva Green) curse, finally set free from his prison after nearly two centuries, introduced to the modern world of 1972. His decedents now live in his home and he share's his secret with the matriarch of the family Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with the secret to the family fortune hidden in the castle by which they plan to reclaim the family glory before the witch, Angelique (Green) cursed the family. It has some funny moments, and is directed by Tim Burton, who has fun with it, and it pays off and shows, because it is enjoyable, and has some great moments.http://filmsnob.blog.com/",6,1,2,24 July 2013
Jurassic Park," 3D Blu-Review
","Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite films, it is a masterpiece and a landmark in film history. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, the Steven Spielberg adaptation of the Michael Crichton novel is about a rich entrepreneur named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who has designed and built the world's first amusement park with live dinosaurs. Hammond needs specialists to sign off on the park before the insurance company will allow him to open for business so he enlists Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) to take the ride through Jurassic Park, along with us. Of course after the ride begins things start to go wrong, due to sabotage, and chaos ensues as the dinosaurs take over the park.The movie is a fast paced, suspenseful, and well done, in the tradition of 'Jaws', not an exact reference of the source material but the version that was meant to be. The effects are still astounding and the movie still works 20 years later. The film's 20th anniversary 3-D convert is excellent. It has a lot of depth and the movie lends itself well to the added dimension. The movie was 'sweetened' for the 3-D release, adding just some environmental elements for 3-D and the soundtrack was also tweaked to engulf the audience more.The only new extra is a short featurette on the conversion of the film, that is also in 3-D, nice touch. The original blu-ray from the box set and a DVD is also included in the 3-D combo-pack. The extras on the blu-ray are a very good combination of older extras and a new documentary, which has counter parts on the sequels in the box set (or separate releases that are now available).The only changes are environmental objects for stereo- viewing, and the soundtrack has also been enhanced to engulf the audience. No there has been no real 'changes' made, so no need to get upset that it is really more than what it is, a 3-D version of the classic film.Well worth the upgrade, though I now have more copies of 'Jurassic Park' than I can countÂ…you want one???",10,4,5,24 July 2013
