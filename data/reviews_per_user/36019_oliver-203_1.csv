Skyfall," Long, Boring, Confusing
","This movie has no characters, a boring villain and a confusing plot. The villain's capabilities, motives and plan are never established and change scene by scene. A lot of time is spent waxing on plot-irrelevant themes. Is Bond too old? Is MI6 too old? Do old things matter? Art-house fluff.This movie could have been so much better. Characters need to have firmly established motivations. Plots need to progress constantly, and each element of a plot should make sense in the context of the whole movie. 'Skyfall' appears to be several scripts stuck together at random with elements from previous bond movies thrown in so we know the whole thing is a 'Bond' flick. Keep in mind this movie is 2.5 hours long.",3,12,27,14 November 2012
