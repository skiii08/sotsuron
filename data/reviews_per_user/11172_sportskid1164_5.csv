The Mask," Entertainin' and Hilarious
","The Mask, w/ jim carrey, was a fun movie w/ some hilarious moments. Jim Carrey is a bank clerk and one night, he finds a mask in a lake and puts it on, he can do anything. His charecter acts very silly as the mask and it's pretty funny. Cameron Diaz plays the hot girl that jim carrey wants in the movie. It is her first role and it's interesting to see how she acted in her first film.overall: Fun! ****(out of five)PG-13 contains some violence and a couple swears. It wasn't a very bad PG-13.Iv'e seen worse.",Null,0,0,3 July 2003
Catch Me If You Can," not as good as the critics are saying

Overall not terrible.not great, but ok 5/10 stars",Null,1,1,19 June 2003
Finding Nemo," Good Family Entertainment
","ever since I was a kid, I have loved fish. When i first saw the previews, I hasn't thrilled about seeing it, but when I saw it, I was glad that I did. Dory was hilarious and the charecters where very creative as well. And the underwater shots were beautiful. Really good film that the entire family can enjoy.Although I did think it should have been PG for scary situations and maybe mild thematic elements.Awesome!! 8.5/10 stars",Null,0,0,19 June 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," a very cute film!
","How to lose a guy in 10 days, starring kate hudson, and matt m., was very cute and enjoyable. Kate Hudson was very good as being annoying ands she is very funny. Matthew M. was good too. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes either kate or matt, or if you enjoy romantic- comedies. Good, Fun Romantic Comedy!Overall: enjoyable 7.5/10PG-13 contains some sexual innuendo, some sexual situations and their is a scene where they are playing a card game called bull****, and they say the word a lot, but besides that, there arn't very many swears.",Null,0,0,2 July 2003
The Little Mermaid," i love it
","I have always loved fish, and underwater scenes ever since I saw The Little Mermaid. it Opens up a new world for kids and shows you what the ocean really contains and how the fish really act. The animation was very cool, too. i highly recommend this to anyone who likes the ocean or likes disney movies. The Little Mermaid was probably the best disney movie in my opinion, anyway. One of my favorite movies of all time.I loved this film! 10/10",Null,0,2,23 June 2003
