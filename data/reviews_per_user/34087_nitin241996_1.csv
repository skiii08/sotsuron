The Avengers," Ultimate Movie.......
","As expected, Avengers is an EXCELLENT movie. The movie shows the efforts of MARVEL STUDIOUS. From the beginning to the end, the movie is full of adventure and action. I was waiting for the movie since 1 year. And when it released, I was so eager to see the movie. Excellent Graphics and Special Effects. The Fun element is not missing in the movie. Although serious and adventurous, Movie never misses any chance to have some fun. All the Super-Humans are so cool. Iron Man is always in funny mood but performs his duties seriously. Captain America has awesome leading qualities. Hulk is just Suuuuperb. A giant who is also a WILD KILLER. Thor is ultimate fighter. Even he can handle Hulk for some time. Shocked. Hawk Eye and Black Widow, although common human beings, contribute their best for the team. Everyone must watch this movie. Never seen such a great movie. I give it 10/10.",10,5,11,7 May 2012
