The Sound of Music," Without a doubt THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!
","This is the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, and Gone With the Wind is tied with it. I grew up on this movie, and I could watch it again and still be as entertained as I was the first time. Julie Andrews and the rest of the cast is excellent. The Sound of Music is a marvel film for other directors and actors to guide themselves by.",10,1,7,8 October 1999
The Evil Dead," GROSS!
","Despite its reputation as being a classic, influential horror film, this is just a disgusting exercise in exploitation about five college students who become demon possessed one by one in a cabin in the woods. Totally inept and sickening, this is only worth watching for fans of gory horror movies or demonic possession flicks. *",Null,2,4,28 December 2000
