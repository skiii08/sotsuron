First Man," A big disappointment
","As a big fan of movies about space travel, and real life astronauts, I had eagerly looked forward to this movie. It was a disappointment for 90 minutes out of the total 130 minutes of the movie. The last 40 minutes, when the Moon trip finally begins, and the spectacular shots of the moon surface, were worth seeing. Rest of the movie- not at all. It moves at a snail's pace. The interesting parts are about the astronauts, but they are frequently interrupted by- for example- Janet Armstrong yelling at her son or her husband, etc. Not much chemistry between the two actors. The frequent closeups are rather irritating.The editing and the screenplay are terrible. They could have shaved off 30 minutes of this movie and made it much more effective. The characters display various emotions but they don't touch the audience. Granted this is Armstrong's story but did they really have to ignore someone like Buzz Aldrin, who is one of the most famous astronauts? The third astronaut Michael Collins, on the Apollo 11 mission was totally ignored. Those two sat there like plastic dolls. As if Armstrong single handedly made it all work!No flag on the moon, but Armstrong throws his late daughter's bracelet on the moon. Ridiculous! Also the great historical significance of this event was completely ignored. Instead it was all about Neil and his wife. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy are good, but Oscars? She may get the supporting actress nod though. Ryan Gosling is a good actor but he is not as effective as I have seen him in other roles. This movie deserves some technical nominations though. The moon scenes are spectacular. It is like I am right there! It made up (partially) for 90 minutes of boredom. That is why I gave it a 6/10. Otherwise it would have been 3 or 4. This movie could have been so much better! Damien Chazelle is a gifted director. I wonder what happened to him? How could he go along with something like this? If this movie gets the Best Picture nomination, it could be solely due to name recognition (Chazelle, Gosling).",6,35,62,13 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Just an OK movie, with some very good things
","Being a big fan of the books may have colored my opinion of this movie, but here it is.I thought it was an OK movie. I am not sure I would watch it a second time, but eventually I will, because I want to own the full set of the HG movies on DVD. This was only a set up for part 2, and that's how the book is written. The movie did a good job of consolidating several scenes from the book, and adding some details that Katniss doesn't know in the book (action scenes- blowing up the peacekeepers, etc. were good). The best consolidation brought Effie in the movie much earlier than I expected. She simply replaced Katniss's prep team, and that was a masterful job of writing.Some (including me) had felt that it was unnecessary to make Mockingjay into two movies, but making just one movie would have sacrificed a lot of useful information. So I don't have a problem with it now. Part 1 is just a set up to part 2, which I expect to be much better, just as the book is. The visuals were great. It ended at the most obvious point, but I would have liked them to carry the movie way past it. It would have allowed them to put more detail into part 2. Now they have to cover too much in part 2, so I don't know what will be sacrificed in it. I didn't have a major problem with where it ended because it was well done. I would say the beginning and the end were both well done. The middle part was not always good.Couple of scenes bothered me a lot because those were big deviations from the book, and completely unnecessary, and IMO bordering on silly. They could have dropped those and instead spent more time on a couple of other scenes to make them more meaningful. The conversation between Katniss and Finick was kind of cut short in the movie. These two have formed a special bond since the quarter quell and the film makers could have used it better. Instead they wasted film on those added scenes.The deviations were both introduced to show how 'great' Katniss is, while in the book she has a more objective opinion of herself, and I prefer that approach to what the movies show- making her superhuman.The first scene that I disliked is when Katniss goes looking for her sister, while bombing is taking place. In the book her sister is late, but Katniss stays inside and asks the guards to keep the door open. It was ridiculous to show them outside during the bombing.The second one is much worse. While a team is out to rescue the victors from the capital, Katniss asks to be put in contact with President Snow on the screen, and they have a conversation. She offers to trade places with Peeta. There is no such a thing in the book, and that added scene was totally unnecessary. The rescue operation was shown well, but it could have been shorter.About acting - Jennifer Lawrence was very good, and she was the only one that had some good material to work with. Others didn't have much to work with. Julianne Moore's President Coin came across as too nice- could be a flaw in the screenplay. Philip Seymour Hoffman is/was such a great actor! His Plutarch Heavensby shows his true colors in this. He is a slime ball who doesn't care about people, but wants to use them in his propos. He does it with a smile on this face. I don't think many actors could have dug that deep into this character.In the pictures published earlier, I had seen President Snow flanked by Peeta and Johanna, all wearing white. That scene never takes place in the movie. Apparently it was edited out. In any case there was no such scene in the book, but I would have been OK if they had shown what was being done to Johanna and Peeta. The movie doesn't even show Johanna till almost the end (that is actually consistent with the book, which is written from Katniss's perspective).On the positive side, the movie keeps moving fast, despite the boring material and it is well edited, with a few exceptions. Visuals are excellent. I liked it that they brought the 'hanging tree' song in it- I didn't expect them to. Now I expect to see it in part 2.Overall I would give it a 'B' grade. Here I gave it 7/10 because some things were handled very well (consolidating some scenes, and using Effie in place of Katniss's prep team). It is worth seeing once, but not more.",6,7,24,21 November 2014
Passengers," Surprisingly good as pure entertainment
","I was not keen on seeing this movie but I went to see it because I wanted something light. I was pleasantly surprised by it. It is creative, entertaining, and the sets and CGI are amazing, I was surprised by the criticism it is getting due to one moral issue. The critics are not in the situation these characters are in. What right do they have to pass moral judgment on this fictional character? The only criticism I have is that the last part, where Jim risks his life to save others and Aurora brings him back and heals him was unnecessarily stretched too long. I assume it was done to create more excitement. Making it tidier/shorter by 5-7 minutes would have made the movie better. Other than that, I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it. I may see it again, next time in 3D. The space scenes are amazing. The acting is good too, by Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. I also enjoyed the robot Arthur, played by Michael Sheen.",8,7,15,26 December 2016
Jackie," Disappointing and Overrated
","I went to see this movie mainly because I had read rave reviews of Natalie Portman's performance, which according to some, will certainly win her her second Oscar.I cannot adequately express my disappointment in the movie and in Portman's performance. The first thing that bothered me was the horrible accent she had put on. I don't know if Jackie Kennedy really spoke this way but it felt forced, artificial. She was good at expressing grief, but I was unable to feel any sympathy. This is shocking, considering how devastating the event - JFK assassination- was to the whole country.In this movie Jackie came across as self centered, which can be forgiven, considering the magnitude of her loss. Natalie Portman couldn't touch me emotionally. The frequent close ups were annoying. We know she was devastated, but it was unnecessary to show closeups if her blood stained face, crying and tears again and again. The worst part of the movie was the interview which went into the past, in segments, asking how she felt, and Portman's acting in those scenes was way below her ability. Natalie Portman is a good actress, but in thus movie she felt artificial. It was totally unnecessary to create the interviews. If the point of the movie was to show Jackie Kennedy's feelings and courage at the worst time of her life, a more direct approach might have worked better. The screenplay, background score, direction were all deficient in putting life into this tragic story. I couldn't wait for the movie to end.The saving grace was the costumes and the White House interior at that time. They were wonderful. Acting wise no one other than 'Jackie' had much room. The screenplay certainly didn't help.The whole movie felt like someone wanted to create a movie that would show Natalie Portman on the screen all the time. Sadly she remained Natalie Portman to me. She never felt like Jackie Kennedy.",3,72,126,11 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Soul is missing in this Star Wars movie. Very disappointing.
","What separated the Star Wars movies from the rest of the Sci fi movies and action films was the depth it brought to the story. No other movie franchise touched so many fans the way Star wars did. The characters were well developed, there was the philosophy about the force, the Jedi were certain types of people that many of us admired. We loved all characters, even the villains.I had enjoyed The force awakens and Rogue one. I had even enjoyed the three prequels. So I went in to see The last Jedi with great expectations. I could not believe how bad this movie was. It was not Star wars at all. The Story was poorly told. It was being jerked around. Really bad use of humor. So many whys and hows that were never explained. So many disconnected and 'makes no sense' type scenes! Awful screenplay. The Snoke character is so badly portrayed!. Kylo Ren keeps getting on the screen and disappearing. Luke Skywalker is to be accepted only because he bears the name, and we know Mark Hamill is playing it. We never find out much about Rey or anyone else. Rey miraculously becomes a great fighter without any visible training, except in one scene. The new character Rose, the maintenance worker, added nothing. The group of goats, foxes, color, fire, just created more distraction. The fight scenes were unbearably long. Chewbacca was (mis)used just to create humor. The persistent theme for me throughout was- confusion.There was a constant onslaught of special effects, as if they would make up for what was lacking in the story, dialogue and characters. I kept hoping that somehow the story would get on track. It never did. Rian Johnson did a terrible job as Director and writer.There were a few positives. Daisy Ridley was very good again as Rey. Some of the scenes were spectacular. It was good to see Carrie Fisher one last time in a movie.I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. It was boring, disappointing, and it made me angry to see what they did to my favorite movie series. I read a couple of reviews by critics and they were praising the movie! I couldn't believe it! I can't believe how bad this movie is. It's not like a Star wars movie at all. Its soul is missing, and what we got is a ton of special effects that obliterate an already flawed story. The only touching moment was at the end of the credits- 'In loving memory of our princess Carrie Fisher'. It brought tears to my eyes.Will there be an Episode 9? I have no desire to see it. George Lucas should never have sold the rights to his beloved Star wars franchise. This is the worst Star wars movie, and really the only Bad Star wars movie.",5,0,0,17 December 2017
The Artist," Very creative, a truly 'artistic' movie
","I was initially reluctant to see this movie because it is in Black & White and is silent, but I could not resist seeing it because it received such high acclaim from so many. I finally saw it, and was not disappointed, but my expectations had reached sky high, so the movie came up just a little short. I may have to see it again, minus the expectations to truly appreciate it.I will not go into the story, since it has been told already. The B&W cinematography is absolutely brilliant. The sets are excellent, and the whole atmosphere really captures the era. They could have made it in color, with dialogs, and it could have been a very good film, but not an extraordinary one. It took great creativity and skills to make this a success. It also took great courage to make it in this format, in today's technology driven movie market.The acting was top notch by the main characters and the little dog was adorable. There was humor and sadness. I could not help feeling nervous for the actor who had lost everything and was in such despair as to try to kill himself. 'The artist' and 'Hugo' both deal with the old era of movie making, and the old actors having to deal with a fall from grace. What a great coincidence that they both came out in the same year! Ironically Hugo used today's technology (3D) and 'The artist' went all the way back to the 1920's. They were both excellent in their own way, which tells us that a movie can be excellent regardless of what technology (or lack of) is used to make it. The most important thing is the story and how it is told.Jean Dujardin and Berenice are brilliant in their roles that require them to use their faces and bodies, without the help of dialogs, to portray the characters. That is so hard to do! The music is wonderful and without it, the movie might not have been successful. The final dance number is outstanding. This movie has so many subtleties and details that I may have missed some, so I will have to see it again.The artist is definitely worth seeing. I am not convinced it is the best movie of this year, but it is one of the best, and most certainly the bravest one.",9,0,2,22 January 2012
