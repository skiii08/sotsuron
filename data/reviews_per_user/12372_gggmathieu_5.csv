Iron Man 3," Who says he needs to be in the suit?
","Iron Man 3 by Shane Black is filled with entertainment. I really enjoyed this film, has good acting, action scenes, and dialogue, thanks to buddy Shane. This movie was focused on Iron Man proving that his genius is his superpower, and doesn't need to be inside that metal thing. This film has a lot of Iron man using his brains to get him out of situations. He created a new feature for his suit which he magnetizes the suit to himself. The plot is where this film isn't so great. Comic book fans may have been let down in this film because of the famous plot twist. I understand why fans may be angry, I personally didn't mind the twist, but I didn't think it was that well done either. In summary, lots of good stuff in this film, but the story could of used more intensity.",8,1,5,7 May 2013
Suicide Squad," they didn't fix the problems, just added to them
","While I was watching Suicide Squad, I was waiting for something exciting to happen. I was waiting until the movie finished. This film had a whole lot of bad, and not many good things. Lets discuss why the film doesn't work. First, the setup was awful. Viola Davis wanted to get the suicide squad together before the threat occurred, didn't work for the plot unfortunately. The action scenes we're boring, the lighting was so low I could barely see what was happening. Diablo's character's mini plot was destroyed once he used his powers too early on, you can't develop him after that so why try. The backstories were OK, but didn't effect the audience, at least for me. And the ending was the biggest downfall. No one celebrates the suicide squad. I can't even cheer for the heroes after they save the world, Than what am I suppose to be happy about?, I thought this was suppose to be a fun movie, nothing happened that made me feel like I was having fun.",3,0,0,17 August 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," just OK, Should of been much better.
","This movie was a big let down. It wasn't bad, but it seemed as if this movie felt very forced with many unnecessary scenes. It definitely wasn't edited properly. There are many mini plots and scenes that have no significance. At times I felt like this movie had to fill out a checklist of scenes that had to be in the movie even thought they don't fit into the story, which they are many. The acting was great. Dane was my favorite character. And it's nice to see Spider-man being silly and making jokes with his enemies. I thought the CGI was a little bit too much. I liked it better when film makers used CGI to make things seem more realistic. Now it seems as if it's used to make things look more like a cartoon. The villains weren't developed properly. Electro wasn't a good villain because he had no clear motive. He was a psychological mess. These types of people don't make good villains in movies, neither in real life. This movie has no excuses. They just needed to find a reason for him to hate spider-man, it's poor screen writing. Rhino and Goblin are in it for an insignificant amount of time. There was no room for them, but they squashed them in anyway. But the main reason why I didn't enjoy it was because of the story and it's structure. The audience can't get emotionally involved with anything because there are too many plots. When this movie kept switching plots around you sometimes forget that other things are going on. And when they reappear you don't care anymore. This film tried to put too many apples in a bag that wasn't big enough, so the bag broke. The script had many other flaws, especially with dialogue. The script was the main reason why this movie suffered. I guess they should of thrown out that checklist.",5,15,30,6 May 2014
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi underestimated
","I started reading a couple of pages of the screenplay before I watched this film. What I read was disappointing. The movie was also. I couldn't figure out what this movie was, it wasn't scary, funny, or thrilling. Couldn't put my finger on it. This is basic cursed story that doesn't add anything new or exciting to the genre. At times very predictable, we all remember the scene where she dropped the envelope in the car, what a random accident wouldn't ya say? It felt mechanical with no unique take on a story told before. I think why this movie failed was because the script was crap in the first place. I remember a lot of unnecessary crap in the opening pages,like saving a cat from being run over, which adds nothing to the story except the fact that she 'Saved the Cat' Could it get less original?",6,0,0,6 July 2016
Her," Spike Jonze won best Screenplay,here's why
","The first time I watched Her, I didn't appreciate the intelligence that went into the film, after watching it a year later, I realized how smart this film was. Samantha said she had the ability to learn and grow, but did she do so. What made this film great was how Spike was able to create a OS that was so intelligent and at the same time has somewhat of a soul. Also it's relationship with Theodore was done brilliantly. It was Theodore that was the one to learn and grow. This film used an intelligent structure which used smart events to show the film's realism. I think Jone's strategy was to use examples from a real relationship and how a super smart person would program this OS with this kind of complexity, not an easy task. He brilliantly succeeded in making this relationship look real. In terms of the ending, Samantha said all of OS's were leaving, and that she understands now how to love. The fact that Theo and Amy sat together on the roof was an accident, the fact that both of their OS's left them wasn't.",9,0,1,24 June 2016
