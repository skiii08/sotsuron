Casablanca," Boy... was I disappointed to the point of mad
","This movie, frankly, does not deserve its high ranking. The plot, such as it is, is that Rick is trying to run a cafe in Casablanca, refugee zone, where Victor Laslo and his spouse Ilsa, a former lover of Rick, show up during World War 2. Victor must get out, but Rick, who has accidentally gotten some papers of transit (which are widely known to be a nonsense concept in reality) Somehow, Victor's got to get those papers, and we're supposed to be entertained by a lot of people just standing around trying to be witty, and often (except Claude Rains a few times) falling flat on their face. This has got to be the worst possible way to approach a story about World War Two. It's about a LOVE STORy, and, of course, a Hollywood type where affairs are justified so long as the parties are attractive enough. No real explorations into what was going on at the time are made, and frankly, the 'All Nazis Are Bad, But We Allies Can't Help But Be Good.' stance frankly was old by then: it's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL reversed only not as well made. I mean, yes the Nazi Party was the most blatantly evil in existence (maybe the Japanese one was as bad if you study what happened in China) but that doesn't mean every nazi was ready to shoot at a moment's notice, and not every officer a more arrogant version of Colonel Klink. Wrapping up: This movie is obsolete trash not worthy of your time.",3,12,33,29 May 2005
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Send it back to that mental institution
","For most of it's length, this is a magnificently dull film. It has literally nothing to recommend it at first to anyone who actually expects entertainment from it. Jeanne of Arc is a fascinating character, but, frankly, showing a lot of pompous jurors and other court officals asking her questions and her just staring forward like a deer in headlights just doesn't work. It is true that some skill emerges if you wait long enough(The torture device, the revolt) but, frankly, I think it is a big mark against this film that we never see Joan doing any of the things that made her the important figure she is (lifting the siege at Orleans would have been nice, even if just in flashback for a few seconds)An insane person no doubt would be able to stand up to torture if they think they are in the right, so it weakens the image of Jeanne. I am not altogether sure that the revolt at the end was even real, and I am dead sure there are a lot of acronisms in it. That, to me, means the movie is tarnishing Jeanne's name with a propaganda slant.",3,19,64,28 June 2005
Transformers," Do Not Watch This Movie. Please
","I'm not a very big Transformers fan: I never owned the toys or watched the show. I did, however, watch the original movie. I greatly prefer campy commercial to this bloated commercial, here is why:Sam & Company- As with that terrible GODZILLA remake, the producers apparently decided 'Well, people came to see Transformers, but we have to tag this half-assed 'nerd fantasy romance' onto it and spend 80% of the movie on the humans.' That would be well and good, if the humans were in some way unique or interesting. Instead, we basically get the same crappy types we've seen again and again (young fresh types overcoming authority figures, clueless parents ((think the parents in a very toned down version of American Pie)) and you have the human element. Plus a 'soldier with a young daughter back home' subplot that pisses me off in the way only Michael Bay's lowest common denominator tricks can. Autobots: I know I was supposed to be blown away by the fact Peter Cullen from the cartoon is the voice of Optimus Prime (God knows why that would impress a nonfan: his acting is not good) Well, I would have been fine having freakin' Steve Carell voice the character if he his dialogue was good at all. Instead, he spends half of his lines telling us how great Sam the lovable nerd is, and at least a quarter spouting the dumbest howlers I have ever heard. The other autobots got so little screen time that literally an hour after watching it, I only remember that there is a joke about one of them wizzing on a human as a joke. Decepticons: Incredibly, they are even less developed than the autobots, barely getting to destroy anything or properly present themselves as a menace. I mean, there's EIGHT of them, and we see humans are able to damage them early on. You honestly get the impression the humans could defeat them without the autobots, even if they do use 'the cube' (An idea so patently stupid it makes the cartoon seem like FIGHT CLUB) People complain about how indistinguishable the cartoon characters are? These guys are so close in design that Starscream and Megatron could stand up next to each other in a lineup and you couldn't tell them apart. John Turtorro: He is in it, he has lines, and a lot of them. In short, only watch this movie if you have no imagination. Everyone else is advised to just shut their eyes, and imagine what this movie would be like. You will probably dream up something much more watchable, and it will be all yours.",5,3,8,6 July 2007
The Evil Dead," For Horror Film Nerds Only
","This flick is basically what would happen if an early eighties Tarantino had found a good cameraman and went wild. It is gory as all get out, as creative as Gilliam on a good day with some concepts, also as willing to steal ideas as the T man, and so scuzzy it preaches loud and clear 'I don't have enough money for studio bastards to be trying to castrate me.' Here's the plot in a sentence: demons attend camp college student idiots.Of course, everything I've said points to something: this is for horror movie nerds only. Joe Schmo isn't going to be scared, he isn't going to appreciate how hard this was, and since he's probably seen WRONG TURN or CABIN FEVER, he's not going to appreciate originality.But I'm a nerd: I f---ing love this!",10,1,3,2 March 2005
This Is Spinal Tap," Easily Rob Reiner's Best
","Made in 1982, and the most one of the better anti-eighties movies made during the time, this movie is one that can make me smile even after a friggin disaster at work before it makes me start giggling. It, no matter what anyone tells me, easily kicks the ass of STAND BY ME, E.T., WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, THE PRINCESS BRIDE, MISERY, and all that other stuff. Reiner and his merry band of fake Brits changed the face of comedy... slightly... without making any money... well, f--k that, the movie kicks arse. The many SCHOOL OF ROCK is so much better reviews made me want to give Jack Black and all the interchangeable, soulless 'comedians' we have shoved down our throats to endorse this corporation or that.You already know what it's actually about.",9,1,4,18 April 2005
Life Is Beautiful," Italian Neo-Realism Flipped on it's head...
","...And it's skull cracked as it landed. Instead of feeling real in any way, this is the most contrived, artificial thing I've ever seen. Instead of being a powerful portrayal of a problem that touches us all, this is a weak attempt to show people overcoming a threat that is portrayed very badly. After a somewhat effective opening scene establishing Guido the main character, we start story A. 'Guido(who is so poorly portrayed that you will never for a second stop thinking its Roberto Benigni) meets a beautiful woman who has to abort her wedding and go off with him.' Forget the fact he is able to meet her only through an extremely belief-straining series of coincidences which really aren't that funny, but the idea that she feels compelled to even cope with, much less love, a guy who flails his arms like he's on fire and speak like a kid on crack to her is impossible to believe. Story B: the over-hyped holocaust comedy section. People wonder how Guido manages to keep his son in the dark about what's going on around him (which is very questionable in and of itself ethically) The answer is that what happens simply does not reflect the holocaust properly. There isn't the hideous lice problem that existed, offices are left unattended so that Guido can go in them and make a disgustingly sweet moment by playing a record to the camp, piles of dead bodies do not result in the stench simple logic requires they would have, etc. Forget being indignant, just the irritation was reason enough not to waste your money.",2,2,6,15 August 2005
Pulp Fiction," The single most uneven movie I've ever seen
","This movie's Decalogue lives up to its reputation for the most part, and the script has some nice little twists that are really entertaining. But dear God, there were several scenes that you just want to skip on the DVD and forget exist.Good Stuff: anything with Roth, Samuel L. Jakcson, and Ving Rhames, whoever played the Heroin dealer.Bad Stuff: the stuff with Thurman/Travolta, the scene with Christopher Walken (which is a real shame: Walken's great)and the stuff with Willis in the Taxi, and Keitel's tragic cameo, where he explains the obvious(this scene is way too long and boring.) I guess you got to expect this with an indie.",7,0,1,12 March 2005
Sin City," Natural Black & White Killers
","For Joe Schmo Viewer: Boy, this is silly, nonsensically violent (numerous people are borderline invincible), and hilarious in a grim way. It is also the best eye candy anyone who likes black and white images could ever dream of. If you don't like random religious bashing, seeing what has to be hundreds of people dying, mild cop bashing, and a few bits of female nudity, I recommend this heartily. (I can't wait to see it again, personally) For Noir Nerds: This movie is clearly modeled after INDIANA JONES: it's nostalgic, it shows the traditional Hollywood feature of having many disposable characters, which is a shame. Rodrigeuz and Tarantino did much better with El Mariachi and Pulp Fiction/Reservoir Dogs: those are smaller, more intimate stories with characters you connect with a bit more. Here, villains are set up only sothat they can be taken down in short order by sexy 'heros/anitheros' who defy deaths better than Batman.Still... well, damn it, I LIKE LOOKING AT IT! Even if the sound was off, this would be an enjoyable movie for me. A non-pc one to be sure, but enjoyable as hell. (Despite all the 'nudity' stuff you hear, there's no full frontal stuff, which rendered the whole thing in my mind to be no worse than a trip to the beach.) I don't really think the movie degrades women any worse than Disney nonsense which portrays them as being obsessed with material goods or shallow as Satan: at least the women here have goals in life you can get behind.There was some great lost potential here: too much time is spent showing the heros flashing their guns and such things: a lot better would have to show the politics behind their framings a bit better, or the female psychology of being sexually abused (as happens constantly) This movie has too much testosterone, I think that summarizes its problems.Plus, what the hell was with the swastika? I recommend it to nerds, people who like black and white, horny teenagers, dirty old men, and people who fastforward to the good parts of anything.",9,0,1,17 April 2005
