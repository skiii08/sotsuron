The Avengers," Great film!
","The Avengers is one of the best action movies I've ever seen! Honestly, I didn't mind but didn't really appreciate the Marvel films until I saw this. The characters, good and bad, were great and the whole thing really flows nicely. The movie has its fast and slow parts, but nevertheless it never gets boring and worth watching more than once. In fact, I saw this many times in the theater. Another thing is the humor brought into this. It isn't a dark or very scary film. And even if you don't like it, or the humor just isn't funny to you, there are some scenes that are so funny everyone is laughing (ahem, Hulk and Loki). The actors really portray their characters nicely, and the whole thing is simply great. I have no issues with this film besides a few scenes that involve people busting through glass, such as Tony Stark and Hawkeye (technically, Stark would have died), but that is to be expected in these kind of films. This is truly, in my opinion, 'the best superhero movie ever'.",10,1,4,2 June 2013
Iron Man 3," Pretty good
","This movie was fairly good, with humor and action, and overall I'd give it a seven out of ten. The plot twists and turns, and some of it can take you by surprise. But there is that 10% of something you feel is missing. It could have been polished up a little more and things explained better, but overall, I wouldn't consider it awful as some do. One of the main things in this that is not explained well is Maya Hansen's serum, and how exactly it works. Because in some cases a person who has accepted the serum will not die if bombed, or whatever, but then sometimes they do. That just does not make sense. But like I keep saying, the movie isn't bad and even the bad guy (we think) is likable in his own sense. But I'm not a die-hard Iron Man fan and we all have our opinions.",7,0,3,2 June 2013
