Blade Runner 2049," Excellent though not perfect sequel
","Let me say I'm a massive fan of the first film so this film is measured to exceptionally high standards. For the most part this sequel meets those expectations. It's visually stunning and has a great atmosphere. There's just three points of note that let it down slightly. I say slightly as they don't stop me scoring this an excellent 8/10. I'm not quite down to the level of nit-picking but these are certainly not major gripes.Let's get those minor negatives out of the way. It's overly long. A lot of it is setting that great atmosphere but it overdoes it. Secondly the ending doesn't reach any great conclusion leaving the viewer somewhat frustrated. The third point being the lead character is a replicant and shows little to no emotion, at least at the start and middle of the film. It's hard to empathise with an emotionless character and care about them. I said three points but I'll raise a fourth, though it didn't bother me being a bloke, but I'm sure more than a few women will find this film misogynistic. A large percentage of the women are portrayed as boys toys.The pros. As said it's a visual masterpiece and a wonderfully atmospheric setting. It ties in nicely with the first Blade Runner and is a worthy sequel. Will it reach the cult status owned by the first - only time will tell. I suspect not as few films ever do but this is certainly worthy of bearing the name of the first and highly recommended. Just exercise some judgement if taking a female friend to see it.",8,0,4,27 October 2017
Gravity," Just OK - not great, not bad, just OK.
","I'd been looking forward to this for some time and the initial reviews singing the praises just heightened my anticipation. I'm at a loss as to explain why anyone would find it worthy of it's current 8.5 rating so here's my thoughts:- It's a very basic story and a seriously limited cast. The cast isn't merely limited in numbers but also the depiction of the main character. Sandra Bullock isn't hugely convincing as a mission specialist. The last time I checked NASA had very strict requirements for their astronauts in that they are expected to show some initiative and backbone. Her character appears devoid of both and flaps in panic mode for large parts of the film. In fairness to Ms Bullock the script is weighted that way so she probably had little say in the matter and did the best she could with the material she had. I'll blame the script writer. A tougher character similar to 'Helen Ripley' would have been more realistic and engaging.Lets be honest, this film is going to appeal to 'nerds'. I'm one! Nerds will find many issues with the film not matching the reality of the situation. You don't need to be ex-NASA to spot them either - basic physics will do. I won't list them as I'd look foolish if I missed one but if you are of the nerdy persuasion you'll spot them and they'll interfere with your view of the film. I don't mind Hollywood taking a few liberties but when you deliberately aim your film at those who at least have some grasp of orbital mechanics you ought to take more advice from scientists and less from writers. Getting details right shouldn't interfere with a story but should enhance it.The good bits are good though. The cgi and any other effects are very good. So good in fact it's easy to feel it was actually shot in space. That's it though. It's not great, it's not bad. It's an OK film worth watching. It could have been been so much better with that stronger main character.",6,7,13,11 December 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Why wasn't 'The Force Awakens' done this well?
","Disney made a complete pigs ear of their first attempt at Star Wars so it comes as a massive surprise to find they've done so much better with this prequel. Given the lead times from shooting to finished film it can't have been the public criticism of the first. I must therefore assume that someone at Disney knew they were selling rubbish and had the clout to correct it for the second effort. Well done that man / woman or committee.This is everything that the first one wasn't. The clich√©s were dropped, the tie in to the original films was (largely) dropped. They bothered to include a decent story without a pointless comic relief character like Finn. This is aimed squarely at an adult audience unlike Awakens with the baddies behaving like true baddies and not some 10 year old's idea of them.The only real fault was with the cgi in resurrecting actors from the grave or their youth. It's still obviously cgi and I'd rather see a look-a-like actor or actress doing the job than a cartoon character.I'll finish with a couple of points I'd like to whine over and they're both of a rather inconsequential nature.1. Why is storm trooper's armour not stick proof? 2. Why does Hollywood insist on an English accent (you know that really posh one that all British actors and actresses have to adopt to get work in Hollywood) that comes from just a small percentage of the accents we have?",8,4,6,3 April 2017
Captain Marvel," Too many binary reviews - no wonder IMDBs algorithm can't cope.
",Few films warrant a 1 or a 10 and this is no exception. For far too many 'reviewers' a 1 or a 10 seems to be the default options and I have little doubt that these exceptional scores have less weight with IMDB in producing an average.The film is lacklustre to be polite. It's hardly terrible but given it's budget it needed to be better. The effects are generally excellent with the notable exception of the anti-aging cgi applied to make old people look younger. Don't get me wrong that cgi is the best I've seen but it's still not good enough to produce a natural looking face. It looks like a bad facelift that's robbed the victim of expression. Bree herself comes across as uninterested and confused. I appreciate her character is often confused but it comes across as more than that. I could see no reason to set this story in the recent past other than to give the aforementioned cgi a run-out.I appreciate that a super-hero movie requires some suspension of reality on the part of the viewer to make it work but when that suspension of reality equals making a small cargo plane into a spaceship in a couple of hours with farm tools and getting into space without thousands of tonnes of fuel I just wonder what NASA has been doing all these years. Such things treat the viewer as an idiot and doing that never ends well.Time to give up on the super-hero franchises IMO. They've worn thin. There's a million and one books crying out to be made into movies and if people keep paying to see poor efforts like this then we'll only be fed more of them.,4,3,5,3 June 2019
Passengers," Not really scifi - more a love story in a scifi setting
","My title sums it up nicely.If you are expecting a science fiction film you are in for a disappointment. There's a spaceship setting with plenty of decent effects but the story is all about a relationship between two people alone on a ship of thousands of people who are in suspended animation. Any scifi going on is utterly accidental and of no importance to the story.The love story is the standard one. Boy gets girl, boy looses girl and finally boy gets girl back. It's been done a million times. It's been done well here though if you are hoping for originality you ought to look elsewhere. If you were hoping for a good scifi film, forget it. If you want a love story it's worth a watch. I've given it a 6 as a love story. If I were to score it purely as a scifi film it'd be lower.",6,2,4,20 February 2017
Ready Player One," Utterly aimed at teenies
","As per all movies aimed at teen audiences the movie is 100% simplistic and comes complete with one dimensional characters you've seen a million times before. By the time you're 10 minutes in you know exactly how it's going to end. Are teenagers really this easily satisfied? Was I so naive when a teenager?
Unlike a large percentage of teenie movies this one is at least well made. The script and characters apart, the production values are high and the film is a feast for the eyes and it's largely this that hauls it up to a 5/10 for me. Nothing else to say as there's really nothing else to this film.",5,1,2,23 June 2018
Suicide Squad," Potential for further films - could have done more with this one.
","I found myself hovering at a middle point between the hype and the haters. Hollywood has made some serious turkeys in the guise of blockbusters recently and whilst they didn't return to a top quality one here they at least made an effort.Too much time was spent on the back-stories to the characters leaving too little time for a plot to be fully developed. The time left wasn't wholly wasted but I got the feeling that more could have been done. Should a sequel appear they will not be saddled with the back-stories any further and I'd expect a better film as a result.The mix of semi-bad guys is curious as some have either super powers or special abilities whilst others have none at all. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is a case in point. She plays the character very well indeed but other than looking good there's little for her to add to the sum of abilities. What could Harley or Captain Boomerang do that a squad of soldiers couldn't? Without a reason to use such people the entire premise of their assembly comes up short. Hollywood please take note and adjust the members accordingly in any sequel. I'm not averse to ladies in small pants but give them a reason to be there besides the pants. The whole idea of the suicide squad is to do things that the soldiers can't, so provide characters that meet such criteria. It should be easy to add and remove such characters as befits the job at hand and who is in the prison.The main villain played by Cara Delevingne came across well and I thought she did a fair job of it. She was no doubt helped by all the cgi and audio effects going on around her. To sum up the plot, she plays an ancient evil entity that the squad must battle to save the world.It's Viola Davis though who steals the scenes as the assembler and manager of the squad who comes across as an 'anything to get the job done' character very well.Next time keep the back-stories to a minimum and find characters that add to the sum of the squad.",6,1,3,2 November 2016
Doctor Strange," Doesn't transition from the comic book to film
","I'm not a Cumberbatch fan. Ever since his 'demand' to speak to Theresa May I've regarded him as having an ego bigger than his ability can cash. How apt then that he plays such a character in this film. The difference of course is that in the film his character finds redemption.The story is rather far fetched in that mystical forces are but an effort away as is the end of the world, and is just that bit overly rooted still in the comic book rather than being able to make a successful transition to film. The villains offer little menace due to an inability to relate the film to the real world. A comic book is aimed at children whereas a film needs to appeal to a wider audience and here it struggles. It's just too much of a suspension of reality to drag you in to believing the story. The hero of the piece is fast tracked through his training at a speed that must make all other trainees somewhat miffed adding to the lack of realism that even a fantasy film must anchor itself with.The actors all do a good job, Cumberbatch included, and the effects are top notch but it's the story that lets it all down. It's just brought too much of the comic book to the film and as such it's too simple and at the same time too far fetched. It's not a turkey but it's not even close to getting into my list of films I'll watch more than once.",5,2,4,14 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Easily the best of Disneys Star Wars efforts (main storyline anyway)
",I'm unsure why this is currently the lowest scored of Disney's efforts at Star Wars (main storyline ones) as it's easily the best. I appreciate that's not saying much as the previous two had set the bar pretty low. The cringe-worthy forced banter early on had me thinking this was going the same way but it improved into a passable effort. This is also the first time I've seen cgi good enough to pass for human in Leia. The effects were never going to be in doubt to be fair. It was always the script and acting quality that was the potential for disaster as per the previous two. A better job was done here though it could and should have been much better still.,6,3,10,15 March 2020
Ender's Game," Fails to realise the book
","First up, I'm a big scifi fan. I've read the book and wasn't a great fan of it. The basic premise was OK but I didn't like the writing style. The film is fairly true to the book but of necessity rushes some very basic parts - principally that Ender is driven to win in every contest he participates in. This is absolutely central to the plot and is skipped over in the film to it's detriment.The characters appear to come from 'my big book of film characters' and have been seen many times. This is not something that Harrison Ford normally does so comes as a surprise. By failing to capture Ender's determination and ability to win under great adversarial conditions during training the film leaves you wondering why they are trusting the defence of the planet to some pre-pubescent kid and falls down accordingly.The effects are very average being primarily cgi and very obviously so. I honestly expected this film to fall flat and wasn't shocked to find my expectations fulfilled. It's not a horrendous effort but is firmly on my list of films not to watch twice.",4,1,2,26 March 2014
Aliens," The best movie ever made
","Every scifi fan should watch this film and so should most people who wouldn't class themselves as one. A bold statement for sure but one that I think the film justifies. Aliens has everything a good film should have:-The script is sharp. Dialogue is realistic and clich√É¬©s are avoided.Acting is first rate with superb performances from the whole cast. Ellen Ripley is something we don't see very often - a female lead with a character that any actress would give their right arm to play. Sigourney Weaver plays it to perfection.The direction moves the film on at a pace and despite the long running time you certainly don't feel like anything is being dragged out.The special effects are absolutely awesome. CGI effects producers of today take note as to how to do effects properly. At no time do you think 'that effect is shoddy'. It's hard to believe this is 28 years old.The alien has to be both the best realised and scariest horror creature ever captured on film. There's no 'man in a rubber suit' here. The alien is both realistic and frightening. Top marks for pulling it off.There's action by the bucket loads, horror and scifi. It's a thriller and there's even a hint of romantic chemistry there too. It's the film with everything and is one of those rare occasions when the sequel surpasses the original. If you're a scifi fan and haven't seen it then you're missing a film that should easily make most fans top ten lists. It's right at the top of mine.",10,1,2,22 March 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A disappointed LOTR fan
","Compared to LOTR this is a major disappointment. As one who bought LOTR on blu-ray in their extended editions because of the magnificent quality of the films it is hard for me to accept such a follow-up effort. The decision to stretch this to 3 films has ruined it. The story plods, with nothing more than one action sequence after another tying it together. Unfortunately the action sequences are utterly unbelievable with hardly a scratch to show for a battle with thousands or a fall that should kill. There is a line to be drawn between fantasy and a lack of reality and it has not been drawn at all here. The CGI is obviously CGI in many places too which I found frankly puzzling given how well it blended in on LOTR. Doubtless when all 3 films have been released they will again release an even more pointless extended edition. I earnestly hope some enterprising soul edits these down to the one film it should have been all along. It can only be better.",5,3,6,12 March 2013
Ex Machina," Not original but exceptionally well made and acted.
",Ex Machina is not Blade runner or I-Robot. There's no action sequences and the android effects though well done are pretty much all there is effects-wise. What this film does offer is an insight into human interaction and failure with AI. It's a thought provoking movie and if you are the type to think Jason Statham is a great actor you should avoid it. Ex Machina is not original at all. This subject has been done before many times. Where it fails in originality though it scores big time in it's quality. The acting is superb from both main actors with Oscar Isaac the stand out. Sonoya Mizuno plays a supporting part of an AI to great effect too.I suppose it's inevitable that the AI was a young pretty female for such a film given male/female relationships but that aspect of the film really is getting a bit thin given previous films on the subject and the lack of originality is why I'm not going higher than an 8 out of 10. Get over that and you'll find a top notch film working with that old subject. We see AI's developing their own sense of self-preservation and (lack-of) moral compass and an arrogance to think we own them simply because we created them. The similarities to Google in the film are all too obvious and are a reminder of how such power can all too easily be abused.The film blurs the line between present day and the future. We are obviously reaching for this aspect of the future now and like the characters in the film I suspect we'll make the same mistakes.,8,0,3,25 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Better than Force Awakens but not as good as Rogue One.
","It's a step forward from Jar Jar Abrams Force Awakens but why couldn't they have repeated the quality film Gareth Edwards created with Rogue One? I strongly suspect it's the tying in with the original films that's holding this new series back.We still get those deja-vu moments such as flying the Falcon through obstacle laden tight areas, such as 'I feel the conflict in you' and such as 'always looking to the future...'. Each time one comes along it only serves to pause the film. Rogue One didn't suffer from this and was vastly better for it.We still get the pathetic cartoon-like character of General Hux. Any army worth it's salt would have kicked such an incompetent snivelling fool out at the recruitment office. The character feels like he's been penned by an 8 year old and is an insult to adults. We see that Carrie Fisher still can't act. She brought nothing to the role at all.Most of all though, we see a rather weak storyline. The main story is nothing more than one long escape from imperial pursuit. There are side plots that add little value to this and the whole effort to bring Luke back goes nowhere. Couldn't Leia have done what Luke did at the end?It seems the old main characters have done nothing but hold this new series back. With the passing of two of those characters and unfortunately one of the actors maybe number 9 will finally get into gear and deliver the blockbuster that 7 and 8 haven't",3,0,0,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Only OK. Not great, not bad, just OK
",This film has had the whole treasury thrown at it and ought to have been fantastic for it. It fell below that aspiration for two crucial defects:- Firstly the main hero of the piece isn't a strong character. He is lead along by others more than doing any leading himself and that detracts from his appeal.Secondly the main villain may as well be a cardboard cut-out for all the emotion and menace he brings to the plot. Utterly devoid of any ability to inspire fear he appears at various points in the film like an advert may appear on TV - ie an interval to the rest of the plot.The supporting animation and effects do their best to prop matters up but the failings of the leading characters limit their effects to merely dragging matters back to adequate. One other thing is that there appears to be no reason at all for the characters to band together. The bonding is utterly forced. It's not awful by any stretch of anything but Star Wars it isn't.,5,7,18,21 November 2014
Logan," X men franchise bows out with a whimper
","As an avid enjoyer of most superhero movies, with the X men franchise near the top of my films to enjoy list I looked forward to the climax of the set. Unfortunately there is little to enjoy here as Xavier is senile, Logan is a babysitter for Charles and Logan's 'daughter' says almost nothing.It's hard to like a character that says nothing. There's little to endear them to the viewer and that is the case here. Suffering Alzheimer's is a terrible thing to cope with and not much fun to watch either. It might be a great challenge for an actor but it's not an area of entertainment for me. To then make Logan a drunk on top of two other miserable characters is asking too much for this viewer. With the characters so full of misery there's just no hero any more let alone a super one.Of course Logan becomes the hero at the end but it's too little to late to make this a superhero movie. It's really just a means of removing the characters so Marvel can move on to some other franchise. All in it's easily the worst of the franchise and a poor way to finish an excellent series of films.",5,6,13,16 April 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A cgi fest with a messy plot and uninterested actors.
","I absolutely hate CGI that is so obviously CGI.It makes live action look like a cartoon. CGI only works when it's so subtle you don't notice it. The very first scene is an action one with so much CGI it may as well be animated. This utterly sets the bar so low as to be limboing for me. It didn't get any better as it went along either. A real shame as previous Avengers efforts were much better.The plot was contrived to the Nth degree and the acting was phoned in. The actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere but where they were.I appreciate that any superhero film requires a degree of suspension of reality but equally it also needs a degree of reality to ground it. Failure to adhere to that grounding leaves you with a live action cartoon, which is what we have here. It simply doesn't work.Please, please, please abandon the over use of CGI and make films that rely on plot, acting and effects you don't realise are effects.",4,4,11,21 August 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Too much CGI - too little story
",Rather similar to the first film in that that effects seem to be the main reason for making a film these days. There's so little plot actually happening that a fair portion of the film has to be given over to a side story of little connection to the main one.The main characters are never felt to be in peril even when under massive attack. This prevents any concern for them which in turn leads the viewer to simply not care. I don't understand how this failure happens time and again in 'blockbusters'.As a set of guardians they are a fairly dysfunctional group and I'd not want them guarding a fridge let alone a galaxy. It's by no means an awful film but others have made far better films with vastly less money.,5,2,5,14 August 2017
Arrival," Frustrating
",Arrival reminded me of Contact with Jodie Foster. Two very similar films in both storyline and a feeling of 'is that it?' at the end.The film could have been so much more but chose to end with nothing more than a 'let's all work together message' which I found deeply frustrating. The film is well made and well acted but surely a better ending could be found than the one chosen. Decent scifi films have been thin on the ground of late and this one does little to alter that. The story is that aliens want our help in the distant future and need us pulling together now to be able to provide that help later. Later never comes to this film though.I'll go so far as to suggest that this film ought to have been in two parts with the second part concentrating on what happens when the aliens return for our help in the future. That would have made a cracking story rather than the feeling of seeing only the first half.They could have done so much more but chose to settle for half the story.,5,2,3,20 February 2017
Prometheus," I expected much, much more
","Given the qualifications of the director and the size of the budget I expected a fantastic piece of scifi, right up there with Alien. What I got was a farce.Lets get the praise out of the way. It's visually brilliant. As good as it gets even and the reason for 4/10 rather than lower.Now to the crux of it's failure - the script. There is one failure after another in it. The script has been written by the most 'Hollywoodised' (sic) team I've ever come across and that's NOT a compliment. There is one clich√© after another and one moment of total and utter disbelief after another: entering a planetary atmosphere just a couple of miles from where they want to be by pure chance, man with satnav gets lost, removal of helmets in unknown atmosphere, treating unknown alien as automatically friendly, major operation and immediately mobile etc etc etc. The list is frighteningly long so I'll not list all the moments of failure. These 'Hollywood moments' as I'll call them utterly ruin the film with there voracious tenacity to continually test your intelligence. Scifi requires a certain suspension of reality in many cases to produce a film at all. That suspension of reality works only if it's plausible. This film though, takes reality and sticks it's middle finger up at it. When you throw away any semblance of reality what you have is suitable for animation only. Unfortunately real live actors were subjected to this script. They did a decent job in as far as the script allowed but it couldn't have been harder for them if there'd been a custard pie throwing contest in the middle of the film too. This was more Keystone Kops than Alien.Prometheus could and should have been a magnificent film. The hard bits were done superbly. How they could have got such a basic as the script so badly wrong is beyond comprehension. How a talented team failed to see such a poor script was in use is also beyond me.I note that Prometheus 2 is listed on IMDb as a 2016 release. I earnestly hope that a different team is chosen to write it. Films that insult your intelligence will always fall flat.",4,6,9,14 April 2014
Blade Runner," Must be on any scifi fans top ten list
","Perhaps I'm alone or one of the few who really loved the original version with Deckard's voice-over. The multitude of other cuts that did away with it just did away with a significant part of the film in my opinion. Harrison Ford didn't like the voice-over but for me it absolutely made the film.This film is the essence of science fiction and if you're a scifi fan and it's not in your top ten you'd better be able to articulate your reasons for it. The premise is a straightforward one in that androids are a threat and loose on Earth but it is so well realised and captured that the viewer is encouraged to think of the deeper philosophical points behind the plot.Effects are great without being excellent but this film is not about effects, it's about deep seated matters of human ethics, wrapped up in a dark and gritty story. A film for those able to think for sure and both played to perfection and moved along by the director to perfection. It's one of those rare films where the celluloid version eclipses the book and not just slightly but by a significant margin. An absolute classic and must watch film. Choose your version carefully though.",9,0,4,28 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A million voices cried out at once - 'Not Disney'. They were right.
","Remember the joke that did the rounds when we all found out Disney bought the rights? And a million nerds cried out at once! Well it turns out they were right to express their horror. This is no classic at all. In fact I left the cinema thinking 'Is that it?'. This is a far cry from when I left the cinema after Empire thinking 'Wow'. Now I appreciate I'm much older if not wiser but isn't a film supposed to wow you? Spoiler time - The plot feels like they've swept up the old clippings from scripts to the first three movies and patched them together. Yet another death star type weapon, yet more flying into large constructions, dodging pipework etc, yet another bad guy wearing a mask with an overlord above him and yet another droid with secrets entrusted to it. There was very little that was new or fresh. I fully expected a number of references to the past to anchor the film but this was almost ALL anchor and little new. The feeling of deja vu was all encompassing and ultimately one of sadness. A great opportunity to expand a fantastic story has gone begging. As to the characters - where does Hollywood find it's English actors? Almost all English actors / actresses seem to talk with a terribly posh voice. Daisy Ridley (Rey)is no exception. As an Englishman I can assure the rest of the world that the vast bulk of us do not speak with a plumb in our mouths. John Boyega (Finn) comes across as confused for most of the film which is not an endearing trait. It's not all bad as what was done was done well with the exception of a couple of bits of rather poor cgi. I know cgi was left out as much as possible and I appreciate that. I hate cgi as it makes things cartoon-like and this film is all the better for keeping it to a minimum. All in it's not a bad film but neither is it going to ever live with the likes of the originals. Disney has a LOT of work to do in the future films already under way to redeem itself. I hope they've started with a much better script that focuses on something new for the next instalment rather than rewarming the left-overs again.I suspect Harrison Ford will be the happiest member of the cast as he doesn't have to suffer any more of this. The force was not strong with this one!",5,38,58,21 December 2015
Godzilla," The last Godzilla film was awesome by this standard.
","Where was the story? To be honest I expected an average film with plenty of clich√©s but what I got surpassed my worst estimation. The characters came straight out of 'my big book of film characters', the story, or what little plot passed for one, dragged interminably and there were more 'Hollywood moments' than I could count. By Hollywood moments I mean liberties taken with the plot or with reality. I'll give just two examples.1. The Japanese civilian authority fails so naturally the American military takes over whilst still in Japan. The Japanese military are not to be seen.2. Ships follow each other and Godzilla mere yards apart and cross an ocean in hours. OK, with any Godzilla movie you have to take some liberties with reality to even make a movie at all but this one just sticks it's middle finger up to such cares leaving you looking at the failures rather than the story. That the story is so poorly told only makes that easier. Frankly films that treat me as an idiot only highlight their own shortcomings. To work, an action or sci-fi film must take any liberties with at least a modicum of plausibility to leave the viewer engaged with the plot rather than grasping with the liberties. The last Godzilla movie was a vastly better affair.",3,2,5,20 September 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," No plot, not Mad Max, obvious CGI, no point in watching it.
",Firstly this is not a Mad Max film. Max is utterly secondary to Charlize's character and the film should have been called Furious Furiosa. Mad Max is allegedly set in Australia but there's such a hodgepodge of accents here that you frankly wonder where it could possibly be set. If you can accept that the basic failing of this not being a Mad Max film you then hit a wall of other failures with this film.There is absolutely no plot at all here. Now I regard a plot as an essential ingredient in any film. For me there absolutely has to be a point to what is happening. This film utterly rips up that notion and laughs at it. What you are left with is action only and it fails here too. CGI is a great tool for film makers but the instant you notice it it makes any action cartoon-like. CGI is very noticeable in many places here and it just destroys any semblance of reality when it appears. It's a shame because so many of the sequences have been filmed with great action only to have the CGI come along later and ruin them. CGI only works when you don't notice it.There is almost no dialogue to the film and as such the characters are not developed in the slightest. You develop no feelings for any of them. They may as well have just hired stunt-men for the main parts for all the acting that was requested of them. The fertile Harem ladies are all supermodels. Why are only the beautiful ones fertile? Are beauty and fertility linked? Given that it's the strong who survive in this wasteland why is the chief bad guy a pensioner?Omitting a plot seems to be a recurring Hollywood feature these days. Are there really so many people around who don't require one that this film could possibly be rated at 8.6? If people really lap this stuff up then we'll obviously be fed more. A depressing thought.Only watch this if you can stand a pointless film with no plot and don't go to the cinema thinking you are seeing a Mad Max film. Better still find something else to watch.,3,12,24,23 June 2015
Alien: Covenant," Yet more incompetent fools allowed in space
","The failings of Prometheus just carry on and on and on...Just as with Prometheus we get yet another crew who shouldn't be allowed to ride a waltzer let alone crew a space ship. One bad decision or lack of leadership after another. It simply beggars belief. I'll not bore everyone with the details of their many failings as I suspect many other reviewers have done just this, but since when would anyone send any but the very best crew on such a massively expensive and important mission? The deputy captain is the biggest case in point having zero leadership ability at all. Who writes these scripts? Who says 'Yes, that's a good script. Let's work with that.' Again as with Prometheus the visuals are superb. All the difficult bits have been done really well but yet again a plain awful script and screenplay is in use. The ending in particular could have been guessed by any 10 year old 30 minutes from the end of the film.Does the industry deliberately set out to make films so badly these days because I'm finding it hard to understand how such mistakes are repeated time and again. Is the average film goer really lapping this rubbish up thinking it quality? If so we'll be extinct long before the Alien gets us. After Prometheus I gave Ridley Scott the benefit of the doubt in that he'd stumbled badly but after two completely identical failures I see no point in watching any further efforts he may make. I'm tired of being treated like a fool.",3,4,8,10 July 2017
