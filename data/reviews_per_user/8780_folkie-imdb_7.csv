The Blair Witch Project," lost in the woods at night
","Blair Witch is a great show that succeeds despite its problems.Problems: The hand-held camera jostles irritatingly in the opening, but that allows you to better ignore the subdued bouncing that is often present later in the film.  Probably the dumbest thing in the film is that the film-makers always keep shooting film or video.  Personally, I would have been more impressed if most of the shots were less carefully framed, shot from the hip as it were, suggesting that the camera was being used more as a light source than as a recorder of events.  While I was able to suspend disbelief *while I watched*, the thought of all that running around (without tripping) while a camera is plastered to one's eye boggles the mind.  I was also p***ed that the trio mentioned following a stream but decided instead to completely rely on their obviously non-functional compass.Succeeds: All that aside, I loved this show (nine out of ten).  Woods don't scare me.  Lost in the woods doesn't scare me.  The woods at night doesn't scare me.  But oooooo I'd be scared if it went on for days and nights and days and nights and something/someone maybe? was stalking me.  I've been too tired to think straight.  I can empathise.  Ever see 'Things to do in Denver when you're Dead'  Remember the guy who decides to stay awake several days, waiting for the assassin?  That's the last half hour of Blair Witch.  I was expecting the trio to turn on each other at any moment.  And Heather? Loved her acting.  First time I can remember an actress allowing her voice to break while screaming -- it's bad for your voice, hurts, and pretty well nobody does it.  But it sounds so much more authentic.  That's the neat thing about this film -- it feels authentic.  I believed in these people. I was glad when the film ended.  I was tired of being scared.",9,1,2,10 August 1999
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Depp can't sing
","Tim Burton is not a fan of musicals and it shows. The leads were cast before they were able to sing their parts. In particular, Johnny Depp (Sweeny Todd) can just barely get by musically, and most of the other actors in this show can do no better. The only people I liked listening to were Cohen (Pirelli, and utterly unlike Borat) and Sanders (Toby the boy). Everything visual in this production is marvelous...although I do wish the blood looked more like blood. The acting...I don't know acting well enough to fault it anywhere. Helena Bonham Carter...well,she's just draws one in, wanting to see what she'll do next. Considering this is her first singing role, wow. Her voice keeps the movie from falling flat. A quick check on Wikipedia reveals that about half the songs from the musical were cut for the movie. That's my main feeling after seeing this: what would the complete show, with professional singers be like. I bet it's good. But I'm not sure I'll get around to making a special trip and shelling out $75 a ticket. 7/10",7,0,2,25 April 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Lord of the Rings has scope; no other fantasy film does
","Well, I saw the film again and I've read the books again. My earlier review's tag-line was: disappointed but not disgusted.There were very few new disappointments in the second viewing and I noticed a lot of great stuff that I'd missed the first time: like the horse-shapes in the flood which sweeps aside the black riders, and many nuances of expression from the actors (Aragorn's face when he moves to fight the Urak-hai on the hill top! wow).  If you really like this sort of stuff, I'd recommend a second viewing, even if you were disappointed the first time through.But the film isn't the book. The director doesn't appreciate epic music - there is only workman-like music throughout the film until the credits roll and Enya sings. Jackson, for whatever reasons, didn't try to make the elves bright and attractive.It's not the great film I think it should be.  But when I tried to think of better high fantasy films, I was stumped.Too often, fantasy turns into really disappointing stuff like Krull (1983) or Legend (1985) or Labyrinth (1986). Dungeons and Dragons (2000) was happy, but simply felt thin (and WHAT was their idea in the utterly unbelievable comic-relief Snails character, wonderfully acted by Marlon Wayons who almost made an impossible role human). Conan the Destroyer is great (1984), is the best sword-swinger to date, but I don't really identify with mono-sylablic, burly sword-swingers.  Dragonheart (1986)? What a forgetable show. Dragonslayer (1981) does almost everything right.  Ralph Richardson is a great wizard.  The lead characters are OK, and the sense of an ordinary guy with hidden strength faced by big troubles is handled well.  It only lacks scope; it's plot would fit easily into about 35 pages of Lord of the Rings.And that is what makes Lord of the Rings the best high fantasy film to date: scope.  Tons of stuff is left out from the book, muddled from the book, yet still, you have the feeling that something really big, and really important is being played out, and that evil is being defeated.  And that's wonderful. I wish they'd released the films closer together.  I'm ready for the next one NOW.",9,0,0,23 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," disappointed but not disgusted
","Jackson has made a good film, not a great film.  Probably the single thing that ticked me off the most is Jackson's fear of a slow spot.  For example, instead of having Gandalf describe to Frodo some of the history of the ring, we see a flashback of ancient history.  A chance is lost for interaction between Gandalf and Frodo.  A chance is lost for the audience to understand Gandalf better, and to appreciate the relationship between Gandalf and Frodo.The characters of the film are strange people, not easy to identify with. Only slow spots can build this identification.  When Gandalf ran into trouble near the end of the film I just couldn't see why everyone was so upset; I hadn't seen any fierce personal loyalties develop.I've also got some minor quibbles: (spoilers ahead) like: why did Jackson have to let a black rider get about a foot away from Frodo before being distracted by someone throwing a stick? why did Jackson allow the fellowship to be surrounded by goblins in Moria, only to have the goblins all run away when their friend the balrog showed up? why did we have to have that dumb wizard's fight (at the time I thought it was neat, but later I thought: better if they hadn't actually fought), couldn't the plot condensation have been done a bit better so that Gandalf didn't abandon Frodo five minutes into his flight to Rivendell?; why did the black riders have to get within arm's reach of Frodo in the last desperate ride to Rivendell? and why, o, why did the black riders have to be such wimps in battle...Aragorn fought off five of them that easily?The first book was done badly.  However, Jackson's style will probably shine brightly in the next two installments because they are more action-oriented. So far, the fight scenes have been fabulous, and I look forward to the battle of Helm's Deep and the great battle in Gondor.",9,0,0,7 January 2002
U-571," didn't quite work
",I love WWII tales.  I love action.  I love suspense.  But this movie didn't quite work for me.  I didn't care about the characters enough.  I stopped accepting the long string of near-disasters-narrowly-avoided about five minutes before the end of the film. Thin gruel compared to the director's cut of Das Boot.  7 out of 10.,7,0,1,13 May 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Special edition so much better
","I just saw T2 Special Edition.  The extra fifteen minutes vastly improve the movie (possibly with the exception of the dream sequence where Michael Biehn appears again).  The absolute WORST deletion was the glitches in the T-1000 after being frozen and thawed.  They add less than a minute to the movie. Without the glitches he looks like he's just walking more slowly simply to be dramatic: the old 'good guys are *just* out of reach' routine.  With the glitches shown, we understand that the T-1000 is not all powerful and that the drama of the continuing chase is more believable.  Some of the other deleted moments, like Arnie learning to smile are wonderful...and I just wonder what editors think of audiences?  So often the special editions and directors cuts are leaps and bounds better than the theatrical releases. Das Boot.  You haven't seen that one until you've seen the director's cut.",8,0,0,29 July 2002
Black Hawk Down," Makes a defeat seem like a victory
","The film ends with the summary: a thousand bad guys died while only 19 Americans were killed.  Wow.  Even during a total SNAFU, 50 baddies get killed for every American.  Makes one wonder why the Americans left Somalia. The film is a wonderful example of how a battle plan can be go awry.   If the kill rate was as high as claimed, the film does a bad job of showing why special forces are so much more deadly than semi-trained militia.  For example, I found it hard to believe that the baddies would run up to the second downed helicopter, a few at a time, getting gunned down so easily by the 3 remaining Americans.  The whole film seemed to give the baddies about as much sense as Indians riding in a circle around the covered wagons while the smart settlers sit behind cover and gun them down.  I say baddies, because the 'skinnies' certainly weren't fighting like real people.Remember Saving Private Ryan, where some troops were so angry when they broke through, off the beachhead, that they shot some of the German prisonners?  I can't even remember any good guys getting angry.  Special forces don't get angry.  Instead, they just cry when they have to shoot a woman.  Yeah, right.This film is dreck compared to Private Ryan.  But it's ok entertainment, so 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,18 February 2002
