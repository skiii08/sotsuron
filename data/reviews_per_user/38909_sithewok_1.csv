Hereditary," 10/10. Don't believe the fake, negative reviews
","There are numerous negative reviews which are all lies and propaganda. Watch and draw your own conclusions.Hereditary is a modern horror classic, painful and gut wrenching to watch, devoid of any comic relief typically present in American horror. It is an experience, not a popcorn film and hard to classify as enjoyable due to how unsettling it is. It's true horror, the way horror was meant to be. The last film that affected me similarly was Martyrs (2008), divisive in its reviews, but masterful in my opinion. If you're up for something challenging which you'll likely be thinking about for quite some time after, give Hereditary a go. I would advise those who suffer from depression or other mental stability issues, or afflicted friends and family members, to pass on it.",10,3,7,29 August 2018
