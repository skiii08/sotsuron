10 Cloverfield Lane," Typical Strong Female lead.
","I knew nothing of this film except that it had one of my favorite actors i it John Goodman. And I must say he did well. But I am sick of these Hollywood plots where there is a male antagonist a female protagonist and a male side cast who sacrifices himself for the female protagonist and of course the Strong Woman gets justice on the Bad Man in the end, Hurray.... I have seen this narrative over and over again and it sickens me. 10 Cloverfield Lane does pretty good for itself script wise for the most part but what ruined the movie for me half way through was the when the fashion (newly single and strong because of it) goes on and on about her Father abuse story Hollywood just keeps kicking these poor men when they are down over 90 percent of child dispute go in favour of women and then you have to go to the theater to here about how abusive men are, disgusting. I just couldn't get past the silly feminist satire especially at the end where the fashion lady became a hero and decides she is going to face the alien threat head on thread and needle be damned!. Who knew Fashion could help save the world! So lame. Do not get me wrong I love fantasy but this movie has strong overtones of feminist jargon. when will we have a truly sacrificial heroine make the silver screen? I do not know. But we will not have it today.THUMBS DOWN",1,1,4,23 June 2016
