It," Nostalgia?
","I've watched so many 80's movies that the impression I had is that 'It' was yet another one of those obligatory classic movies to watch. How does a movie just come from having the responsibility of a classic and still go so well in the reviews and box office ?! Even more a horror movie?The feeling I have is that 'It' was so well because it did not take the 'terror' so seriously, putting the necessary suspense and 'classic' formula of the movies of the 80's. Selling terror, but also nostalgia.The film 'It' is Warner Bros showing the trend of how terror should be treated. With quality of production and terror in the right dose.",8,1,2,15 March 2018
Ready Player One," Steven Spielberg is back in the 80s!
","I confess I was afraid of this adaptation. Could Steven broadcast the games to the movies? Yes, it did and brought its essence from the 80's. Group of friends, great adventure, quality action, world-building and villain worthy of villain.If Steven continues, this may be one of the best franchises in years.And Disney, where's your Tron now?",10,16,34,19 July 2018
Get Out," Very crazy, very disturb, I loved it.
","I confess that I was slightly disturbed after this movie. LOLSeriously, I was impressed with the script, not only because of the turn of the story, but also because there is a gender exchange in the middle of the movie, something natural that only then you realize that it was horror, that became comedy and in the end suspense. And what a fantastic performance of the protagonist!",9,22,43,16 March 2018
A Quiet Place," Disturbing movie.
","With the proposed silence, any noise on the scene gives a horrible tension. If I had in a movie theater, I would be afraid to eat popcorn and drink soda.And almost speechless, are the expressions that make the actors spectacular. Especially Emily Brunt, with pain and suffering without shouting or exaggeration. Amazing!",9,0,0,14 November 2018
Incredibles 2," Yeah Pixar...
","All the chauvinism that I as a child already saw in 'The Incredibles' seems to have been fixed here. Same formula and same dilemmas, but reworked for a new experience 'Girl Power'.The big surprise this time was obviously the baby, who was previously forgotten in the first film. Great 'time' of humor! With great powers comes great laughs.Yeah, Pixar has the power to make the sequels better than the original movies.",9,2,5,19 July 2018
