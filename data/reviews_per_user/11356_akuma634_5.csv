The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!
","This was supposed to be this terror filled scream fest and it was nothing to that effect. I figured because the story was a rip off of Cannibal Holocaust this would be decent but I was dead wrong. Not one drop of blood, you never see the witch, NOTHING HAPPENS IN THE Entire MOVIE! It's just people cussing about a map for an hour and a half. This is pathetic, not one redeeming quality about it. The hype killed this from the start. The acting was noting special. The ending made no sense. There was practically no story which can be forgiven in a good horror film. But this is not a good movie. If you love being bored and House Of The Dead is your all time favorite movie and you think Ed Wood and Uwe Boll are the greatest you love this! For the rest of the world don't waste your time or money.0.01% OUT OF 100%",1,2,6,13 December 2004
Hostel," Did I miss the part where it was supposed to be 'gory?'
","I saw it first in theaters and years later the unrated DVD as a Blockbuster free rental. The movie feels like a con job, all you heard was how it's just way too violent and shocking but then when you see it all you really get is lots of talking, gratuitous soft core sex, and near the end of the movie some really bad gore effects. I've seen Troma movies that had a budget of what change they could find in their couch cushions that had far more realistic gore and of course much more creativity.The problems with Hostel are that they took a decent idea and didn't even try and go anywhere with it. You have some American tourist who end up being kidnapped and tortured by wealthy Europeans. A big problem is that there is way too much talking and sex and not enough of the 'horror' element. There aren't very many kills and what you do see looks insanely fake, like the blowtorch scene where all you see is the guys back and then they cut to the girl with red plastic glued to her face. You'll be better of just hitting fast forward through most of the movie since you won't be missing much, just lots of long conversations there to pass the time that don't add anything to the story.There just isn't anything worth seeing in Hostel. Very little plot, badly filmed soft core sex for filler, and some of the worst gore effects you'll see in a major Hollywood movie. Do yourself a favor and get something good, may I suggest getting a Troma movie like Terror Firmer which has a perfect blend of horror, comedy, nudity, and loads of gore. All I can say is that Hostel has no redeeming qualities, maybe if it didn't take itself way too seriously it could have been slightly more watchable.",1,1,3,6 July 2007
Saw II," A movie that makes you feel stupider for just watching it,
","I hated SAW with a passion. There was no gore, no suspense, loads of plot holes, and 'shocker' ending thought up at the last second, not to mention it damn near plagiarized the much superior Se7en. How can the sequel get any worse? Well I went to Block Buster to spend my free rental, I didn't see anything halfway interesting so I grabbed SAW 2 because it can't be worst than the first and it got so much praise and hype.So it starts almost exactly like part one. This guy has an iron mask filled with nails that will snap. OK I know for a fact it won't be gory because it'll just cover his face, what's the point. So I was right, just a little cheap blood. It goes on very slow paced with characters no one gives a damn about and never a reason to care if they live or die. Eventually everyone is locked in a room with no idea how they got there. They get a message that each one of them can unlock a safe and each one knows a number. Wait, did you ever see the movie Cube? Wow, they just ripped off Cube this time. But Cube had suspense and some gory moments and Saw one and two don't have either. So everyone of these idiots blinds runs right into every single trap without thing about it. It's like an hour in a half of watching rats walk into a mouse trap for a chunk of cheese. Not to mention that this movie isn't anywhere near as gory as it's hyped to be. as far as gore and violence go this would be a 3/10, even that snooze fest Hostel had a little more blood than this dung heap. Oh yeah and this Jigsaw killer is the lamest horror villain since the Leprechaun. Jigsaw is just a poor man's John Doe (Se7en) and Hannibal (in this movie he blatantly rips off Hannibal.) So just like SAW one everyone is stupid, there's no gore, and you already know who's going to die and how. For example 'Hey I should craw into this giant oven, nothing could possibly go wrong here!' The movie treats it's viewers like idiots, and you know what after all the praise both movies got maybe they have a point. And like SAW one this movie does another moronic plot twist that will either leave you laughing or just insulted. Not to mention like SAW one this isn't the slightest bit scary. I think it's made to freak out teenie boppers who think I Know What You Did Last Summer was scary.How do people say this movie is gory anyway? If you thought this was gory I'll bet you wet yourself in terror at the very mention of The Little Mermaid. You'll be better of renting or buying something good, like Se7en or Cube. I want my free rental back.",1,6,13,18 February 2006
Grindhouse," If anything see it for Planet Terror
","I love these kind of movies, there is just no greater thrill for me than to watch a great gory 70's or 80's splatter film pretty much anything from Death Race 2000 to Cannibal Holocaust. So the movie starts off with a bang, there is a trailer for a fake movie called 'Machete' which I really think should have just been filmed to replace Death Proof. Machete was this really great cheesy and gory action story almost like a Mexican variation on the black exploitation action films.Anyways Planet Terror really made it worth while. This movie is just a great action packed, gore soaked, and even humorous thrill ride. It's pretty much a zombie story and the body count is huge and there is enough gore to satisfy a hardcore gore hound (sure it isn't Dead Alive but this is an R rated movie after all.) The plot works well, the characters tend to be over the top but they have great charisma. Also the special effects are really well done, although to look like a Grindhouse movie the effects were a bit too good to really feel like a cheap 70's gore film. But it never gets dull for a second. I'd have to give it a 10/10.After that we're treated to some great trailers that are really funny. The Thanksgiving trailer is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while, also the very great parts where people get beheaded at impossible circumstances is really funny to see. So again the trailers are just a real treat, I have to say some of these could work as great horror comedies.Then Death Proof comes on, I have really high hopes for it. It starts with shots of some very beautiful women's feet and legs then you see a group of women talking about their sex lives. There is this weirdo (played by Kurt Russell) who is stalking them. So for a while not all we see is the women talking and some moments of the killer who we find out is a stunt man. All the talking really gets tiresome fast and I want some action. Eventually after way too much talking (and I'll also add that most of it has nothing to further the plot) they drive home. The killer has a passenger that he kills by doing sharp turns to bump her head into the car. He then drives in front of the group of women and crashes into them head on, it shows how the all die in the crash (pretty cool looking.) Then it cuts to the killer as the only one left alive (just a little banged up) and then our next group of women.We meet a group of very obnoxious women, I swear I wanted to strange them so I'd never have to hear them speak ever again after just 5 minutes of them. At least I should be able to watch them all turn into road kill. They end up talking and doing some car stunt for the rest of the movie. Later on the killer shows up and starts ramming the women until the diver shoots him in the shoulder and he becomes a coward who all of a sudden refuses to seek any form of vengeance. The women become the road warriors and bump his car until the cars stop and the women beat him to death. That is Death Proof, a movie that has only one car crash and 89% talking. I give it a 2/10 because it was just so slow paced, boring, and nothing really happened. Just rent Duel, The Road Warrior or Death Race 2000 if you want a quality driving thriller.In the end seeing Death Proof really took away a lot of my fun. But up until Death Proof I was seeing one of the best horror movies I've seen in recent years and I was having a great time. If it wasn't for Death Proof I'd give it a 10/10 but that just isn't the case.",8,1,4,8 April 2007
The Descent," Wake me when it's over
","I am very opinionated about horror movies and I haven't seen a good (new) horror movie since the remake of Hill Have Eyes. I despise movies like Saw and Hostel and I saw this for free and had very low expectations. So early on this woman gets into a car wreck and her husband and daughter die and for some odd reason it in to way affects the story as soon as everyone goes to the cave. So they put than in to make you feel sorry for her I guess. The characters are all very generic and the movie has almost no story. There was way to much talk and very little in the way of suspense. They use boring conversations as filler and you just sit there waiting for someone to die. The monsters weren't even the slightest bit scary and they show them way too often so it really cheapens it even more. The special effects were beyond awful, you hear a sound effect and see the aftermath in most deaths and in the other deaths it's a monster pouncing on someone and fake looking blood shoots out. For example if someone gets stabbed you hear the effect and the camera will cut to the knife already in the monster and the make up already applied, anyone with 5 bucks and a video camera could make better effects than this. In one scene this chick has a leg injury and people were actually grossed out by this. There is a fake looking bone sticking from the pant leg, and when the pant leg is lifted the make up is already there and it doesn't look very real.How about the lack of suspense? You know who will die next long before it happens, it's always when someone gets wreck less and you just know they will die soon. The monsters just magically pop up out of nowhere every few minutes. There is no psychology, no stalking, no nothing it's just BAM! And the monster just pops out. Damned pathetic. So if you've ever seen a monster movie then you will have this movie figured out long before anything happens. And like I said there is no real story, it's a bunch of women with annoying accents in a cave with a bad rip off of that thing from Jeepers Creepers popping out of nowhere every few minutes until the credits start rolling, oh yeah and according to my watch the monsters didn't even show up for about an hour (but then again there were at least 15 minutes of previews from when I went in.) So if you like your violence as fake as possible, your gore kept to a minimum, a movie that treats you like a fool, a movie that give you plenty of warnings too early (almost like The Grudge remake), and just fails on every possible level than this is the movie for you.Do yourself a big favor and go to your nearest video store and rent the following movies: The Thing, Alien, Aliens, Jaws, Piranha, and Piranha 2. Then you'll be satisfied. Those are the monster movies that really will shock you and you just won't expect what will happen next. These are the foundations of the sub-genre that every other movie has been ripping off for the last 2-3 decades.",1,9,17,14 August 2006
