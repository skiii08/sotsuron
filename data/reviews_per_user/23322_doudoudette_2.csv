Ford v Ferrari," A Masterful Account of the Chronicles of Ford v. Ferrari
","It is the 1960s, Ferrari is reigning as king of race cars, while Ford has gained a reputation for mass production of uniform road machines. When a buyout goes sour, the biggest grudge match, or the longest, is about to catch the world by surprise.As someone unaware of the dramatics of the racing world, I hesitated about going into the cinema for it. Ford v. Ferrari already sounds like a pissing contest between corporates. Well, it definitely is something of that nature, except the backstory and the act itself proves to be much more thrilling than you'd imagine. The amount of 1960s corporate suits didn't bother me at all. The cast is stellar, without a doubt, Matt Damon is so incredibly in control of his talent, capable of convincing the audience he IS Carroll Shelby, even if Damon himself is not a car guy at all. This says much about how good the screenplay is, based on a book of all real events. Christian Bale is as usual, on a ride with his A-game. The distinct mannerism of the racing Hall of Famer Ken Miles is immortalized through Bale's careful craft, borne of his unshakable dedication to the art of cinema. In fact, the whole cast shines so brightly through the movie, from Josh Lucas, Jon Bernthal to Outlander's Caitriona Balfe, each woven into the main narrative in an organic yet unneglectable way without much drag or distraction. Also, using all real racing cars instead of SFX for the important car racing scenes definitely pays off on the big screen. The camera angles are brilliant in capture those 200 million-dollar cars in motion. As a girl, I love the racing segments!More than just a car movie, the 2.5 hours boasts with comedy, thrills, and dramatic revelations that in the end, all make sense during the climax. To me, there wasn't a moment wasted, and my second viewing became even more entertaining, ripe with 'a-ha' moments. I am definitely gonna pick up the book it's based on, Go Like Hell by A. J. Baime. Can I also just note how wonderful the soundtracks are? Without a doubt, the engine sound is probably more center-stage in the film, making the just-right amount of epic score and songs much appreciable along the way.",8,1,2,24 November 2019
1917," A War Story told with Stunning Visuals and Technical Excellence
","Directed by Sam Mendes, Cinematography by Roger Deakins, and Edited by Lee Smith, each of these main crew members came on board the production of 1917 blessed with their respective win of an Academy Award previously. Sam Mendes won his first Oscar for American Beauty back in 2000, a director of good taste and technical wisdom, he knows exactly what his vision requires and puts himself to test en route to the end goal.Based on true events, 1917 tells a story of strenuous wartime efforts refined by Sam Mendes and Writer Krysty Wilson-Cairnstold, originally told to Mendes by his grandfather who fought in the Great War. In 1917, north of France, Germans make a smokescreen retreat to lure a regiment of the British Army into their trap. With field telephone lines cut, two soldiers are ordered to hand-deliver a message to the regiment on the frontline calling off their planned attack, where lives of 1,600 men are at stake.I can hear people say, uh, not another war movie, and the Academy has seen great ones since 1999 with Saving Private Ryan grabbing 5 golden statues including Best Director. But this movie is less about the war than about the almost impossible salvation of one person, or 1,600 people in time of war. In an increasingly hostile socio-political climate recently, we seem to forget the price we pay in wartime in exchange for the solidarity and comfort we take for granted. We resort to ways to soothe ourselves and take care of our souls but in a time like 1917, one man struggles to belong to the turmoil of war, let alone cares for his own insecurity and fear. 1917 is a film that puts you in the shoe of two young soldiers and follows them on a journey of salvation, where war is not happening but conditions every step of theirs. It is a universally moving story of sacrifice and heroism through the experience of two insignificant yet so brilliant boys, kind of like us. It is also a stunning movie that looks like it is done in one shot to exactly transcend your film viewing experience, taking you into the desolate world of war-torn France as we follow the soldiers passing through unimaginable lands. The technical excellence blends into the gripping storyline seamlessly, and we feel for the soldiers as they embark on a near-impossible journey that ultimately, is for their reunion with their loved ones.The film is tantamount to a free-flowing yet labored and deeply affecting poem, one that caught me on the edge of my seat, fidgeting and unwilling to let any moment. Some scenes are beautiful beyond measure, i.e., when George Mackay's character floats in a river with cherry blossom flowers emerge and 'escort' him down the stream like guardian angels; or when the wrecked city gets lit up by weapon fire in the middle of an eery night, the camera flows in a way as if it has a soul of its own. Surprises abundant, 1917 also renders each location crucial to the development of the main characters, thanks to the impeccable production design and the wonderful camera movement in every frame.Also, speaking as a production nerd, let's go back to its Golden crew - congratulations to their well deserved Oscar nods in Best Achievement in Cinematography, Sound Mixing, and Special Effects! To reach the height of a one-shot illusion, the production team planned for 6 months to go into the set with excellent coordination, minute-detail oriented planning, and near-perfect execution. Production designer Dennis Gassner built models of the entire set so everyone could sync up with the vision of Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins. When shooting, the camera could roll for as long as 10 minutes, sometimes more. 1917 provides invaluable filmmaking insight to those who aspire to unconventional storytelling and creative handling of locations & characters. If perfection in production planning ever existed, 1917 is probably it.Last but not least, Thomas Newman's score is sensational throughout, inducing all kinds of emotions at the right moment. He reminds us time and again why he is one of the greater film composers. At nearly 62 years old, Newman has 80 film scores and nine television scores to his prized name, nominated at the Oscars for 14 times. He is no doubt an indispensable muscle in helping the film get its recognition.Perhaps filmmakers of every genre could benefit from learning how 1917 is done, it is truly a gemstone of poetic storytelling combined with technical excellence. I hold this film very dear to my heart and I only dream of planning and producing a project of this much beauty and sophistication.",9,1,2,19 March 2020
