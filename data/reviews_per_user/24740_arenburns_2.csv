It," Worst Remake of a Movie I've Ever Seen
","Absolutely hated it. The creepy paedophilia moments in it, the annoying jokes and cussing from the kids, the little girl cutting her hair, thw fact that the movie was almost completely differently from the original movie and book. Don't even get me started on how IT looks like a lankey bobble head. The person who directed this obvioisly never read the book and probably didn't even see the original movie. Its just too different, its a total shit verison. I'm honestly so disappinted I wasted over 2 hours for this.",1,3,6,26 January 2018
Paranormal Activity," Overrated and Dissapointing
","So much wrong with this movie. Actings poor, shouldn't have done it in their POV, makes absolutely no logical sense like who sleeps w their door wide open and tries catching a ghost on camera? The entire series is a big mess and waste of time, it's all jumbled up and poory put together.",1,0,0,9 April 2018
