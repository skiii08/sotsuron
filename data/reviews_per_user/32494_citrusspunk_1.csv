Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely Astonishing!
","A maximum of a 1000 words could not describe this film for me...my god, i just finished it 30 minutes ago, and i am still shaking, never has a film, had me in a sweat...i don't want to get into anything about the film, because even if you are told what happens, it still has to be seen to be believed, and anyone who gives anything away, should be ashamed of themselves...i wish i could have given it a higher rating then ten...this film is so good, how it didn't get nominated for best picture and best director, is a total slap and laugh in the face, this film is so much better than Erin Brokovich (yes Soderbergh, you still are a god to me, but now you have some company)...",10,0,0,24 May 2001
