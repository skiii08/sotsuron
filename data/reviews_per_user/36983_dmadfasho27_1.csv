Skyfall," Good Movie!
","This movie was definitely a step in the right direction for the James Bond series of movies. It was very unpredictable and exhilarating. It was always a surprise to see what was going to happen next. It had its unrealistic points, although what good would a movie be without them. The main downfall for me is that, at the very beginning the movie did not make a whole lot of sense, but they pulled it together well in the end. The action spread throughout the movie was very well put together and could really draw you into the movie. My confusion at the beginning of the movie was pretty well all pulled together at the end of the movie.",8,1,9,10 December 2012
