Minority Report," My first 9 in a long time - maybe spoilers !
","First of all, I must say it's brilliant to see how international this site is !I had been terribly disappointed with AI so I feared this movie was going to be of the same juice being Sci-Fi as well.  But no !  It was really good, great technology, those 'spiders' were something else ! Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise and I guess Vanilla Sky was a perfect warming-up exercise for him in order to play MR afterwards (when he gets disfigured especially).  I have no problems with the product placements.  At least it gives us a good idea about how invading advertising could become in the future.  I certainly hope that places like the cyber/virtual reality 'cafe' will one day open, no no I don't want to kill my boss !!One thing that bothers me is 'spoiler !!' that you would expect that for security reasons 'they' would have canceled his security access, especially to enter the temple, once he was supposed to be the 'bady'.  But no, he can still use his retina as a sesame, OK you will say but how would he have got inside otherwise ?, well why not using the pregnant black lady character as an accomplice, you barely see her in the film but she seemed to really like the boss so this could have been an option.I don't mind the end, what's wrong with 'happy endings' anyway ?!!",9,0,0,8 October 2002
We Were Soldiers," Yawn
","I picked up this film as there was nothing else left at my rental store. Bad idea.  As others said Mel Gibson is playing himself again, it looks indeed like a remake of Braveheart or Patriot(s). And does he have to preach us with religion in all his movies now ? I understand it must be a relevant movie for people studying war techniques and so on or also for the Vietnams Veterans.  But as someone else wrote : it doesn't look like Vietnam at all, even if the making of shows they've planted Asian vegetation, it doesn't work one second.  At least Morocco was credible for the same location in Spy Game.  It also missed terribly the 60's beautiful music that is usually used for Vietnam's war films and helps you to put yourself back in time.  And how lucky those soldiers were to all have so beautiful wives, some dummer than others for not getting the 'whites only' sign at the laundrette but at least it helps us remember how life was for African American at the time.  We watched 1/2 of it in fast forward and that's pretty rare.  You have to watch it as a documentary based on a true story.  The good thing on the DVD is that you get to see the 'real guys and the wives'. 5/10 with all the respect to all of you who took part to the battle, it's not your bravoury which is quoted but the picture only !",5,0,3,5 November 2002
Black Hawk Down," not a chick movie
","OK, I'm a female and maybe not the target audience for this picture. I must admit that this part of African history was not fresh in my memory and therefor I found the beginning of the movie tough to watch by nevertheless very instructive.  I guess it's easy not to feel concerned about problems in remote countries.  Although I tried to make an effort an 'get into' the story, it didn't work for me and started reading while my hubby and son kept on following the story, but even they admitted they didn't enjoy it that much.  And first of all it was too long.  Excellent photography, but that's Scott for you, as hubby said 'every shot is art directed', on the other hand the sound wasn't great but we put on it the fact that they probably tried to make it more realistic that way, to show how hard it was for soldiers to hear what others were saying with all the noise going on during the battle. I guess this movie is for viewers who are passionate about combat techniques or are soldiers themselves as for the others it's just a bit too heavy, I felt far more comfortable with Saving Private Ryan.  And I'm also puzzled about the usage of 'small' mobile phones at that time in such a poor area to have a proper network and providers, to be checked...",5,0,0,23 September 2002
Vanilla Sky," Total Recall meets David Lynch...
","that's what I was thinking after viewing the DVD.  I gave it a 7, which for me is already a good mark as I need a lot to be impressed by a movie.  Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise, both girls are quite good and so is Jason Lee.  It's not the type of movie you'll fall asleep in front of.  You have to like plots in which you get lost, confused - OK not as 'mental' as Lynch would do but during the entire time you will be wondering : is he dreaming now or not ?  It also shows how weak guys can be, the main character just met what could be the love of his life and he's ready to (and in the end does) jeopardize everything for a last 'time' with his 'sleeping buddy'.  Rather typical, maybe that's the morale of the story...  Also I'm not an expert in plastic surgery but you would think that - especially if money is no option - nowadays surgeons can do a pretty good job fixing people's face after an accident, no ?  The film also shows how in fact you can loose your mind taking painkillers and other medications, what is reality and what's not ?  And what's that snobbery about having only poster of French movies on the wall ?  And whatabout the 'empty Time Square' scene ?  Isn't that just a gimmick used to make the media talk about the film during it's making - great publicity stunt isn't it ?!  But does it really bring something to the movie, or is it just another dream scene to make sure you're lost from the word go ? Another question this movie is asking is : in this superficial world we live in, could one still be in love with another after this person gets disfigured, could you still kiss that person ?  Is it 'ok' to steal you best friend's new girlfriend ? SO as the others have already said it might not be the best film ever but the picture will make you think, wonder and can be the start of great discussions among friends and that's already something, isn't it ?...",7,0,0,12 August 2002
