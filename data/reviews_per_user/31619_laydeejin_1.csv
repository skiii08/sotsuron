Come and See," Excellent, brutal and mind throwing movie....
","'Come and See' is by far one of my favorite movies from Klimov. In this movie, I felt that Klimov portrayed the brutality, the horror, and the grief of an teenager boy's (Floria) experience in a stunning manner. 'Come and See' was one of the movies that left an unforgettable impression on me. I felt that there were many significant meanings within the movie. In the beginning it was confusing because the audience is introduced to a teenage boy named Floria, who is excited to join his countrymen in the war against the Nazis. It got me thinking to why a young boy like him would desire to do such a thing when he is too young to know anything about what can happen to him in his future. As the movie slowly unfolds his experience during the war, it makes a full 360 turn. I felt that Klimov was straight forward with his movie by showing the viewers the truth about what was happening during the war. The scene where the Nazis burned the innocent people and children in the barn made me clench my chest because it was so hard to watch. The scene where the people, including Floria's mother and sisters, piled up behind the house made me goosebumps on my skin appear while sending shivers down my back. It was so gruesome to see those people killed and piled up and it also made my hatred for the Nazis grow further more.My favorite scene in the movie has the be the last scene. It is when Floria stares at Hitler's portrait in the water and decides to shoot at it. This was a major significant scene for me because throughout the movie, we never see him fire shots from his gun. However, only in the last scene when he shoots at Hitler's portrait is the only time he decides to use his gun. Also, while he is doing so, Hitler's life is shown reversed back into time of when Hitler was a baby. Overall, 'Come and See' was an excellent Russian war movie that portrays the humanity of what the people during the war went through. It showed the audience the meaning of realism and the experiences of the people who served their time in the war. This movie is a real eye opener to people and one of the best war movies I have ever seen. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Trust me, you will love it.",10,3,3,8 February 2011
