The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," love the Twilight series, , hopefully more to come.
","I loved the Twilight movies, and I hope that there will be more sequels to come, especially with original cast members. The settings where filmed were beautiful, the music captured my heart.It has been a very heartfelt series and I pray that the series will go on and certain cast will let go of past and forgive you all did a wonderful job with the movies and it was nice to see a family really stand by one another. I have watched the series several times now and have bought all the DVD's and am planning on getting the whole complete set . I so felt drawn in by the main characters of the series and if more are made I pray that they all will return, we only live once and need to be able to forgive and caring to all .. I believe Kristen and Rob should be together, for real, I just feel it.",10,1,7,23 September 2014
