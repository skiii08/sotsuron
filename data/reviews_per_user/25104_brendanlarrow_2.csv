The Monuments Men," Watered Down History
","Despite the star-studded cast, the movie displays fell very short for me. The story is amazing however, in order to perhaps attract a younger crowd, the movie removes itself from the struggle of warfare during WW2. There were some good/funny scenes and I'm not going to say the movie was awful but, considering the topic that is being talked about, I feel that the directors cut back on the potential in order to stay at PG-13.",4,7,9,17 April 2017
Knowing," Great potential but held down by the ending.
","Within the first hour, I was truly drawn into the relationship between both Cage and his child, especially with addition of the men in black with the creepily white faces. But, then the ending where the children rise up as if their reincarnating themselves. Also, the end of the world, and creation of a new one just made me feel so sketched out, as if I was watching a religious shitty movie propaganda film.",4,1,3,5 March 2017
