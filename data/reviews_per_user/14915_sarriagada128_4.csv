3:10 to Yuma," An intense ride through the west from start to finish
","If your a fan of classic western films then you will not be disappointed by 3:10 to Yuma. It has all the nostalgic qualities of the classics along with great characters and action sequences. It is a ride that doesn't stop, it is literally jammed full of action and suspense but also has very complex characters.The story is simple, Dan Evans (Christian Bale) agrees to escort captured bandit Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) to a train headed for Yuma prison. What happens on the way and the twist and turns really make this movie one you can't walk away from.If you don't care about character development and high emotions then you can still enjoy the action. If you sigh at action sequences you can appreciate the drama, character complexities and the way characters discuss and explore their moral codes. It really is a film for all types.",8,2,4,12 February 2008
The Orphanage," don't expect a great horror movie, expect something more -
","The Orphanage is not a horror film at all, if your looking for a rip their heads off film you will be disappointed. Sure there are scenes that are genuinely scary but they are few in number and not worth the wait. This film is for anyone who likes a good supernatural mystery, a film that comes to mind is Dragonfly (2002). The fun of the breadcrumb clues and puzzle solving will have to be enough for the audience to sit through the whole film, which it is if you like that stuff. The cinematography and location are incredible. It is the directors first feature film, which I think is unnoticeable, it is very well crafted. As you probably know Guillermo del Toro (Pans Labyrinth) produced this film and with good reason, it screams his style, his feeling of story telling; eerie and mystical with a hint of danger. So if you like a good supernatural mystery/thriller that has more emotion and drive than your typical horror film you will enjoy The Orphanage. If your just looking for a good horror movie scare, you wont get it; but you might get more out of the film than you think.",7,2,5,17 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Batman could actually exist
","Nolan has done a great job at painting a gritty, real world Gotham in which Batman and the Joker play it out.The film brings emotional tension and danger only experienced in films like the godfather to the world of Batman. I think this film really was for the adult batman fans, which were kids at one stage, but they grew up and Nolan accommodated.I have a feeling that future superhero adaptations will follow suit treating films as intense rides for adults rather than fun ones for kids.This film is definitely the best superhero adaptation you will ever see.",9,4,9,26 July 2008
The Da Vinci Code," An echo of the novel...slightly different, and not heard as well.
","Every now and then a best seller rises up to international fame, a film hitches the ride and punishes audiences with missing scenes, bad direction, story change and everything else that made the novel so special. This is not the entire case for Ron Howards 'The Da Vinci Code'. Normally i think it would be wrong to compare a film to its novel, however there is no secret to its popularity and it wouldn't be wrong to assume most of the viewers of the film would be the readers of the novel or Tom Hanks and/or Amilie fans.The film in comparison to the book is not far off, only the occasional additional lines, that i will not give away, seem to be strategically placed to calm the Christians who were outraged by the novel. The character of Robert Langdon seems to be dumbed down and given a spiritual side, this i could imagine would outrage the most devout believers of the novels claims. However, i still think even though the film was not completely faithful (95% faithful) to the novel, it was still a good little puppy; following the main issues of the book. The film did create the atmosphere i remember reading about, i found myself sitting in the theatre and thinking 'this is how i imagined it' but then again i have seen postcards of France.The performances of the actors were mediocre. Tom Hanks was lacking dimensions of a character known so well to so many, personally when reading the novel i pictured Harrison Ford in the pre-adventure university lecturing acts of the Indiana Jones movies. Audrey Tautou wasn't as great as i imagined her to be, my advise would be not to expect too much from her. Ian McKellen (Sir Leigh Teabing) was fantastic, i imagined his character to be stocky from the novel, but i forgot all that at once when seeing the charming old bugger.The film loses a sense of revelation, which the readers of the novel apparently obtain. My guess it was done to calm outraged Christians, but it is my guess again why they would be watching the film. However with or without revelations, the film was entertaining and worth the watch.
