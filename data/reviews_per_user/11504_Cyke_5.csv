The Rock," Great cast, action, characters, suspense, everything.
","This is absolutely my favorite movie, from my favorite director Michael Bay, starring some of my favorite actors.  Sean Connery gives a unique performance reminiscent to his Oscar-winning role in Brian De Palma's 'The Untouchables.' He plays John Mason (Another in a long line of action-movie 'Johns'), the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz.  He's grouchy, and he curses a lot.  Nicholas Cage plays a role in which he improvised many of his lines, such as 'Okay, that's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen,' and, 'This ISn't HAPpenNING!'  He plays Stan Goodspeed, a music-loving chemical weapons specialist who just found out that his girlfriend is pregnant.  He is enlisted by the FBI to disable the chemical rounds in a number of guided rockets that terrorists are using on Alcatraz. Ed Harris, also in one of his best roles, plays Gen. Frank Hummel, a justice-seeking military commander who has stolen the guided rockets to use unless the Pentagon pays him 100 million dollars.  He won't keep the money for himself, mind you, but distribute it to the families of the soldiers who have served under him.  This is a unique villain role, because it's hard to declare him as the villain. The scenes are well choreographed, including a spectacular car chase sequence between Connery and everyone else.  Since Connery and Cage are both driving expensive cars, every crash is a tragedy. Nicholas Cage delivers a great performance as a regular guy in a series of dangerous situations.  It really helps you to imagine what it would be like if YOU were there. This movie has everything you could ask for.  A great cast, interesting characters, edge-of-your-seat action scenes, heart-pounding suspense, everything. Michael Bay's best movie yet.",8,1,1,3 April 1999
Battleship Potemkin," Movie Odyssey Review #014.1
","#014.1 - Battleship Potemkin (1925) - released in Russia 12/21/25; viewed previously DOUG: I'd like to say a quick word about this Eisenstein film which we watched in Film Expression class, and were shown it again more recently in our History of Silent Film class (I slept through most of it, as I did with nearly every film we watched in that class, no matter how good). Eisenstein was, of course, a pioneer of film montage, and this film contains one of his best sequences, the famous 'Odessa Steps' sequence which follows a baby carriage rolling down the stairs followed by the oppressive Tsarist soldiers. The subject of Soviet Montage is always a key topic in any Film History class, and while it was important, a lot of my classmates have come to hate it, and feel scarred from being subjected to this and other Eistenstein films (a friend of mine jokingly called Soviet Montage 'Throwing a bunch of random scenes together and calling it a film.') We decided we didn't need to re-watch this film for our Odyssey, since we would just be waiting for the Steps scene, and we've got plenty more Eisenstein to look forward to.KEVIN: I watched Sergei Eisenstein's seminal masterpiece Potemkin freshmen year in college in our Development of Film Expression class. Eisenstein's films are certainly not for the squeamish. It wasn't ever enough for him just to get across what happened. He seemed to want the viewer to be completely immersed in the action and the drama, and he achieved this through an unparalleled use of camera-work, editing, and harrowing depictions of the most graphic imagery ever captured on film for years after. None of his films demonstrate his style as perfectly as Potemkin. It's been years since I watched this film, and most of it I've forgotten, except of course the unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence, which is often regarded as Eisenstein's crowning achievement of film-making. I watched it yet again in another film class, and I managed to sleep through most of it, waking up just in time to see the Odessa Steps. What I stayed awake for I still managed to forget.Last film chronologically: The Big Parade (1925). Next film chronologically: The Black Pirate (1926).",Null,0,2,26 July 2006
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Movie Odyssey Review #022.1: Passion of Joan of Arc
","022.1: Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) - released in Denmark 4/21/1928, viewed previously.DOUG: We watched this silent classic a couple of years ago when we became interested in how historical figures, warriors in particular, are portrayed in the movies. This entry was part of a trio of films featuring Joan of Arc (the others starring Ingrid Bergman in 1948 and Leelee Sobieski in 1999). We watched this one last, and it's definitely the best of the three. Those wondering about the title may assume correctly: Mel Gibson took the same approach to Christ in his film Passion of the Christ as this film takes to Joan: The last part of their life leading up to their famous public execution. When one talks about this film, the discussion really has little to do with what happened to Joan herself; it's more about the unique, disorienting way the film is shot, lit, edited, and acted. The director isn't really interested in teaching the audience about Joan; her trial is just the setting for this little head trip. The whole thing is very disorienting; in the courtroom scene, you're not allowed a sense of where each character is sitting or how the room is laid out. Dreayer wants to immerse you in what's happening. Much of the film's strength also lies in the performances of the cast, particularly Maria Falconetti in her only film role. This is an essential piece of silent film history, which was winding down at this point in time.Last film chronologically: Speedy (1928). Next film chronologically: Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.",9,4,7,18 October 2006
Duck Soup," Movie Odyssey Review #093: Duck Soup
","093: Duck Soup (1933) - released 11/17/1933, viewed 6/9/07KEVIN: At last, my favorite Marx Bros. movie. 'This means WAR!' First they messed with high society in Animal Crackers. Next they wrecked havoc on a cruise liner in Monkey Business. Then they unleashed their antics on the college campus in Horse Feathers. But this time, it's war! The Marx Brothers latest outing, Duck Soup is their funniest, most streamlined, and by far my favorite Marx movie, and it is the first movie on the odyssey that I already have memorized. I'll take this one over 'Night at the Opera' any day. The movie starts out like an achingly routine politics-and-manners play. But when Groucho makes his entrance, it's a non-stop romp from there. Margaret Dumont is at her best. In the previous films, her timing with Groucho was a little shaky. It would go like this: Dumont would act regal, Groucho would toss out a non-sequiter, Dumont would pause to regain her bearings before the next line. Now the awkward pauses are gone, and Dumont never quits, no matter what Groucho says to her. My favorite moment from her is late in the film, when she puts in one last effort to prevent war and must watch helplessly as Groucho inevitably fouls it up. Edgar 'Slow Burn' Kennedy is a stitch as the burly lemonade vendor who is repeatedly tormented by Chico and Harpo. After watching those scenes for the 18th time, I started to see that while certain comic beats may look chaotic, it is all meticulously rehearsed over and over again until it's perfect. Everyone else is perfect too. The supporting players pull their weight rather than slow things down. In the past the Marx boys played it sort of like they were in a different movie than everyone else. It's the same in Duck Soup, only this time everyone and everything just fits. And the final reel of the big bad war is the most rapid-fire marathon of Marx material I've ever seen. Naturally, I chose the film's climax as the clip to show for a presentation I did in my theatre history class about the Marx Bros. and their similarities to commedia dell'arte (it was way more fun than it sounds.) It comes down to this: The Marx Brothers are all about chaos. Anything that is structured and in order, they come in and tear it apart. By the time they're done with Freedonia, all that's left is pure hilarious mayhem.'And while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are!' DOUG: It's the end of an era with this, the leanest and meanest Marx Brothers movie of all, and one that's very close to my heart, Duck Soup. It's the last one with Paramount, the last one with Zeppo, and the last one in the Pre-Code era. I watched this film for the first time several years ago on TCM. It was on at 1 in the morning, and it was the funniest 70 minutes of my life, totally worth it. Watching it this time, I kind of got this impression: It's as though Zeppo got a role in this boring movie about two countries in political turmoil. Rather than simply act in the film as planned, he invited his brothers over to make things interesting. The result was Groucho, Chico, and Harpo disrupting the proceedings with their trademark mayhem and non-sequiters, while the other actors (Raquel Torres, Louis Calhern, and the great Margaret Dumont) are trying desperately to stick to the script. It's the only explanation for why Mrs. Teasdale ever trusts Firefly to save the nation, or why Trentino ever expects Chicolini and Pinky to come through for him. By the third act, it's as though they just threw out the script and made up the rest. The film's meager running time is filled to the brim with jokes, gags, and insults that come fast and furious; you'll never catch them all in one viewing, or two, or even three. Even 'Airplane' and 'Young Frankenstein' can't match the pace of this one. In one scene, Trentino asks the guys if they 'got Firefly's record,' and a flurry of gags ensue: a toss, a gunshot, a bell, a cigar, and finally trapped fingers. The only scene that doesn't really work for me is the trial scene, maybe because it feels like filler before the big finale, maybe we're all tired out by that point, or maybe it's just too many other characters stepping on the brothers' jokes and throwing out obvious set-ups. Then there's Zeppo, the youngest brother and straight man one last time, playing Groucho's handsome assistant Bob. I recall when I watched the film for the first time, I didn't know that Bob was actually Zeppo until he joins his brothers in the 'Freedonia's going to War' number. Not that that's bad; he does what a straight man must, going along with his boss/brother's every odd request ('Here's five dollars, keep it under your hat. Never mind, I'll keep it under my hat.'). Margaret Dumont is at her best here. She lets out the necessary reactions to Groucho's subtle insults about her weight, but never loses her cool, and powers on through in-character like nobody's business. Like comedies? Like mayhem? Like classic movies? Like good movies? Like movies AT ALL? SEE IT!Last film: Little Women (1933). Next film: Flying Down to Rio (1933).",10,1,3,6 April 2008
All Quiet on the Western Front," Movie Odyssey Review #040.1: All Quiet on the Western Front
","040.1: All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) - released 4/21/1930.DOUG: We watched this film as part of our exhaustive War Movie Odyssey two years ago, and it was definitely one of my favorite movies in the set, not to mention one of the all-time best movies about WWI. It shows the war from the German point of view, but I got the feeling they could have done practically the same movie from the point of view of nearly any nation in the war. The themes are pretty universal for what happened; the needless massacres, the officers who had no idea how to handle an army, the soldiers asking 'why is this war happening?' The movie is made up of nothing but memorable scenes; the scene where the soldiers get back at their drunken CO for spoiling their leave; the scene where a fellow soldier realizes that his leg has been amputated; the scene where Paul spends the night in a foxhole with an enemy soldier he has killed; the scene where Paul enters the class of students, just like the one he was in years ago, and tells them all how war really is. War movies of the day were clearly about how war was pointless as that was the feeling about WWI (or, as it was called then, The Great War); this would change when WWII came along, when the word would be that the war was necessary, and worth fighting.KEVIN: We watched this film years ago to kick off our massive war movie odyssey, and there were no other films throughout that list that equaled this one in anti-war sentiment. Most war movies are anti-war on some level, but All Quiet spends every frame of its 130-minute running time driving home its point. I remember so many scenes in this film. The scene when Paul and his friends are listening to their teacher go on about the honor and patriotism of going to war and fighting for their country, and the scene later when he returns to the same classroom after his disillusionment to find that his old teacher is telling the same bull story to a new flock of prospective corpses. The scene when Paul finds himself in the hospital bed being wheeled through the door of no return. And of course there's the unforgettable scene when Paul winds up in a shell hole with a dying enemy soldier. I remember the battle scenes were gritty and graphic to a degree that we would not see again until Saving Private Ryan, the way the camera tracks viciously across the trenches as the enemy forces advance. One of the interesting things is that the fact that the characters are German is incidental, as the conditions and the despair were nearly identical on all sides of the conflict. Had we watched it again, it would have been the first film depicting World War I on the list (after the more uplifting The Big Parade), and it would have been almost unnecessary to watch any others, simply in the way that this film captures in every way the disillusionment the world saw during that war, brought to life from the point of view of a few scared youths facing horrors no one before them had ever experienced.Last film chronologically: The Divorcée (1930). Next film chronologically: Hell's Angels (1930).",10,2,5,11 January 2007
