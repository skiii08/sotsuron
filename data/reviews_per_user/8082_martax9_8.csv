10 Cloverfield Lane," Nice story-line and performances but a disappointing ending
","First of all, I should start this review by stating that I was very excited to see this film. I rarely go to the cinema and this was one of the films I had picked out to see at the cinema which means I liked it very much. Secondly, the performances were brilliant which was an important aspect of this film since it featured only a few actors which were also the protagonists. Its claustrophobic theme was breathtaking: you were feeling for the 3 people and could sympathize with all 3 of them, even though you didn't know if they were actually nice or disturbed. The film was indeed a roller-coaster ride. You were led to believe that the ''abductor'' was a kind guy who just wanted to help, then you find out that he has probably abducted other women and killed them so he must be crazy and then, the twist at the end informs you that you should have believed him and that he didn't want to hurt you (as much) after all.But, I rated this film with 4 out of 10 stars because the ending, although I did not expect it, involved aliens which made the film sci-fi, which was not the reason I wanted to watch it. On the contrary, I was expecting another genre and I didn't like that kind of transformation. Plus, the aliens that seemed to be very powerful at first, eventually retreat when the female protagonist -in the heat of the moment, tired, shocked and scared- attacks them with what? A bottle? In conclusion, the ending came of as sketchy and sloppy, as if they had wasted the film's minutes building up the suspense and then they ran out of time, so they just surprised us with some aliens and a very cheap solution so that the female protagonist can survive.",4,0,1,1 January 2017
Aliens," I don't understand what all the fuss is about!
","First of all, I should start by saying I loved Prometheus and Alien: Covenant but not so much Alien and Aliens. Of course since Prometheus is a more recent film it has better special effects, sound, and even casting (for some people) I could relate to it more but that's not all. I find that there are a lot of inaccuracies and plot holes that this film would be considered a B-movie if it wasn't for its originality back in the day. The girl lived and wasn't killed by the alien, only to be taken to the room containing all the eggs to supposedly become a host (?), yet everyone else was killed by the aliens. The crew members that were attacked just died and the aliens didn't multiply...and definitely didn't take them to the room with the eggs and mother...Riiiiight. Also, how did Ripley's leg manage to stay attached to her body when the mother alien was clinging to her with the air being sucked out of the ship? How did the girl who is the less able human out of all 157 colonists manage to survive there on her own while everyone else just died? What did she eat? Didn't the crew and Ripley arrive some years later? That's why they slept didn't they? I guess time on earth and time on another colony are very different but the girl probably wasn't there alone for one day only..And if she managed to hide, she would have stayed hidden for days. There were so many questions I can't count them all.I think this film is so popular and well-rated because it was different from all the other films released back then, it was a breakthrough for that time, something original, scary, gripping so everyone went crazy over it and it became an instant classic. It has happened to me too so I know they psychology behind it, but I can look past that and judge films Objectively now. For example, when I was 11 I loved Charlie's angels with Barrymore, Liu and Diaz and would swear it's the best film ever, and I still like it but now I see I was just taken aback by the film's action and bad ass female casting..and that it's not so great after all. I do not understand why this film has such high rating, why it's considered one of the 250 best films ever (ffs), I found it rather boring to say the least.Rating: 5/10",5,2,13,13 September 2017
To Rome With Love," Yet another adultery film
","What's up with Woody Allen and adultery?His 'romantic' films don't end up being romantic, but cheap excuses for him to portray adultery as something that just happens. I bet every single one of his films starts with a not so happy couple and ends with one of them or both cheating on each other. And he makes it seem so natural, as if it's just bound to happen and everyone does it, yet no one feels bad for it. I understand cheating is very common and sometimes makes a film interesting but I've come to believe he is obsessed with the deed...and it bores the hell out of me.Also, his romantic partner, spouse, mistress in his films is always 20+ years younger than him...always.Is that a coincidence, too? This film wasn't any different, though I hoped it would have been.6/10 for the famous cast and nice view of Rome.",6,0,4,1 March 2018
Call Me by Your Name," I wanted more and better.
","I was so excited to see this film, and I was glad that such a film was even created because we rarely see the LGBT community represented so clear in cinema and when we do, the films themselves aren't that good. I couldn't wait to see it because I was certain it was going to be amazing.The film started, the background was beautiful, the soundtracks too. I was waiting for their relationship to 'happen' and waited for a very long time. Nothing wrong with a build-up I thought as I became more and more anxious to see them get together at last. Both Elio and Oliver are interesting people but I could't quite sympathize with them. For some reason, I didn't see past their carnal desires. I wanted to see Elio struggle with the fact that he liked men, maybe fear what his parents would think of him if they found out. I wanted to see Oliver question his sexuality as well, before their platonic relationship turned sexual. It was like I waited an hour to see how they came together. They were distant from each other for an hour and I didn't feel a connection there and next thing you know Elio tells Oliver he wants him to know about some 'things' which Oliver correctly translates to ''I want you'' and they start making out. In other films with couples, I get attached to them, understand their feelings, feel their longing and struggles, and I'm rooting for them. I was waiting for this moment in this film as well but it never came.What's more, I wish I could understand Elio's sexuality, as he sleeps both with Marzia and Oliver. I couldn't figure out whether he slept with Marzia thinking of Oliver or he actually liked her, too. Oliver says he misses him but informs him he's engaged to a woman. Is he bisexual or just gay but can't do otherwise? It would help me understand if this film is about lost/forbidden love or just a fling that was good while it lasted but couldn't be anything more than that.Nevertheless, it's a coming of age film that depicts first love nicely and has a very moving scene in which Elio and his father talk about Oliver. Timoth√©e Chalamet is extraordinary and his performance is compelling.",6,17,41,26 February 2018
Coco," Simply put...it's amazing
","This film gets an 8/10 from me not because there was anything wrong with it. I bet if I were born in Mexico I would have connected with it even more and I could relate to it and rate it 10 out of 10.This was an amazing film on so many levels. The music, the characters and their depth, the colours, the meaning behind it..I was crying uncontrollably for the last fifteen minutes while also feeling stupid for reacting that way to a ''kids' movie''. But this is a movie for everyone! You can be 10 and enjoy it or you can be 80 and still love it!I recommend it to anyone, even those with a cold soul because it just touches you and leaves you with a bittersweet feeling when it ends.",8,0,1,18 July 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not in the top 250 films
","This film should definitely not be in the top 250 list. It was a nice film, time passed rather quickly, it was enjoyable but nothing more. I liked the casting, especially Uma Thurman as the Bride and the script was original and refreshing to see a female lead that is strong both physically and mentally. But all the gore, blood shooting out of hands like it's some kind of weird anime, the Bride basically airwalking in half the scenes, and her basically being ready for anything after her being in a coma for four years is nonsense. Furthermore, what's with all the black and white scenes? It seems Tarantino was trying to hard to impress everyone and make them talk about this film..I suppose I don't like Tarantino's directing style.Other than that, it's worth a shot if you like these kind of films, or Tarantino himself.",6,0,0,12 April 2018
Whiplash," What's the point of this film and why do people like it so much?
","The good: The outstanding performances of Miles Teller as Andrew and J.K Simmons as Fletcher. They both were incredible in their parts and it seemed as if they gave their best in portraying the two male leading roles. The film surely wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for these two to lift it off. I also liked the fact that this film pays tribute to jazz music which is so overlooked in this age and time.The bad: Pretty much everything else. It seems like the initial goal of this film is for us to sympathize with the protagonist and share his ambition. We are supposed to like him, admire him for his persistence and cheer for him as he is trying hard to succeed in what he wants the most. But soon, we discover that Andrew's character is a self- centered, self-righteous, arrogant guy who thinks he is the best musician that has ever existed just because it is his ambition to become one. He hurts everyone else's feelings and diminishes them because he seems to believe he is more talented than them (as if it's him who decides that). For example, when he tells the girl he was supposed to be dating, that he does not want to date her anymore because she will slow him down, she asks him if that is because she said she doesn't know what she wants and he is positive. Which means that in his mind, just because he has found a thing he is passionate about, he is superior to the girl, who hasn't found a hobby or career path. Before that, when he is at the dinner table, he seems agitated because his family is not always talking about him and his drumming thing. He tries to change the subject back to his drumming and proceeds to diminish their talent because he really does think they will never amount to him. Which means that although he doesn't like the emotional abuse he is receiving from his teacher, he likes mentally abusing other people. Furthermore, I do not clearly understand what this film is trying to prove or make us believe. That it is okay to be emotionally scarred for life if some teacher says it's for your sake? Are we supposed to be relieved when the teacher reveals he is being cruel only to motivate the students to be the best and say ''Okay, he wasn't that bad of a person'' because I don't think that's a sane thing to do. The way to motivation should not (and is illegal to) include battering the students, calling them names, using their family background to verbally abuse them and insulting them in numerous ways. So, even if the teacher thought that was the way to make them better, it does not make him a better person. It makes him a monster. What's even worse is that Andrew seems to like his teacher in a weird way. He knows he is a good teacher and an even better musician so he is trying to look up to him and be the next Charlie Parker. Which means, he has to be as mean and as selfish as his teacher already is so that the teacher finally gives him his blessing. Is that what we want our kids and fellow men to do? Can't someone be the greatest musician ever without being an arrogant guy that puts other people down and admires the wrong kind of people? Couldn't Andrew just be humble and a nice person with the same persistence and drive? Another thing that really angered me off is how Andrew is indecisive. He swings from wanting to kill his teacher to cooperating with him to get him to like him. He confesses that his teacher is verbally abusing everyone in his class, he knows that the teacher's ways have led to someone's suicide so it looks as if he understands how bad of a person Fletcher actually is. Then he talks to Fletcher, plays with him at the festival as if there is nothing wrong whilst still admiring him as a teacher and musician. And after he finds out his former teacher has betrayed him by ordering a new song he didn't know, he leaves enraged, only to return to his drum set and give everything he's got....Is he suffering from bipolar personality disorder or is he just not sure of what he wants in life?Overall, I did not like much in this film. Sure the performances of Teller and Simmons were something else and the cinematography is brilliant but in the end, this film should not be anyone's favorite.",4,3,8,2 January 2017
The Greatest Showman," I would have liked it more if..
","I don't know an awful lot about the real P. T. Barnum's life so I will not compare him and the portrayl of Hugh Jackman, but I will say this: the film wants you to like him. We see him young and poor, with dreams bigger than life itself. Then we see him succeed but always want more. Then we see him fail but we are supposed to root for him again and in the end, he picks up from where he left and is rich and successful again.Why should I like a person who took advantage of poor, unwanted people just to make money out of them? He didn't want an inclusive society, he wanted ''oddities'' that would shock people and make them laugh because he knew it sells. In his circus, he had animals as well and I'm surprised other reviewers have not mentioned this at all. Don't you know how badly animals are treated at circuses? They whip them, hit them, yell at them and God knows what else they do to them to perform. They are separated from their family, from their own kind, taken from their natural habitat only to be forced to do things that aren't natural to them. How do elephants standing on just one leg or lions jumping through fire make for a nice movie ending? It just made me sad.Now I kind of liked the music and the movie overall was enjoyable even though I don't like musicals very much. But it was a romanticized account of a real person's life. I would have rated it higher if the movie was truthful because it could have easily been so. It could still be a wonderful musical but portray him as the man he really was.",5,1,2,21 October 2018
