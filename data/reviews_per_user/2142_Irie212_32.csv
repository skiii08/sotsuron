Iron Man 3," The skillful evolution of Iron Man
","To judge by many of the reviews here, it's possible that fans of the Marvel comic may be too close to the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man to be objective, because I didn't read many cogent criticisms of this as a stand-alone film. There's a lot of lamenting about how it should or could have been done. But Iron Man 3 does stand alone, and it stands tall.The movie is a cleverly constructed stride forward in this franchise, which is the most entertaining of any comic-to-screen work. It's popularity and success is largely due to Robert Downey Jr's unique charisma, of course. However, considering John Favreau's wonderful comic turn as Happy Hogan, I can't help but conclude that a lot of the success is due to his approach to the material. Most impressive for me was the way Tony Stark and Iron Man are examined in relation to each other. The film begins with Stark having tirelessly (sleeplessly, in fact) constructed more than 40 iron suits (including one each for Pepper and Rhodey), the new models being generously articulated-- hundreds if not thousands of components whizz toward and assemble on him on command. That deconstruction of the suit becomes a plot device, allowing Stark to go through the various fight scenes in various degrees of armor-- fully encased, partially, or entirely without the suit. We're watching him evolve. The suit is also a skin, and a weapon. When Pepper wears part of hers, she gets insight into Tony that she could never otherwise have had: I understand how attached you are to it now, she says (I paraphrase). And in the end, Tony commands the suits into whizzing action: first as an army, and then in a spectacular display in which he reclaims himself as a vulnerable human man.This is a well-conceived film that moves Iron Man forward more as man than machine. The only disappointment for me was the pointless 3-D technology. It didn't hurt; it just wasn't necessary. I would write more, but I need to see the film at least once more before I can fully explore all the talent that went into it. The post- credit sequence with Downey and Mark Ruffalo is not only fun but useful, for making the audience appreciate all the names the roll past, and all their roles. Among them: Mark Stoeckinger (Star Trek 2009, Prometheus, Unstoppable, etc., etc., including multiple episodes of Miami Vice), whose sound editing in this film is as good as it gets-- no small praise for this genre of movie.",8,0,2,11 May 2013
Child 44," Strong story, flawed in the telling
","A serial murderer is at large in Stalinist USSR (1945). The victims are young boys. That is the background to what is really an attack on Stalinist tactics. We don't see much of the crime or even the investigation. Mostly we see a Western take on Soviet suppression. Don't get me wrong, Stalin was a mass murderer on a historic scale, and deserves vilification. But his minions were individuals. 'Child 44' doesn't recognize such complexity. Instead, it reduces almost every character to good or evil. The exception is Raisa (Noomi Rapace in a beautiful performance), the wife of a captain in Soviet intelligence, Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy, in what may be his best performance to date). The arc of the story takes her from feeling forced into a marriage to a powerful gendarme to the dawning realization that Leo is a good man struggling with his brutal role and reputation in society.Ultimately, the two principal bad guys-- the child murderer (Paddy Considine) and Leo's colleague and nemesis (Joel Kinnaman)-- are nothing more than plot devices to deliver scenes of brutality, including a protracted beating of Leo. I saw the film streaming on TV, so I could fast-forward through scenes that made me suspect sadistic tendencies in the director, Daniel Espinosa. The only other film of his that I saw, 'Safe House,' showed the same tendencies ( and his 2017 movie 'Life' has no shortage of pain and gore, according to reviews I read.) I'm not squeamish; there is a place for violence in cinema. But Espinosa indulged in it well beyond the needs of the story. The running time of 137 minutes is a tell. And the power of the story is not about the Soviet purges and gulags, where violence occurred. The story, at its heart, is about one spouse finding the true moral character in another-- a wife learning to trust her husband's love, and coming to love him in return. It's too bad such sensitivity didn't inform all the characters in the story, or spare the audience the excessive bloodthirst.",6,0,0,23 August 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Not a fresh moment in it
","If you've seen previous Star Wars films-- almost any of them-- then you've seen this movie. The premise is rather fun: it's a prequel to the original 1977 film, 'Episode IV: A New Hope,' detailing how rebels acquire the plans to the Death Star that Princess Leia delivers to R2D2, and ultimately to Obi Wan Kenobi, in Episode IV. Unfortunately, the two plots-- this movie and Episode IV-- are virtually identical. In both, rebels plan and execute an invasion of an Empire stronghold. Little effort is made to enliven that old plot with fresh ideas, fresh humor, fresh anything.Several actors from the 1977 original are digitized in (Peter Cushing, Carrie Fisher), and Darth Vader shows up (James Earl Jones' voice), and I don't expect or want anything new from them. But the rest of the characters are just rehashes of previous ones. We've seen them before. The generic Zen character (Donnie Yen) is part Yoda, part Obi-Wan. The robot K2SO is part Wookie, part C3P0. Bad guy Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelssohn) is Darth Vader but in a white cloak. Jyn (Felicity Jones) and Cassian (Diego Luna) are basically the same character. They're fine actors, but one does wish for the occasional change of pace, even if its just a different facial expression.I wish I could recommend it. It's not an embarrassing disaster like 'Phantom Menace' or 'Revenge of the Sith,' it's just boring.",5,6,12,14 January 2017
Public Enemies," What exactly would a 'spoiler' be for this film?
","Okay, I clicked the 'spoiler' box because I don't want to be blacklisted, but honestly, if you don't know the fate of John Dillinger, you should be reading, not watching movies. There. That's off my chest. Now then, in spite of its predictability, Public Enemies has worthy performances from a strong cast. Depp, Cotillard, Crudup, and Steven Lang are standouts, but the cast is big-- new cops and gangsters seem to crop up in ever sequence. The screenplay is well-crafted, and notably fine art direction is sensitively set in the original Midwestern (Wisconsin and Illinois) locations. The only real disappointment is the music. (News flash: Billie Holiday was not the only jazz singer in the 1930s; in fact, she didn't even start recording until a year before Dillinger was killed, so three songs by her is a bit much. Why not Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, Ma Rainey?). The fact that it's impossible to issue a spoiler for a movie about Dillinger becomes one of the fundamental problems with a gangster movie like this-- unlike, say, The Godfather, which was fictional. It's very difficult to deliver suspense. For the most part, we get action instead-- chase scenes, shoot-outs-- because the question is never, What will happen?, but How will they show it? Michael Mann does succeed in keeping the story moving, and the visuals very engaging, even though the plot is a series of bank robberies, jail escapes, gun battles, and of course a little sex.",7,2,2,16 July 2009
Brokeback Mountain," A meritorious subject does not guarantee a meritorious film
","Like most people who saw 'Brokeback Mountain,' I came wanting to like it because I am morally involved with the subject matter. In the end, though, whatever compassion I felt for the two men came from my principles, not film itself. Their longing for each other is embedded in the screenplay, but the only reason I had to believe that they were in love was that I was told it. I never felt it.Dealing with homosexuality as a forbidden subject accounts, to some considerable degree, for the fawning reception this film received. But a meritorious subject does not guarantee a meritorious movie. If it did, then the drab rehab movie '28 Days' would be a classic and the racist 'Birth of the Nation' could not be.While the failed marriages of the two men were convincing, their failed chemistry left me unmoved. But that wasn't the only problem, of course. Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant could be kissing in 35mm and it wouldn't overcome Ang Lee's stale direction. I'll confine myself to three main complaints: 1) the watching-paint- dry pace that makes this 2-hour movie seem longer than a 20-inning baseball game; 2) the gutless country music soundtrack, which is Santaolalla's worst work; and 3) Ledger's incoherent mumbling, for which there is never any excuse. Mumbling was one of Brando's signatures, but his artistry was such that he delivered the emotional essence.It would be shorter to say what's right with 'Brokeback': the Alberta and Wyoming locations, and Michelle Williams.By the way, for real chemistry between men in a far more effective and important movie on the subject of homosexuality, see 'Victim' (1961). The screen is never even shared by Dirk Bogarde and Peter McEnery, but the strength of their forbidden love â€” in England, criminal love until 1967-- is all the more powerful for including scenes explicitly addressing the tragic political and social bigotry.",3,3,25,13 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," A strong story sacrificed to action sequences.
","Perhaps the most impressive thing about Terminator Salvation is the secret behind the title. The film is indeed about salvation-- but not the salvation of any familiar character like John Connor or Kyle Reese or even the T-800. Instead, this sequel tackles one of the richest themes of sci-fi: exploring the 'humanity' of an artificial man. The secret of Terminator Salvation is that it begins, and crucially ends, with an original character-- a death row inmate called Marcus-- who becomes an entirely new hero in this long-established franchise.If only the filmmakers had developed and respected that creative storyline. Instead, the idea is all but lost in a relentless, and relentlessly loud (not Danny Elfman's best work), maelstrom of action sequences. Adding to the ear injury is the screenplay. There are few if any memorable quotes, and many truly lame lines. Most memorable are the idiotic shouts of 'Hang on!' when everybody was already (DUH!) gripping any available purchase to survive yet another deafening action sequence.But although this movie disappoints, a lot of obvious talent went into it. I refer not to Christian Bale, who has become Hollywood's true Hoarse Whisperer. I refer to Sam Worthington, who brings a slowly building power to Marcus. It just seems that most of the all-important writing talent ended up on the cutting room floor. Many things do, of course, end up there in any film. But plot and character should not be among them. Sadly, in this case, they seem to have been the earliest victims of the unrelenting CGI.",5,2,3,1 June 2009
Juno," Pregnancy minus humanity equals 'Juno'
","'I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here and it's obviously a poisonous environment to raise a baby in.' That line is spoken by an ultrasound technician, and anyone who believes that there exists in any hospital, anywhere in the world, a technician who would say that to a patient, is a moron.As for the rest of this callow, glib film, I hardly know what to, like, say. A high-school junior gets pregnant, but shows not the slightest humanity or vulnerability-- except once, when she complains that her fellow students make fun of her. If they do, there's no evidence of it. She acts, throughout, as though the pregnancy is less of a bother than a passing case of acne.Ridiculous doesn't begin to cover it.",2,6,16,15 September 2009
The Prestige," 'If your hate could be turned into electricity, it would light up the whole world.'
","That quote is from Nikola Tesla himself, it's not from the dialog spoken by David Bowie as Tesla. But I think it summarizes what is wrong with The Prestige. The action of the movie centers around the nexus where science meets illusion, which is a fascinating avenue into metaphysics, but in this movie, the science is little more than elaborate window dressing to what boils down to a melodrama about the all-consuming hatred between two illusionists the 1890s, Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale). I'm not a fan of reviews that say what filmmakers should have done. Better to judge artists on the choices that they did make in the writing, casting, production, etc., and how successful those choices were in the finished work. But The Prestige is particularly frustrating because the Nolan brothers are obviously talented men, and I'm convinced that they missed opportunities both large and small.First, the science: Besides including Nicola Tesla as character, there are two stagecraft engineers, Cutter (Michael Caine) and Fallon (Bale, disguised, in a dual role). Neither, unfortunately, add much to the story, which, again, boils down to a feud which is so vicious that both men end up handicapped.Second, a rather glaring flaw in the script: Angier is determined to duplicate Borden's most phenomenal trick, teleportation, which can be compared to Scotty beaming people from Point A to a nearby Point B. Angier's engineer, Cutter, deduces that Borden achieves the illusion by simply using a body double at Point B, but Angier stubbornly refuses to believe that, which drives the plot off the rails for two reasons: (1) Less believable than any magic trick, ever, Angier is promptly presented with his own exact lookalike--Gerald Root, an underemployed and drunken actor-- which is preposterous, and disappointing except that it gives us a double-dose of Hugh Jackman. (2) Cutter was right about Borden simply using a double (his twin, Fallon), but Angier has gone to Colorado to find Tesla, whom he employs, and the great Tesla actually invents a kind of teleportation that is more fantastic than Scotty's transporter: it not only transports, it clones. While the subject remains at Point A, a duplicate pops into existence at Point B.A stunning breakthrough, no? But it's used as just another magic trick.In the end, more disappointment for the viewer. Angier confesses that his motivation all along-- the driving passion of his life-- is nothing more than to bask in applause, so the whole feud boils down to Angier's rolling-in-it ego vs. Borden/Fallon's consummate duplicity. The women Borden and Fallon love don't even know there are two of them. Ultimately, both wives end up dead, and a shared mistress (Scarlett Johanssen) is so manipulated and betrayed that she scrams. The actual climax sinks to a horror-film tactic, with clones of Angier rotting in water tanks under the stage. That's followed by a pat Hollywood ending, where the covetous Angier dies, the resentful Fallon is hanged, and Borden walks off with one of the two surviving females, his daughter. Another quote, one spoken in the film by Bowie as Tesla, suggests how good this movie might have been, if it had been more about ideas than emotions. Speaking as a scientist to a magician, he says, 'Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified.' That is where a potentially fascinating film could have been found, in a story about how illusionists ultimately rely on science and engineering, and when the science is revealed, the result is the end of confusion and the dawn of enlightenment. Getting it completely backwards, The Prestige exploits science in the service of illusion and insane rivalry.Their subject was magic. I only wish the Mssrs. Nolan weren't quite so guilty of misdirection.",5,5,10,24 July 2017
Crash," The other message of 'Crash.'
","Writer/Director Paul Haggis is well-named. The definition of 'haggis': the minced heart, lungs, and liver of a sheep or calf mixed with suet, onions, oatmeal, and seasonings and boiled in the stomach of the slaughtered animal. In other words, he's an offal filmmaker (sorry).His screenplay is heavy-handed, melodramatic, and loaded with implausible coincidences that cause the characters to collide (crash!). The ultimate message: racism is bad, and cars and cellphones and TV-- all of which make L.A. tick-- make it worse because they're tools of alienation. Not exactly fresh ground. But here's the other message, one everybody seems to miss: Women are bitches. Nearly all the female characters are mean, strident, unreasonable shrews. Sandra Bullock: rich white bitch. Thandie Newton: rich black bitch. Loretta Devine: working-class black bitch. Jennifer Esposito: working-class Latina bitch. I could probably name more of these one-dimensional female viragos, but for that I'd have to see it again. Not in this lifetime. I'd rather be mistakenly shot by Ryan Philippe for laughing.",2,7,10,16 August 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Making faun of Spain's Civil War
","Long mystified by this film's grand reputation, I watched it for the second time yesterday, and the nicest thing I can think to say, really, is: I don't get it. Maybe that's because I can't easily dismiss plot devices and plot holes, even if they're part of an elaborate fantasy. Guillermo del Toro is trying to have it both ways-- Brothers Grimm-style fantasy and the actual Spanish Civil War. Unfortunately, the fantasy is a virtuoso display of grotesque characters and a relish of cruelty that makes Hannibal Lecter seem like a faintly decadent gourmand, while the Spanish Civil War was no more real to me in this film than WWII was in the brilliant opening sequence of Del Toro's pure fantasy, 'Hellboy.'At no point did I take the human characters seriously, especially not the relentlessly evil Colonel (Sergi LÃ³pez). He's the equivalent of Grimms' cruel stepmothers, which is as thin as fantasy gets. Three particular things bothered me, not all of which can be written off as fantasy or a child's viewpoint -- if it is a child's viewpoint. Adolescent Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is the heroine, but powerful Pan (Doug Jones) is the voice-over narrator.1. When the mother (Ariadna Gil) tells her daughter that real life is hard, not like the fairy tales that Ofelia devours, I waited for some evidence to support such a claim. Ofelia's fairy tales are gruesome and repellent-- as bad or worse as anything in real life. 2. Toward the end, the housekeeper (Maribel VerdÃº) viciously stabs the Colonel, first in the back, then chest, shoulder, and mouth. The wounds leave him at her mercy-- but she doesn't finish him off. Given her risky loyalty to the rebels he's battling, and her willingness to stab him four times, the only reason for stopping short of murder has to be to set up more brutality. So the Colonel survives only to be almost-killed again. Indeed, he emerges from the quadruple stabbing strong as ever except for a bloody shirt, a bandaged lip, and a firearm. If you'll notice, the plot wouldn't change an iota if she hadn't stabbed him at all. The same is true a little later, when Ofelia poisons the Colonel. He staggers a bit in his bloody shirt, but in the next scene, he's back in fine form, gun in hand.3. The movie really lost me at the end. When the godlike character on the throne says to Bardo Ofelia, 'Arise, my daughter. Come. You have spilled your own blood rather than the blood of an innocent. That was the final task and the most important.' The blood she spared was that of her infant brother. But she's, what?, 12? That's not an innocent? Given that the actress who played Ofelia was at 'the bud-stage of breast development,' as Humbert said of Lolita, I actually wondered if puberty is being referenced there, as the loss of innocence, the end of childhood. Probably not, since it's not an issue anywhere else in the movie. Anyway, the point is, in war, most if not all children are innocent.I have not yet seen del Toro's latest, The Shape of Water, which is getting high praise as I write. But at this point, with the dominance of sensational visuals over coherent ideas in his work, I'm beginning to think Guillermo del Toro is Spanish for Tim Burton.",4,0,3,10 December 2017
Knocked Up," Praise for IMDb's cleverest critics: your best lines about Knocked Up compiled here
","I was going to write my own review, but I couldn't decide if 'Knocked Up' was more boring or loathsome, so I browsed other reviews-- and chose to digest the savvy critics who got here ahead of me (apologies for the spelling irregularities in names, a lot of them were flagged as problems by IMDb so I had to improvise):'No women I know are dying to go out with fat, unemployed, pot heads, no matter how big their Jew fro is or how many stains they have on their shirts.

Lost in Translation," I think I know why this dreadful movie was acclaimed.
","I'm probably wrong, but honestly I can only think of one reason that critics and the movie industry seemed to love this tediious, contrived, and artlessly racist movie: Bill Murray.Here's the basis of my theory (and please forgive the name-dropping, it's required to make my point): Celebrities are spotted quite often in New York. I've bumped into Harrison Ford on Madison Avenue, dined near Nicole Kidman , seen Uma Thurman browse jazz records and (separately) Ethan Hawke knock back neat whiskeys. Etc., etc. But in thirty years, only once have I ever seen a celebrity actually cause a stirâ€”and not a stir among the general public, but among waiters at a very upscale restaurant, where celebrities are commonplace.It was Bill Murray. I was waiting for a friend, and happened to occupy a barstool that was near both the waiters' station and Murray's booth. The waiters were actually arguing over which of them got to fill his water glass next. They were neglecting other patrons. They were whispering and giggling. They were thrilled.The point is: Everybody loves Bill Murray. I've never seen a bad review of him, and let's face it, he's no Laurence Olivier. He's made some real clinkers (Zissou, Where the Buffalo Roam, Quick Change, Charlie's Angels, Get Smart), but he seems to float above them, a cynical, comical everyman that nobody hates.If his 'Lost in Translation' character had been played by anyone elseâ€”say, Kurt Russell or Michael Keaton or Jeff Bridges (they're all about the same age, and all have comic/dramatic range)-- I suspect critics would have treated 'Lost in T' the way they treated, say, '3000 Miles to Graceland' or 'Jack Frost' or 'Nadine.' In other words, they would have had the courage to say, This film is atrocious.The moral: If you've got a dull, callow screenplay and a name like Coppola that'll get you funding, hire Bill Murray",2,32,63,15 September 2009
The Passion of Joan of Arc," The one thing everyone should know about this movie is...
","That the script was based on the transcripts of the actual trial of Jeanne d'Arc in Rouen in February and March of 1431. The same is true of much of George Bernard Shaw's play, 'Saint Joan.' There is no question that the film would be powerful even to anyone who had never heard of Joan of Arc. It is impressive in every way-- the structure, the camera-work, the acting, even the fact that make-up wasn't used, which heightens the brutal reality of her story. But the most astounding thing is the script. I can't think of another SILENT FILM with a script this important and memorable. All it takes is one look at the original trial transcripts to understand why both Dreyer and Shaw relied them. Joan's intellect is impressive, as is her faith, which embraces all that is good about Christ's teachings. In contrast, the ignoble church interrogators ask questions that expose the shallow hypocrisy of the corrupted Roman Catholic hierarchy-- blind, self-serving, intolerant faith that is still evident among too many passionate Christians today.",10,3,5,20 August 2009
Disturbia," The only person this movie could horrify is Hitchcock.
","The first half of 'Disturbia' shapes up to be an obvious homage to 'Rear Window,' so I got sucked in. I had to fasten my seat belt for the second half, though; it plummets mercilessly into schlock, approaching the level of 'I Know Who Killed Me,' the Lindsay Lohan bottom- dweller that deserved even more than its record-setting eight Razzies.Fellow time-killing IMDb.com critics have pointed out the plot inconsistencies, so I won't. I endorse praise of LaBeouf's and Morse's performances, and heartily add Aaron Yoo to the list. And I would thank the filmmakers for lighting the many night scenes so badly that I was spared from seeing much of the action.That's almost it for praise, though. The turning point toward Razzie-world occurs with the first lines delivered by the talent- free Sarah Roemer (cf. bare-breasted Phoebe Cates and masturbating Judge Reinhold in 'Fast Times...' for real swimming girl/peeping tom footage). But let's not blame a flicker-in-the-pan like Roemer when the 'Disturbia' authors, Landon and Ellsworth, are the real perps. The first half shows such promise that one or both obviously have talent, which makes me wonder how this movie went so wrong. Somebody (the director?) trashed an initially engaging homage to Hitchcock, which the writers had enlivened with some crisp and funny dialogue, mostly delivered by LaBeouf's Kale (who names their kid after a crop in the cabbage family?) and his sidekick, Ronnie, played by the gifted Mr. Woo.It was one of Ronnie's lines, inf act, that summed up the movie for me when the credits finally rolled: 'Operation Stupid is officially over!'",3,1,2,27 July 2009
X-Men: Days of Future Past," An instant classic in the genre
","This movie is close to flawless. X-Men: DoFP has substance as well as virtuoso technique. And once again, as happens so often in the 'superhero' genre, the bad guys-- the ruthless and powerful humans who destroy what they cannot understand or control-- are Americans, often the government itself. That alone merits my admiration every time, from Iron Man ironically fighting against his own iron weapons, to JosÃ© Padilha's Robo-Cop, where a scientist (Gary Oldman) has to try to turn Alex Murphy into a mindless killing machine because the military-industrial complex (Omnicorp in this case) funds his research. It reflects reality all too well, sugar-coated though it is in fantasy.Casting Peter Dinklage as Trask, the mutant-hating scientist, takes full advantage of that actor's skills and his stature. Dwarfism is usually caused by a genetic disorder, and to quote Wikipedia, 'A condition caused by mutations in one or more genes is called a genetic disorder.' So he is self-hating, but when asked if he really hates mutants, he says no-- he admires them. He has to; in a way, he's one of them. You don't find that kind of complex insight in many 3-D action pictures.Trask's warning to the Senate about underestimating the enemy refers to mutants, but he's speaking in 1973, as we are evacuating Vietnam and entering the Paris Peace Talks (scenes of both are included). We lost that war and he doesn't know this, but we do: Iraq, Iran, and global guerrilla warfare (a.k.a. terrorism) are in our future. Americans -- especially Americans -- cannot be reminded often enough that underestimating an enemy is a deadly and arrogant mistake.It is not an original idea, but using time-travel to start new time-lines is a game-changer, and well adapted here. The whole franchise is re-booted now, and everything that happened in earlier films was just an alternate time-line-- meta-universe stuff, much like J. J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot. Oh, and one more thing: the scene where Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is shown at normal speed while everything else appears frozen already stands as one of the best scenes ever conceived in science fiction, and its execution is breathtaking-- a thrilling mixture of comedy, chaos and explication.There's more, of course. The humor is fresh, and it's both visual and verbal. The writer, Simon Kinberg, does such a beautiful job with the script-- it smart, brisk, and witty-- that I think we should forgive him for THIS MEANS WAR. There are underwhelming performances, particularly Shawn Ashmore as Iceman, but a few low batteries in this powerhouse array hardly matter. A mere quibble. Because, if we leave aside the inevitable time-travel paradoxes and don't ask too much about how Kitty Pryde's quantum tunneling ability allows her to send a disembodied mind through space-time, we have a new classic in the Science Fiction genre, worthy of multiple viewings. It was a stroke of genius in 2011 to cast two screen-commanding talents, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, in a movie series that already had the Sirs Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, and that genius is back on display here.",9,0,3,24 May 2014
District 9," Attempted allegory fails to help a formula buddy film
","In short: A sci-fi buddy flick with more repulsive gore than science.The buddies here are a kevlar-vested bureaucrat and a bolero-vested 'prawn' or alien. Most buddy movies have the buddies start as enemies and become friends, and 'District 9' follows that formula. Think '48 Hours,' if Eddie Murphy was a prawn instead of Nick Nolte's pawn.A few clever ideas stand out (not including the failed attempt at cinema verite), especially the fact that the aliens have already been on Earth for 20 years when the movie begins, which recognizes that, as with most invasions, the problem is the aftermath. (How long have we been occupying Iraq now? 6 years?). Their spacecraft appears derelict, just hovering over Johannesburgâ€”a location that delivers the obvious metaphor: District 9, the enclosed alien encampment, is like a bantustan from the era of apartheid.The best plot ideas have to do with alien weaponry. The prawns have arms which only they can useâ€”only their DNA works on the trigger. Not bad, right? Even better is the acknowledgment that we humans are more interested in finding out a way to use those weapons than we are in any kind of lasting dÃ©tente with the aliens-- let alone the fact that humans apparently have zero interest in where the aliens came from, why they're here, details of their obviously superior technology, etc., etc., etc.To top it all off, there's no ending. Instead, we're left with characters' promises that there will be retribution and salvation in the future. Is 'District 10' already in the works? I hope not.",3,7,16,16 August 2009
Bridesmaids," Top 5 Things Wrong with 'Bridesmaids'
","5. Formula chick-flick, but with the frat-boy flourishes that women like Kristin Wiig and Amy Schumer have latched onto, apparently because they think feminism means imitating men. By the time all the gossiping and self-pitying and puking and, yes, diarrhea scenes are over, every one of the six female characters gets, or already has, her man. Happy endings go with comedies, of course, but writer Wiig seems incapable of adding anything surprising or original. The movie is a series of skits. 4. Cheap laughs, and not many of them. Insult humor goes after Lesbians, the fat, the aging, and-- in a movie about women-- ordinary women ('You look like an old mop,' 'You're an old, single loser'). Instead of laughs, expect stammering Ã  la Woody Allen, cursing Ã  la Judd Apatow (he's a producer on this), and one-liners that depend mostly on four-letter body functions. Attempts at physical comedy fail-- e.g., Annie attacking a giant cookie-- because director Feig, cinematographer Yeoman, and editors Kerr and Sale don't know how to capture or control motion on camera for comic effect. 3. Oldest plot in Hollywood, which is, of course, de rigueur for romantic comedies: Girl meets boy, they flirt, fall in love/hit the sack (depending on the era), and then she storms out on him in a trumped-up fit so that we get a few mad-at-each-other scenes before the inevitable reunion can be staged with the inevitable sentiment and wisecracks. The familiarity and predictability of the plot isn't a problem if the details are fresh. There is nothing fresh here. In fact, the same old plot even applies to Annie's relationship with the mandatory rich bitch Helen (Rose Byrne): they hug at the end.2. Comedies don't need fully realized characters the way dramas do, but they still need characters. These women are ideas, and thin ones at that. Their mascara has more depth than their roles. Only Melissa McCarthy stands out, and not just for playing the butch girl. With her exceptional timing and bold presence, she is so much better than her fellow actresses that she actually becomes the comic relief in a comedy-- which says all you need to know about this movie, as a matter of fact. In spite of her grotesque role, McCarthy is enjoyable, except during her big pull- yourself-together scene with Annie, which bears similarities to, but is less plausible than, The Exorcist. 1. In a movie about women, the most interesting character, and the only charming one, the only one I'd care to meet in real life, is a man, Officer Rhodes (Chris O'Doud).It's pitiful, really, Wiig's lack of originality, let alone ambition. There were scenes that, if they had been tweaked with any wit or thoughtful insight, could have turned this into a satire. A statement about rampant consumerism was waiting to be made when the women were defecating in and vomiting over the $800 dresses they're expected to buy. The shallow understanding of foreign cultures could have been exploited in the ridiculous French-themed bridal shower. Megan's intervention with Annie could have exposed the idiocy of instant cures for personality disorders. But satire requires sophistication and distance and these filmmakers have neither. They are not about to make any trenchant observations about the culture they're exploiting for skit-level comedy. To Apatow et. al.'s credit, they do seem to know they're still at the potty-mouth level of maturity, so they stay close to the toilet, where they're obviously comfortable and so, it would seem, is a lot of their audience. As I write, the box office gross is closing in on $300 million worldwide.",3,5,8,17 March 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Big budget, big cast, big disappointment
","As with RUSHMORE, DARJEELING, MOONRISE KINGDOM, ZISSOU, etc., GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is all style, no substance. I would say it's cinema for cinema's sake, but this isn't even cinematic, it's just desperately visual. There are zero ideas. Every scene strikes the same note. The characters are mannered and empty of interest. There's some visual wit, but almost no verbal wit. Wes Anderson, the mysteriously admired director, seems to have gotten all his skills from watching sketch comedy on TV. Weird people, weird situations, weird visuals-- that seems to be enough for him. He uses an inner circle of friends/ actors, and often chooses to feature people who aren't even actors in lead roles (that includes the expressionless Jason Schwartzman who, happily for the audience, has only a minor role in this film). Actors who really need direction, e.g. Edward Norton and Adrien Brody, languish in Anderson's hands.As for plot and content: If Anderson is aware of what Central Europe was like as Hitler rose to power, he shows no indication of it beyond the trappings-- costumes, set design, both of which are very good, as is the music. Indeed, Alexandre Desplat's score provides the only feeling the movie has. GRAND BUDAPEST is superficial from the first frame to the last-- and an insult to Stefan Zweig. If you see it, watch for the fake Egon Schiele painting, 'Two Lesbians Masturbating,' and ask yourself, why? Why that subject? My guess: because Schiele is still, almost 100 years after his death, a radical painter-- an adjective Anderson would like applied to himself, though he is really only pretentious, delivering well-funded displays of superficial eye candy.",2,38,78,12 March 2014
Revolutionary Road," How honest can this movie be when the children are mere props?
","Hey, Hollywood, here's a question: If life is dull in the suburbs, why doesn't it occur to you that movies set in the suburbs will be dull, too? Because they are. Revolutionary Road is yet another mildly decadent, inert melodrama exploring what writers seem to regard as soul-dead all-white suburbia (American Beauty, The Ice Storm, Little Children, Pleasantville, etc. etc.). In my experience, suburban people are not stereotypically dull.But dullness isn't this flick's only, or primary, problem. Dishonesty is. In fact, it's hard to say what the most dishonest part is. It might be plot devices like the two Wheeler offspring, who are treated as nothing more than props, yet we're supposed to believe that the third child will matter? Or the other plot device, the mentally ill mathematician, who seems to exist purely to say inflammatory things (he gets to, he's crazy) that let director Sam Mendes give Winslet and DiCaprio chances for histrionics. But I think the most dishonest thing is Winslet's character, April. A moody hypocrite with bleach-blonde hair and coal-black eyebrows, she baits her husband into drastically changing their lives by following an absurd pipe dream (she doesn't even research these 'secretarial jobs in Paris' that she talks about), saying that moving to Europe is for his sake when obviously it's just as much, if not more, for her own.Clearly, we're supposed to have sympathy for April. That's what's dishonest, because nothing about her actions merits sympathy. Both April and Frank are unhappy in the 'burbs (what movie protagonist isn't?), but when Frank chooses to stay and face their responsibilities-- as well as tacitly admit that they aren't artists or writers or actors who have a Bohemian future in Paris-- April becomes a shrew. Along the way, she also contemplates a self-administered abortion (never mind the risks, or Frank's opinion, he's only her husband and the father). April is as selfish, callow and emotionally constipated as it is possible to be. For instance, whenever Frank wants to talk about little matters, like, oh, say, the fact their dinner party just broke up into a near fist-fight, or that she's taken to sleeping on the couch(!!), she retorts, 'Why do you want to discuss EVERYTHING all the time?' Coward that she is, she wants to run away from her problems, to Paris; short of that, she walks away from her husband when he wants to work things out. I'm all in favor of walking away-- but from this movie, not from life's problems.",2,15,28,6 June 2009
Gran Torino," Top 10 Things Wrong with Gran Torino
","1. Contrary to Walt's simple-minded claim, blue-collar men are capable of the occasional sentence that doesn't use words like dick, ofay, guinea, and spook. Peppering dialog with racist insults wasn't insightful when Archie Bunker did it in the 1970s, and it isn't now.2. The hero is contrived. Over the course of one summer, Eastwood's Walt builds affection and the utmost loyalty toward the 'gooks' next door, but he couldn't do the same with his own sons over decades? He's alternately soft- or hard-hearted depending on the needs of the plot.3. A few of the Hmongs have distinct characters, but Walt's family are little more than clichÃ©s-- resentful sons, greedy daughter-in-law, shallow granddaughter. His children are a disappointment to him and his ego, and he treats them as such. No wonder his sons are resentful.4. Further to that, the sons are presented negatively, as opportunists, but the only time Walt calls one of them is when he's in difficulty (and even then he doesn't have the courage to actually speak up), so is he really any better? 5. The inexplicable stalking of mild-mannered Thao by his cousin's Hmong gang, in spite of the fact that 'all Hmong boys go to jail'â€”so clearly there's no shortage of recruits. Presumably it's out of family loyalty? I don't think so, because...6. When the gang retaliates against Walt for having kicked the crap out of one of them, they open fire â€” on their own cousins' house instead of Walt's next door! 7. The ending is entirely predictable, even before Walt starts getting all shaven and shorn for his coffin.8. Using the dog as a device to steal audience affection for Walt rather than making him someone genuinely likable and worthy of respect.9 etc. Bad lighting, sluggish direction, and, worst of all, transparent plot manipulation to keep the police out of the picture until the final scenes. (Okay, I know that's more than 10, but it could easily have been a Top 20.)",2,11,23,1 August 2009
X-Men: Apocalypse," A question for comic book fans.
","This isn't a review of X-Men Apocalypse (a movie I enjoyed, as my rating indicates). Rather it's a question-- an observation, really-- about the genre. Screenplays are based on original ideas, or they're adapted from another source, such as a book, a fairy tale, a play, a TV show, etc. Comic books have recently become a gold mine for adapted screenplays, but the genre isn't new. In 1931, the movie 'Skippy' was based on a comic strip, and the screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. Two more nominations came in 2003, for 'American Splendor' and 'Our Cancer Year,' both based those respective comic book series.Most moviegoers understand that adapting a film from a book or another source means a departure from the original material. Film, after all, is a different medium with different demands on creativity, including whole armies of creative collaborators led by the director and writer(s).But fans of Marvel and DC Comics don't seem to understand that when they enter the movie theater, they're going to see a movie, not a comic book come to life. Many reviews posted here seem to be looking for absolute faithfulness to the original material, which is not only unrealistic (film has different tools), it is an insult to the creative filmmakers who adapt the material.I've seen all the X-Men movies, and the various Avengers films, and Superman and Batman, and etc.-- I'm a genuine fan of the genre. But I have read none of the comics. Not one. I was a film student, and learned to appreciate that medium on its own terms. My favorite novel is 'Moby Dick,' but nobody needs to read Melville's masterpiece to know that the movies based on it are mediocre. Nor does anyone have to read 'Moneyball' or 'The Martian' or 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' or 'The Maltese Falcon' or 'Rebecca' to know the film adaptions are good.Films must be judged on their own merits, not on how closely they adhere to the original source material. If comic book fans come to terms with that, they may find themselves enjoying the original as well as the adaptation.",7,23,40,1 June 2016
Prisoners," The 7 Deadly Sins of PRISONERS
","7. Rain. Constant rain and snow. The story is gloomy, I get it. Does it also have to be relentlessly dark and poorly lit?6. When was the last time you watched any decent film, or TV show for that matter, where a sensational headline-grabbing crime against children is investigated by one-- count him, one-- detective. This small town may have limited resources, but when two young girls go missing, even a two-man department puts both men on it. When Jackman blames Gyllenhaal personally for not finding the girls quickly, it took a few seconds for my eyes to roll back into place.5. Nobody locks their doors. Even AFTER the girls go missing, one of the possible bad guys walks into both of their houses, while people are at home, and steals items. Easy peasy.4. The Paul Dano character endures 10 hours of interrogation by Gyllenhaal, then when he is released, suddenly whispers a clue to one of the fathers (Hugh Jackman), which no one else can hear, and therefore no one believes. The result is Jackman capturing and torturing Dano for a week-- and he still won't talk. Why not? So the filmmakers can have him tortured twice.3. The other suspect (David Dastmalchian), another man who was once kidnapped and abused, keeps trunks full of snakes in his house. Evidently, this is just to scare the police, and the audience, but it only confuses things.2. Okay, I know this will be about as popular as saying that Ryan Gosling actually looks like a gosling (which he does), but here goes: Jake Gyllenhaal has one expression: doleful. Given how dumb his character is, that almost works. Still, you'd think that an animal expression would cross his countenance occasionally.1. Motivation. While we drown in motivation for Jackman's vigilantism, little motivation is provided for the crime(s). We're told the kidnappings are the perpetrators' way of 'getting back at God' because their son died. It's a lazy, trumped-up reason for a thriller. And the balance is way off. The filmmakers wallow in the torture of innocent suspects, motivated by 'good' characters (Jackman, Howard, Davis), while the real villain is hardly seen until the end, and the motive for having tortured children is only mentioned in passing. It's amoral film-making. By the time the movie is over, my relief and apathy were so great that all I wanted was escape. If I'd had a toy whistle, I'd have been just like Hugh Jackman at that point.",3,11,24,17 December 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," Capra's most cynical movie, and why he's right.
","Criticizing It's A Wonderful Life is almost an act of treason in this country, but if ever a movie deserved a closer look, it's this one.Far from being a celebration of the importance of the individual, or of small-town life, 'It's a Wonderful Life' depicts most citizens of Bedford Falls as timorous weaklings. Moviegoers identify with the hero, George, of course, but he's the exception in this movie, not the rule. If any general lesson is to be learned from the story, it's that a willful leader is the only thing preventing ordinary small-town folk from losing not only prosperity, but morality.The evidence is plain: Without George Bailey to hold the town together, it becomes Pottersville, which is a Hays Code version of Gomorrah. The townsfolk haven't got the courage or sense to manage their own affairs without a leader. In Bedford Falls, that's either corrupt Potter or long-suffering George. The only other characters with any backbone are Harry Bailey and Sam Wainwright, and they both left town. What remains are virtual ciphers like Mr. Gower, Uncle Billy, Ernie, and Bert. America doesn't exactly burst at the seams with self-reliant citizens, according to Frank Capra. So why does this movie merit a healthy 7 rating? Two reasons:1. Because it has undeniable power. Capra was a good director-- but a great propagandist. He made patriotic short films for the U.S. Army from 1942 until 1948-- and 'It's a Wonderful Life' was made in 1946, smack in the middle of that period. The film is a masterpiece of manipulation. People love it, watch it over and over again every year, never noticing that its real message is deeply cynical, presenting little hope for mankind, and almost no faith in it. Indeed, it is almost fascistic in the way it champions the idea of a single leader (or worse, divine intervention) taking charge over ineffectual ordinary middle class people.2. Because Capra proves himself right with his own movie. As an influential leader/filmmaker, he is skilled enough to make generations of sheep-like Americans cry and cheer at his movies, no matter how much he insults us.",7,41,71,28 July 2009
The Departed," One of the 50 best movies of all time? Really??
","'The Departed' isn't a bad movie, but it's certainly not one of the best movies ever made, yet as of this writing it is #49 on IMDb's Top 250-- a list which reveals far more about the reviewers than the films.One look at the Top 250 is enough to make any cineaste curse transient gods like Michael Bay and the Wachowskis. The list is so slanted toward movies that are both American and recent that a serious list of excluded movies-- from 1919's 'Broken Blossoms' to 1939's 'Rules of the Game' to 1959's '400 Blows' -- makes the Top 250 look downright silly. How silly? It includes the following, all of which have good qualities but nothing approaching best-ever levels: Inglourious Basterds, The Prestige, District 9, Kill Bill I, V for Vendetta, In Bruges, Benjamin Button, Big Fish, Crash, and an Eastwood quadruple-threat, Gran Torino, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, and Mystic River. (News flash: Eastwood is as talented a director as he was an actor.)Ranking 'The Departed' at #49 is particularly strange because it isn't even as good as the Hong Kong original, 'Infernal Affairs' (2002), which lands at No. 249. (Foreign films take a real beating on this list, which is why I cite many non-American filmmakers here. The USA is, after all, only one of more than 150 countries producing movies.) 'The Departed' at #49 is also odd because it's far from the best work of any of the actors-- Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson, Winstone, Farmiga. (As for Oscar-nominee Marky Wahlberg, all I can ask is WTF. His apparent facial paralysis wasn't a particular handicap in his role as Sgt. Dignam, maybe that's why he was lauded. All he had to do was deliver profanities, but even at that Wahlberg is to R. Lee Ermey as Bud Lite is to Guinness Stout.)It's probably also true (for obvious reasons) that a lot of IMDb-ers have mainly seen movies made after they were born, and mainly American movies besides. No wonder they produce a list as lame as the Top 250. A lot of young people I know categorically dismiss black-and-white movies, which is probably a fair reflection of the number of idiotic fusspots in the world. But if you've never seen Gregg Toland's cinematography, how can you evaluate Wally Pfister's? One 20ish couple I know-- movie buffs who are well-read and savvy-- haven't even seen The Third Man or Grand Illusion or Rashomon, so I find it really impossible to take their uneducated opinions about film seriously. I also wonder if they really are fans. I don't see how they can be if they're not searching out Ozu and Leone and Lubitsch.Ultimately, IMDb's Top 250 is a good list if your teeth need grinding. As for the actual written reviews-- some of which are very very good-- the only profitable way I've found to read them is to customize them by eliminating all ratings of 1 and 10. Try it. It's an astonishingly effective filter because about half the reviewers don't seem to know that numbers 2 through 9 even exist. I just checked an unquestionably average-to-above-average film, 'Rushmore': it had 592 comments-- and 452 (76%!) rated it 1 or 10.",5,3,4,31 December 2009
Wedding Crashers," Formula weddings and an autopsy
","The first time I saw 'Wedding Crashers,' I thought it was fun. So I watched it again, and wow. Never in my experience has a movie shown its formulaic structure and cheap laughs faster or more thoroughly than this one does upon a second viewing. By the third viewing-- which I did purely out of curiosity-- I felt more like I was autopsying the movie than watching it.The heroine, Claire Cleary, is the key to this movie. She is the only believable character, and Rachel McAdams is one of those rare actors who can generate chemistry with almost anyone. She's the female equivalent of Mark Ruffalo: engaging and expressive actors, simultaneously exuding strength and vulnerability, intelligence and emotion, all of it in a fully integrated way.The rest of the characters-- with the exception of Christopher Walken, who manages to bring dignity to his role as patriarch-- are stereotypes, and despicable stereotypes at that, though the strong cast almost brings it off-- hence the relatively healthy 6 rating. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan are overgrown juveniles, though Wilson's character is made redeemable by virtue of his love for Claire. Vaughan is always up to verbal comedy, and here he handles physical comedy well enough, too. A good thing, because he gets wounded in football, again in a hunting accident, an old lady fires a shotgun at him, and Claire's sex-crazed sister (Isla Fisher) gives him a handjob at a family dinner, then later ties him to the bed so she can have her way with him. Later that same night, still tied up, Vince becomes the toy of another stereotype, the brother, a gay artist. The least effort went into the creating the grandmother (Ellen Albertini Dow, 92 at the time), who is a standard a foul-mouthed old woman, the mother (Jane Seymour), a horny middle-aged woman, and the weary-of-white-folks servant (Ron Canada).The most thankless role, without doubt, belongs to Bradley Cooper as Owen Wilson's nemesis, the insufferable fiancÃ© of Claire. That she would have anything to do with him is perhaps the least plausible part of a movie that is almost wholly without credibility. He's worse than Will Farrell because Farrell's character is never anything but preposterous. As the aging lech who concocts the scheme to seduce bridesmaids at weddings and mourners at funerals, he is played wholly for cheap laughs-- the standard modus operandi for his ilk, the over-rated and under-talented SNL alumnus.The movie is, of course, also predictable. Formula films are. A lot of talent went into this, but the writers and filmmakers aim to make every scene outrageous, with McAdams as the quiet heart of this desperate, frantic comedy. That she makes you care about her is no small feat.",6,0,0,1 August 2015
There Will Be Blood," And I thought Andy Warhol's movies were slow.
","About ten minutes into this film-- that's only one scene in Paul Thomas Anderson's world-- somebody in the audience said, aloud, 'We get it, already. Digging oil wells is dangerous.' Anderson never directed a crisp, concise scene in his life. 'Boogie Nights' (155 minutes), 'Magnolia' (188m), 'There Will be Blood' (158m)-- that's 8.5 hours for three movies. And before someone points out that 'Punch Drunk Love' was only 95 minutes, I would counter that it felt twice that. At least.Pascal wrote, 'I am sorry for the length of my letter, but I had not the time to write a short one.' Amen. It does take time-- and talent and discipline-- to sculpt and winnow an idea down to its most purposeful and powerful elements. But Anderson doesn't winnow, he wallows. He seems to think that if a four-minute scene is good, then it'll be twice as good at eight minutes, and three times as good at twelve. It's a wonder his movies aren't six hours long.The best way to deal with this endlessly over-rated film is with adjectives, starting with endless and over-rated. Then, of course, bloated. Slow. Fatuous. Loud. Unfaithful (to Upton Sinclair's original satire, 'Oil!'). Sentimental. Confusing (Paul Dano's twin characters). Abrupt (the ending). And, finally and crucially, pointless. I didn't care about a single character, and the film introduced no new ideas or even flavors to the oil industry, family loyalties, ruthless ambition, misanthropy, religion, or bowling.",2,9,16,23 September 2009
Arrival," 'Always in motion is the future...' --Yoda
","Since this film is about humans being stuck in linear time, let's take first thing first. The premise: Aliens arrive in 12 ships, posted around the Earth. A linguist, Louise (Amy Adams) is recruited to go to the Montana location to help communicate with the heptapods (as these squid-like creatures are called). Joining her to head the project is a physicist, Ian (Jeremy Renner).When Louise begins to decipher Heptapod B, the aliens' written language, she also begins to see flashes of her own life-- glimpses that the audience naturally assumes are memories: random scenes of her with her daughter, Hannah, including a conversation about her separation from the girl's father, and a scene of Hannah dying when she's still a schoolgirl. But no, these are not memories, because it turns out Hannah did not exist before the aliens arrived. She is the daughter of Louise and Ian, who meet at the alien encounter. (Many reviewers, including Anthony Lane at The New Yorker, got this wrong. His review refers to the glimpses as flashbacks, but then admits he 'hasn't worked it out yet.')The key is the heptapod language, a kind of alien code that allows those who understand it to see the future but-- and this is also key-- not the *whole* future, and perhaps only your own future, at least not until you're fluent in heptapod. Louise gets glimpses of her future as she learns heptapod, and when she realizes that, she concludes that the aliens arrived to deliver their language as a gift: the ability to perceive nonlinear time, to glimpse the future.She's half right. It is a gift to humanity, but the heptapods arrived, on what could well be a suicide mission, with a much bigger purpose. They're desperate. As Louise eventually learns, they have seen the future of their own civilization, and know a catastrophe is coming. They're here because they will need Earth's help.The aliens and their perception of time as nonlinear is not developed. We learn little about them. Instead the basic theme-- communication as an aid to survival-- is explored through Louise, Ian, and their doomed daughter. The film has a lot of impressive CGI and sci-fi trappings, but at its heart, it is a family drama and-- to a greater extent than is needed, I think-- an action picture with rioting citizens, rival nations, and a bull-headed military.It may be peevish of me, as someone who likes robust science in their science fiction, to wish there were less family drama and more about Time/Spacetime. But this is a thoughtful and well made film, powerful in places, and quite often suspenseful. I applaud the filmmakers for providing an escape from the question that arises when time becomes nonlinear-- If you know what happens in the future, are you free to prevent disasters? do you have free will?-- by giving Louise only glimpses, and random ones. She never sees the immediate future, so she doesn't know how the alien arrival will be resolved. Therefore she take a grave risk (which I won't reveal, because I still don't quite understand why or how she did what she did) which stops a military attack on the alien ships.Now that I've written this, and thought about it, perhaps ARRIVAL deserves a higher score. I must see it again...",7,1,6,15 November 2016
Rear Window," 'Spoilers' cannot ruin a movie this good.
","With over 400 glowing reviews already posted, the only thing that needs to be added is that, if ever a movie proved that 'spoilers' can't spoil a superb film, it's 'Rear Window.'The movie is smashing great fun even if you know the ending, because what matters is not 'The End' but how we got there. I've seen 'Rear Window' at least a dozen times, and it seduces me every time with the smart dialog, the performances (go, Thelma!), and especially with the way Hitchcock builds suspense in what is essentially a comic film. He is the master.Far from spoiling a good film, knowing the ending actually allows you to better appreciate the structure and skill that went into it. After all, who doesn't know how Romeo and Juliet ends? or Amadeus? or The Gospel According to St. Matthew? Does that mean they're 'spoiled'? And it isn't just true of adaptations, biographies, and the Bible. Even original stories that seem to depend on surprise-- thrillers like 'The Sixth Sense,' mysteries like 'Chinatown,' comedies like 'The Sting'- - are just as good the second time if they're well-made in the first place.",10,4,7,9 August 2009
Godzilla," An astounding film, for all the wrong reasons
","The original 'Godzilla' (1954) has had 27 remakes. Remember the 1998 'Godzilla'? The one with the planned sequels that never happened because it was a Razzie-winning bomb? In terms of everything but the visual effects, it was better than this one. In fact, I wondered if this director, a certain Gareth Edwards, was influenced by its director, Roland Emmerich, who is reigning king of big & cheesy cinema (though '2012' had merits). If Edwards did choose to emulate Emmerich, then we know all we need to about his motives ($) and his integrity as an artist ($$$).Yet, astoundingly, this 'Godzilla' has a redeeming quality: It could be taught in film school: Film 101: How NOT to Make a Movie.The screenplay is almost a tour de force of corny dialog. It might be the result of writer Max Borenstein meticulously collecting all the trite dialog in horror films since 'The Monster Walks' (1932, with an IMDb rating of 3.9). The writing is the worst flaw, of course, because it's so basic, but even the sound and sound editing, which action pictures have perfected, is amateurish. It reminded me of Spinal Tap: turned up to 11. Ditto the score, which was written by the usually reliable Alexandre Desplat (he provided the only reason to see 'Grand Budapest Hotel'). I wasn't the only person sitting in the theater with 3-D glasses on my face and my fingers in my ears. The characters are-- well, there aren't any. The two leads, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, were ciphers, but they're cast together in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015), so let's hope Joss Whedon can elicit lifelike performances from them. Genuine talents that are wasted include Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, David Straithairn, Richard T. Jones, Juliette Binoche, and Bryan Cranston, who here proves that even an actor at the top of his game can stink up the joint.Gareth Edwards appears to know nothing about how to structure a story, control action, direct actors, or even manage continuity. Based on 'Godzilla,' he should have stuck to his original career in visual effects. The action scenes here, once the plot lands in San Francisco, are skillfully done and fun to watch. Godzilla itself (himself? herself?) is also a fun creation, as are the Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms (MUTOs), but that may be because Andy Serkis consulted behind the scenes.",2,11,23,16 May 2014
Hart's War," The most under-rated war movie since 'The Four Days of Naples.'
","Perhaps this film is underrated because it opened before screenwriter Terry George emerged as an important filmmaker with Hotel Rwanda, which he wrote and directed. It deserves another look. The script is smart, tight, with no shortage of morbid wit ('If I wanted to kill crackers, I'd have stayed in Macon,' says Terence Howard, a lieutenant on trial for murdering a white enlisted man). It's also very ambitious, efficiently and engagingly exploring life-and-death conflicts without sentimentality. It works not only as a war movie (with harrowing sequences, and not forgetting that Russian POWs were treated even worse than Americans) but as a first-rate mystery complete with courtroom sequence and hugely satisfying denouement, layered with dramatic surprises. Ultimately, the movie belongs not to any one actor, but to a character. There are dozens of truly great war pictures, but I can't think of another character, not even a real one like Patton, as fully explored as Col. McNamara (a solid Bruce Willis). He is the consummate career soldier, a constitute of courage, determination, leadership, physical and mental toughness, unflagging honor, and -- most impressive-- a commitment to cause that is revealed in strategic and resourceful military thinking that make this one of the most intelligent war pictures I can recall.",9,3,6,5 March 2006
Alien: Covenant," Look on your works, Mighty Ridley, and despair
","It's diverting enough as entertainment, if you show up with really low expectations, but in a genre as rich as science fiction, where stories and situations brim with big ideas and cosmic questions, I would never waste time on a second viewing of this vacuous entry.I won't catalog the many plot holes. Other reviewers have thoroughly autopsied the story. But I would like to underline just one point that most reviewers rightly reviled: the ineptitude of the crew is epic. The only less competent spaceship crew that I can recall seeing, ever, were the Omarans from the Star Trek TNG episode, Symbiosis. But they had an excuse: they were in chemical withdrawal, in need of their felicium fix. No wonder they didn't know what an electromagnetic coil was.In contrast, the crew of the Covenant are ill-trained and, it would seem, ill chosen people for the mission. Idiot was a word that leapt to mind a dozen times or more, but it finally got stuck and stayed stuck to Sir Ridley Scott. He does many things wrong in this movie, including having so many alien outbursts from human torsos that there was laughter in the theater. One of the reasons I could laugh was that so few of the crew members had any individual character that I had nothing invested in what happened to them. Billy Crudup stood out as the beta-male captain who was on the verge of tears most of the time. Katherine Waterston held her own as his Ripley-like (and - lite) female 2nd in command. But the rest of the crew, except for the android (Fassbender), seemed interchangeable. At one point, one of the men says, 'I've never seen my wife scared before.' I didn't even know he had a wife, or which one she was.",5,14,33,20 May 2017
Atonement," One question: What if Robbie hadn't gone to prison?
","Answer: Able-bodied Robbie would doubtless have found himself in the army anyway, and at the front even sooner. And that is what makes this contrived story ring so false-- that, and even worse stupidity:The fact is, far from causing Robbie's death, the false testimony of young Briony would actually have saved his life if he'd opted to stay safely in prison, where he could have fought his conviction, perhaps even persuading her to recant after she had apparently matured into an empathic adult (she's a war nurse). Instead, he enlists in the army, only to croak at Dunkirk exactly one (one!) day before the evacuation, because god forbid this over-reaching melodrama leaves any tears unjerked.Oh, and by the way, since Briony's sister Cecilia dies in the Blitz, it isn't as if sis and Robbie were going to be reunited anyway.And another thing (I loathed this movie, are you getting that?): Maybe I missed it, but at any point does Briony attempt to clear Robbie's name? Her book doesn't--it's fiction, not memoir. To her way of thinking, of course, it's probably a question of, why bother since Robbie is so conveniently dead, and I'd be the only one who suffers.Selfish and vain as a child, Briony is guilty of causing Robbie's imprisonment. But as bad as that misdeed was, it was the act of a juvenile and the tragedies that ensue have more to do with poor adult responses and a little thing called World War II than with a self-centered little girl. Her real sins-- the chronic faults she takes into adulthood-- are egocentricity and opportunism: She capitalizes on her juvenile lie by exploiting the story as a novel, yet again falsifying facts, this time to give the lovers a happy ending. It's SO much easier, after all, to apologize in fiction rather than in reality. She manages to keep the spotlight on herself throughout, of course, and eventually turns into Vanessa Redgrave on a book tour. The end. Thank god.'Atonement'? There's none in this movie, but plenty is owed by director Wright, screenwriter Hampton, and especially by the phenomenally overrated novelist Ian McEwan.",2,22,39,8 August 2009
