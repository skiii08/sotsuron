The Rock," Connery and Cage make this pretty good action movie into an excellent one.
","Yes, Connery and Cage have a chemistry and acting ability to make this movie that probably would have been just okay with other actors turn into a really fun action movie. Cage is a guy who is an expert at deactivating weapons, especially chemical ones, and Connery is a man who is locked up for life, but once escaped the infamous Alcatraz prison. What brings them together, former military men led by Ed Harris have taken hostages on the island prison of Alcatraz and they are threatening to launch chemical weapons into the heart of San Francisco if their demands are not met. What ensues is pure action as we have car chases through the streets of San Fran, we have special forces slipping into the prison, and we have many gun fights between forces. Still though Connery and Cage stand above everyone else and really make this movie rise a notch or two above what it would have been without them as they add some humorous dialog into the film. If I had a complaint it would be that the Ed Harris character does not make a very good bad guy as you almost feel sympathetic to him. However, plenty of the other soldiers in his charge are more typical bad guys for you to pull against. All in all a fun action ride that has one of my favorite actors in it, Sean Connery.",9,2,3,20 July 2005
"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Simon Pegg runs away with the show here, though the rest of the cast is good too.
","This movie is rather funny, not up there with 'Shaun of Dead' or 'Hot Fuzz', but still once again Simon Pegg does a great job and makes you sympathize with his character. Thandie Newton is rather good too as is Hank Azaria...though my favorite costar was Moran as the rather laid back and a bit strange cousin to Newton's character. What is the story? Man makes a run for it on his wedding day and leaves his pregnant wife behind at the alter. Flash to five years later and our runaway husband to be is now an out of shape security guard for a women's apparel store. He still is in his ex fianc√©'s life as he does try to do stuff with his son, but there is now a new man in her life in the form of what initially seems to be a really nice and well off man. Let's just say he changes throughout the course of the film and he begins to get a bit more obnoxious as the movie precedes along. Well Dennis (Pegg's character) decides to show his ex that he has what it takes to change by agreeing to run in a marathon. A twenty-six mile marathon that is only three weeks away and yes our hero is not in the best of shape. Thanks, however, to a bet made by his ex's cousin and a landlord who seems a tad off, but seems to really like Dennis, he is trained very hard to reach his goal. Let's just say there are some very funny scenes that ensue during the training. The marathon itself while not the highlight of the film is good too. A few serious scenes damper the mood a bit here and there, but for the most part it is a rather funny film and I rather like the London setting too.",7,0,1,23 October 2008
The Blair Witch Project," A camping trip gone bad!
","What happens when you send three student film makers into the woods to shoot a documentry about a witch?  Well somehow they manage to get lost when the road can't be more than a mile away if that much.  Perhaps, they should have taken some outdoor survival classes, because these clowns would probably get lost in someone's backyard.  And guess what?  We get to watch them complain, moan, and groan almost the entire movie and it is supposed to be scary. During all this they are been stalked by an unseen force or something, which is probably just someone camping who is sick of hearing them yell, scream, and cuss each other out.  This force does scary things like shake the tent and make barely audible noises in the distance.  It also makes arts and crafts and displays them...Oh how scary!  Meanwhile, our 'woodsman' keep walking around in circles like idiots instead of following the river which would have prevented them from going around in circles.  This movie could have been really good.  The beginning was alright where they interviewed those people and before they yelled at each other constantly, and the end was alright too.  The middle, though, did not have enough in it.  There should have been more hints at what might be out there.  You don't have to show it so everyone knows what it is, but perhaps give peeks at something in the darkness.  Hear noises that are a bit more distinct.  This movie had potential, but wasted to much time showing the three argue.",4,1,5,8 November 2001
The Avengers," The Avengers were assembled and this audience member loved the creation.
","This movie has been a long time coming as it had its beginning in the 2008 film 'Iron Man'. There would also be 'The Incredible Hulk', 'Iron Man 2', 'Thor' and finally 'Captain America'. All these parts, left some wondering could they have this many superheroes in a film and it not turn out a jumbled mess? I never wondered that as all one had to do was look at the X-Men films and see that for the most part those films got it right, the main difference here was that different companies were involved so there may be some trouble. However, what we got was a film that brought a team of superheroes together and totally cranked up the action to the max. Yes, I have to say the action in this film is better than any action in other comic book films. It is not even close, they gave me here what I have been wanting! Do not get me wrong, the Batman movies are still great, I also enjoyed the Spider-man and X-men films, but this one just said this is a comic book film, and people want to see an epic battle, maybe even more than one! So no good, but relatively short fights like those found in most comic book films, we get lots of action and an epic finale! My favorite character on the Avengers is the Hulk, which explains why I did enjoy this film a good deal. He was finally done right, granted 'The Incredible Hulk' was good too, but this was the best representation of the Hulk easily. He was presented as the strongest by far, though I nearly gasped when he and Thor faced off as I never saw that in the trailers so that was a nice treat for me and he did to Thor just what I wanted him to, punch him through something! Granted, Thor got some good hits in too, but I loved how they made it clear Hulk is the strongest one! Mark Ruffalo was also an improvement over Eric Bana and Edward Norton. He played Banner in a bit more nervous and skittish manner, unlike say Norton's who looked capable of putting up a fight without even becoming the Hulk. Hulk also got the biggest laugh in the theater I was in.So this film was everything I was hoping for and more. The rest of the cast was good too as Loki has come to Earth to capture the power of the cosmic cube (though he has someone behind him calling the shots). He plans of bringing an alien force to Earth so that he may become its king, he does this for no other reason than to irritate his brother, Thor it seems. He is still the same Loki from Thor, as you still do not know what he has going on in his mind! I was afraid he would not have this aspect in this film, but they were able to keep it. His alien force is great, and this makes for the great finale!The finale has the Avengers assembling and working together to stop the invasion and it is a grand spectacle to behold! So loved seeing the heroes utilize their skills and powers and every hero gets in some good hits. Black Widow and Hawkeye are expanded on in this film and they are pretty cool. If I were to have a complaint, it would be that there was one hero they under utilized a bit. In a film with so many heroes I guess it is to be expected, I was just surprised it was Captain America. He just did not play as big a role in the final fight as I would of liked. Sure he gave some orders, but his contribution to ending the assault was giving the Black Widow a boost. However, he was used well in the other scenes he was in, this is not a major gripe mind you...just if I can find something to complain about it is this. So in conclusion, I was impressed and loved this film. It was great to see this band of heroes slowly unite as it was watching Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury pulling the strings to get them to work together. Surprised he was listed last in the credit sequence at the end, because he played the most significant role in the film and was in it from the beginning to the end. The way it is performing at the box office also makes me think there is going to be a sequel for sure and that makes me ecstatic as they show who was calling all the shots and suffice to say I was not entirely sure who he was until he smiled and then I am like 'oh my god, yes!' See this DC and Warner Bros, if multiple companies can come together and make an epic superhero team film then you can make a Justice League movie!",10,5,13,14 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Captain Jack is back and helps this pirate move float.
","I was not expecting this one to be quite as good as it turned out mainly because of the review I read of it that made it seem really bad. I have to disagree with that review, however, as I found it a good movie, better than the second and third installments of this film, but not as good as the still best first one. This one sort of picks up after the third one in that the object of everyone's desire is the fountain of youth as the pirate Blackbeard, the English and the Spaniards are after this most magical of places. For the waters of youth to work one most first get two silver chalices and a mermaids tears. Jack at the moment is in England, but he shall get around quite a lot in this one. His old nemesis and sometimes partner Barbossa is also back this time seemingly in league with the English. The action in this one is rather good and Captain Jack Sparrow is once again the best character, only this time he is the main guy with no others taking time away from him in bunches like the previous two installments. The scenery in areas of the film is just really gorgeous once they get to the area of the fountain of youth. There is also a very nice mermaid scene to be seen as well, just enjoyed most of the film. Granted there are questions one has while watching this film such as Blackbeard's mysterious powers that are not really explained and if it was I missed it, however I had questions like this one for all three of the other movies too. So a good movie, better than Pirates 2 and 3 for me and a nice ending to boot. I do not know this one just flowed better than the previous two pirate movies. At least for me, the one review made this film sound very slow and not all that entertaining aside from a couple of scenes. I guess I just enjoyed seeing Captain Jack Sparrow back sans Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly who I feel had to much screen time in parts two and three.",8,6,8,23 May 2011
Men in Black 3," I was not expecting much, so this MIB was a pleasant surprise
","I had heard nothing of this film except negativity, so I did not rush out to see this film in theaters like I had the previous two films. I was not really crazy about part II anyway, so I figured this one would be more of the same. So I finally got around to viewing this film, and suffice to say it was actually pretty good...better than part II. I am a bit puzzled as to why this film did create such bad buzz, I mean if people enjoyed part II, this one should have been a blast. Will Smith is back as is Tommy Lee Jones. There are a few other originals from the previous films, though absent in this one is Rip Torn, who was having a spot of legal trouble at the time this film was being made.The story has J and K doing their normal routine. Only something seems to be up with K, something on his mind...especially when an alien escapes from a maximum security prison on the moon. This alien, known as Boris, has a plan to not only destroy the earth, but also get revenge on the man responsible for stopping him in the past and taking his arm, agent K. J will have to go back into the past to assist his MIB partner, as K's younger self will not only have to take on the Boris of the past, but also that of the future.Tommy Lee Jones is not really in the film all that much...he kind of bookends the film. However, Josh Brolin does a very good job of imitating a younger K. Will is his usual self and puts in a pretty good performance, honestly he just has not done much in the last 5 or six years. There are a few sight gags that refer to characters who are not present and a few from the earlier installments who make brief cameos.So, while not as good as the first film, it was better than the second film and seemed to carry a bit more weight than the previous film too. There was a bit more interplay between J and K and it helped this film along. It is a shame this film was so poorly received, I cannot foresee there being another film. This one had a huge budget, so while it did not do bad by 1990's standards, it did not work well for today. However, if it is the last film...it ended on a rather good note.",7,0,1,16 June 2013
Alien 3," The bitch may be back, but it sure is boring.
","This is by far my least favorite entry into the Alien franchise and that includes 'Alien vs Predator'. There is nothing new or innovative about this installment except for the fact that the alien is mixed with a dog or something. Lets just say this one plays out like the first one, but it is not as involving or as interesting. Weaver goes through the motions and that is the shame because she is the only actor you will recognize here with the exception of Lance. The story, Ripley lands on a space prison, alien tagged along, it starts killing, and the startling revelation why said alien will not kill her. Of course evil people want to use the alien again for weapon purposes. Why? Who knows, but I think it would be obvious by this time that the aliens are simply killing machines, and they are incapable of being trained. The ending is the lone bright spot here, but I was bored out of my mind by the time it rolled around. I can't believe this one ranks higher than four, which by admission is a bit goofy at times, but it is a much faster ride than this slow plodded yawn fest.",4,190,201,8 July 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Robert Downey Jr. returns as Sherlock and so the game is afoot!
","It took me a while to watch this film...I wanted to see it at the theater as I really enjoyed the first one, but I never made it. Finally got it as a gift and have to say that I enjoyed it just as much as the first one. I know many out there do not like this version of Sherlock, but this is one of my favorite versions of the famous detective. I am not the biggest Holmes fan admittedly. My other fave Holmes is Peter Cushings, I really enjoyed 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'...in both these cases I really enjoyed the actor playing Holmes.This film has Holmes trying to match wits with his greatest adversary, Professor Moriarty! A man whose genius is only matched by his nefarious desires. Sherlock must once again team with his good friend Dr. Watson as they have to go through Europe to figure out Moriarty's scheme. Once again there is a lot of humor and a lot of action. Some may find this off putting, but I really enjoyed it. The movie starts out with Sherlock on the tail of a familiar friend, he takes his good friend Watson to his stag party where then his wedding, has a great encounter on a train and ends up at a very nice castle in Switzerland. The locales are great in this film too, by the way.I enjoy films from this time period so that is probably one of the reasons I enjoyed it and the predecessor. Probably explains why I enjoyed the film 'The Raven' as well...though that one took place in America. I also enjoy a good train action sequence, whether it be in a movie or even a video game. This film has that too. At times though the film does move around to much which is why I did not score this film a 10, I really enjoyed the film, but at times it became difficult to follow! So while it may not be the popular thing to do, I enjoyed this film. Cannot pretend I didn't. To me these Sherlock are the perfect combinations of action and humor. That is the kind of role I like Downey Jr. in, action type films with some comedy. I do not really enjoy his totally serious films or his comedies. So basically I like him as Starks and Sherlock I guess. I am looking forward to the next Iron Man film and I also hope I can look forward to the next Sherlock film. There is one listed, but it has no date so it may never come to fruition.",9,0,0,2 January 2013
Gremlins," Best of the small creature attack movies.
","After this movie there were several other movies that tried to capitalize on the success of this movie. For the most part though they failed to live up to the energy and fun of this movie. Heck, not even the sequel of this one had the energy of this movie. Here we have a guy getting a pet as an early xmas gift, a cute creature called a Mogway. It however, does have a few problems, as it needs special care. One thing you can't do to it is get it wet. Well Billy does (that is the guy who got it). This breeds more of the little critters, and they are harmless enough at first as well. Then they are fed after midnight and this turns them into Gremlins. This new form is a beer drinking, candy eating, mischief machine that isn't above killing. Most of the original batch is killed off in a gruesome kitchen scene, but the leader, Stripe, gets away and dives into a ycma swimming pool, so the whole town gets overrun by the little monsters. This movie is very funny and enjoyable to watch. Even though the Gremlins do kill, this movie never gets as dark as some of the copycats, or too goofy like some of them do. It ends up being a well-made movie that is fun to watch.",8,24,34,7 April 2003
The Incredible Hulk," Smashingly good fun.
","This movie was the second film to release that would set up the 2012 Avengers film. In retrospect, it was a bit of a mistake as it did underwhelming business at the box office; especially when you compare the box office take of this film and the first film to release, Iron Man. Why is it a mistake, well there was already a Hulk movie released only five years prior to this one and it too was a disappointment. That being said, this is the better film than the 2003 Ang Lee film, I just feel it released too soon after it. I think if that film had not existed, this one would have performed considerably better. Not the 300 plus Iron Man did, but perhaps a 200 million dollar film rather than making about the same amount as Ang Lee's film did. I also believe they tried to do a bit too much with the story, not that it is complex, just that they almost blend the comics, with the television show and the 2003 film. At the end of the 2003 film, Bruce is in South America, at the beginning of this one he is in Brazil...so it's a sequel? No, not at all. The origin that is shown during the credits alludes to the television show, but Hulk looks like the comics. Just too much and trying to appease too many people all at the same time. I also think Norton was poorly cast in this one, as I did not get a Banner vibe from him at all. He just does not seem like he is into the role and considering he did not opt into doing the Avengers film and beyond suggests that he was not into it.The story has Bruce in Brazil working at some strange soda plant or something. Looks like Mt. Dew, but has some funky name. Well, a slight accident leads to some of his blood getting into a bottle and this is how the military and General Ross track him down. Bruce is in chats with a man dubbed Mr. Blue in the hopes of finding a cure; however, he must find more data for Mr. Blue to create a cure. A crack team of soldiers try to track down Banner and he avoids them for a while, but soon turns into the Hulk, leading one of the soldiers, Emil Blonsky, wanted another crack at the beast. He is soon infused with super soldier serum and does quite admiral in dodging the Hulk, but it is still not enough. He craves the power the Hulk haves and soon this desire will create an abomination! The film is pretty good, but could have been better. The scenes with the Hulk are by far the highlights and better than any of the Hulk scenes in the 2003 film with the incredible expanding Hulk. That being said, I did not like the fact they tied Banner turning into Hulk with his heart rate as it is solely tied to his anger. The film also did not portray the Hulk becoming stronger the angrier he got and the fight with Abomination should have showcased this. In the comics, Hulk is stronger than Abomination because of the increase as he gets angry. Abomination though is a better fighter as he is more agile and that is why he gives the Hulk a good fight, not because he is stronger. The reason the Hulk wins is because he keeps getting stronger, not because he is a better tactical fighter.So, in the end, this film was more enjoyable than the Ang Lee film. That film was just strange in many ways as it played out in comic panels which suggests a fun film, but was so serious with virtually not humor that it was just a strange concoction. This one had some good action, but was not a perfect film. Hurt is the only actor from this film to be seen in a later Marvel universe film as he appeared in Captain America: Civil War. Most things from this film were pretty much scrapped though as the Leader looked to be coming, Abomination was still alive and various other things. Abomination was supposedly going to be in the second Avengers film and that would have been great as I felt Ultron was not enough, but they decided against it which sucked as something other than the exact same robot would have been cool. In the end, this film is kind of part of the Marvel universe and kind of not.",8,15,27,15 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," My favorite in the series...I think.
","I liked this movie quite a lot and I think it is my favorite. Why do I say think? Because the first two were fun to watch, but were not what you would call memorable movies. This one may not be either so I had better review it now lest I forget it and just say it was entertaining, but I don't remember much about it. This one has Ethan Hunt being tortured with his wife about to be killed before him right at the get go. It then shifts to an early time and this was a very nice plot device because I was actually curious to see how he got into that predicament and how he would get out of it. There is a rather cool rescue scene and another where our team must try to capture a weapons dealer. There is one good action scene after another quite frankly and this time Ethan Hunt has a good IMF team behind him and they actually seem to be helpful. This one also has a very good bad guy a few twists along the way (though nothing to hard to figure out) and it has a rather interesting part of the movie where Hunt is getting something for the bad guy but you never get to see any of it except before he enters the building and when he abruptly leaves said building. This movie is not without its flaws, however, to me it was the best one of the series and one heck of an action movie...at least I think I liked it more than the other two.",8,1,1,11 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The movie is all light sabers, stupid aliens, and inconsequential plots.
","When I saw this movie at the theater I initially enjoyed it. I got swept up by the crowd and the light saber battles. Then I saw this movie again and it lost a lot of luster really fast. Now when you watch it, the film is very bland and not very entertaining at all. Other than a somewhat exciting opening scene and a very nice saber battle with the very pointless, but still cool in a way Darth Maul this movie is just a bunch of plot points that will quickly run its course and really has no impact beyond introducing a young Anakin to Obi Wan. The plot has some forces invading this planet we never heard of in the original series. This planet has a rather dumb looking princess and a very annoying race of amphibious creatures that as soon as I saw it I knew it would be the most annoying thing in the film. That is until they meet young Anakin Skywalker so I do believe we had a tie. The rest of the film is just pointless filler getting us to the somewhat enjoyable ending, well about one fourth of it was enjoyable anyway (the saber duel). In the meantime you have a pointless race where you just knew young Anakin was going to win, stupid cameos that make no sense (come on, Anakin making C-3PO, really?), and very bland leads in Liam Neeson as a guy who never existed in the original saga and Ewan as a even more impressively bland Kenobi. Yes, the acting is about as good as watching people in front of blue screens as everyone has no reaction to what they are supposed to be seeing. All this and it culminates with a battle with the creatures that are annoying and robots (I wish the robots won that one), a stupid action scene for the princess (basically an anything a guy can do a little girl can do too set of scenes), an annoying Anakin piloting a ship against the underdeveloped enemy, and one of the few things worth seeing a duel between the Jedi's and Darth Maul. Kind of a shame a movie this bad made as much as it did, but you put light sabers in a movie and name it Star Wars and it would probably easily make 100 million.",4,4,9,3 April 2001
The Expendables 2," The Expendables are back and stuff gets blown up! What else did you expect?
","I went to this film expecting another fun explosive ride and I got what I was expecting. Lots of explosions, plenty of bullets and numerous kills. I have to say I enjoyed this one a bit more than the last one, I am not sure what the critics were complaining about, but then they were harsh to Sylvester and Arnold's films back in the day too, so I guess I should not expect anything different this go around. And speaking of Arnold, it was great to see him back and part of the action this time. Probably one of the reasons I enjoyed this one a bit more than the second film.The story has our gang going into some type of military type installation to retrieve a hostage right from the get go. Suffice to say, before the title comes across the screen you are exposed to lots of action and violence. Ah Sylvester, you sure know how to do it right. We get introduced to a new member of the team and sad to say we have to say goodbye to one of the older members. Granted he was not killed, but he does exit the film early and does not return. I could not believe he did not come back, and if I have a gripe about the film it is that this character did leave so early. Well Church (Bruce Willis) finds Barney (Stallone) and he wants a favor. He wants Barney to take his team to the site of a crash to retrieve something. Something that Van Damme wants and gets. Barney's group goes after this villain, not because of what was taken, but for revenge! The character's are expanded upon here a bit more. It was great seeing Dolph with the team for the entire film. He is still crazy, but he is a bit more under control and actually provides some very humorous moments. Arnold and Bruce are in this one a lot more than the previous film too. They get to take part in the action this time as their roles are not merely walk ons this time. Chuck Norris also gets to do his thing, just as he did back in the 70's and 80's. Van Damme was also in this one a good deal and he made a very good villain. He was much more memorable than the villains from the previous film, I mean Stone Cold was good at the fighting, but did not leave an impression on me as far as acting. Van Damme on the other hand played the part of a villain very well, this film may open up another avenue for him.This film was fun for me. I am not suggesting it is a work of art or anything, but I missed the first film in the theaters, so I was not going to miss this one. I wanted to see this troupe of action stars shoot it up on the big screen and I got what I wanted to see. Arnold's return was particularly satisfying for me, as there has been a void in my movie theater life since he became governor. I want to see him on the big screen as he was a favorite of mine as a kid and young adult. I also enjoyed seeing Norris on the big screen for the first time in my life. I thank Stallone for bringing all the big guns to the table and while others may not have cared for this film...for me, it was a blast! So sorry if you do not care for my opinion, but I enjoyed this film.",9,96,152,22 August 2012
Skyfall," After a lengthy absence Bond is back with a vengeance!
","After I first watched this film I felt it was a very good Bond film, but I was unsure just where to place it in the three Daniel Craig Bond films. Initially, I was disappointed by the fact the organization set up in the previous two films was not mentioned or used. However, the more I thought about this Bond film, the more apparent it became that this was indeed Craig's finest Bond movie yet. This is due to the increased screen time of M played once again by Judi Dench and this film basically revolves around her character as it is a bit of a farewell film for her. Sure, the organization was not used this time, but after Dr. No and From Russia with Love Spetre was given a film off for Goldfinger. So I can see them once again having James Bond face off against this mysterious group again in the next film. So basically this Bond movie was great with great action which is usually a given and an emotionally charged ending that was not expected.The film has Bond trying to chase down a man who has vital information in his possession. Suffice to say, this Bond movie has one heck of a chase right from the get go. Unfortunately, Bond is nearly killed right from the get go as well as he is hit by friendly fire. He later turns up, but not before the information he failed to retrieve is used to attack MI6 headquarters. Someone has a grudge against M, and James Bond is on the case to track them down. He has to go to the Orient where he discovers a former 00 agent is the cause for the turmoil, this man is not what he appears to be as he is cold and calculating to the extreme. Bond soon uses M as bait as he takes her to his old family home, 'Skyfall'. There he will face off against this madman hellbent on revenge against M.If I were to have a complaint about this one, it is the villain. He is good, but they do not develop him quite enough. He needs more screen time as Javier Bardem does a good job with the relatively small amount of screen time this villain receives. However, that is about the only complaint I can muster against this film. I loved how they brought back two staple characters from the movies prior to the Daniel Craig films, and while Judi Dench will be missed, I like her replacement. To me, it almost felt like the Sean Connery days as they were ending this one...and that is a good thing as Connery is my favorite Bond. Granted, Craig is close to tying him at this point.This film was amazing. At first I did not realize how good it was, but it sticks with you long after it is over unlike so many other films that just vanish from your brain a couple of hours after viewing. It was also good how Judi Dench's M had such a major role...I loved the scene with them in the classic Bond car. It is a shame it took so long for them to get Bond back on the big screen, but I am happy to report that the film was everything one expects from a James Bond film and a bit more. Hopefully, we will not have to wait four years for the next installment, and perhaps the organization set up in Quantum returns.",10,5,13,15 December 2012
Ghost," One of those romance movies that can appeal to both sexes.
","At its core this movie is in fact a chick flick, kind of in the same way the film 'Titanic' is a chick flick. Basically, it is a film more geared to the fairer sex, but there is enough plot points and laughs and in the case of 'Titanic' enough of a disaster to keep a guy's interest. You would think the 'Twilight' series could do a better job at holding a guys interest, but for whatever reasons they apparently are completely hated by males, me included...sorry. This one though had an interesting enough plot after we see Swayze and Demi making pottery, as Swayze gets killed and leaves behind the love of his life. However, he sticks around as a ghost (hence the title) to try and keep his love out of harms way and to solve his own murder. Kind of hard to do when no one can see or hear you, that is until he meets a woman who claims to be able to speak to the dead. Well she is actually a fake, that is until Swayze shows up and her powers come to life. The film has some really good elements to it, a nice scene by Vincent Schiavelli in the subway. There is a nice dose of humor too mainly consisting of the scenes between Whoopie and Swayze. The film is not without its faults though as when you think about it the part where Swayze takes control of Whoopie's body is a tad creepy when you think about what is actually going on. This would be by far though Swayze's biggest movie and I think Demi's as well. Made of a very modest 22 million and grossing over 200 is quite impressive especially when you consider this movie did not exactly fly out of the gate opening only with a modest for the day 12 million. At its core a romantic movie geared to females, but with enough stuff added to keep all entertained.",7,1,1,8 August 2010
Iron Man 3," Good film, but still left the nasty taste of iron in my mouth
","I kept hearing how this film was better than Iron Man 2, which I actually enjoyed so my expectations were a bit high. However, I tempered them a bit as I could see what was going to disappoint me a lot when I was watching the trailers. So I went to the film, and I enjoyed it for the most part...I liked it a bit better than two. Mainly due to the longer action scene at the end, but the disappointment was there too. What disappointed me so, you ask? The villain of the piece, of course. Being a fan of comics in general it was just a tough pill to swallow. Still, the film still managed to be very entertaining all the same.The story, has Tony Stark recounting a trip he had in Switzerland back in 1999, where he had a fling and kind of was a jerk to a man insistent on seeing him. Flash years later and a terrorist known as the Mandarin has been planting bombs and is at war with the U.S. The U.S. responds by sending Col. James Rhodes and war machine, now dubbed The Iron Patriot after him. Well Tony is going through some trouble, frequently having panic attacks, most likely brought upon by the attack upon New York seen in the Avengers film. Tony is brought into the hunt for the Mandarin when his friend and former body guard Happy is severely injured in the Mandarin's latest attack. Tony dares the Mandarin to come get him and the Mandarin does just that sending attack helicopters that decimate Tony's home and leave him stranded in Tennessee where Tony is able to piece together the full story and finds that there is something going on and it has nothing to do with a terrorist detonating bombs.The story played out pretty good, but the whole Mandarin thing was a disappointment. I had been waiting to see Iron Man's main nemesis since movie one. I am still waiting as what I expected to happen did. The Mandarin was just a fraud and the real villain is very easily figured out. I was happy that the real villain did have powers, but it was kind of like Molten Man's power. The villains heat up to a high temperature and can melt through even the Iron Man armor. People try to say they were doing something different, but I think that is only a small portion of it. For one, the director had stated he did not really want to do the Mandarin. Why get a director that has issues with a character? It is like forcing Venom on Sam Rami who hated the character or putting Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich in charge of Godzilla when they hate Godzilla. It doesn't make sense. Another reason, and the main one is that I am guessing they had already decided to put as many Iron Man suits on display as possible. This takes time and money. Well the Mandarin uses ten rings in the comics each with a specific power which translates in Hollywood to ten costly special effects that they were to cheap and lazy to do. Much easier to do the same effect for the villains over and over. So no Mandarin in his true form and thanks to the introduction of him in this film, no Mandarin ever unless they reboot the series.Once again, the film was still good. I enjoyed it, I just would have enjoyed it more with the real Mandarin. The action was done very well, it had a lot of funny moments and it was cool how they referenced the Avengers film. So a lot of good to be found. Just the nerd in me that is severely disappointed. It would be like if they made a Batman film and had Batman fighting a villain and they crash into a birthday party. A clown at the party sprays Batman with a flower and Batman pushes him angrily saying, 'Out of the way, 'joker'' and this is what counts as the Joker in the movie. Sure, it was funny, but also highly disappointing. It is also disappointing that Robert Downey Jr. will no longer do any stand alone Iron Man films as they do make for a good super hero film. So was it better than two? Yes, but not by all that much in my opinion.",8,0,2,20 May 2013
The Ring," One creepy film
","Creepy is definately the word I say describes this film the most.  The atomosphere is good too.  I enjoyed this film.  It is one of the few horror films made that have made me tense.  Are there problems?  Yes.  The story is about a reporter that while trying to find out why her niece died comes across a tape that supposedly kills you if you watch it...so what does she do?  She watches it.  On it are a bunch of disturbing images in black and white that reminds one of that one Nine Inch Nail video from way back.  She promptly shows it to her ex because he insists then her son sneaks and watches it.  So the reporter has to solve the mystery or in seven days as a phone call tells them they will die.  Some of the problems for me included the girl in the mental institution...you never find out why she is there or how she knows things.  Also, the little boy has some physic (I know this is spelled wrong) powers that are never fully explained and at one point you wonder why didn't the boy say what he knew earlier.  There are a couple of other little things, but all in all it was a good movie...now I just have to see what happens to me at the end of the week.",8,16,33,22 October 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," My favorite movie of all time!
","There are few movies I can watch over and over again, but this is one of them.  This movie has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. Harrison Ford is at his best as Dr. Jones, one of the most exciting archeologist ever.  From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure, I love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl, I just love every bit of it.  Spielburg said he wanted a b-type movie like he remembered from his youth, but this far surpasses any b movie and any a movie as far as I am concerned.",10,113,184,19 April 2001
Resident Evil: Afterlife," This set of films plays out more like a comic book than most comic book movies.
","I really enjoy the Resident Evil films and this one is no exception. Sure, you really have to suspend your disbelief for some of the stuff, but it is akin to suspending your disbelief in any comic book or fantasy film. These films are telling an interesting story and they do a lot better from one film to another than other big budget movies. Alice continues to wage her war on the Umbrella corporation leading an assault on their headquarters in Japan. Her troops, the many clones of herself. Unfortunately, though she is able to exact a bit of revenge, she also loses her powers thanks to the villain Wesker. Though she rather prefers to be human I think she would be better off with her powers. Well she ends up trying to find those she saw flying off to a safe haven in Alaska, she makes it there only to find a field of planes and no sign of humans other than Claire Redfield who has some strange device on her. Well they end up holed up in a maximum security prison and it becomes overrun and then a big dude comes and chaos ensues. Great action, Milla is probably my favorite heroine in film right now. Well I would say scratch the probably, she is. The film also does really good at making the film look like a 200 million dollar blockbuster on a 60 million dollar budget. The end most certainly suggests another film and I am most certainly up for another go around. I just enjoy the films, they are fun and fast and usually have good action and zombies. They may not be works of art, but they keep me entertained and I applaud this series for that, as I also applaud them for keeping the story intact and not completely ignoring stuff from the previous movies.",9,17,36,2 January 2011
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Liked it at first.
","As a kid my parents burned me out taking me to this film.  Every day they wanted to get rid of my sister and me for the day they took us to E.T.  By the third or fourth time, I really began not to really care for this movie to the point of being incapable of wanting to watch it again.  The story is simple though and good for kids to watch.  Even as a kid though I got quickly bored of this on and today I never want to see it again.  I will say I really enjoyed it the first and second time I saw it, but I have to say this movie is definitely for kids and they will get the most enjoyment of seeing Elliot help the little alien call his friends to pick him up.  This movie was also a really big advertisement for the candy Reese's pieces...they were basically unheard of before this movie.",4,3,7,6 May 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A movie that for me just missed the mark.
","This movie had a rather good plot, had funny scenes involving some of my favorite cartoon characters and it just missed mainly because of one mistake. That mistake you ask? Making Roger Rabbit sound like he did, it had the annoying factor of Jar Jar Binks, but Roger was in the movie a lot more than even that annoyance. Bob Hoskins whom I usually say is not really starring role material actually turns in a fairly good performance, but he is overshadowed by Christopher Lloyd who is fantastic in his role as Judge Doom. The voice of Jessica Rabbit is also very well done. The plot has Roger framed of course and the only person that can help prove his innocence is a guy named Eddie, who quite frankly does not like cartoon characters all that much. What is behind the murder, and what crazy stuff will happen in Toon Town? All of this would have been so much better if Roger Rabbit was not apparently on crack. Still, it has a lot to offer, I am sure most kids can overlook how annoying Roger is, and they may even find him very funny, heck most kids laughed at Jar Jar. For me though, if they would replace his voice I would probably have given this movie a seven or eight.",5,8,14,6 September 2009
Minority Report," A memorable action scene or two, but I found the story a bit lacking
","This movie was okay, nothing really special. A Tom Cruise science fiction action/mystery/suspense that works on some levels, but not on levels concerning the story as I found it weak and full of holes. It is the future in this movie and there are some nice visuals and some stuff I can actually see happening. What I do not see happening is the whole seeing a murder before it happens and people who have not actually committed a crime being sent to some strange tanks for the rest of their lives. The opening kind of demonstration shows a murder that any lawyer could get a person a much lesser sentence for as it was a crime of passion and would likely draw a manslaughter charge at most. Well the lead guy on this squad of super cops who rely on psychics to find out who is going to commit murder before they occur is now on the run because the psychics have said is going to commit a murder. Well a nice initial chase scene occurs and there is a lot of cat and mouse that works nicely. Then there are scenes that make one think 'what the heck is going on?' as the guy on the run gets his eyes replaced and plays pick the food. Yes, he has two choices of good sandwich bad sandwich and good milk bad milk. Strange plants that ensnare guests and a bunch of other just strange stuff more fitting for say an anime rather than a future that they are trying to present itself as realistic. It is nice to find out they culprit behind a bizarre murder case, but there are just too many strange moments for me to say this movie is all that good. It was watchable and somewhat enjoyable, but there just are not enough really cool scenes like that initial chase scene to make this a really good movie.",6,1,2,17 December 2009
John Wick," The movie teaches us not to kill a man's dog
","My parents own the DVD I watched of this movie and I borrowed it from them. It took me forever to watch it, but now I am happy to report that I have viewed the film so now I can return the copy back to my parents. It turned out to be a rather good action movie as well kind of in the same vein as the Punisher films and the film Dredd. Lots of action, a lot of bloody action that is. This film is almost non stop action as the set up of this film is very brief before it introduces us to John Wick's dark side and the insane criminal world he lives in. Granted, it seems as if this film was based on something as there were a lot of rules in this criminal world that seemed almost like we, as the viewer should already know, but I do not believe it was based on a book or graphic novel.The film starts out with John Wick (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) looking in rather rough condition and then we spend the rest of the film finding out what happened to put him in the place he is. His wife recently passed and after a very unfortunate turn of bad luck and timing he must go after some people that have wronged him. He will have to take on former allies as he wages a one man war against the head of a criminal family.Keanu Reeves does a good job as the title character and he apparently put a lot of work in training wise to play the man with special skills. The other cast members do a good job too, but the only other recognizable ones were only in the film for brief periods. I thought the film was going to be devoid of humor, but it had some moments here and there as it was funny to see how quickly people were to let John Wick off the hook as they had no urge to cross him.So all in all a good film as it was a bit of a super violent action flick...something the last Expendable film failed to be. It did not hold back on the violence, but I am a bit surprised that there was no nudity as I was sure there was going to be some in the couple of clubs that John came across. It does use computer blood, unfortunately, as it seems they must use computers for even some of the most basic special effects these days. However, my complaints are few as this one kept me entertained throughout.",9,1,6,4 May 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Not as funny as a movie titled 'Kung Fu Panda' should have been.
","First, let me say my niece enjoyed the movie quite a bit...this was her first movie so it was a new experience for her. If I was rating the movie on her thoughts on it I would have rated it higher. However, I paid money to see this one too, and I have to say I just thought it would be funnier. Jack Black is great as the voice of the Panda as was all the cast, though I thought the five warriors were rather ignored for the most part with the Tigress one sort of stepping up a bit. The movie was just to talky for me with way to many serious moments. I will draw a parallel if I may. The first hour of Shrek had me laughing a bit and was rather good. The last half hour I did not laugh much at all and I thought it dragged down the rest of the film. This whole movie seemed more like the last half hour of Shrek rather than the first hour. It had a few cute parts here and there, but for me it just did not deliver the goods, the preview for Madagascar 2 looked better than this one. The story has a Panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu hero ending up being the chosen dragon warrior to the dismay of a master of kung fu and his students. A villain escapes and is on his way to challenge the dragon warrior and nothing to surprising happens along the way. A few chuckles to be sure in the ending fight, and scattered throughout the movie, just not enough for my tastes. However, my niece loved it so it is a good movie for kids anyway.",5,3,13,22 June 2008
Meet the Parents," More realistic than its sequel this Ben Stiller/Robert DeNiro film full of laughs.
","I enjoyed this film quite a bit as it was a nice look at what the male of the species has to go through when meeting his girlfriend's parents. This one plays a bit more realistically than does the sequel which only enhances this film a bit above that one. Greg wants to ask his girlfriend to marry him and is about to do so when he learns that she wants him to meet her parents so he prepares to meet them and get her father's approval before he asks her. What occurs is the old adage if something can go wrong it will. From making a poor first impression to accidentally uncorking a champagne bottle so that it hits the urn of someone's final resting place, one really has to feel for poor Greg. He not only has to get passed these sort of self inflicted wounds, but also must deal with the fact her dad is also an ex-CIA agent or something to that effect and poor Greg is in for a very troubling stay. Throw in the super smart cat capable of using the toilet, the only one on his side seems to be his beloved. Though the mother is not quite as bad as the father, in fact she is no where near as bad. Throw in an ex-boyfriend and a pool party that starts out very embarrassingly and turns ultra competitive and nothing is going right for poor Greg. Very funny movie and great performances all around. I liked that Owen Wilson was in it as he is always good in movies such as these. DeNiro and Stiller were very funny as well as both played their parts well. An all around good comedy, which me liking a comedy made after like 1999 is a rarity.",9,1,2,9 September 2010
Mulan," Another one I got dragged to.
","My friend is for some reason a big Disney fan...he sees all the movies and somehow he always finds a gal that is really into Disney too.  From time to time, he somehow drags me to one of these Disney movies.  I have a policy of I will go to any movie as long as someone pays my way.  So I got dragged to this one and man, I didn't find it all that enjoyable.  If it wasn't for the character Eddie Murphy voiced I would have had a completely lousy time indeed.  His character though does do some funny things so I was able to tolerate it better.  This one has a girl pretending to be a guy in order to help her father who is drafted to serve, but is very old.  Of course, in this type of movie the girl does great in the army and becomes a better soldier than all the guys as is typical with these kinds of movies.  In the end I was able to sit through this one, but I wouldn't want to see it again. I have never really been a big fan of Disney movies, even when I was a kid so maybe I should revise my you pay I'll go policy.",3,3,29,7 March 2003
Wayne's World," Never cared for their skit, but their movie was okay.
","I thought this was mildly amusing, much better than most SNL movies not that it is much of a race mind you. This one stars Wayne and Garth as they do their thing and finally get recognized and offered their own show. There is also a girl rocker that is in this one a bit to much as the problem with both this film and its sequel is the presence of Tia Carrera. One has to believe that Mike Myers had a thing for her as she was to much of a focal point of both movies. She was attractive, but she could not sing or act worth a crap. Still, there are funny bits here and there like their speech on how they would never bow down to sponsors and the ending which had multiple parts to it. Also rather funny, a scene where they get pulled over by a cop looking for someone. Though for all the funny stuff that was in the movie there were also a lot of cringe worthy jokes that did not work at all, much like your typical SNL skit that has gone on to long. Saturday Night Live may have made some of the better comedic actors, but most of the films based on their skits suck, while this is an exception as it does not really suck, it is just a mild comedy that is just a longer skit that has flashes of being rather funny, but in the end rather forgettable.",6,1,2,12 July 2010
Star Trek," The reboot to the Star Trek series my favorite Star Trek to date.
","I am not what you would consider a Trekkie. I am a casual viewer of the series at best. I watched some of the original series and it was okay to pass the time. I did not care for the Next Generation all that much oddly enough because while I like Patrick Stewart as an actor and in just about every role he played I disliked the character of Picard for whatever reasons. Still, my favorite characters from the whole Star Trek universe are the ones from the original show and the first six movies. Though I really disliked Star Trek the motion picture, which was the first Star Trek movie of any kind. This movie featured young versions of those characters and I found the movie was very well cast as I liked all the characters. The guys playing Kirk and Spock were great, the ones playing Dr. McCoy and Scottie were very funny, and the other cast members filled out the troupe quite nicely. The story had very good action, drama and lots of humor as well. The movie did not have a slow stretch in its entire running time. I only have minor complaints here and there mainly about how I would have liked to see more of Kirk's time at the Starfleet academy and a little better conclusion with the Romulan leader Nero, but this movie was very entertaining for the most part. The story basically has a time travel twist to it and I do not want to go into to deeply out of fear of revealing some of the plot, but it was very interesting and I was happy to see Leonard Nimoy had a bigger role in the film than I expected. Also, I loved Simon Pegg as Scotty, he takes a while to make his appearance in the film, but when he does he really makes an impact. So for a very fun, action packed and funny thrill ride beam aboard the new Star Trek movie.",9,4,14,17 May 2009
Akira," Kinda slow at first...but it really gets going.
","Saw this on sci-fi channel so I have no idea how much was cut out.  What I saw though was pretty cool.  It is a bit slow at first, but once a dream sequence starts up it gets moving pretty fast.  The story is about a group of bikers, one of them takes a spill thanks to a mysterious boy in the middle of the road and the army takes the dude who had the spill and does experiments on him.  These experiments end up giving him telekinetic powers...powers that were apparently given to another named Akira.  Well the guy ends up going berserk and using his powers to destroy the city, looking for the one called Akira.  Meanwhile his old friend joins some rebel group in the hopes of finding his friend.  The rebel group opposes the Akira experiments.  After awhile the two friends have a cool duel.  Parts are hard to follow, but all in all it is a cool movie and trust me nothing I wrote will spoil it for you.  This is a very brief summary of the plot.",8,2,6,8 October 2002
As Good as It Gets," Not as good as it gets, but it is good.
","This is a film that is driven by characters and thankfully the actors and actresses in this film do a good job so it makes for a nice comedy/drama film. Though I would say it is a bit more comedy than drama. It is also a film with more than a couple of uncomfortable scenes within it. You know the type of scene, the one that just makes you feel like turning the channel. The film's plot is basically a man with ocd and is a writer is doing his thing when he eventually gets called on acting a bit of an arrogant uncaring guy all the time. He gets forced a bit to watch his gay neighbor's dog though he can not stand the dog and he is forced to deal with the fact the waitress he has to have at a local restaurant has a son who is sick and in need of medical attention and she is not able to work at her job at times thanks to this. Though a funny thing happens, he starts to actually become attached to the dog and he does things that are not like the persona he shows the world. The movie is very good as Jack Nicholson is very great as Melvin, the man with the ocd. Greg Kinnear is also very good in his role as is Helen Hunt and Cuba Gooding Jr. It is interesting to see how Melvin changes throughout the film and the film ends perfectly as it does so simply.",8,1,2,11 October 2010
Underworld," Gothic tale of the war between vampires and werewolves.
","Rather good and sleek action/horror hybrid in the same vein as a Blade, though not quite up to that movie. The action is good, and the scenery is good to as the city setting seems very other worldly, a Gothic mixture of old and new. The story, there has been an ages old feud between werewolves and vampires, the vampires apparently winning as they are slowly but surely wiping the wolves out. However, there seems to be a new target of the wolves, a young doctor whose blood the wolves want for reasons that are not immediately clear. So there ya have it, throw in a lot of gun fire and some latex and you have your movie. There are problems with the film though as there are a lot of double crosses and I am still not one hundred percent clear as to what made the doctor dude so important. Still, there is plenty of action to watch and lots of blood too. It was funny seeing how the werewolves were a bit rough and the vampires looked like aristocrats. It was a bit hard to pull for either side until the end when all the motivations were on the table too, as neither side seemed really to be making a target of humans. So all in all a good action/horror flick.",8,1,1,23 June 2007
Kickboxer," I prefer Blood Sport to this movie.
","This little Jean Claude Van Damme movie had its ups and downs, but in the end just was not up to his previous martial arts movie 'Bloodsport' released the previous year. The movie has more of a revenge plot to it than anything as this guy who is the American champ of kick boxing goes overseas to fight another champion of some country in Asia I do not remember which. The brother is paralyzed by this champ and the other brother finds a guy to train him so he can defeat this super killer guy who took out the American champ in a few seconds. So the rest of the movie is Jean training to get back at the super kick boxer. The movie is okay, but it has problems too. There is only so much training one can take and this one has those scenes in spades. The super kick boxer in the final fight is a bit weak and that whole fight is a bit anti-climatic. And seriously they just dump the American champ outside after his loss? Why did the American agree to go over there without some sort of backing by the government to take care of him and sanction the fight, just goes to show you never go to an underground like fighting arena to prove yourself. Still, it is a watchable movie just not really my thing, I preferred the tournament of 'Bloodsport' where they had rather big array of fighters.",5,1,2,9 October 2009
Captain Marvel," I enjoyed it, but my least favorite of the Marvel series so far
","Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later, finally a movie in the Marvel universe set of films that garnered a score less than 8 from me. Most have gotten 9's and 10's with some 8's. This one though I have to give a seven as the score, which is still a good score, nothing too bad, it just did not feel epic enough, like it was a backstory that was not important, with nothing new and no surprising moments. My least favorite up to this point was probably a tie between the third Iron Man film and the first Thor film; however, they had more going for them than this one did going for it. It just did not feel epic in the least.So, the story has a woman named Vers trying to harness her powers and having strange dreams about a past she has no memory of. She is on the planet of the Kree, which tells you right away who the villains of this one are if you have watched the other Marvel Universe films. Well, she is captured by the Skrull who probe her memory and end up near Earth as they try to find a woman from Vers past who holds the key to a light speed engine. Vers must find this woman and stop the Skrull, while agent Fury tries to get a handle on this woman who claims to be from another planet, but also seems to have ties to Earth.Captain Marvel is not really a favorite of mine. She is not really someone I dislike either. Honestly, she was not around at all when I read the comics and is pretty much a B squad hero. The first Captain Marvel was a male who was killed. I believe Carol Danvers is the second to have the moniker of Captain Marvel, but when I was reading the comics, she too had lost her life at the hands of Rogue who inadvertently killed her and took her powers of flight and super strength. So no, she was not really all that, and they totally over powered her in this film. She is not in Thor's or Hulk's class of strength, if I had to compare her to someone, it would be Iron Man. In this film, the conclusion of the film has her taking down huge space ships on her own and totally beating the bad guy's ass with ease which is just plain boring. It was also so obvious her mentor was going to end up being the bad guy, I mean the Kree had just signed a treaty in the present times, of course they were the real bad guys then!So, the film just was a bit of a bore in terms of surprises and such. The main surprise in this one is how Nick Fury loses his eye! His character adds something to the film and I thought Brie's Captain Marvel while a bit of a bore in the first part of the film becomes a bit more likable in the second half. Give her a decent opponent at the end that can put up a fight and try to come up with some good revelations and this one is better, but that is the problem setting the film in the past, too much you can mess up and there is too much we already know. The cat Goose was the best part of this one, but I still enjoyed it overall.",7,9,23,19 March 2019
This Is the End," Images in this movie will stay with me always
","Comedies in general can be one of the toughest movie forms to create. This is due to the fact everybody almost has their own sense of humor. When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought perhaps that this was a comedy that I would enjoy and not be disappointed by at the theater. Basically, I usually go to a comedy and end up disappointed. I was disappointed by Me, Myself and Irene, Nutty Professor II and Austin Powers: Goldmember just to name a few. I was disappointed by this one too, sadly. It had its moments and there was a stretch when I thought this film was taking off and it was going to be a comedy that I would enjoy, but it just kind of lost the sizzle and began to fizzle for me. Though I see by the score and by the fact it is probably going to eclipse the 100 million mark that it has an audience, that audience just did not really include me and the group I went with.The story is promising to a degree. Buddies Jay and Seth reunite at the airport, planning on spending some time together (all the actors in this are playing versions of themselves, I cannot believe they are exactly like they are portrayed here though) and Seth ends up getting Jay to reluctantly go to a party at James Franco's house. While getting smokes things begin to unravel as some sort of apocalyptic event is taking place. Jay and Seth race back to Franco's house and along with Jonah Hill, Craig Robertson and later Danny McBride, the group of friends tries to hold out for rescue as the world around them is falling apart.The premise was good, and while I thought the film started slowly, once the world began coming unraveled I thought the film was going to be a pretty funny movie. I laughed at them kicking around a person's head and I enjoyed watching Danny McBride waste supplies. However, at a certain point the film became somewhat of a bore to me. I did not like the whole revelations direction they took. I wanted to see a group of celebrities and their reactions to destruction all around them. When the film was doing this it was pretty funny, but once they started having one on one conversations and the jokes started being just the fact there was a penis on screen it just lost it. It also ended in weak fashion too, I thought they would do something a lot better for the grand finale. I will also never be able to watch a Channing Tatum movie and think of him the same again after this film.So, for me, it had some moments. It was not a bad movie, just not my type of film. I give them props for doing something different, but at the same time I deduct points for them using a special effects laden finale. However, once again this is a comedy meaning while I did not like the film, you may very well laugh through the entire thing. I mean, I laugh a lot during an episode of MST3K, but a lot of people simply look confused, unsure as to what I am finding so funny. So read the reviews or see the movie for yourself...it may be your cup of tea. I, on the other hand, hope that the other apocalyptic comedy coming out in August will be a comedy I will enjoy at the theater.",6,0,4,2 July 2013
Dawn of the Dead," I liked it as much as the original.
","I did like this movie as much as the original, though for different reasons. This one starts out showing you the outbreak as it first happens and I thought that was very nicely done.  Sure 'Night of the Living Dead' sort of showed us the initial outbreak, but this one does it in such a fast and furious way.  This movie has a few similarities with the original, though not many.  Mainly the name and the fact the survivors find refuge in a mall are the main similarities.  This is fine by me because I do not want to watch the same movie again.  The zombies here are fast, sort of like the zombies in 'Return of the Living Dead' or 'Nightmare City', but they are still stupid and can be killed with a bullet to the brain.  They are also a lot better than the ones in '28 Days Later' though they were not really zombies.  They were just people infected with a disease that turned violent and puked blood, while the zombies here do what zombies normally do...eat people.  Some humorous moments are scattered throughout, as are a few cameos...Tom Savini and Ken Foree are the two I noticed.  Good action and lots of zombies to be seen here.  This movie does one of the better jobs of making you believe the zombies are everywhere and the zombies are numerous. All in all good zombie action fun to be had.",9,0,1,21 March 2004
Iron Man 2," I thought the sequel to Iron Man was a blast
","This film did almost the same amount of business as the first film, but a lot of people consider it an inferior film. I am not one of those people, I actually think it is just as good as the first film. The first film had a bit more polish, but this one had more bang for your buck as the last action sequence in this film has more action than all of the cation scenes in the first film put together. They did recast Rhodes in this film substituting Don Cheadle for Terrance Howard, but quite frankly I thought it was an improvement. Cheadle just has a better presence than Howard and though they recast the role because Howard wanted more money, I think it worked in favor of the studio because Cheadle is a better actor. All the other primary players are accounted for as Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts. The two do great as a very eccentric pair and I thought Mickey Rourke as the villain was an improvement over Bridges in the first film. I just am not seeing what others saw that make them say that this film is a worse film than the first one.The story has a man in Russia with ties to Tony's father blaming the Stark family for all the misery that he and his now dead father have had to endure. He designs his own reactor and a pair of whip like weapons. Meanwhile, Tony is having problems as the U.S. government wants the Iron Man suit and the reactor in his chest is killing him at a rapid rate. So, thinking his time is limited, Tony goes crazy trying to live every moment as if it was his last. This leads to him to giving away his possessions, wearing his Iron Man suit to his birthday party and driving a race car. It is during the race that he first comes face to face with the new villain Ivan Vanko. Vanko is stopped by Iron Man, but his stay in prison is shortened when Justin Hammer, who is desperately trying to design his own Iron Man suit springs him in the hopes Vanko can create him the suit he yearns for. Tony soon gets information on a way to save himself and it all culminates at an all out battle at the newly opened Stark expo.The movie to me was fun as they brought back most of the cast and as I said, I thought the one they had to recast was an improvement. Also, introduced in this film is Natasha Romanoff who gets to showcase her skills a bit in this film. A lot more than Hawkeye would get to showcase his in his first appearance in the first Thor film. I enjoyed the Iron Man suitcase armor in the first fight with Vanko and I liked how Vanko looked in that fight as well. Something primal as a man with just a couple of whips and slight enhancers on the body trying to challenge the hero.Once again, not sure why this one is thought of as inferior. Tony was dying, that is why he reverted a bit to the jerky out of control self. He was just trying to enjoy his last days. I heard a lot of complaining that the final fight with Vanko was not long enough, but that was only one portion of the final action scene. Before that you had Iron Man being chased by drones while Romanoff was kicking butt at Hammer industries and then you had Iron Man and War Machine fighting against the horde of drone robots. Like I stated earlier, this final action scene was long and had a lot going on. The humor was still good and there was still heart to it. To me, this film is just as good as the original and the action was actually better.",9,3,4,13 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Not as good as the first two Alien movies, but it is the easiest to watch.
","I enjoyed this, the fourth movie of the Alien saga. As good as the first two, no, but at least it was a lot better than part three which I did not really care much for at all. This is also the fastest paced and more humorous of the four movies and that only adds to the appeal. You never get as tense as you did watching the first two, but that can be a good thing if you just want to watch the aliens killing and being killed rather than watching something that makes your heart race. Weaver is back as a clone of her former self, and quite frankly she seems to be having a lot more fun in this one than in the others. Ryder and Pearlman make great additions and really add the overall effect of this film. The aliens are once again reborn and they take over a ship as of you expect to happen. No one ever listens when they are told that the aliens can not be controlled. A group of mercenaries join forces with Weaver to fight their way to freedom off the alien infested ship. Good movie, though there is a few bizarre scenes here and there including one with Weaver and an alien. This one is not the best of the series, but it is a fun movie to watch.",8,10,22,5 June 2005
World War Z," Finally broke down and saw this high budget zombie film
","It took me awhile to finally go and view this movie. I had gone back and forth on rather or not I would see it during the past few weeks. At first, I was going to see it as I like zombie films and this was one with a huge budget. However, the fact it starred Brad Pitt made me iffy (not a big Brad Pitt fan). Then I saw some trailers and I was a bit more excited, until I saw the film was rated PG-13. At that point it was a no go as I just thought a zombie film should be R. After seeing several people on Facebook say they enjoyed the film I decided I would see it and it turned out to be a rather good zombie film. Granted, I still say it would have been better rated R as I could tell by the editing that there will be an unrated DVD version.The story has a man and his family having breakfast and going about their daily routine. My thinking at this point was that the film was going to take a while to get going. However, the family is not in the car for too long before explosions begin to occur within the city and people are fleeing in a panic. Finally, people begin attacking other people and the zombie outbreak has begun! It is up to Gerry (Pitt's character) to help a man try to discover what is the source of this horrid outbreak, however things do not proceed as planned. Gerry goes to South Korea, Israel and what I believe was Germany in the hopes of finding a source of the outbreak or at least some way to combat it.The effects are pretty good, once again I think they should have just released the film with an R rating. My guess is though with such a huge budget they decided that they needed as many people as possible going so that is why they ended up demanding cutting the film so it would be PG-13. Pitt does okay and the movie as a whole does a great job creating tension. For the next couple of weeks, every time I hear a door slam or something squeak I will remember this film. The film had more action than I was led to believe it was going to have, but I do have to say the scenes in Israel are the best as the zombies find very creative ways to get to their prey! So I did enjoy this film a good deal. It was nice to see something at the movies that was not a sequel or remake. The film throws you into the action quickly as it does not linger long on Gerry's home life. Near the end it turns almost into a stealth movie as there is a lot of sneaking around. It ends in a way that suggests there could be a sequel at a later date as things are far from resolved. If so, I will probably see it as well.",8,3,7,12 July 2013
Zootopia," Was pretty good, but thought it needed more humor...
","This Disney movie interested me when I first saw the previews way back when, but never got around to seeing it. Then I got my wife Disney+ as a Christmas gift and saw that it was on their streaming service so we gave it a watch. It was cute and mildly amusing; however, I found that it could have been a bit more funny as the crime began to overshadow the humor a bit in this one. What I mean is, figuring out what was causing the animals to go mad was the more interesting portion of the film rather than the fact we have a bunny cop and wise cracking fox trying to figure it out.The story has a bunny whose dream it is, to be a cop in Zootopia. She ends up becoming the first bunny police officer and she is basically given the job of meter maid, much to the delight of her parents who are scared to death for their little girl. She soon though gets wrapped up in a case involving a missing otter and must enlist the help of a con artist fox to find out where the missing otter is.The movie is more funny during the first part than the last third. The voice acting is good as was the animation. The areas of Zootopia really popped as you had snowy zones and a rain forest. The best part of the film, though, to me was the sloth run DMV which so accurately depicts how it is inside the real department of motor vehicles! I also like the mob boss who was really into icing people!So, in the end, this Disney film was pretty good. It is nice to have a Disney animation that does not have songs and such within like the police chief alluded to. The film seems to have been a very huge success so I am sure the inevitable sequel will be coming, but unlike some films, this one warrants one as you can have many misadventures for two officers on the job!",7,1,1,3 December 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Funny zombie spoof...but not quite as funny as it could have been.
","This movie offers plenty of laughs for the most part and is a very enjoyable zombie spoof movie. Not quite as good though as Peter Jackson's 'Dead Alive', it still offers plenty to the viewer to see and laugh about. This movie is about a guy going through romantic problems, and other problems as well such as a dead end job and two other roommates that are on opposite ends of the spectrum causing headaches for our hero. While all these mundane things are going on there are numerous reports of strange happenings being announced, but our hero just switches the channel or ignores it and is completely oblivious to the fact zombies are going on a rampage. It is a bit of a slow set up, but it is funny watching him totally unaware of the fact people are being killed. Then the zombies attack in full force and the movie really picks up. Unfortunately, some times in the movie it seems to be an 'Airplane' type spoof then in the next turn it gets a wee bit too serious for its own good. These scenes just don't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie. However, it does not deter from the movie all that much and in the end it is very much a comedy first, romance second, and horror a distant third. Some rather nice zombie effects here and there as there is a scene where a zombie falls on a pipe, and another person gets pulled apart, but for the most part it is not a gore fest. In fact, in scenes where people do get killed it seems a bit out of place seeing how light hearted the movie is at times. Worth a look and worth more than a couple of laughs.",8,2,5,1 January 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Captain Jack Sparrow is back and he has a debt to pay...
","This rather good movie as sequel to the sleeper hit Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the Black Pearl is not as good as its predecessor. Of course, this time it isn't a surprise as was the first one, it also has a very choppy flow to it that doesn't help. The plot goes here and there, to many characters introduced when all we came to see (well most of us anyway)is Captain Jack. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly return too and there is to much focus on them for my tastes, don't get me wrong they need to be in it, but more Jack please. Still you get action in the form of a rather cool sword fight in a water wheel, an aquatic sea monster attack, and other scenes like this and you get your comedy, the best bit coming near the start of the movie where Jack and his crew are in the clutches of a group of cannibals. So while this movie is not as good as the first for the most part, it is still a rather fun film that would have benefited with a shorter running time. It could easily be edited down a good fifteen minutes or so. Still there was a nice surprise at the end, at least for me, however IMDb kind of ruins it. Thankfully I didn't see that till tonight. So if you liked the first Pirates go see this one because while not the first one your still in for a treat, but be warned it ends in a cliffhanger.",8,4,9,8 July 2006
Rocky V," Granted it was the most original sequel, it still felt wrong.
","Of the Rocky movies I have seen, this one is by far the worst. Never saw Rocky Balboa so I do not know how that one stacks up to the others. One of the many problems of this movie is its feel, it does not feel like a theatrical movie. It feels like a direct to video or maybe a television movie rather than a movie made for the theaters. I also did not like the way poor Apollo is now just an afterthought getting only one mention in the entire movie. It makes the fight against Drago just the setup for the brain trauma that Rocky suffers in this film that causes him to be unable to fight. This film also has the annoying guy doing the Don King impersonation that gets very irritating after awhile. So the story, Rocky loses all money and is forced back in to his old neighborhood where he meets and up and coming boxer named Tommy Gunn (played poorly by Tommy Morrison)who wishes Rocky to train him and gets mad when Rocky gets to much attention. Why he did not see that coming is beyond me. The movie does not really feature all that much ring boxing and the fight at the end is rather bad and not at all entertaining and the Mickey flashbacks are a bit creepy. Basically, a movie that would have been better off not being made.",3,2,5,7 March 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," I feel I should clarify an earlier review.
","I enjoyed it when I saw it at the theater, but I was very much sleep deprived at the time so I didn't catch everything.  On having gotten the DVD, I can say that there are no plot holes are such as I thought there were then.  It is also still a very good and funny movie when I watch after having loads of sleep.  Why oh why, though is this movie rated pg-13?  Seems to me it should be pg easily.  I mean pg means parental guidance and I do believe many eight year olds would love it.  Just seems the ratings board has forgotten that movies like Jaws and all the earlier James Bond movies were rated pg.  I just think they under use that rating to a ridiculous extreme these days.  I also thought Spider-man should have been pg.  Well enough of that, this movie is thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family with action comedy and all that good stuff.",9,0,2,17 January 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Other than a few unresolved plot points and a long running time this one is pure fun.
","Seeing the previews of this one I thought it would be a nice fun adventure and as it turns out it was.  The person though that stands out the most in this one though is Johnny Depp, he was great has Captain Jack Sparrow. There wasn't to many moments in this one when he was on screen that didn't make me at least chuckle.  He really made the film for me, though the rest of the cast was good to with Geoffrey Rush as the bad guy and Orlando Bloom doing excellent jobs as well. The female lead was great too.  This one though was just a purely fun movie to watch.  The scenery was great too on the open seas.  The only thing I had problems with are some plot points and the movie did run a bit long.  I still am not quite sure why they needed the one guys blood and there was something else that didn't quite fit together as well, like what was up with the compass, but these are minor problems I had with it and in no way do they diminish the enjoyment I had watching this one.  Great swordfights in this one as well, as I love a good sword fight in a movie.  This one is also good for the whole family, and I am still wondering why it was rated PG and not PG-13 as I think the ratings board these days is a bit crazy.  If the last two Star Wars movies were PG then this one should have been as well.  All in all a great time to be had by everyone.",9,0,3,19 July 2003
Stripes," My personal favorite military comedy movie.
","This movie is a very funny comedy starring a rather great cast. Bill Murray is the headliner and Ramis is also rather good too. Backing them up are an assortment of goof balls including the late John Candy in one of his better roles. The story, guy is having a bad go of it at the job and his social life. So what does he decide to do? Well he joins the army of course and even manages to convince a friend of his to join him. Well the army is not quite what either of them expect as they seemed to be in a set of the worst recruits ever...not that they are any better and a bunch of funny scenes ensue including the introduction scene where you learn some of the guys motivations for entering the army including weight loss and one guy who figured he would be eventually drafted anyway even when there is no more draft. Plenty of great training, a bar scene involving a mud wrestling arena and a heroic rescue. Of course, the movie is at its funniest during the training scenes and their adjustments to army life. The last part of the film seems kind of stuck on to extend the movie a bit longer. Not that it is bad, just not up to the first two thirds of the film.",8,0,0,10 June 2008
The Babadook," A horror film that needs way more explanation
","I had heard various people talk about this film and what I usually heard was that people really enjoyed it or really hated it. I fall in the middle as I thought this horror film had an interesting premise and it had me hooked wondering where the heck it was going with the bizarre plot; however, it ended up having a rather bizarre, in a bad way, ending. I have mentioned this in several other reviews that I have written about horror films that I have seen, and that is so many have something very promising as far as plot and atmosphere only to fail to fully deliver on said premise. Usually it is a twist or something that ends up messing with the ending or in this case the fact the ending made absolutely no sense!The story has a mother who lost her husband when they were trying to get to the hospital so that she could give birth to her child. The child is a young boy when the film starts and just about the most horrid acting child one could imagine. The mother is being completely overwhelmed by everything around her as the boy constantly lashes out at things and he gets taken out of school and she is trying to work too. She is sleep deprived and just really looks like she needs a vacation. One night, the boy wants her to read a book called, The Babadook. She reads the book and the boy becomes terrified that this thing is real. Soon strange things begin to happen making the woman question her sanity, but she soon learns that the Babadook may be real!The story was interesting, but the ending was just so strange. I was expecting mother or son to end up being the Babadook, but turns out the thing was real. Only, that makes no sense as you expect some backstory on the thing if it is real. Why did it choose the mother and son? What sort of creature was it? Why was the mom feeding it worms at the end? Seriously, that ending made no sense, I usually like it when there is a supernatural force, but in this one, I almost think it would have been better had the son ended up being the thing as he was portrayed to be quite the monster throughout the movie!So, the film had some interesting elements, but it did not fully deliver. A lot of wasted potential as there is just not enough explanation going on within. I had thought from what everyone was saying that the Babadook did not even make an appearance in this thing, but it was real and you had glimpses, but you never get to see its true form which is mentioned in the book to be truly terrifying, which is what led me to believe the son would turn out to be it as what would be more terrifying for a mother, but to learn her son is a monster. That would have been a much better end to this one. As it is, it is a horror film with a great build up, but disappointing payoff.",6,0,2,11 April 2018
Spider-Man 2," Quite frankly Spider-man, your amazing.
","This so far has been the best movie I have seen all year...it was all I expected and more. Better than the 2002 hit, this Spider-Man is well worth seeing. A plot I was not expecting when I saw the previews helped too, as it continually surprised me with where it went and where it was going. The special effects are top notch, as was the acting, and generally everything about the movie was just great. Not the typical summer action movie, this movie had heart and just has to be one of the best comic book movies made if not the best. The story has Peter Parker/Spider-man really having a tough go of it as of late. He is late for classes; he cannot hold on to a job, he is neglecting his friends all while trying to lead a double life. Meanwhile, a brilliant scientist is developing a process to make energy. Of course, this is Doctor Otto Octavious. During the two hours you are in for a ride both action wise and emotional. Spidey loses his powers because of all the problems he is having in his life personally and the good Doctor has an accident that causes him to fuse with metal arms he created to handle the unsafe fusion process. The highlights of this one include a very good bank heist by Doc Ock (dubbed that by JJ Jameson) and the best action sequence in any comic book adaptation a fight that starts on a clock tower and ends on a speeding train. Doctor Octopus is a definite improvement over the Green Goblin as he has much cooler fights with Spidey, plus he looks and fights more like the villain in the comic than the Goblin did. The focus in this one, however, is mostly on Peter Parker/Spider-Man as he tries to deal with the enormous powers he is given and trying to find a way to deal with his love for Mary Jane Watson a girl he seemingly can not have. That is what also made this movie work for me...I just can totally relate to his situation. Not that I have super powers, but any woman I fall for I never act upon because I think they will be better off not knowing me. I also have the bad luck and I am a bit of a klutz. Heck, if I did have powers I would have abandoned this life long ago. All in all a great movie that I look forward to buying on DVD. The best superhero ever...go get em' Spidey.",10,1,3,2 September 2005
The Fifth Element," Science fiction, action and comedy with Bruce Willis and a young Milla Jovavich.
","This film is a bit of a curiosity in terms of movies in the last twenty years or so. Why you ask? Because everything indicates that this movie should have been a rather big box office hit, and while it did rather good overall when you factor in the whole world, here in the United States it kind of had a lackluster showing. Makes no sense as it seems to be liked by a good many people and it had Bruce Willis at his best and introduced two relative newcomers to the screen in Milla Jovavich and Chris Tucker (though I believe Tucker was in 'Friday' before this one). It also had really good special effects, especially in the city. So good in fact I often feel George Lucas really liked those city scenes as he seemed to add a place just like it in his second Star Wars movie 'Attack of the Clones'. The plot is pretty good, though it gets to be a bit much in areas as there are multiple bad guys here and there for our hero to overcome including time as the longer things go on the more likely it is for the Earth to be destroyed. Yes, an ordinary cabbie gets to be a hero, though he is an ex-soldier, as a young and mysterious girl comes crashing through the roof of his flying cab. On with some nice chases and such and a trip to a cruise ship in space for a bizarre operatic fight scene. The movie has a bunch of stuff going on though like I said at times to much as poor Gary Oldman's character just does not get enough screen time and he factors almost not at all in the final showdown. Still, overall this movie is a fun watch even though there is a lot going on and the ending was a tad anti-climatic.",8,1,3,14 April 2010
Batman Returns," Batman did return, but after this film Burton didn't.
","This Batman film at the time of its release was thought of as a bit of a disappointment. Sure it did quite well at the box office, but really did not compare to the first one. The reviews were lukewarm at best, quite incendiary at their worst. I believe it had multiple razzie nominations and I do believe Danny DeVito actually won for worst performance. However, over the years for reasons unknown to me it has gained a following, now it is often said to be the best of the original four films. At one point it had a 6.2 score on IMDb, but now sports a 7.0. What changed? I have no clue as to me it is not the disappointment it was then, but I still thought the first film was better. Burton went darker with this one, at the same time in areas he went lighter. This one is a sequel, yet other than a throw away line about Viki Vale and a few of the same actors this film almost feels like a totally different film in some regards. Still, it is my second favorite film of the original four films, though it is a set of sequels that change up the formula so often that you hardly can tell they are connected when you compare Batman and Robin to the first film.The story has a strange circus gang on the attack, things get a bit out of hand and Commissioner Gordon calls on Batman. Did not take him all that long to become over reliant on the Bat now did it? Well during the chaos a strange person dubbed the Penguin makes his way out of sewer, part of his plan that is not really a Penguin plan of the comics. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle is having boss troubles to the point of being pushed out of windows and resurrected as Catwoman! The boss, Max Shreck, decides to use the Penguin for his own needs and makes a bold push to make this strange man into the mayor. Catwoman and the Penguin soon team up as the Bat keeps interfering with each and plan a caper to frame the Dark Knight.There is a lot going on in this film, and that is a bit of a problem. Penguin's and Catwoman's team up seems rushed, there are parts of the film that seem important that are never discussed again and the best villain is not even one of the two super villains, but rather Christopher Walken's Max Schreck character. Still, Burton has a way of making the very bulky bat suit not look like something that is going to restrict someone's movement to the point it is nonfunctional. The next two films it looks like the heroes can barely move! The suit on display in this film is also the best looking one of the original four ditching the molded muscles of the previous film and the strange tail on the bat insignia. The bat mobile still looks awesome, it doesn't for the next two movies and Catwoman's costume is hot...though I prefer the Lee Merriweather look in the 60's version as Michelle is too pale for my tastes.As for the villains, neither is really a lot like their comic book counterpart. However, Burton should not be restricted by a comic book nor any other director. Seriously, do people really want every comic book movie to start at issue 1? Granted, both get a very strange treatment as Catwoman gains her power from random cats, I would prefer she be just a cat burglar and Penguin's origin shown at the beginning would be great, if the villain was Killer Croc. He is also a bit to disgusting looking. I just do not see people rallying behind him as people are shallow and while they may not burn him at the stake, they are not going to fall in love with him as they do in this film. Michael Keaton is still good as Batman, I prefer Bale a bit over Keaton, but Keaton is miles ahead of the other two guys. I just think Bale did Bruce better while Keaton was actually better as Batman. With them it is close, not so much for Kilmer and Clooney.So I still do not see why people act as if this film is the best in the series including the Nolan films, however, I respect their opinion. One even gave me a list and while I did not agree it allowed me to understand a bit why they felt it was superior. To me, it was an okay film and a disappointing sequel. I just thought areas of it were to strange, some too lighthearted and it just did not continue the first film well enough (Billy Dee Williams...where are you?). It still had a lot of fun moments and it had a lot more Batman in it than the first film and probably the next two. Add a awesome action scene to the end and I would give it an 8, but the anticlimactic ending we got is one of the main reasons I did not like this film as much as the first and only give it a score of six. I still remember the disappointment I felt as a kid as the ending played out.",6,0,0,27 October 2012
Finding Nemo," Great family comedy adventure, under the sea, in the aquarium, and through the deadly ring of fire.
","This movie was a very family friendly and funny movie that both kids and adults can enjoy. Great voice work really makes this one, as both Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenerous do outstanding jobs with their characters. I especially enjoy Ellen's spacey character, that does not have to good of a memory, but is so cute in her delivery. I love the part where she takes her turn at the shark intervention. Great scenes everywhere as the father goes looking for his son Nemo who is captured and placed in an aquarium of a dentist. In the tank are some of the most neurotic fish ever, including one determined to escape the tank. They all band together when it is found out that Nemo is going to be given to the dentist's niece who lets just say isn't very good with handling fish. Nemo's father faces many perils in the quest for his son including jellyfish, a lantern fish, a whale, seagulls, and many other very funny perils. So watch this movie and enjoy as it is one of the better computer generated movies I have seen with great voice acting. I enjoyed almost every minute though the opening is a bit sad it makes up for it with great comedy...look for John Ratzenberg as a very funny school of fish and check the end where the flaw in the escape plan is obvious.",9,0,1,26 November 2005
Blade," A very stylish movie.
","This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it.  It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever.  I liked this one even more than X-men.  In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either.  Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade.  He is just not an emotionless super hero.  Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating.  Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic.  This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't.  A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight.",10,9,12,19 September 2001
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Wolverine goes back to his roots.
","This movie was rather good, I have to say out of all the X-men movies though it was the weakest of the bunch. Not by a lot as I did give it a score of 8, I just found it had some story problems here and there and other issues that the other movies did not have. However, I was surprised the story was somewhat good and not disjointed as it looked like it might be from the trailers, by that I mean the time did not shift from one random scene to another. The story basically shows us how Wolverine became Wolverine and a bit how Sabretooth came about as well though he was never called that in the film. You go through the opening credits going through all the wars they participated in, to their time in a band of mutant mercenaries led by Stryker. After a mishap there Logan (Wolverine) goes to live a more normal life only to find it destroyed by Victor (Sabretooth). After a brutal battle where it is apparent Victor is just to powerful for Logan to fight in his current state, he accepts an offer to go through a procedure that gives him the metal skeleton and claws that we all know and love. The action is rather good in this film though I thought Wolverine had better fights in the previous movies as nothing in this one can really compare to the Lady Deathstrike fight in part II. I liked seeing other mutants from the comics as I thought they did the Blob very well. I was disappointed that Gambit was not in it more, and the one real fight scene he was in was a bit hard to follow, but it was nice just seeing him on film. Scott Summers also makes a brief appearance and they actually showcase his optic blast better in this movie that is mainly a Wolverine feature than they did the other X-men movies. It is not all perfect as Ryan Reynolds character was underused, I did not care for the reason Wolverine lost his memory in the other movies as it seemed to far fetched and kind of weak, and the last fight while cool was kind of a waste of one of the more interesting comic characters. I would rather have seen Omega Red as the final enemy as he would have been cool and you could have used the other character in later movies. Next up is X-men Origins Magneto, but truthfully I would rather see an X-men 4 movie as there were to many loose ends in the Last Stand.",8,5,10,6 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Even better than Shaun of the Dead, this movie delivers the laughs and surprisingly the action.
","The best comedy I have seen this year or probably the last couple of years this movie had me laughing and cheering on our heroes. In this movie we have a super cop who has gotten numerous awards for his excellent service, top of his class, and smart too. Unfortunately, he is to good in that he makes the other officers in London look bad so he is promoted to Sergent in a very small and quaint little town. Once there he quickly makes his presence known and we get to see him adjust to his new life and even a new partner. Well not really a new partner as he is more of a guy who really looks up to the officer for all he has done. However, all is not as it seems in this nice little town as something sinister seems to be at play. This movie is just great. Funny, and it has loads of action and blood too. It is sort of nice to see a rated R action cop movie again. Throw in a plot that actually surprised me a bit and it a nice change of pace from the the computer terrorist plots so many movies are employing and you have one of the great films of the year. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are great here as they were in Shaun of the Dead, they are also likable as it is like joining a couple of friends at a day on the job. Also in the cast is a former James Bond, Timothy Dalton so that was interesting as well. Still even with the cool action scenes what I was looking for here was laughs and I got plenty, from the opening scenes to the final ones the jokes flew fast and furious with a few sentimental touches as well, however, they added to the movie and worked quite nicely too. So for a super funny cop buddy flick this should be on your list of one of the best.",10,1,3,1 August 2007
The Mummy," A Raiders type adventure.
","This movie and its sequel remind me a lot of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (this one more so).  It is a great fast paced action movie with the only real horror being the fact the good guys are up against a mummy.  This one had the better plot of the two mummy movies, but the sequel had the better action so I like them about the same.  This one has them discovering the lost city and awakening the mummy from his sleep.  He starts out all rotted, but as he kills the group that awoke him he regains his former body. Brendan Fraser is rather good in this one as the hero.  The rest of the cast does rather good too, though no real big name stars were used in the other roles.  Some pretty good special effects too, though they are definitely not the best ever witnessed on the big screen.  This movie is just an old-fashioned action movie though so it works.  The scenes in the pyramids and stuff were better than the tomb raider movie was...in fact this one was more like the tomb raider games than the tomb raider movie was.  Some comedy is also thrown into the mix as well.  All an all a well-rounded adventure movie.",8,0,0,24 April 2003
Constantine," Keanu Reeves on the highway to hell.
","Pretty good movie, nothing super, but a fun two hours nonetheless. This movie is about a guy who sees demons and angels and sends demons who are naughty back to hell. The catch (there is always a catch) is that he is dying of cancer and he is not going to heaven when he dies. Why, because he attempted suicide as a young man and according to this movie that means a one way trip to hell no matter how good you are. Well Constantine is not exactly an angel either, even though he performs exorcisms and such. Well a spear has been uncovered and the demons are doing things differently...Constantine must pair with a cop whose twin sister has committed suicide in order to find out the deal. Action and special effects abound aplenty in this movie with some pretty good action and a few doses of horror in there just for safe measure. It is not all good, however, because other than Reeves and Weisz (the gal from the Mummy movies) there is not another soul I recognize in this movie. This movie is also in need of a better bad guy as well as there really is not a well defined one here. Still though you are in for a ride as how many other movies feature a crucifix shotgun?",8,2,5,20 July 2005
The Others," Not really much horror or mystery in this one.
","It entertained for the most part, granted it was rather easy to figure out the twist to this one. That may have more to do with the movie 'The Sixth Sense', because thanks to that movie one tends to be looking for a possible twist especially when reviews talk about the shocking ending or what not. This movie has a lady and her two children living in a very big house where one day a group of three mysterious strangers comes and offers their services. Well the mother accepts and so starts the spooky going ons and such that accompany all such films as these. For the most part they are minor stuff here and there. Apparently the daughter suffers from some disease and must stay out of the sunlight, yet the shades set up keep coming down. There are other strange happenings and a strange visit by the father who for some reason comes and goes in very strange and mysterious fashion. Then there are scenes where the girl is seemingly possessed which are quite nice. Still the movie was somewhat disappointing, it is one of those horror/suspense films that is a bit to talky for my tastes and one of the films to start the current trend of PG-13 rated horror films. It also has Nicole Kidman in the lead and I have never been a big fan of hers, as she was one of the worst lead actresses in a Batman movie besides nearly everyone involved in part four. However, I will say this is one of the better roles I have seen her in. I may have found this movie entertaining if we can go back to a day where the surprise ending is not advertised in the trailers.",6,0,1,1 August 2009
Home Alone," If it wasn't for Pesci, I would have given it a 1.
","This is just one movie that I cannot stand.  I am not wild about movies that are mainly about kids who get the best of adults, and this definitely fits the bill as one of those movies.  What really gets me, is this kid would not have gotten into all the trouble he did if he wasn't such a brat.  The family is trying to organize this big trip with all these other relatives, and all the their younger son can do is whine and complain.  'I don't want to sleep with that kid', 'I have to have my pizza a certain way', stuff like that...and he is supposed to be the kid we are pulling for?  We get to see him left alone and do all the things kids do when they are left alone. Watch black and white old movies.  Yes, and this kid is such a wimp that a black and white mobster pick scares him.  Though he uses it so wisely later in the movie (yeah right, that would work).  This kid somehow outsmarts the two thieves even though earlier one of them is smart enough to impersonate a police officer and check all the security of the houses in the neighborhood. I guess his intelligence went down a notch or two.  Then there are the many clever traps that usually consist of someone getting hit in the groin area...ha ha ha!  It is always so funny to see someone get hit there and writhe in agony.  All in all this is just one bad movie that I did not care for at all.  I just wish the kid got into some kind of trouble for all the problems he caused.",2,17,44,2 April 2003
Terminator Salvation," For better and worse, Terminator is back.
","This movie was not quite as disappointing as I was expecting from all the mediocre reviews I read, but it was still my least favorite Terminator in the series. The plot was interesting and to much all at the same time. Christian Bale at times seemed to be the movies main focus, at others he almost disappeared into the background. Worthington though was good throughout as the mysterious Marcus. The Terminator robots looked good whenever they were on camera, but at times their presence in the movie needed extending too. All in all though it was a rather good job as it was a rather good action movie, just do not expect all that much humor in this one. Basically this one has Kyle Reese being targeted as well as Connor, always Connor. Well the robots get Reese and Marcus wants to rescue him, but he gets held up by Connor's group who find his secret. By far the best scene in this movie was the scene with the giant Terminator that started with a gas station being destroyed and then turned into one really nice chase scene. After this there are good action scenes, but nothing really compares to this extended chase scene. Arnold makes an appearance at the end sort of. You can tell it is somehow done with computers as it looks like Arnold from the first film. Basically good, but not as much of a thriller as the first Terminator, not as epic as Terminator II and not as fun a ride as Terminator 3.",7,2,4,11 June 2009
Aquaman," Never thought I'd enjoy an Aquaman film adaptation
","I am in the minority when it comes to the DC films in that I have enjoyed them all. I thought Man of Steel was an awesome Superman film, Batman versus Superman wasn't great, but the last portion of the film was good, Suicide Squad was pretty cool and Wonder Woman, well people liked that one. I even thought Justice League was good and was baffled that it had a disappointing box office take as it was so much better than Batman versus Superman. This one I was not sure of, because I just thought it would be difficult to make an interesting movie using only Aquaman. I was wrong and was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.The story has Aquaman coming out into the forefront as he takes out some pirates after we are introduced to Arthur's mother and his dad and how they met. He leaves a pirate father/son duo to die as they had been killing indiscriminately; however, this would later turn out to be a mistake as son wants revenge on Aquaman. Aquaman, meanwhile, must go back to his kingdom of Atlantis as his brother tries to start a war with those of us who reside on land. Arthur/Aquaman must try and reclaim his throne and prevent this war his brother so desperately wants and also deal with a new enemy, the Black Manta!One of the reasons I enjoyed this one was the cast who did a very good job. It was nice seeing Dolph Lundgren in a big movie for a change rather than the direct to DVD stuff he usually does these days. Jason Momoa is really good as Aquaman and is one of the main reasons I think this one worked as he is very charismatic as the hero in this one. My favorite though was the Black Manta as they had the costume down pat! He looked completely awesome and the fight between him and Aquaman was the highlight of this movie for me!So, overall, a very fun action movie and surprisingly so for me. I think the DC films are rather good, though I still favor the Marvel film universe more. I have always enjoyed Marvel more in the comics too as I find their heroes more relatable and less overpowered than those of DC, but I like the DC characters too. I am looking forward to Shazaam as well as that one looks fun too. Sorry, but comic book films should be fun and not all dark and serious...unless we are talking Spawn of course.",9,0,3,24 January 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," A better title would have been 'The Day the Earth Froze', but I already think that title has been used.
","First off, this movie was better than I was expecting.  A nice disaster film with some rather good story and great special effects.  Sure it is a bit unrealistic, the type of disasters shown here could not take place in our life time without massive volcanic eruptions, but hey it is a movie so it is best to watch and enjoy and not worry about the scientific facts.  The cast is rather good as Dennis Quaid turns in one of his better performances.  I just wish Ian Holm had a bigger part in this one.  As for the effects, as I said before they were great.  I also enjoyed the story although there was one unresolved plot point involving the one guy's brother in Philly.  The first half of the film shows the beginnings of the super storm and the second half is more of a rescue mission over the frozen areas of the United States.  The movie could have shown the effects of the storm on a few more countries as it tended to only show the United States and of course as in any disaster flick there tends to be a rather pointless subplot that never really goes anywhere...here it was a boy with cancer.  All in all though I enjoyed it more than I was expecting, I was just wanting to go to the movies and it was either this or Shrek 2.",8,1,3,28 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Jack Sparrow returns, though not nearly enough for my tastes.
","On par with Dead Man's Chest, not as good as the first part three still offers a very wild ride. The main problem, I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie. Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe. I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow. Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow, the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again. Granted it was not a huge disappointment, it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that. The story, this is going to be the hard part, however, I am keeping it as simple as possible. The gang is going in search for Jack, all with differing reasons. Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy. There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend, something about a song, a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects. So there you have it, sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while, but it still manages to entertain. I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes, just nothing all that super funny like in the first. It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene. Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well. So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth, bring back Barbossa, and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple.",8,24,38,29 May 2007
Deadpool 2," Deadpool is back and is less serious than ever
","I enjoyed the first Deadpool film and I also enjoyed this one. Anyone who liked the first one, but didn't like this one is a bit perplexing seeing as how it contains the same humor as the first film. It is not as if this one is a huge departure that experiments and does things completely differently or something. No, we get the same Deadpool we got in the first film, only with some more action this time around, but still the same amount of gags. We also get Cable, X-Force, Colossus and a whole bunch of other crazy stuff!The story has Deadpool's lady friend from the first film being taken out by bad guys right from the get go leaving the super healing sort of superhero depressed and no longer wanting to live. Colossus tries to get Deadpool out of his funk and gets the crazed hero to join the X-men where he promptly gets himself arrested due to the fact he shoots someone during his first mission trying to get a mutant boy under control. The boy and Deadpool get sent to a prison and soon a mysterious warrior named Cable breaks into the prison to kill the boy. Deadpool makes it his mission to save the boy and forms X-force, but soon inadvertently frees not only the boy, but the Juggernaut as well from a prison convoy. Deadpool and Cable form an uneasy alliance and try to stop the boy before he kills and gets a taste for killing!The characters were great and I like how they did the Juggernaut in this movie. The first film showed that they could have made a proper looking Colossus and this film shows they could have made a Juggernaut that looks like Juggernaut in the X-men films. Not only that, they had Colossus and Juggernaut fight in this film! This is something I expected to happen in the third X-men movie, but it never happened. The Deadpool series just does a better job of making the characters look right and give us what we want. So, I enjoyed this film and I am sure there will most likely be another one. I enjoyed the humor and I really enjoyed the whole X-force portion of the film as the trailers I saw really had me fooled on how that would play out. Ryan Reynolds once again does a good job as Deadpool and I thought Josh Brolin did a decent job as Cable too. Kind of funny seeing him in this considering he was also the voice and motion actor for Thanos. Domino was really cute and I liked her character and I liked the return of Colossus and the girl from the previous film as well. Just a fun film, nothing to take seriously and worry over that is for sure.",9,1,3,17 July 2018
X-Men," Doesn't really follow the comic at all, but still enjoyable.
","This movie mainly focuses on Wolverine and Rogue.  Cyclops, Jean Grey, Professor X, Storm are also present along with a few others doing brief apperances.  The villians are Magneto, Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad.  As you can see as much as I liked this movie there were quite a few characters and its short running times meant you really couldn't dwell on anyone to long.  And as good as this one is the next one sounds as if it will just to many characters period.  The people who made this one though were smart enough to focus on Wolverine and he was the best character in this one.  I was disappointed to see Iceman a student at Prof X's school seeing as how he is one of the founding members in the comic book, but this movie, unlike Spiderman doesn't really follow the comic book much at all except for their powers and in some cases not even then.",9,0,0,15 December 2002
Spider-Man 3," Spidey still amazing...albeit a bit somber this go around.
","I really enjoyed this movie a lot and rank it right there with part two in how much I enjoyed this movie. Granted, a lot of people do not share this opinion, but then we all have differing tastes do we not. For me I was extremely surprised at how well the movie was made and how the story progressed...from all the reviews I was expecting a bit of a jumbled mess instead of a story that may had a lot of plot points, but for me they all came together quite nicely in the end. There is quite a lot of drama in this one, I will not deny that either as this was the complaint of a couple of people I know. I say a movie needs heart to keep your emotions going, and it was not like there was no action in this one, this one had more action than the previous two installments. When I read about this movie from critics and such I was not expecting what I got, I had a rather negative review ready to go on how this movie should have only been the black suit without Venom and how he should be introduced in the next movie, in the end Venom was not quite in the movie as much as I would have liked, but I still enjoyed the scenes he was in as Topher Grace was surprisingly effective as the character. And speaking of effective Thomas Haden Church was also excellent as the hulking yet sad Sandman. The plot, everything is going alright with Spidey at the beginning, the city of New York has embraced Peter Parker's alter ego, this however kind of blinds Peter from the fact MJ's career is not going quite so good and he does a few things that he should not. If this were not enough Harry attacks him as the New Goblin and another super villain appears as the Sandman, a powerful foe seemingly unstoppable. Add to this the fact that Flint Marko, aka the Sandman, may have actually been the one to kill his uncle and the pressure is really on Parker as now the old stirrings of revenge have surfaced. Fortunately, thanks to an accident Harry seems to be his old self again, not so fortunate some sort of alien material has now attached itself to Spider man and now Spidey and Peter are exhibiting a darker edge. So that is how it plays out, throw in an annoying new photographer named Eddie Brock causing Peter and Spidey headaches and you have a wild ride as there are fights in the skies of New York, on the streets, in the subways, and finally the biggest fight in any of the Spidey movies at a building under construction, an all out battle with two villains and even two heroes. However, this movie will not be for everyone as there are stretches where the movie is really dramatic between the action scenes, and even though I loved it, it still left me depressed too. Still if it ends on this it will be okay, however I do believe there is an opening for a sequel and if there is one I do believe the focus will be on that one particular character that some complain was not in this one enough. Though one thing was kind of lame, was Peter walking through the streets doing his little shuffle, I do think they could have come up with a better way to portray his dark side than that as I would have at least included a scene of him in the black suit taking out some criminals with a bit more force than necessary.",10,49,96,14 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," This Thor was strange, random and completely out there...of course I loved it!
","I was not sure what to expect from this Thor film as I saw only one trailer of the film. It seemed to be having multiple things going on and a lot of randomness so when I finally saw the finished product it was a very random at times movie. It was also a very fun film and I enjoyed it immensely as there were more than a couple Marvel characters in the film. I knew Hulk was going to be in it, but he appeared in the film a lot more than I was expecting speaking more in this film than all his three solo films combined. I was not sure what to expect from Loki either, but sure enough he was his usual self and once again I really enjoyed the scenes with him and Thor together as they have such an interesting relationship. There is a lot going on in this one and it almost had the feel of a Guardians of the Galaxy film, just with Thor interjected into it.The story has Thor fighting a being who wishes to bring about the end of Asgard. Thor fights this being and wins, thus hopefully stopping this Ragnarok from occurring. He soon returns to Asgard where he reveals to everyone that Odin has been replaced by Loki. The two go to find Odin on earth and Thor is assisted by the sorcerer supreme. Thor and Loki learn of Thor's sister who is soon to be released upon the world where she takes over Asgard while Thor ends up on a strange junk planet ruled by the Grandmaster. Thor must battle the champion of the planet, find a way off the planet so that he may return home and try to reclaim the throne from his diabolical sister.Love the characters of Thor and Loki as they always have such humorous exchanges. There is a scene where Thor is imprisoned on a chair and I am thinking I see Loki kind of just chilling in the crowd and sure enough it was him. I also liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in the film as he is all disjointed and a bit messed up. Seems the Hulk has been the far more dominating persona as of late and I found it humorous that both Banner and Hulk accused Thor of liking the other one more. Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett also did well in their roles.So fun is the way I am describing this film as it is like a Guardians film or the latest Spider-man film. With the passing of my fianc√© I do not have a lot to look forward to these days, but I do look forward to the latest Marvel release. The films keep being very entertaining and they make me smile if only for a bit and for that I am grateful. I will probably see the Justice League film when it comes out in a couple of weeks as well, but I am sure I will not like it as much. Marvel just works better for me I guess. I mean, they do not fear having a scene where Hulk is in a hot tub and gets out and you see his bare ass! Just a very enjoyable film that kept me entertained and made me forget my depression if only for a bit, but even if it is only temporary I am still grateful.",10,12,24,7 November 2017
Resident Evil: Extinction," Mad Max with zombies...
","Yes, this movie to me was very good and action packed. However, I am not a movie critic just an average guy that likes to see loads of head shot action. If I were a movie critic I would probably say it was not very good. I was impressed that they picked up from the last one, as they did not seem to forget plot points I thought they might have from part two. The only thing missing were the little girl survivor from the last movie along with the Jill Valentine character (which made me a bit sad). Still, one could just figure they died along the way so their absence by no means hindered the plot. So what is the plot, the world is overrun by the undead, infected by Umbrella's t-virus. Umbrella still exists, still experimenting for the good of themselves. Survivor's roam the lands, some by themselves...Alice for example, some as tightly knit roving communities on wheels that include a couple of familiar faces from part two, and then there are rednecks, who are idiots that deserve what Alice does to em. Alice meets up with her old friend and the caravan and plot a course towards possible salvation, meanwhile an Umbrella scientist once again locks in on her and needs a blood sample. Yes, this movie has loads of zombies and other nasty creatures and it has lots and lots of action. From an undead crow attack, to a Las Vegas zombie attack to a final showdown in one of Umbrella's hive facilities. This movie was very good and if this is the last one it ends on a good note in my opinion.",9,2,4,6 October 2007
The Terminator," Arnold's best role.
","I like all the Terminator movies about the same; they all have their strengths and weaknesses so I rank them all a nine.  This one looks very dated now and some of the special effects just don't look so hot, but it still is a fun movie to watch as Arnold plays the killing machine very well. His prey, Sarah Connor played very well by Linda Hamilton.  The story is good and there is lots of action and excitement.  This one goes pretty quick too, unlike the second one which has places in it that drags a bit.  Of course it makes up for the slow parts by having better effects than this one.  This one has many memorable scenes, the most memorable being the Terminator's attack on the police station.  There are a couple of Cameron staples here as Michael Biehan and Lance Henrikson are in it.  They appear in other Cameron movies as well.  Bill Paxton even has a small role in this one.  All in all a very good sci-fi action movie that is entertaining and exciting even though it is a bit dated now.",9,0,2,12 January 2004
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellboy is back and burns even brighter this go around.
","This sequel is an improvement to the first movie, both were good this one better. Of course, for me the main factor in it being better is that there is such a variety of monsters to look at this time. In the previous movie basically all the monsters Hellboy fought were essentially the same creature. Even the last monster he faced was just a bigger version of said creatures. Here you have a ton as this movie looks a bit like Pan's Labyrinth in the underground troll market. Ron Pearlman is still aces as Hellboy, I liked Liz better in this one and Abe Saphien plays a much bigger role as well and is fleshed out a bit more. They take away the Norton character which is fine as they replace him with someone who lets just say fits the team better. The story has a prince elf (at least I think he is an elf) who has been in self exile over the many years searching out pieces of a golden crown so he can gain control of the legendary golden army and once again wage a war on humans. There is an excellent scene involving creatures called tooth fairy's and then Hellboy gets the exposure he has always yearned for. The movie then switches to them trying to find the troll underground market where there is more action as a very big beastie is unleashed to kill Hellboy and then a humorous scene of Hellboy and Abe drinking beer. Then a rousing conclusion as we have a rare comic book movie that has a very good final battle. The humor is good, the action is good most of the movie is very good. I will say the thing between the brother and sister elves that occurred was a bit to telegraphed, however other than that this movie had very few flaws for me.",10,2,6,17 July 2008
Sleepy Hollow," One of Burton's best.
","I am not a big Tim Burton fan.  For the most part, other than this movie Batman is like the only other one he has done that I really like.  This one though he did great.  His like for darker things helps this movie be as good as it is.  This time Crane is a detective who goes to Sleepy Hollow to investigate some murders.  The atmosphere and Burton's use of colors really enhance this movie.  I also like the change in the story, as a detective is just more interesting than a schoolteacher.  Johnny Depp is great as Crane and the rest of the cast is good as well.  There is even brief appearance by Christopher Walken and horror legend Christopher Lee.  I wish Lee had a bigger role in this one.  The story is really good in this one, though near the end it is almost more of an action than a horror.  Still a good movie though.  I love what happens to the woman in the end.",8,1,1,7 March 2003
Silent Hill," Starts out very well...but it does run a bit long and it also explains to much.
","This one has music seemingly directly from the game it also has a lot of the atmosphere from the game as well, especially when you first enter Silent Hill. I was thinking, 'Wow, this has to be one of the best video game adaptations ever'. I mean they had the clues that characters would find in the game on display here, the monsters were exactly what you see in the game only more disturbing as here they are in the flesh. I was waiting for the heroine to open a random cabinet to find a shotgun or something, and maybe some ammo in a shelf, of course thankfully that did not happen. The story has a mother taking her daughter to Silent Hill in hopes that this will somehow explain her very bizarre sleepwalking behavior. Of course, for those who played the video game Silent Hill is not your ordinary little town. Upon arrival her daughter is lost, the air is full of ash, and when the siren goes off the entire town goes black and things of indescribable horror lurk in the darkness. A police officer is there as well, having followed our heroine into town and at first she is a pain, but later she is very helpful. However, the movie would have been a lot better if it did not try to explain so much. I mean in the games they didn't really explain anything about why the town itself was going crazy, usually it just explained to some extent the scenario that brought the people into town. I didn't really care for all the explaining as it narrowed it all down right to the cause of everything. Granted this made for a rather grisly climax, I still would have liked to have scene the little religious group taken out of the picture all together. I don't know I just think we needed something more out of the game for the end and less of the here is why the town and everything in it is happening. This also could have taken the movie down a few minutes as it seems to run a bit long at the end as well. Still though the movie had depth and while it wasn't the greatest movie ever, it was still very interesting to watch. Also, the cast is rather good and the scenes with Sean Bean were particularly good...I just he would have found a more vague cause.",7,1,4,25 April 2006
We Were Soldiers," Great emotional Vietnam film starring Mel Gibson.
","I saw this film at the theater and it was a totally engrossing film. My dad, who served in the Vietnam War also enjoyed it as it was not a film that made the United States troops look horrible, while this one puts them in a more positive light. Though I would also say that 'Full Metal Jacket' was a rather good movie about the Vietnam War as well. This one chronicles one battle during the conflict. I think it was like one of the first involving the Vietnamese and the U.S. military and it is a very good conflict on screen as it really keeps you on edge. You also get good performances from Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot and even Greg Kinnear. The film is very emotional as you get shots of the wife of Mel Gibson's character delivering letters to wives whose husbands are killed in battle in Vietnam. There is a little humor in the film, but much after the conflict starts which is understandable as Sam Elliot has a couple of good lines before shipping out. Like I said the battle itself is very edge of your sit type stuff, you have your drama and you have some very graphic kills as the one involving the napalm was particularly nasty. The movie shifts focus from time to time though so you are not sure at times how much time has passed in certain scenes, they also seem to ignore the fact that the M-16 rifle was not exactly a great weapon in its day, instead making it nearly flawless. Which it was when kept clean, however as my dad said if it got dirty it did not fire. Overall, though this movie was a good emotional film that deserved a bit more recognition in 2002 as I think it did not get any awards at all.",8,0,2,25 April 2010
Moana," Looks great, less fufilling
","Another film I watched while with my fiance that she picked out to watch. It was not bad and had its interesting moments and it was really nice to look at, but how many more of these messed up plot movies are we going to get? I guess a whole hell of a lot considering you smack Disney on anything and it does spectacular even when we get a story and a world where I cannot tell when things are supposed to be occurring or why things are occurring.The story has a young girl who really wants to go sailing and imagines really peppy songs while her ancestors are shown sailing. There is something about a dude who steals a jewel from an island and has a magic fishhook that allows him to be anything he wants and not sure when this happens. An older woman telling the story suggests that it happened long ago, but Maui whose power is reliant on the fishhook hasn't aged a bit since that happened. He also has tattoos that move and are supposed to be funny, but they generally miss the mark. He joins the main character Moana to return the jewel to the island and meet all sorts of strange things that are never really explained thoroughly.The film looks good and there are some funny moments and even a few catchy songs, but the story is so weak. Another in a long line of girls can do everything a guy can and be the hero, of course, in real life testosterone plays a factor and guys generally are stronger so that is why up to political correctness time men were the main protagonist in stories. Sorry, but no matter what you do, can't change biology. The demigod, Maui, of course is a lumbering oaf who does more hindering than helping, but at least he wasn't the bad guy, well I guess he sort of was...So, a very pretty film to look at, you get a few catchy tunes, but you also get the same thing we have seen in quite a few Disney films lately. Female protagonist, doofus male sidekick and a twist at the end you will see for miles before it is revealed. I'm glad Marvel has some control over its section and is hands on with the material, I do believe it is the only thing keeping those movies really good.",6,3,7,23 October 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-man comes home to the Marvel universe
","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!",10,59,115,11 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Nice end to the original trilogy.
","Though it is considered by many to be the weakest of the original three (as do I) it is still a very good movie...and a lot better than the first two of the new trilogy.  The best part of this flick is clearly the rescue of Han Solo from Jaba the Hut.  These desert scenes are great and the flick is at its best here.  We also learn of the empire, which is constructing a new Death Star.  Then the movie gets to the weaker part of the film where they go to Endor which just looks like any North American woods rather than any alien world.  And we are introduced to the ewoks who are nowhere near the pain that Jar Jar would later become.  There is also a cool space battle with Lando in command while Han leads a team to destroy a shield generator on the planet.  Luke goes and confronts Vader as well.  I like the way it looks like the good guys are losing on all three fronts, but all of them get their act together.",8,3,8,21 February 2003
The Expendables," Guess what? There is a lot of violence and explosions in this one!
","Yeah, I am being rather sarcastic, anyone who could not figure this one was going to be explosive most likely does not watch all that many movies. In the end, I have to say it was a good movie, about what I expected. A team of mercenaries is hired to assassinate a general on an island in the Gulf. Things are not as they seem though as Sylvester Stallone's character feels bad that the daughter of the general did not leave with him and his buddy as they did a reconnaissance mission before the entire team left for the island. The action is really good, my only real complaint is the use of computer gore effects instead of the good old blood packs and other nifty tricks to make the mess a bit more splatty. Sylvester, Jason Stathan, Jet Li all do a rather good job, wish they featured Li a bit more considering he is one of the top billed characters. The best performance came from Dolph Lundgren. He is not the best actor or anything, but in certain roles he shines and he does so here as a member of Stallone's team that gets kicked off because he is becoming to unstable. The rest of the cast is good too and it was fun seeing Arnold, Bruce and Stallone together in a scene...most likely the last time that is going to happen so even if their scene was a tad pointless in some ways it was still fun. Stallone has shown a real knack for bringing back the hard action movie of the 80's and he does a good job here. If he just used real blood for gore effects I would have given it a nine.",8,5,9,26 November 2010
Blade II," Pretty Cool
","This was one action-packed thrill ride.  Though I would say I liked it about the same as the first one even though it had more action, the first one had a better plot.  Though I understood everything and did not find any of the plot twists to confusing or anything like a lot of others complain about. The darker setting is very cool and the European setting makes this movie have a Gothic setting.  It is a combination of the very old and new that gives this film great atmosphere.  The plot is there is a new breed of vampire on the streets and normal vampires need Blade's help in disposing of them, but can he really trust them.  I highly recommend this flick.",10,7,9,15 April 2002
Alien," The alien movie that started it all.
","This movie is sort of like another science fiction movie that had the same basic premise from the 50's or 60's, but this one really set off a lot of alien movies and copycats from somewhat good ones, to a whole bunch of bad ones made by the Italians and Roger Corman. Of course, of the alien movies that are in this Alien series my favorite is Aliens as that one was just totally cool. This one though is by far the best horror of the four movies. Has great moments and great atmosphere and has all the elements needed to be a great horror movie. Do not know which I like better though as a horror movie this or John Carpenter's 'The Thing' both being movies that can show others out there how to make a good horror movie. This one has a mining vessel searching a planet that has what appears to be some sort of alien vessel on it. Writing this review now I can easily see where the video game 'Dead Space' got a lot of its plot. Well it is not to long that some sort of alien lifeform attaches itself to one of the crew and refuses to let go or to even let anyone tamper with it. That is okay it falls off and dies in a bit and that is where the fun starts. I will not go into how, but now stalking the crew of this mining vessel is one deadly creature capable of killing nice and quickly. There are other parts to the plot, but I do not wish to ruin them for those few out there that have not yet seen this fine flick. The monster is done by costume for the most part and it looks better than any computer monster done these days. So for a complete horror experience try either this movie or The Thing.",9,2,5,14 July 2009
Suicide Squad," In some bizarre way, this film just clicked for me...
","I had heard that the reviews for this film were less than stellar so I was not sure what to expect. The reviews for Batman V Superman were not so good either, but I enjoyed that one and I am happy to say I enjoyed this one too. In fact, I thought it was more enjoyable than Batman V Superman. I cannot explain why, but it just really worked for me for some completely unknown and strange reason. Perhaps, it simply worked well with the myriad of mental issues I have and it blended well to form some sort of connection with my warped brain. I just do not know, but I am glad I enjoyed it as I took a gamble to see it in theaters and I would hate to shell out money for tickets and not like it. Not only did I like it, but the other two people I was with enjoyed it as well. It was not without its problems, which is why I give it a nine rather than a ten, but most of the issues are in the opening portion of the film. Once the squad is together and in the field the movie is off and running and it is nearly nonstop action the rest of the way.The story starts out with a woman with a plan to bring together a team of meta humans and those with special skills to combat any threat from a superhuman. Basically, it picks up where Batman V Superman left off and Superman is dead so not only is he not around anymore there is always the chance that another like him turns up and perhaps this one will not be as friendly. Well, we are introduced to the candidates who are criminals for the most part. There is Deadshot, an assassin for hire, Harley Quinn the Joker's insane partner in crime, Killer Croc, Diablo master of flames, Boomerang and a mysterious woman who is possessed by a being known as the Enchantress. Well that last one turns out to be a huge mistake as she releases her brother and together they hatch a plan to take over the world. The team of criminals are assembled and forced to help a special teams unit as in Escape From New York and are led by Rick Flagg who is joined by a girl named Katana. They must enter the city and retrieve someone important, but the Joker is tracking their movements as he tries to take Harley back! The actors and actresses all do a good job. I especially enjoyed Will Smith's Deadshot as he is probably one of the few people that can make an assassin for hire a sympathetic character. I also enjoyed Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. A lot of people have been complaining about the amount of screen time Jared Leto's Joker received, but I thought how was presented worked as he is not a member of the team, he is just someone trying to get his girlfriend back and does so in strange ways. He was almost like Micheal Keaton as Beetlejuice, not really in the film for very long, but he made an impact any time he was on screen. The main problem I had with the film was the first portion of the film as it was at times, a bit hard to follow. The characters are introduced, but then it flashes here and there; however, this stops once the team is dispatched and after that it is almost all action the rest of the way.So it was not a perfect film and from all the negative reviews it is not going to be a beloved film by everyone. That being said I really enjoyed it. The music clicked for me, the characters clicked for me and the action was great and kept me entertained. That is all I can ask for. It also sets up next year's Justice League film which I saw a trailer for and it sadly had almost the same amount of humor in it than the entirety of Batman V Superman. The trailer was like two minutes long so that should say something. This film, too, had some more comedy and at the same time dark so it melded really well. I would love to see these characters turn up again in another Suicide Squad film or in other films in the DC movie universe as they really made the film work for me.",9,32,53,8 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," My favorite of the post Avengers films so far
","Of course, who is to say that I will not like Guardians of the Galaxy more, but of this, the second Thor film and Iron Man 3, this is so far my favorite film since the first Avengers released. Iron Man 3 was good, but relied a lot more on comedy and felt at times separate from the rest of the Marvel universe. Thor delved a bit more into Asgard, but something about it seemed somewhat low budget. Captain America, though, felt like part of the larger Marvel universe as it dropped names, had multiple characters other than Cap and had the best villains in the Winter Soldier and an organization long thought defeated. So this one felt like a big movie where the action and story were on par with the scope of the Avengers movie. Though, that may just be me, mind you.The story, Captain America is assisting the Shield organization. Something though is not right and Captain America tires of working for Fury, feeling that Fury is up to something and hiding things from him. A boat mission confirms these fears as the Black Widow seems to have a different mission than the rest of the team. Soon, Nick Fury is targeted and a mysterious villain emerges to rival Captain America in the Winter Soldier and Captain America and the Black Widow must team up to learn the truth of this mysterious foe and learn what mysterious organization seems to be controlling Shield.Good stuff here as Chris Pine is doing a great job as Captain America and since this is his movie he gets to show audiences his skill set as they overshadowed him a bit in the Avengers film. A nice plot here, but anyone who has read the comics are has a basic knowledge of the comics will know the identity of the Winter Soldier before the big reveal. I like the organization behind everything though, as I was not quite expecting it, but then again, seeing as how it is Captain America I should not be too surprised.So the action in this film is great, but that is not too surprising. I was surprised at how well the story flowed and I am also happy to announce that the 3D was pretty good too. Though, this is only the second film I have seen in 3D since that craze resurfaced. The only other film I have seen in 3D other than this is the second Ghost Rider film, and well anything is going to look better than that I guess. I like the direction this film took and I am interested to see how the events that unfolded here will affect the next Avengers film. Though before that, I must see The Guardians of the Galaxy, though from the looks of it, not sure if it will have any impact on the next Avengers film. This one though was a great action thrill ride.",9,2,6,16 April 2014
Over the Top," This movie is more than just arm wrestling...it would have to be wouldn't it?
","Yes, if the movie was just arm wrestling it would be kind of hard to make the entire movie revolve around it and still be motion picture length. So how do you fill the rest of the time up, you add the touching story of a man trying to reunite with the son he left for his mother and grandfather to raise long ago. A plot straight from the lifetime movie channel that makes all the growling and yelling at the arm wrestling tournament all the more stupid. The saving grace of this movie is the rather good soundtrack. The music is good and saves this otherwise to sappy and overemotional movie. The arm wrestling tournament at the end is full of colorful characters, but they are not really delved into because we are busy trying to have the son driving to the matches to see his dad and they can have the sappy reunion. We get lots of arguing between father and son, mother and grandfather, grandfather and father this and that and we get a big migraine. Perhaps this is to better distract us from things that happen in the matches such as Hawks (Stallone's character) being in the perfect grid to face Bull Hurley in the final showdown or other strange occurrences like the fact Bull never seemed beaten at any time on his road to the finals. Of course, this type of movie is kind of Sylvestor's type is it not? He had Rocky and some other sports themed movie about wrestling that is not quite as well known. To bad he did not make more like that cop one he did with Billy Dee Williams, now that one was good.",3,2,5,10 March 2009
Doctor Strange," The Doctor is in!
","I enjoyed this film, but then again I thought I would. I've always been interested in the world of Dr. Strange since I am a huge Marvel fan. His world is one where the threats to Earth are of a more indirect nature and sometimes things that are hidden in the darkness lurk just out of sight, planning on bringing the darkness to our world! So not a typical hero movie as there are elements of other films in here such as The Matrix and Constantine as the film does revolve around a shifting of reality and darker dimensions full of unspeakable things that wish to destroy or enslave the world.The story has a neurosurgeon, Doctor Strange, getting into a car accident where his hands end up shaking badly and all but useless in his particular field. He tries to do experimental surgeries, but they all fail. He finally ends up going to a foreign land where he hopes to find a person who apparently helped a man walk again. What he finds himself in, is the world of mystics and sorcerers. He becomes the student of the ancient one and soon his unrealized talents begin to quickly develop. Unfortunately, another former student of the ancient one is trying to use pages stolen out of a book to gain the powers of the dark universe where a creature named Dormammu lurks and wishes to have the earth and all its people! I enjoyed the film, but I have seen others who have not liked the film. Which is fine, but seriously, if you do not know the source material and do not pay attention, that is kind of on you. I read one review where the person complains that Strange defeats the more experienced sorcerer; apparently, they missed the fact Stephen has a natural knack for using magic and in the comics he becomes the sorcerer supreme. Also, that was an infinity stone he used to win the day and those are actually Beyonders in infantile state and a Beyonder is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.So, the film was a fun little distraction while it lasted. It was nice to see it wrap up in under two hours, these days every comic film usually goes like two hours and twenty minutes. This one felt fast and that is a good thing. Sometimes films tend to drag when they go on for too long. I thought the film had some cool special effects and was a nice start to the more mystical side of the Marvel universe. It is also accompanied by two scenes during the credits and both were pretty good. They both actually lead into other films, whereas the scenes from the latest Guardians of the Galaxy film tended to be more of a comedic nature. I look forward into delving into this strange universe more in the future.",9,0,0,9 July 2017
Full Metal Jacket," Almost a tale of two movies. One training, the other Vietnam.
","I have to say I am not the biggest Kubrick fan. Not really against him or anything, but I have actually seen very few films by him. In fact, other than this one, the only other film of his I have seen is 'The Shining' so of these two my experiences have been mostly positive. This film starts out great in my opinion with a well organized basic training section. You get to meet new recruits as they get their head shaved, then you get to see what a Marine has to go through to be a Marine and suffice to say there is no way I could do what they do. Not only do you have a crazed Sergent constantly yelling at you and demoralizing you, I just could not handle the sleeping quarters and all that comes with basic training as I have social anxiety problems so I most likely would try to get away or off myself. I would not do what the one guy does here though. The second half of the film is a bit weaker and not as strong plot wise as the first part. This may have been done on purpose as to depict the Vietnam war as disorganized and chaotic and if that is the case it is done well. Just not enough plot structure for my tastes in this section of the film, still good, it just can not quite rise to the level of the first portion of the film. The acting is even though throughout the movie so that helps in the rather uneven Vietnam section of the movie.",8,2,2,21 June 2010
Pacific Rim," If I had seen this as a child, I would have messed myself because of the excitement
","There were certain things I enjoyed as a child. One was giant monster movies such as Godzilla and another were giant robots. So this movie would have been right up my alley. It still is something I wanted to see as it is also very anime like in the way it plays out. It has an anime inspired look and also add the Guillermo Del Toro factor and you end up with one very cool action movie featuring giant mechanized robots fighting huge monsters that were even given the name they have in Japan, Kaiju. Granted, it was not perfect as the look of the film was spectacular and the action grand, the story just was a bit to by the numbers and the acting at time serviceable and at other times a bit like they were not being directed to do nothing more than to open and close their mouths. Still, Del Toro is more of a visual director in my view as I enjoy the first two Blade films equally, liking the first one's story better, but liking the overall style and look of the second better (Del Toro's).The story has the earth under assault. Some sort of rift has appeared in the Pacific Ocean and huge beasts are coming through causing havoc. At first, it is believed to be an isolated incident, but it turns out that these things keep coming. The earth reacts by building huge robots called Jaegers to combat this monsters. The Jaegers turn the tide momentarily, but the monsters that come through keep getting bigger and adapt their fighting style. A man who used to partner with his brother, piloting a Jaeger called the Gypsy Danger is working on a wall that is being erected to stop the Kaiju as the Jaegers and their pilots are being killed at an ever increasing rate. This man lost his brother and now is asked to team up and pilot the Gypsy Danger for one more mission to close the rift and stop the Kaiju from entering our world.Like I said, the film has great visuals and that is the star of the piece. So much so that I still give the film a nine despite the many flaws with the story. The robots look good and the monster pretty cool too as one of the monsters near the end even sprouts wings and resembles the Gamera nemesis Gyaos. However, I wish they did a bit more to make the monsters look a bit more distinct as the robots look all different, but the monsters tended to resemble one another. Still, there are some great fights and as I said with a Del Toro film it is usually the visuals that are the highlight and they do not disappoint here.So a fun movie to watch, at one point the pilot of the Gypsy Danger activates a rocket on the arm to make the robot punch harder and I was thinking 'Rocket Punch!' from an anime I had seen as a kid. If they could have added a bit more humor to the film it would have been a near perfect film for me. The ending was a bit to predictable too. Overall, the experience was satisfying and I am a bit sad to see this film not doing better at the box office here as I would love to see a sequel mainly due to curiosity in how it would play out. So a very nice film, to bad it did not come out when I was younger.",9,8,13,28 July 2013
Rocky II," And Apollo said he did not want a rematch.
","Of course, I find it understandable that he wanted one and he had the quick turn around from the first movie. As soon as that fight was over the media started hounding him and he knew the only way to exorcise the demons as it were was to destroy Rocky in the ring. So basically, we have Rocky getting endorsement deals and some cash from the fight in the last movie not really wanting to fight again as Apollo did a real number on one of his eyes that he is almost blind in it. Unfortunately, Rocky is not to good with commercials and the money starts to run out quickly. Take also into account that Adrien is pregnant, however she is opposed to him getting into the ring as well. Well this and that happens and Rocky agrees to the rematch and Mickey is once again training the Italian Stallion. Mickey also has a strategy, to protect the bad eye from further damage and to throw Apollo off his game he is going to make Rocky fight right handed, then when the timing is right let him revert back to being left handed to really throw Apollo. More stuff happens including the birth of Rocky's son and a close call with Adrien and then the fight is on. The fight is not quite as realistic as the first one as this time Apollo was prepared and he was the heavy weight champion of the world. He really should have leveled Rocky...however, that would not have made good cinema and the ending was pretty tense there for a bit.",7,0,1,7 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Old veteran actor versus muppet!!!
","Yes, when the highlight of the film is an aged Christopher Lee battling a little green dude who really is not there the movie is just not a winner. Wisely, Lucas pulled back the usage of Jar Jar and replaced the young Anakin Skywalker with another actor. However, the movie is not much better than the last film and has way to many groan inducing scenes involving Anakin and Amidale who is now a senator as the planet she is from obviously has serious flaws in the way its government is structured. This one starts out with an assassination attempt on Amidale and great scenes like those Lucas ripped right out of the film 'The Fifth Element' and had people selling death sticks (oh, what a clever jab at the tobacco trade). This film offers nothing new in the way of establishing a decent plot, other than the brief mention of the clone wars from the original Star Wars film. The guy they got to play Anakin was rather bad at his lines and was even stiffer than Ewan though I really think Ewan's main problem is that he did not want to really be in these films. We also get the origins of Bubba Fett as a guy who had less than ten minutes screen time in the original trilogy really needed a whole section of the movie dedicated to how he came about. Really this should show movie makers do not make scenes based on the fans wishes. Sure for some reason Bubba had his fans, but in the end his character was not important enough to merit this much attention. The only thing more stupid was making C-3PO a creation of Anakin even though he was a widely recognized protocol droid in the original series and adding Chewbacca for the heck of it in the final film in this rather badly written trilogy. There are scenes here and there that are good though (though not any scene where Anakin and Amidale are acting cutesy). Then Christopher Lee comes in and acts rings around everyone else and has the most entertaining fight in the movie as he takes on Yoda. So in the end, a rather sad attempt at trying to write a story around characters that were never really important to begin with and trying to set up a bit of Anakin's switch to the dark side.",4,1,3,7 June 2010
Forrest Gump," The movie works overall, but like a box of chocolates there are way to many bad pieces here and there.
","This movie had its humorous moments, but with that came way to many sappy scenes and suffice to say I did not love this movie. Nothing I hated, but nothing I try to watch when I see it on the television either. The story revolves around the character of the title Forrest Gump of course. It basically goes through different parts of his life and shows how a very simple man led a rather astonishing life. A rather unrealistic life filled with a bit to much melodrama for my tastes. I can see why others like this movie, but once again just not really my type of movie. Tom Hanks is good in the lead role and I also thought Gary Sinese was good in his role too, however I did not care for the character of Jenny as she just ticked me off to no end. The film is also better in some places than other as the film really has a rather disjointed feel to it. It goes from here to there and is not hard to follow at times though it just feels like a patchwork movie. The Vietnam portion of the film to me was the highlight, here the comedy was good and even the drama worked too. Other sections of the film at times just felt to underdeveloped. Here is Forrest entering college, now he is done two minutes later, here is Forrest playing ping pong, now he is back Washington D.C. at a black panther party. Like I said it has its moments, but for me it was a bit to all over the place like they tried to get everything that was in the book up on screen. And as short as some of this segments were you then have a rather lengthy scene of just him running, though that one was rather good even though it was simple. I will never see how this film beat out 'True Lies' for the best special effects Oscar, I was not overly impressed with the scenes Forrest was inserted in as it simply looked like they animated the mouths of those he was supposed to be meeting and they sort of stuck him in there using file footage of John F. Kennedy for example. I just thought it was just a bit better technique used than that of a Steve Martin film 'Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid'. Overall it was okay, but just not going to be in my personal top 100 movies of all time.",6,2,5,8 July 2010
Ant-Man," Ant-man bursts onto the big screen, then shrinks...
","Finally able to watch this Marvel movie and now I am all caught up again as far as films in the Marvel universe are concerned. After watching it though, I have to say I wish I had seen this one on the big screen and in 3D as it looks like some of the scenes would have looked really good in 3D. For reasons I cannot remember now though, I never got around to seeing it, and it took me awhile to finally catch it on DVD. This is mainly due to the fact Disney always charges high prices for all their films which is kind of the downside to them owning any movie property as they, like the gaming company Nintendo does also, will almost never drop the price of their merchandise. Fortunately, a friend let me borrow it and I have to say the film was really good. I would say that it is more action than comedy, but there are a lot of funny scenes in this one. The action is pretty good too and it was nice seeing Michael Douglas in a significant role. They always manage to nab a solid actor for their films, like Robert Redford in Captain America: Winter Soldier. This film was a nice way to end the night as I watched another film that was good today too, but the ending was a downer.The story has a convict trying to reform his ways which proves to be difficult because he is friends who only seem to know how to do crimes. Meanwhile, Dr. Hank Pym is shocked to learn that a man he once mentored is close to replicating his invention, a substance that can close or expand the molecules between atoms. Thus, it can cause things to grow and shrink. Dr. Pym even has suit that allows this to happen without any adverse effects on the wearer as long term exposure to the agent seems to cause neurological damage and it is becoming evident that the man he mentored is experiencing these problems. Pym enlists the aid of the convict much to the dismay of Pym's daughter that wishes to use the suit herself to grab the Yellow Jacket suit. One that the man Pym once mentored wishes to sell to the highest bidder once he has perfected the shrinking agent.The movie was really good as was the cast and Marvel continues making really good films. I actually like this film more than the Avengers: Age of Ultron as it was different. That film felt familiar to me, as the layout of the film mirrored the first Avenger film a bit too much. This one just felt fresher to me than that film. The next Captain America also looks to be better than the previous Avengers film and more epic as well. This one was not really epic, more of a fun action film that one would expect considering the hero in it. They did change things around, but it is just par for the course, every comic film changes a few things. Here the main thing is Pym is no longer the one who is in the Ant-man costume during the film, but he did use it in the past.So another very good Marvel film and now I am all caught up and ready to see Captain America: Civil War. Though, this film was not really necessary for that film other than a couple of scenes here and there. It was cool seeing Falcon in a small role, but I guess his role was larger than Ant-man's! Ha! The film is set up to have a sequel and the daughter looks like she is going to be taking on a role herself. I kind of guessed that she might, but was not entirely sure until the scene once the credits role. The one really good thing about watching these movies on DVD is that I do not have to sit through a ton of credits to get to an extra scene or two. No, with a DVD I can just speed through them! So another fun Marvel film that sets up yet another hero in their universe.",9,0,3,28 March 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America is a super soldier in a rather super film
","I see over the years the score has lowered here on IMDb, but to me the film is still a very good origin story. I enjoyed it more than Thor that was released the same year; however, the other two Captain America films would be better than this one. Of course they would be as there is more action and such, but for an origin story it does alright. The main problem with the film is that it is so well done at first, the second half almost seems a bit rushed. Not bad mind you, just like they were running out of time or something. That being said it did have a really cool battle between hero and villain at the end. This would be the fifth and final Marvel film leading up to the Avengers and basically where Disney took over pretty much all the Marvel films. This is good and bad as now all the films seem to have the same flow, but at the same time, you did get a bit more unique experience when different filming companies were doing them.The story has a team during the present finding a huge airship at the North Pole. Then the film turns back the clock to World War II where a team of Nazis known as Hydra bursts into a cathedral where the head Hydra agent, Schmidt finds an object of immense power. Over on the US side a man by the name of Steve Rogers is being declared 4F by the military again as he keeps trying to enlist in the army. He and friend Bucky go to the Stark expo of the time and instead of enjoying himself, he wishes to try and enlist again. This time a doctor with some clout sees him and gets him into the army in a super soldier program. Soon he is chosen to be the first super soldier, but unfortunately, he is the only one as the good doctor is killed by a Hydra agent. Captain America is born and at first is stuck doing promos and such to help boost of the sale of bonds and enlistment, but once he learns that his friend was in a group of infantry men demolished by Hydra he goes to the rescue. During the rescue he meets Schmidt who has taken on the persona of the Red Skull due to the serums gruesome effect on his face and the two race towards a final confrontation as Captain America and a group of troops destroy the Hydra bases one by one.The film is good and a large part has to do with the casting as Chris Evans does a very good job as Captain America. He is completely different from when he did the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four films. Tommy Lee Jones is also good in his role as a cranky colonel who even when he warms up to Rogers still remains the same. Hugo Weaving though was totally excellent as the Red Skull and I do not see anyone else doing as well as he did in the role. Which also saddens me because he has yet to turn up in another Captain America film. I thought for sure he would be in the second Captain America or something.So, I enjoyed this film a lot. Though once again, after a certain point the film seems a bit rushed to me. Basically, after Captain America saves the prisoners and then gets his trademark shield this occurs where we only see a few clips of battles and things going on. Even the infiltration of the last base seems a bit rushed. One wanders when Captain America and Agent Carter had time to develop feelings for one another during this stretch. Still, the final fight on the huge airship is cool and it ends nicely as it sets up the Avengers film.",8,2,3,21 August 2017
Top Secret!," The best spoofs...
","are usually the ones with plots of their own.  This one is such a spoof and it is very funny.  You don't have to see any movies to find this funny either.  You just have to have seen parts of an Elvis movie over the years or saw a scene or two from an old espionage flick.  You don't have to watch an entire movie to get the jokes.  Val Kilmer is very funny here as is all the cast.  The jokes are great even with some of them being a bit dated. The resistance group is great, the escape, everything in here is really funny.  After 'Airplane' this one ranks right up there with the best spoof movies made.",8,40,48,23 April 2003
Predator," One of Arnold's best.
","This one has soldiers attacking a base of rebels or terrorist or something. After they hit the base though the fun begins as this creature from outer space is tracking them through the thick jungles.  It kills them one by one, hunting them.  The army men led by Arnold try to set traps for the creature, but no matter what they do the creature always is one step ahead and one tough critter.  The fact that this movie was such a hit is a bit of a surprise...in fact how good it was is a surprise too.  They had so much trouble shooting this one, almost all the predator shots had to be done again as the original Predator looked really bad...it was played by Jean Claude Van Dame.  They got a really tall actor to take his place and it worked a lot more as this one towers over Arnold and made the final fight great.  The design of the monster's face changed a lot too, as the original looked really stupid, more like a mosquito or something from a bad science fiction movie of the 50's.  In the end though this one turned out great and the finale is one of the best.  Arnold facing off against a giant, ugly, super space alien hunter.",8,2,4,26 March 2003
L√©on: The Professional," Cops are the bad guys here.
","This film was a rather good film that features a professional hit-man. You see this man do his job with deadly precision at the start of the flick then you learn a bit about his life. He is a simple man, who needs little. Well in the apartment complex he lives in is a family and the father of said family has run afoul of a dirty cop, played by Gary Oldman. Well this family is pretty much wiped out from the father to the wife and the young son, only the daughter survives and this is only because Leon, the hit-man, lets her into his home. This professional hit-man is played by the always interesting Jean Reno who I believed played the character in the foreign and original version of this movie (I think it was a French film). You have some humorous scenes of Leon teaching the orphaned girl how to clean (his term for knocking someone off). He tells her how one goes from long range to short range that you are truly great when you become adept at the close range. Though with all this you know that sooner or later the men who killed the girl's family are going to get back into play and you end up with a very explosive finale. The movie runs quickly and is entertaining. The acting is good and adds to the film, I did not really like the ending, but I kind of knew it was heading that way. Enjoyable film that really has good action and a pretty good story too.",8,1,1,15 February 2011
Bird Box," Not a rip off of Quiet Place people...
","A Quiet Place was released in 2018, early in the year. This film was released the same year and its production started in October of 2017 and it is also based off a book from 2014 so no, this was not ripping off Quiet Place and if you think so, you are kind of dense thinking that a movie can be thrown together so quickly within a year and you don't bother to read anything otherwise you would know it was based off a book that predates Quiet Place. I have not seen Quiet Place, but I do want to, but I actually did minimal research to discover the origin of this film had nothing to do with that one as they were already in the works to making this film prior to even the book release back in 2013! If anything, Quiet Place may have stolen a couple of ideas from the novel this film is based on. Now what the film is much more like is The Happening, but with a much better thing causing people to take their own lives.The story starts out as two sisters are about to visit the doctor as one of them is pregnant and not to thrilled about it. They see on the news that there is something going on in Russia where people are claiming their own lives. Well it quickly moves in and soon they are fleeing amid mass suicides as it appears that the ones who kill themselves see something that causes their abnormal behavior. One sister sees it and takes her life leaving behind the pregnant one played by Sandra Bullock. She is helped into a house where the people are smart enough to close the windows as it is clear something is seen before the urge to kill oneself occurs. They try to figure out what to do while at times we are taken ahead years in time as Sandra's character is now in charge of two kids and is trying to make her way down a river to a place offering safe haven.While the film is not a ripoff of Quiet Place, it is also not perfect and suffers many flaws and questions. I figure the things they are seeing are demons as only something like that could possess a person and cause them to do the whole suicide thing and I can see a demon not being able to enter a house kind of like a vampire not being able to unless invited (in the book they apparently could enter houses). This was not one of the problems for me, but one thing that was, was the way the film played out. It starts by showing Sandra and the two kids thereby telegraphing that all is not going to go well at the house and that pretty much everyone is going to die. I also wanted to see the demons, but the only way we could have seen them is if the main protagonist had seen them and quite frankly, they probably would have been disappointing had they been seen. The ending was a bit too happy and still leaves one with questions too.So, this was a pretty good Netflix original film. Certainly better than Open House and another one I saw about a haunted school, but I think I still give The Ritual the edge as far as best Netflix original horror film that I have seen. That one provided more atmosphere and tension than did this one. Still, it was entertaining for what it was.",7,1,8,15 January 2019
American Pie," This is considered funny, why exactly?
","I never watched this film back in the day, I never found the trailers all that funny for it. My fiance told me how funny it was so she pulled it up on Netflix and we began watching it. It had an opening that was sort of amusing, a disgusting scene involving a beer, a completely retarded scene involving a pie and a bunch of losers trying to lose their virginity. Wow, what a concept! Like there has never been a film like that in the 80's or several of them! Suffice to say, by the end, I haven't laughed much at all and my fiance was baffled as to why she found it funny back in the day. The story, why four guys want to lose their virginity. One of them is a jock who tries to lose it with a college chick, but she doesn't go for it. One has a hot girlfriend who gives him oral and not understanding why he really cares and two are just losers. We get to watch them try different techniques to get girls like joining a jazz choir or having a girl come to your house, but you'd rather send a crappy feed to your friends than try to take advantage of the situation. Seriously, this crap makes that Tom Cruise flick 'Losing It' seem really great by comparison.So there isn't much in this film I found funny. The whole pie scene which is kind of this films big laugh scene is completely moronic. Why the hell would someone do what the character did to that pie!?! Like his family isn't going to notice it gone? The beer scene was just gross as all get out and not funny and none of the characters are likable. They are like Friday the 13th victims to me, hence, I would be rooting for Jason to kill them horribly! So this film was a huge success and made lots of money back in the day. I do not understand why, other than people have very differing taste as to what is funny than I have. The actors in this film all were retched human beings and Eugene Levy as the father was moronic and I usually like Eugene Levy. This would go on to spawn several sequels, but near the end they were pretty much direct to DVD fare as like a lot of comedy franchises it got wore out quick. You can only do so much with the same characters. I missed this film back in the day and I am wishing I had missed it now and never saw it.",3,1,9,10 February 2018
Watchmen," Good movie, but certain parts of the film seemed to keep me in the dark.
","This movie was really quite enjoyable...its long runtime was a no issue for me. The main problem I had with this film is that I have never read the graphic novel that it is based on and certain parts of the film had me going 'huh, what, who?'. Do not get me wrong though, still a good movie and I got it enough that I was not totally lost or anything. The movie starts with a bang with the murder of a former superhero known as the Comedian. Well not to super as you will see through flashbacks this guy was a bit brutal, yet he also seemed to get it in ways most do not. He was the Comedian, a punchline of the American people almost a caricature of its worst. Through the story you meet others from the days of superheros as for some reason they are outlawed during the time of this world a strange 1985 parallel world where Nixon is the president still and the world is on the brink of a global nuclear war that would seemingly end most life. The only thing that seems to prevent this is one of America's strongest superheros a person who is seemingly close to being a god, Dr. Manhattan. Well he and another former superhero, Ozymandias is trying to create a limitless amount of fuel that would help rid the need for war. Well the death of the Comedian does not sit well with another superhero known as Rorschach who is a rather brutal hero in the same mold as the Punisher. He warns Nightowl, and Dr. Manhattan and his girl the Silk Specter. Through all this you know all is not as it seems and you are heading to some strange revelations at the end. Good action scenes as I loved watching the opening battle and the Rorschach prison escape...actually I loved everything about him being in prison as he was by far my favorite character cause even though he seemed the weakest of the bunch he still persevered and even though he seemed a tad off he still kept to his principles. Suffice to say I did not care for the ending to much. However, this was a very fun ride and my main complaints come from the fact this movie could have actually used a longer runtime. There was this cat that was with Ozymandias that came out of nowhere and talking to some who have read the novel was actually a lot more developed. I wanted to know why superhero vigilantes were banned as well. I have so many other stuff I wish they had developed as Ozymandias is almost a no show in the movie especially in the flashback scenes, I would have liked to see him in action as a superhero. So I liked it for the most part, I do want to read the graphic novel that I am told is a lot better than the movie.",8,1,4,23 March 2009
Justice League," Not sure why this film is being so criticized
","I went into this film with low expectations. Batman vs Superman was okay to me, but it did have a bunch of nonsensical stuff in it and did tend to drag setting up the main event. Then add to that, the fact this one is not exactly going over well with critics and other people and I was expecting a train wreck on the screen, but I still thought I would give it a shot as I have enjoyed Henry Cavill's Superman and I did want to see how he was brought back in. Suffice to say, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the film. I am also surprised by the negativity this film is getting as it seemed well done to me. It was not perfect, but I had a really good time watching it and I thought it was better than Wonder Woman, which I enjoyed as well, but did not get why it was so praised as it played out like your typical origin story. This one is being trashed when it was a fun super hero team film, so what, does DC and Warner Brothers just not have the money to bribe reviewers like Disney does? Does the general public do everything they are told or what? I will be the first to say that I am more of a Marvel hero fan all the way, as I did enjoy Thor: Ragnarok more than this one, but this one was not all that far behind. That is, not to me it was not and my parents both enjoyed it as well and neither were super fond of Batman vs Superman.The story has Superman perished and the world kind of falling apart. Batman battles this strange creature that senses fear and he fears some sort of invasion is imminent due to material he has recovered from Lex Luther. He feels he must get a team together of super humans to try and defy the odds and beat back the threat which is a being known as Steppenwolf. This being strikes at the Amazons first and then the Atlanteans as he gathers these cubes together in an attempt to convert Earth into something else entirely. Soon the team of Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg battle the threat head on, but it seems readily apparent to Batman that more is needed and thus he begins to hatch a plan to revive the man of steel.I enjoyed the film, kind of wish I did not as I am sure I am going to take flack for it. The heroes were done really well as Ben Affleck's Batman was good as was Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. I enjoyed the Flash as he added some great humor to the flick and I liked how they did Cyborg as well. I was a bit skeptical of Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, but I thought he did a good job as well. The one that blew me away the most was Henry Cavill's Superman as he seemed the most like Superman in this one than in his other two appearances. He kicked some major butt in this film suffice to say! So, I enjoyed the film. I was expecting it to be a complete mess, but I thought the story was pretty easy to follow. The film had more light moments than did Batman vs Superman and it had a lot more action too. It also accomplished both feats while being a shorter movie than Batman vs Superman. Once again though it was not perfect as I thought the film could have used more Superman; however, due to his limited use it does make the scenes he is in more awesome. Not sure they will create any more DC films due to the fact this one does not seem to be lighting the box office on fire, which seems a shame as to me they seem to be doing a good job with their films. I would love to see Darkseid in a Justice League film, but at least I finally got to see Superman really be Superman!",9,1,4,21 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Never read the book, but loved the movie!
","I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater, all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights, magic and monsters.  I was not disappointed.  It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well.  I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended.  I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick.  That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it.  If you want to see a great movie, one that delivers where so many have promised, but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book.  And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie, just don't give anything away about the next two parts.",10,1,2,7 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," More enjoyable than Reloaded, but still not the original.
","Let me start off by saying I didn't like Reloaded all that much.  In fact, other than a couple of scenes I didn't like it much at all.  This one, however, I found to be very enjoyable.  I was looking for a couple of hours of diversion and I got it.  This one picks up where the last left off; thank goodness there was no recap.  Neo is in a comatose state and the machines are close to Zion.  What ensues after a somewhat slow start is a great battle and one heck of a finishing fight.  Not as many speeches in this one, and thank God there was no rave scene or anything like that in this one. Morpheus kind of takes a back seat in this one and that helps as he has less time to make dramatic speeches, actually Neo isn't in a lot of this one either.  Still it works cause the battle between the squid robots and the people is really cool.  The humans use these cool machines that are reminiscent of the loaders in the movie 'Aliens' except they have guns. Agent Smith is also back and he is close to taking over not only the matrix, but also all of the machines.  This sets up an incredible fight that reminds me of a fight in the anime DragonBall Z.  In fact this movie makes me excited about that movie, cause I can see they can do fighting right in that one.  It also makes me excited about Spiderman 2 as those tentacles on the squid robot look like his arms would.  And those machines the humans were using make me look forward to the Transformers live action movie.  Are all the questions answered?  No, but some of those questions should have never been brought up in Reloaded to begin with cause they were only used to try to make it seem more complicated than it was.  This movie was simply more of an action movie, which is probably why it turned some off, but I liked it. I gave Reloaded a 4, but I give this one a 7, it is not without its flaws, but overall this one did not disappoint me.",7,4,8,8 November 2003
Man of Steel," Man of Steel manages to finally give Superman an action filled movie to reside in
","I was skeptical when I had first heard of this film, even more so when I learned of Zod being the villain of the piece. I thought they were going to make the same mistake they had done during Superman's previous movie and simply copy one of the first two Superman films. Superman Returns was a rehash of the first film, and I feared this would end up being a rehash of the second despite the casting of a new Superman and a new director. To many times directors and producers fear doing something different, so they rather copy the success of previous movies and such. Well, they did not do that here and they finally managed to give me the Superman film I have been waiting my life for. I was never impressed with the Donner films, the first a high budget film that focused mainly on Superman's flight ability. The second had its moments, but rushed the relationship between Louis and Superman in a way even the comic book had not gone to at that point in time. Superman III was just goofy, but had some charm to it as I liked dark Superman and Clark fighting and I actually though Robert Vaughn's character was more Lex Lutherish than Lex Luther himself. The less said about IV the better and then as I said, Returns was just a remake. Here we are finally given a Superman film, filled with action, more than probably those five films mentioned combined! The story goes over the early stuff and how Superman came to this planet. More detail is given to his back story here as the scenes on Krypton are amazing. Zod, himself, is given more back story and his character better developed in this section than he was in both Donner films. All I know of the Zod there is that he orders his minions to break crystals, he hates Jor El and that he wishes the son of Jor El to kneel before him. Soon we are taken to Earth as a young Clark Kent tries to cope with his powers and find out who he really is. Unfortunately, things are rushed as Zod makes his way to Earth. He seems to only want Clark Kent, however, he has sinister plans for Earth. Clark Kent will have to use his unnatural abilities to try and counter Zod and his forces, but can one man stand up to an army of super powered warriors?The casting was good, I really thought both Russell Crowe as Jor El and Kevin Costner as Johnathon Kent did great. I also like the choice of Henry Cavill as Superman. It was nice they did not try to go for a clone of Christopher Reeves this time. I think they learned their lesson after Returns, sure a clone can sound and act sort of like the person they were cloned from, but they have no emotion! The action was great, this film featured a lot of colossal battles between Superman and the other Kryptons. Lots and lots of destruction. It also had the best one on one fight between hero and villain I have seen yet in a comic book film...the Avengers having the best team battle. However, while I enjoyed this movie a lot, it is not without its faults. The gang at the Daily Planet were a bit underused, you never really get to know any of them beyond Louis Lane. The film also could have used a few more lighthearted moments in it. I do not mind that the film was dark, but just because the overall tone is dark does not mean you can not have a bit of comedy. Look at Amazing Spider-man.So, yes this is my favorite Superman film. It is the Superman film I have been waiting for, one where his abilities are all on display and are used in full force. With that said, I do hope the next film develops some of the Daily Planet's staff a bit more and that they do return to Lex Luther as the villain. Just a different Lex, one not consumed with real estate or a crazy crime lord, but a corrupt businessman. We have finally made up for the lack of action missing in all the previous films so I am okay with a return to a less threatening menace in the next film.",9,9,15,9 July 2013
Grease," For a musical it is tolerable, even if it has virtually no plot.
","Like I start off saying before I review most musicals, I really do not care for the musical format in a movie. That being said this one is more tolerable than most musicals I have had the misfortune to see. In fact, some areas of the movie are rather good. To put it bluntly a five is a very good score for me to give a musical. The main problem I have with the movie has less to do with the fact that it is a musical and more with the fact it has almost no plot whatsoever in the film. Also, it seems to be trying to teach people that the only way to be accepted is to act like everyone else and not be an individual. So not the best message in the world that is for sure. Still, the songs in this one are actually kind of catchy compared to some musicals, though my favorite musical number in this one is the song played in the opening credits. There are a couple of other rather good songs in this one though, I have to say the worst song in this one is better than anything heard in the dreadful sequel to this film. There are also a couple of humorous scenes in this one too, like the sleepover where they make fun of poor Sandra. And speaking of Sandra, Olivia Newton John is very good in this film as is most of the cast. Even Travolta is rather good in this one and to be honest I am not a big fan of his usually (when I usually can tolerate him is when he is a bad guy). So while not something I would want to see every day, this musical to me is tolerable which is high praise coming from me who hates musicals usually.",5,1,5,20 March 2010
Footloose," When you are the only boy among three girls you get dragged to films like this.
","I spent the night with two of my cousins when I was young. Along with me was my sister so I got dragged to 'Footloose' and suffice to say I was bored out of my mind! This is just not a film for a nine year old kid and not really for me now either. It is just not a movie that is going to crack my fave films of all time for obvious reasons. The main one being I like to see movies as an escape and when escaping with this film I get to go into a small town where dances and such are not allowed. What fun! Especially considering I live in Alabama in a small town I just have no urge to revisit places like this on the big or small screen. The film does star Kevin Bacon though, and he is not the typical lead in a film such as this so he adds something to the film as does John Lithgow. Though not enough as the rest of the cast is typical of a mindless flick such as this. The premise is bland, the film is bland, that song by Kenny Loggins was kind of catchy though. Still, this is not a favorite genre of mine so this film is not going to be something I would care to see again.",3,2,9,17 December 2010
28 Weeks Later," 28 weeks later a frenetic nonstop horror thrill ride.
","I first have to admit I did not much care for 28 days later, however, part of my dislike for that movie may stem from the fact a review I read said it was like 'Dawn of the Dead' which it wasn't really. Still, I may not be as harsh on it now as I was when I first saw it, I found it was a bit slow at times and you really never got to see the best horror, only have it described to you by the one person talking about how people were in a panic and that one by one people turned. Here you get to see exactly that. The movie starts with a bang as a husband flees from the rage infected hordes of people having left his wife behind seemingly to die, flash to 28 weeks later and the city is being repopulated slowly, but surely as the husband from the beginning is reunited with his kids who are extremely stupid. Yes, they do what they are not supposed to and go into a non safe area in search of their old house so they can pick up a few mementos of their mum. Well surprise, surprise their mother is alive, though not so well and is taken back to the city for examination. Well we soon find out why you should stay in the safe zone as the infection begins again and I am pretty sure most of the people who have returned home are now thinking maybe we should not have returned. The infection spreads as fast as described in the first movie, there is panic in the streets and the military is now in kill mode as our two kids are joined by a medical officer and a military man not keen on shooting everyone in sight whether infected or not. So you have cool chases with both the infected and the military and the characters in this one don't have much time to do anything, but catch their breath. Very good and fast paced horror movie.",8,2,6,14 May 2007
Cast Away," Life on a deserted island most certainly not a good time.
","This film was interesting, however not as good as I was expecting. The film about what amounts to a delivery man in a plane crash and stuck on a desert island for a while is rather good. I just did not care for the run time after he is rescued as I thought it went on a bit to long after he was rescued. I went to the movie to see a man on an island and how he copes, I did not really want to see how his former wife could not wait a bit longer before she remarried (seriously a guy would be expected to wait twice as long before anyone pushed them to marry someone else I am betting the female here started getting prodded to get married again about two weeks after his disappearance). The story on the island was good though, the volleyball was a bit lame, I realize I am rather antisocial so the lack of people would not affect me as much as it would someone who loves people, but I still do not see talking to a volleyball as something that is going to be helpful. I liked the way at the start of his island life he kept getting hurt and had trouble eating and such and then it flashed forward and he is spearing fish and eating them raw. His escape plan is both brilliant and reckless at the same time. This film could have been really special had they cut a bit of time off the run time and got rid of the annoying wife.",7,4,6,21 June 2010
The Thing," Who among them is the thing? Great paranoia horror from one of the masters of horror.
","This film to me is the best horror film John Carpenter ever did, trumping another great 'Halloween'. What he did in remaking a 50's science fiction movie into a super horror movie was just genius. The story has these guys (and it is all males, not a female to be seen) at some sort of research facility in Antarctica, I think. They discover something that has been removed from the ice at another facility, having been led there after witnessing a helicopter chasing after a dog with the purpose of killing it. Well they explore the base and take said dog back to their base, which in turn leads to some thing moving about the facility. It seems to infect or take on properties of those it kills, it is kind of hard to say, but when you find it out it goes all out to defend itself making for some of the most gruesome special effects you have ever seen. I love the scene with the shock pads and the head, who can forget the head? The movie also has such tense moments as you do not know who could be the thing and the group of dwindling survivors gets more and more nervous and paranoid as their numbers go down. The monster effects would inspire a lot of horror movies and games, just look at the recent 'Dead Space' video game for things that look like they came straight out of this movie. This movie would also be Carpenter's greatest movie, looking at this one wonder's how he could have made a movie as bad as 'Ghosts of Mars'. This is also one of Kurt Russell's best roles as well, he and Carpenter always make a good team and this movie makes for a good night of fear, suspicion and gore. The thing could be anywhere...or be anyone!",9,0,1,29 August 2011
Armageddon," Cool, action, sci-fi movie.
","This movie would have a higher score if it weren't for very anal people who have to downgrade every movie that isn't an Oscar caliber picture.  These people also listen to critics and basically mimic what the critics say in their reviews.  This movie isn't meant to be serious, it is a nice fun movie where you can just relax and turn your brain off for a bit.  Not all movies have to be deep and make you think...in fact it takes a lot less time and energy to make all those great movies than it does for the summer blockbusters.  If I want to think hard and be challenged, I will read a book thank you very much, movies to me are an escape and should be an enjoyable experience.  This movie was that for me.  The story an asteroid is heading toward earth and the only way to stop it is to drill it and put a nuke in it.  Does this sound like award winning material...no, but it is fun to watch.  The cast is great and they seem to be having fun making this movie as well.  The only scene I could have done without is the animal cracker scene.  That was for the ladies, just like the special effects finale in Deep Impact was for the guys.  All in all it is an enjoyable movie as long as you are not a super serious person who listens to what the critics have to say.  Don't expect to be enlightened, just expect a nice escape.  And no I am not attacking everyone who didn't like this film because it isn't for everyone.  Just those whose reviews seem to attack the people who liked this film.",8,1,3,28 February 2003
The Village," It putters, then stutters, and then dies.
","Congrats 'The Village', you have replaced 'The Chronicles of Riddick' as the lowpoint so far of the 2004 movies I have seen.  The sad part is I sort of liked that one, this one, however, I did not enjoy much at all.  In fact, I have now finally seen a movie that was worse than last years '28 Days Later', in fact after seeing this one I feel bad about being as hard on that movie as I was.  I give this movie a three only because at least it has good performances...still those performances cannot make up for the fact the plot was awful, it was dreadfully boring, and the ending was very predictable...I think I got it five minutes in when I saw their community resembled an amish village, and I was 100% sure once the origin of the creatures is revealed. The movie is totally devoid of humor, it takes itself seriously to a fault, and quite frankly it would not scare a child of three or four years old. The only reason it is so highly ranked here at imdb is that M. Night directed it so people feel they have to like it, but he isn't a god and so I say this movie is just a mistake by him.  Why he can not make a movie without the twist ending is beyond me.  Next time he should just make a straight horror movie with no twists at the end and that would probably surprise people more than this one did.  I mean if you did not see this one coming you probably have problems concentrating, but then who could blame you?  This movie is very tedious and if you can manage to keep awake through the whole thing you will say 'so that is it?'  You would have been better off sleeping.  There are also more holes left unfilled than can be found in a piece of swiss cheese.  It also irked me that Phoenix is basically not even in the second half of this film.  All in all a grave disappointment, a movie that looks like a made for television movie presented by the Lifetime channel.  If this scares you seek medical help.",3,2,4,2 August 2004
Pitch Black," Much better than the over the top sequel.
","This movie had some science fiction elements to it, and it did not look cheap in any way. However, it was a much more simple movie than the sequel and to me that made it better. It also helped that this movie did not totally focus on the Riddick character. Granted he was an interesting character, but the fact there was so much mystery with him is what made him so cool. In the sequel you just found out a lot more than you really wanted to. It also helps that this movie has more horror movie in it than anything else. I always enjoy a good science fiction horror movie and this one was another in a long line of good ones. The story as a ship that crash lands on a strange planet that is very hot as it has three suns. To add to the difficulty of the situation they are transporting a rather dangerous individual. Pretty soon he escapes and soon after someone dies. However, it is not the escaped prisoner, rather there seems to be something living within the planet, something that is hungry. The good news is these whatever they are do not come out in the harsh sunlight, so no problems right? Wrong! Even with the many suns the planet is about to go into a stage of darkness and the creatures are going to come out and feed. So they now have to rely on each other to escape and that includes the escaped prisoner who has had a special procedure done to make it so he can see in the darkness. Very nice movie, some good kills and good monster action.",8,0,1,17 August 2009
The Hills Have Eyes," One intense family road trip.
","I have never seen the original movie by Wes Craven, I want to though, but I am guessing that one is going to be a more realistic movie while this one ramped up the violence and the mutation on our radioactive desert family. What we get is a rather intense movie that once our innocent family has an accident in the middle of nowhere the film does not let up. It also made me want to get a German Shepard doggy. So the story is basically a family are driving I am guessing cross country or something in a rather old motor home...the type that gets pulled along by a truck. They make a stop at a gas station and things go wrong when the creepy attendant tells them of a shortcut when he fears one of the family members sees something they should not. Well this sets them along a dirt road which you never take no matter how good of a short cut it is and they get eight flat tires, what is the chances of that happening? Well now our family is stuck in the middle of the desert to bicker and such, but not for long as they are being stalked by some folks out in the desert hills. There are some rather brutal scenes to follow as I really felt for the family, and I wanted nothing more than to see those responsible pay. Which is much better in a horror movie than that group of thoroughly obnoxious people that you want to die in horrible ways. So be prepared for a lot of gruesome killings and one heck of a dog in this very hard core horror movie. Something about the stranded traveler horror movie I usually like.",8,1,6,27 March 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Great Sci-Fi action movie, better than I expected.
","I thought this one would be pretty good, but the previews did not really convey how good it turned out to be.  I also thought it would be that good thanks to its relatively short running time.  It turns out this helps the movie flow really fast and you never find yourself wondering how much time is left.  At least it didn't for me.  This one has Arnold as the Terminator once again being sent back in time to save Conner from an evil Terminator. Well I guess it isn't evil as it is a machine.  Well anyway this time the Terminator doesn't have to long to protect John as the war to end the world, as we know it is really close.  This one is just a great action movie, probably the best one I have seen this entire summer of 2003.  There is a great car chase, one that is even better than the Matrix Reloaded, mainly cause it looks more real, like it is actually happening in a city rather than a road Hollywood built (don't get me wrong though, that one was cool too) and there are other numerous scenes in this one that just keep your attention to the screen.  The T-X is rather cool, but I just don't see her being superior to the T-1000, as it seemed a lot harder to destroy.  Though I thought Kristen did a rather good job similar to Robert Patrick (I think that was his name).  The movie explains some of the plot points I was wondering about too, all in all this movie was very enjoyable and had quite a few humorous moments as well.",9,0,2,19 July 2003
U-571," It was an action movie, not a historic recount so for what it was I enjoyed it.
","A lot of movies use historical events such as wars or tragedies as backdrops for their movies. 'Titanic' for instance was completely untrue for the most part. This movie for some reason had lots of people complaining about how Americans were not the first to find the decoder depicted in the film. So what? Really, some people are just so anal. If England wishes for the true story to be told make a documentary on the subject with their money. This is an action movie made with American dollars, this is not to be confused with fact, seriously did you look up the Titanic's manifest and see if that poor Jack or his love Rose was on it. The decoder was just a way to get some guys on a German U-boat so we could have a pretty good action movie. It was nothing to ponder or for historians to dissect, I mean did we believe that Forrest Gump was real too and that he was a very important person in American History too or what? The main problem I had with this one is that Matthew McConaughey is the lead in this one. I think someone else would have been better, though he was not to bad in this one. Just when I see him I usually think chick flick, though I did like him in 'Sahara' too. So a nice action movie, with some good submarine battles, I preferred 'The Hunt Red October' and I have heard the German film 'Das Boot' is the superior submarine film of all of them, but have never seen that one. Would like to though, until then though I enjoyed this one and I realize the English were the first to find said decoder.",7,10,20,29 October 2010
The Shining," Good...but not as good as some say.
","I liked this movie, but how it is ranked so high is beyond me.  There are some pretty scary images in the movie, but on the whole it is not that scary.  In fact, for the most part it is just watching people putter around a hotel by themselves and one of them goes insane.  The boys powers are for the most part ignored, and it is a major part of the book.  Though I myself would have loved to have driven around on a big wheel through a hotel at that age it doesn't really belong in this movie either, what the kid can't be walking and discover stuff?  Jack though does a great job as the father, though he seems a bit to insane at the beginning so him going crazy is definately not a surprise.  All in all a few scary scenes here and there, but this one to me is just an ok movie, not the scariest movie by any stretch of the imagination.",6,2,6,7 October 2002
"I, Robot"," Kind of a blend of other movies, but it works.
","This movie is basically a little of 'Minority Report', 'Men in Black', 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace', and the story it was based on all roled up into one.  Sometimes with a blend you get a foul tasting mess, but here you end up with a rather good movie, that could have been better, however, overall it was entertaining.  A movie about a robot who may have committed murder focuses mostly on Will Smith's character.  He does pretty good in the role, but I am thinking an older actor would have done a better job with the role, maybe a Bruce Willis or someone like that.  Still Smith did better than I thought he would and his character was believable enough for me.  The robots are very well done and the story is decent enough, though I think they could have trimmed it down maybe ten or so minutes.  The effects are good and the action is good as well...though most of the best action scenes are at the tail end of the movie.  There are a few twists and turns in the story as well and they work rather well too.  All in all this movie is an entertaining summer movie.",8,0,0,20 July 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The sweeping epic of the series.
","This terminator movie is the big one of the three; by big I mean the longest one, the one that was the epic blockbuster.  I like all three the same though.  This one is the biggest of the bunch and has many great special effects; this one also though has a couple of boring spots in it.  The other two have better flow while this one stops here and there.  Still though there are great action scenes, though nothing as good as the chase in part three.  It also has a cool villain in the T-1000, a terminator that was very tough to kill.  I say it was a lot more durable than the T-X in part three even if it couldn't do some of the stuff it could.  Arnold is of course great in the one role that is perfect for him and Linda Hamilton is good as well.  Furlong is okay, but he can get on your nerves so I am glad he didn't come back for part three.  This one has it all and is the grandest of the bunch as far as scope, Cameron was trying for a big budget, and big event movie and he succeeded.",9,1,2,17 January 2004
The Patriot," Interesting movie about the Revolutionary War.
","I enjoyed this movie and for the life of me I do not see how the movie 'The Perfect Storm' made more than this film at the box office. They both opened the same weekend and this one would make quite a bit less than that movie. A movie that seemed to be made only to show that scene where the boat met the wave while this one actually had an interesting story, good bloody action, and some rather humorous moments too. It also had Heath Ledger in one of his earlier roles as Mel Gibson's oldest son and he and Gibson paired up very well for this one. The story takes place during the revolutionary war and has Gibson as a father of I forgot how many children, but there were a lot. He owns a nice home and the African Americans that are on his land are not slaves, but choose to be there. Yes, I know this part seems unrealistic, but I am guessing they wanted to make the guy more of a hero than the actual guy this was sort of based off of and if he had slaves that would not have been good. Well anyway this guy is trying his best not to get involved with the war. Unfortunately, his eldest son joins the rebels and soon after he is being arrested and Gibson's second oldest son is killed while trying to get to his older brother. Well this sets a light under Gibson's character and you find out he was a rather super killer during his younger days fighting battles. He soon enlists the aid of others and they begin fighting the redcoats using tactics not seen during this era. Basically, instead of standing there taking shots at each other they ambush their enemy from hiding spots. The movie has a sad scene later, and ends on a rather more positive note after a fierce battle and great final line between Gibson and the villain of the piece. The movie works on a lot of levels, could use maybe a trim down on the run time of the film and perhaps a tad less tragedy and it could have been really great. Still, I enjoyed it and will never understand how this fine film got sank by that weak boat in 'The Perfect Storm'.",8,1,8,3 March 2010
Edward Scissorhands," Worth a look just to see Vincent Price's last role.
","I do believe it was his last role, and not surprisingly he is absolutely great as the inventor who sees a human in a cookie cutting machine and gives it a heart, a body and life and sadly dies before he is able to give his creation hands. The impact really had me going and was very emotional especially considering how shortly after this Price himself would take his last breath. The rest of the movie is good too, I would have ranked it higher, but the ending so brought me down that it left me feeling down in the dumps where it could have instead uplifted. Poor Edward went through so much, then was able to carve out some happiness with people and then had it taken away again. The ending is just enough to break your heart. Then again, what can one expect from Tim Burton? The movie has a very Gothic look to it that would also be seen in 'Batman Returns' though I would argue he got a bit to dark and Gothic in that one. This one though becomes more of a comedy when Edward is found and introduced into society. Then near all the funny stuff, Edward falls in love and tragedy ensues making making this movie a depressing one. Still, it is a good movie and worth a look. Like I said, the movie is worth watching for Vicent Price's brief scenes alone.",Null,0,1,6 September 2009
Van Helsing," A very good action movie...just not much of a plot.
","I enjoyed this movie for the most part, it went by quick and was almost entirely action.  However, the plot could have used a lot of work.  Not the best put together movie I have ever seen and I would not think it would be that hard to put these horror legends together and have a credible plot, but I just did not care for Dracula's big plan.  James Bond villains have better plans than the one we were presented with here.  Still though the action was great and Hugh Jackman was good in the title role, though I would take Peter Cushing over him as my personal favorite.  I wish they had cast someone bigger in the Dracula role though, the guy they got was okay, but Oldman was better in the role than the one we get here.  Sure I know you can not use Christopher Lee anymore, but someone a touch more big in Hollywood would have been better.  But then there are not really all that many big stars for horror movies like there were back in the day.  My best advice is that if you liked the Mummy movies then you are more likely to like this one because they are similar.  If you did not like them then I know you will not like this one so skip it.  It is also best just to turn your brain off and just enjoy the action.",8,1,2,11 May 2004
Rocky IV," This Rocky is a bit much, but still okay.
","Yes, this Rocky takes aim at the cold war between the US and Russia or USSR that was taking place during the time of this movie. This one is also more over the top than part three and just not realistic at all. Still, those training sequences in this movie as well as parts of the fight really get one's blood pumping. The movie has a Russian boxer coming to America to take on any challenger bold enough to go head to head with him. For some reason, this infuriates Apollo and he is the one to challenge the Russian. Well the fight occurs and tragedy occurs, to much tragedy we lose one of the most interesting and fun Rocky characters when all he had to to was lose and maybe get partially paralyzed or something. Apollo dying just mirrored Mickey's death in the previous movie to much. Well now Rocky wants revenge and he is going to Russia to fight the monster that killed his friend. Great training scenes occur and Rocky and the monster fight. The fight is a bit much, but still cool. This movie has a fast flow, so despite its flaws it is an okay film.",6,0,0,7 March 2009
Spider-Man," What I was hoping for and more.
","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.",10,80,103,2 September 2005
The Amazing Spider-Man," It was pretty amazing.
","I enjoyed the first three Spider-man films immensely even the highly scorned third film. So I was not to sure what to think about a reboot to a still young franchise. However, I just realized that Sam Rami is not Spider-man's creator, that there are thousands of stories and ways to portray Spider-man so why keep us waiting fifteen or twenty years for another film? There is no reason at all, I want to see Spider-man on the big screen and honestly while the first three Spider-man films were enjoyable this portrayal of Spider-man is the more accurate. Does it follow the comic book exactly...well of course not. No comic film does that, why is it even necessary? Sam Rami gave Spider-man organic shooters, bypassed Gwen Stacy in lieu of Mary Jane, and had Sandman kill Uncle Ben...so yes, the formula did not match the comic the first time, so why now or ever? This film seemed to be a combination of the original Spider-man that first appeared in the 60's and Ultimate Spider-man which launched either in the late 90's or early 2000's. And the match up worked and now if they wish to continue the success they need to continue the story in an interesting way and not let it end as badly as the third Spider-man film ended without a resolution.This story is an origin tale, so you know the basics without me going into details. Those not familiar with the ultimate story arc may be confused about certain things such as Peter knowing his parents and things of this nature. The main thing that is different though is the villain as we finally get the Lizard. You also get to see Peter learn to use his powers a bit more here than in the first film. It is not quite the smooth transition. He soon begins fighting crime which leads him to having to try and capture the Lizard. The Lizard has plans of his own though.Things this movie did that the previous films did not do are plentiful. Do not get me wrong, this one was not as good as the second Spider-man film, I am just saying they did the Spider powers better. They also had the web shooters, even when I was at my most negative about this film from the first trailers I salivated over Spidey finally using mechanical web shooters. They also had him move like a spider more. During a fight with a lizard the way he entangled the lizard in the web was very spider-like. They also had a scene where he shot multiple webs in the sewer and used the vibrations to try and locate the Lizard. This Spider-man also wisecracks and constantly talks during battles, another trait missing from the previous entries. So all in all this Spidey was more like the Spidey I know from the comics.The villain is the Lizard and while I enjoyed how they integrated him in the origin plot there was a problem I had with him. Mainly that it was not explained that he could telepathically communicate with other reptiles. I knew why there were so many lizards and such present, but for those not familiar with the character there may be confusion. Just as in his motivations. When fully transformed he hates humans and wishes reptiles ruled the world, while this comes across a bit in the film I read a review where the person questioned his motivations and how he became evil so quick. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was great, much cuter than Kristen Dunst and looking more like the character she was portraying. I thought her and James had good chemistry and I liked how their romance was not simply he pining for her.Finally, I want to cover one thing that this movie did that I was so happy when a certain something did not occur. That is Gwen did not get taken by the villain and Spider-man did not have to rescue her! I was so certain this would happen, but to my surprise and delight it did not. Sorry, but Mary Jane being kidnapped at the end of all three of the first films was a bit monotonous. I swear the makers of this film felt this too as it looked like Lizard was going from her and then he just gets what he was coming for and leaves her in the room. Leaving me to think the makers were like 'Gotcha! Ha, thought she was going to be taken for the final confrontation didn't ya?' So this film was a nice restart, though I do hope they film the movies quicker and get in a good three or four films in and have a complete story done. The first series was good, but it did not end all that well as there were still a number of things left in the air. This one has set up a good beginning and hinted at a future villain in the upcoming films. I believe if all goes well the next film could be the best one yet, but let me reiterate if all goes well. And should they complete this set of movies I would want for them to reboot once again. I love Spider-man and want to see him on the big screen...however, I am good on origin stories so you can at least skip that next time. This time though it was simply nice to watch Spider-man swing his way in and out of danger once again.",9,5,14,9 July 2012
Aliens," A horror science fiction action movie so good it almost makes you uncomfortable to watch.
","I saw this one in the theaters as a kid with my mom.  I was only eleven, but I really liked the looks of this one from the previews, besides I had an alien toy from the original 'Alien' movie so I always liked the way it looked.  It was creepy and seeing a whole mess of aliens vs marines was to much for me to pass up.  My mom took me because she liked the first one too and we had a good time.  Of its faults its main one is not really a fault. That is that the movie puts you the viewer in with these people who are in a very dire situation.  It makes you nervous that they may not make it out alive and there are very much doubts to whether they will survive the ordeal.  No matter how many times I see it I feel this way.  Still though what you came to see is also present...future army guys (the marines) going against an army of aliens.  Still the movie builds up rather slowly at first, this lures you into the world of the alien, then it rockets you in with a fire fight where you see very little of the aliens, then finally there is an all out assault.  I will not say much about this assault, but to say the marines do not do to well.  After this Ripley (Weaver) must brave the hoard of aliens alone in an attempt to rescue a little girl all the while a reactor on this planet is about to blow the place sky high.  With this alien movie you are in for a wild ride.",9,0,0,11 August 2004
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Was not sure what to expect, but I ended up enjoying the latest X-men film
","I am one of the few people out there that apparently enjoyed X-men: The Last Stand. I thought the film had the best battle scene of the original trilogy as it actually had the first real team battle instead of being Wolverine versus various mutants and people. I had heard that this one was going to wipe away that film, but in reality, this film pretty much wipes all those films away, but does so in a bit more imaginative fashion. Like a reboot, but not in a way. We get the cast of the old films and the ones from First Class in a time travel story that works for the most part.The story has the mutants in a desperate situation as Sentinels have been created to cleanse the Earth of all existing mutants. We witness, right away, the terror they can inflict as they wipe out some of the toughest mutants around with ease. This Sentinels adapt to their targets and are able to inflict great damage. Well after this group of mutants is wiped out, we see them alive and well as one of the mutants, Shadowcat, can now send a person back into their former self and that person then warns of the impending Sentinel attack and they then abandon their hiding spot and find a new location. Professor Xavier and Magneto are now on the same side and Professor X has a plan to send his consciousness back into his former self to the time the Sentinel program took off and stop Mystique from killing a man by the name of Trask as this leads to her capture and her ability to morph leads to the super adaptable Sentinels. Unfortunately, Professor X can not survive the time jump, but Wolverine can. He makes his way into the past and must convince not only Professor Xavier, but also Magneto that they must stop Mystique and thus stop the horrific future.The story was pretty good and I liked that Beast played a huge role in this film. I also enjoyed Quicksilver's time in the movie. Still, the emphasis is on Wolverine, young Professor Xavier and young Magneto. Granted, the best action takes place in the future as the Sentinels once again locate the remaining mutants hiding place. They did a lot of good things here, but I am a bit perplexed as to why they insist on making Mystique such a huge part of these movies. I can understand Wolverine, as he was everybody's favorite and he was in the comics a whole lot, but when I collected comics heavily for three years I literally did not have but maybe two comics with Mystique in it. One a back issue featuring Cable's first appearance and another an annual that had a couple of short stories detailing the downfall of her group Freedom Force. While perplexed, it did provide for an interesting story and so I guess I will roll with it even though I find it highly unfair that the females who saw this got to see Wolverine's bare buttocks while all us guys get is a smurf with all the best parts distorted.In the end, I really enjoyed this X-men film more than I thought I would and I am also very excited about the next film that will finally feature another X-men villain that should have been featured before now considering the amount of X-men movies there are now. The film did have some strange moments and there were some off screen deaths that were a bit puzzling and I did not care for, but overall the film had some nice action and an interesting enough storyline to keep it all together and not seem like a film where they were simply trying to shove every mutant possible into the film just because they could.",9,6,11,9 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America's third outing a very good film
","Marvel studios has made yet another film that I really enjoyed as they continue to do a really good job telling their story and keeping all their heroes relevant and integral to the ongoing story. That being said, I was somewhat disappointed by this one as well. Perhaps it was the hype surrounding it as I was hearing that it was the best comic film ever and things of that nature. Not that it was a huge letdown, mind you, I am scoring this thing a nine, that is a very good score in my book. I just was expecting this one to get a ten, but as it is I enjoyed it more than the other hero versus hero film released this year, Batman V Superman, it only equaled the enjoyment I got from Deadpool also released this year. Deadpool's budget a bit over 50 million and this one 250 million. I do not know, I just feel it should have blew me away more than it did. Still, it had really good action, the story was pretty good too as they had to come up with a way for the heroes to clash and they did the best they could using the Winter Soldier as the main catalyst for Captain America and Iron Man butting heads.The story has the government wanting to take control of the Avengers due to all the destruction they had caused during the previous movies and an incident in this film that resulted in the deaths of some dignitaries from the country of Wakanda. Of course, if the Avengers had not intervened in New York the world would have been taken over by Loki, Hydra would be killing all those it deemed a threat by way of giant flying gun fortresses and Ultron would have easily wiped out humanity too, but everyone seems to ignore this stuff and the fact the heroes cannot save everyone so Tony Stark is fully on board for the registering of heroes. Steve Rogers is not, but this is not what sets them at odds, but rather the fact his old friend Bucky seems to have set a bomb that kills the king of Wakanda so a world wide search begins. Captain America gets involved as he does not wish to see his old friend killed and soon the heroes will clash as things deteriorate rapidly.The film features many returning favorites as Captain America, Black Widow, War Machine, Iron Man and Hawkeye return. Also, we get to see Falcon, Scarlett Witch and Vision do more in this film. Antman is also in this one and is a nice addition as he added some great comedy to the mix, I just wish he came in sooner. Black Panther makes his debut in a film and is a cool addition and then we also get the debut of Spider-man in a Marvel film and this is where some of my disappointment comes in. I thought now that Marvel had my favorite superhero that we would finally see the best representation of him yet, but while he is okay, they just did not do him justice. He could take any one, on either side of this one on one and could probably beat multiple ones in a fight, but here he literally loses a tug of war with Captain America which to me is just insane! Captain America's base strength is 800 pounds, certainly stronger than most humans. Spider-man's is 10 tons! He can also stick to any object and it was once explained in a comic that no physical force could remove him until he himself decides. Yet he is shown exerting a rather large amount of effort to pull Cap? There should have been no effort or any struggle! They also seemed to ignore his spidey sense pretty much like all the Spider-man films have done, I guess they just feel if your the hero you gotta be a punching bag. I enjoyed seeing him debut, but once again seems like they are not going to do him justice. Seriously, I have a comic where he beats down Iron Man and knocks his armor clean off.So, overall, I enjoyed this film. I did enjoy seeing the new characters and some of the ones that had not really done much up until now do more. Sure, I was not entirely happy with the web slinger, but this just comes from reading so many comics of him and seeing what he can do and fully knowing all his powers. I kind of wish Antman was in this one more as he was the funniest one in the film as up until he arrived the film was kind of a downer with the exception of some Falcon and Winter Solider exchanges. I have heard that there may be another Iron Man film, and I hope this is the case, as I would love to see Robert Downey Jr. do the role at least one more time. I am looking forward to what Marvel offers me in the future as this one was really good, just not quite what I was expecting.",9,7,15,9 May 2016
Spirited Away," Strange, but fun trip through a spirit world bath house.
","I saw the movie 'Re-Cycle' not that long ago and people on boards for that film talked about two scenes that resembled each other so I wanted to see this one. I have seen another film made by this company 'Nausica' and I could tell there were similarities in music and animation style. Well the bridge scene was a bit similar, but my girlfriend says there are a lot of tales in Asian culture of holding your breath so the spirits can not see you so it really was not to a like. Actually, I found this movie while a bit flawed here and there for my tastes more entertaining than that other film and much more whimsical. A girl and her parents are driving to their new home and get detoured along the way and end up at what appears to be the entrance to a long abandoned theme park. Well the daughter, named Chihiro has a bad feeling about this place, but her parents just have to explore. Suffice to say the daughter's bad premonition about this place turns out to be correct as the parents stumble upon a lot of food in one of the buildings in this place and proceed to eat the food like Goku eats in Dragonball Z. In the end the girl ends up trapped in what is the spirit world, and this theme park which is actually a bath house for the spirits. The girl ends up getting employed by the witch who runs the bath house and has her name basically stolen by her as she goes from Chihiro to Sen, a boy named Haku at times seems to want to help her and at others seems cold to her. Her parents are pigs, a strange creature seems to really like her and she gets to meet all sorts of interesting new chaps. The problems I found with the piece you ask? Well despite a rather lengthy runtime of 125 minutes it still feels like it needed more. Many interesting plot points wrapped up with not enough development, like No-Face. The twin sister's strange turnaround in they way she acted and treated the girl. The way she gets back seems a tad rushed too, however for the most part this movie was simply a delight.",7,1,3,2 March 2009
The Conjuring 2," From Amityville to Enfield we shall go
","I was not a huge fan of the first film, I thought it was an okay haunted house type story, but I was glad it had the success it did as it garnered an R rating and went on to have a lot of success pulling in over 100 million on a rather small by today's standards budget. My hope was that this would kind of give Hollywood executives the hint that we like our horror to be R and not the PG-13 horror light that fills the theaters these days. This one too is R, and it had a rather sizable opening weekend so I am hoping this one will do a lot of money and show it to them again, because sometimes you got to beat something into a person's head before they get it. I actually liked this one more than the first film too, as I thought it was a bit more graphic than the first film which I thought honestly could have been a PG-13 rated horror film like so many others. This one was well acted and I liked the setting to it more than the last film as it was something different. Sure, most of us know the real story is not as dark and creepy as the movie, but I really do not go into these 'based on a true story' movies thinking I am going to get an accurate retelling of the actual events. If it did that, films that were based on true events would probably put most of us to sleep.The story starts out in Amityville and details some work the Warrens did in the old house that we have seen in its own series of films. From there we are introduced to a family in England. A mother, whose father has ditched them live in a very run down looking house. There are four children, two girls and two boys. Things begin to happen within the house with the youngest girl seemingly sleep walking and strange noises occurring. Soon, things begin moving around and an old man appears within the house wanting the family to leave. Lorraine Warren, meanwhile, keeps having visions of a demonic nun who seems to be foretelling the death of her husband. She wants to take a break from their investigations, but they are soon pulled into the Enfield haunting and must find out what is behind the girl's strange behavior and the secret of the old man in the house before it is too late! So this film, to me, was an improvement over the first Conjuring film. From what I have read, this one was written with an R rating in mind while the first they were trying for PG-13, so this one did have more of an edge to it. I also enjoyed the opening scene in the Amityville house as I was not expecting it to be featured. Granted, I am sure most people already knew, but I kind of do not watch television or read anything about films I am going to see to be as surprised as possible. The acting was good, the atmosphere was good and it had some creepy moments. My only problem was that it did run a bit long for a horror film. I thought ten or fifteen minutes could have easily been taken out of this one and not taken away from the story.So, yes, this film to me was pretty good. I had to see this one in theaters so that it could make as much money as possible so that maybe Hollywood would wake up and realize horror films should be rated R and that the 13 to 16 year old demographic unable to attend a horror film is not going to doom it to failure as many of them will just go with their parents anyways. Unfortunately, they probably still will not get it as another horror film coming up this year called Lights Out is rated PG-13. Looks promising, but it will most likely not have the edge this film did. This film did not kill numerous people and had no sex, it just had a creepy edge to it that made the film R. It also is a throwback to the days when they had decent actors and actresses in horror films and not just super models and buff dudes being stupid. So, I say give this one a go as not only are you end for a creepy good time, you will also be helping this film do well which will hopefully lead to more R rated horror films!",7,1,4,13 June 2016
Die Hard 2," Good action here and there, but it lags here and there also.
","A pretty good follow up to the smash hit 'Die Hard' this one actually made a lot more money at the box office. Still, it is not as good as the first movie as the action here is good, but this one has to many boring stretches and needless plot points and a bit to much this and that to even compete with the much more thrilling and tension building original. This one has actual terrorist taking over an airport threatening to take down the planes if their demands are not met. How does our hero McClane fit in? Well it just so happens his wife is on board one of the flights forced to circle the airport while running dangerously low on fuel. So what do we get, short shots of action that is good and a lot of filler in between. Don't get me wrong, there are some great scenes such as the grenades in the airplane, but this Die Hard just seemed to run a bit too long while the first and third movies seemed to cruise along at a very brisk pace. The villain in this one is not as good as Rickman was in the first one, or Irons was in the third and the whole concept of McClane being in the wrong place at the wrong time seems very unlikely to happen. Granted it is just a movie and for the most part it is enjoyable.",7,1,3,8 July 2005
Resident Evil," Pretty good video game turned movie.
","It is a good movie if you like action, gore, and horror.  This movie is non-stop and if you like the above then you will definately not be bored.  A trained team of commando's have to break into a facility to find out why the computer running the place killed everyone inside.  What they find when they turn the computer off is that the computer was trying to hold back scores of zombies and other creepy things.  The plot isn't anything original, but the movie is performed to perfection.  Not as good though as classic zombie movies like Dawn of the Dead and such it still entertains.  My main complaint is they killed the leader of the commandos to quickly he was my favorite character (the poor guy didn't even get to be killed by zombies, but really cool lasers).",8,2,5,21 March 2002
Avengers: Endgame," An enjoyable end to the Infinity saga, but not as good as Infinity Wars
","I loved Infinity Wars, it being a totally awesome comic book film that did a great job of having dream team ups and great action and fights. Thanos was an awesome villain that looked unstoppable at times and seeing him snap and reduce half the population to ash was epic. One thing I have to say about this film is that I have never enjoyed a film so much while at the same time being disappointed with it. Was it epic? Yes, but it did not feel as epic as Infinity Wars. Did the main cast do a good job? Yes, but I felt the direction the story went was not all that good. It just seemed very off to me personally. I was not expecting them to rush off to where Thanos was and kill him with ease and then get the five years later line. I just did not care for that at all. They made too much time pass in between the snap and the reformation of the team and a new plan. There are other things that bothered me, but I did enjoy the action and the humor and other aspects of this film...it just was not as good as Infinity War.The story starts out showing us that Hawkeye lost his entire family to the snap which seems a bit against the odds as it were. Then we shift to Tony Stark in space afloat and seemingly near death with Nebula when Captain Marvel comes to the rescue and the gang manage to track Thanos down and kill him after learning he disposed of the stones. Five years later, Ant-man resurfaces from the Quantum realm and somehow manages to come up with a going back in time plot that seems out of his area of expertise. Well, soon the Avengers are back together and planning to get the infinity stones so they can snap everyone back into existence; unfortunately, the Thanos of the past comes to learn of this plan and makes a plan of his own to get the stones the heroes collect.The film was good, but it had problems, as I felt the film was just jamming characters in the film to make as many characters appear as possible. In Infinity Wars it felt more seamless and natural how things fell, this one it felt forced. We have not even seen Pepper in Rescue before in the films, but she shows up here. I was on the fence about Captain Marvel before, when I saw her in her own film, but now I am more sure...I don't care for her. I do not get the goofy ass smile she has like she is superior to everyone else. In the comics the likes of Thor, Hulk would annihilate her in a one on one battle, yet it looks to me like they are setting her up to be the number one Marvel hero going forward and it sucks as she is not that huge of a player in the comic world. The whole females teaming together to get her through the enemies was stupid too, mainly because if she just flies the opposite way, there are no enemies and she could have easily gotten the infinity gauntlet out of there! They went with the total wimp Hulk in this one too, kept expecting him to redeem himself against Thanos after the butt kicking he got, but nope, he was a non factor in the final battle. In the comic Hulk is stronger than Thanos physically to the point Thanos has said he would not go toe to toe with the Hulk as it would be an unwinnable endeavor. The good news the main Avengers save the film and make you enjoy it more than you would if it had Captain Marvel leading the charge. The originals keep you watching despite the flaws in certain areas of the film.So, I enjoyed this one a lot, and I do like it better than Age of Ultron; however, it is not as good as the first film or Infinity Wars. The original cast is good and keeps you watching even though you know that some of them are not going to make it through the film. Unfortunately, if the future is Brie Larson as Captain Marvel then phase four of the Marvel plan is not looking so bright in my eyes. Not sure if it is too late to recast her or not, but she has no charisma. I will still watch sequels such as Spider-man, Guardians, Black Panther and Dr. Strange, but some of the movies they have planned for the future have me scratching my head. I always thought the Marvel Universe had more heroes than that of DC, but they seem to really be running out and relegating several big name heroes to series rather than big screen. Still, this one ends the infinity saga and not sure what they could ever do to top it and the infinity gauntlet anyways.",9,4,13,9 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," A very good continuation of Casino Royal.
","Yes, this movie starts off with a very nice car chase scene and is a very action packed James Bond movie. After the nice chase scene to open up the movie you are aware that this movie is picking up where the last movie left off. A nice change of pace for a James Bond movie as this is the first time I know of that this was done so directly. Granted 'From Russia With Love' sort of acknowledged the previous movie by mentioning the death of Dr. No and in 'Diamonds are Forever' it had Bond going on a revenge kick...this one is the first I know that picks up more like a direct sequel with a continuation in plot. The plot has Bond trying to find out who was behind the set up of Vesper as it seems there is a mysterious organization behind it and they have a member who has a rather different plot that Bond must uncover. You never really get to find out what this organization is, however, I have my suspicions. I think it may be something out of some of the previous Bond movies. So you get lots of action as Bond must chase a guy across the rooftops, interrupt an opera, escape on a boat and plane and have a blazing conclusion in a virtual inferno. Daniel Craig is once again very good as is Judi Dench. It is nice they used characters from the previous movie and the Bond girls in this one are very attractive. However, this movie is somewhat dark as Bond is having trouble coping over the lose of the woman he loved. He tries desperately to make it seem he did not care, and that revenge is not the main driver behind his actions. However, this revenge does not blind him, but rather makes the path more clear to him as he is able to see who the villains are.",10,10,18,18 November 2008
Independence Day," Fun summer blockbuster that some just took to seriously.
","I enjoyed this movie, sure it isn't the most original movie ever made or the best, but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50's plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70's.  A lot of critics don't like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don't care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like 'The Two Towers' where it doesn't feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn't as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50's science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70's disaster flick.  If you don't care for either of these genres you probably won't like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don't take it too seriously and have fun watching it.",8,217,355,7 May 2003
Alien vs. Predator," The Predator comes off as a bit wimpy in this one.
","All in all it was an okay movie, but it should have been much better.  It had its moments, but all in all it needed something more.  Mainly, it needed more alien vs predator and a lot less unknown gal and gang of merceneries running around pyramid.  This movie also makes the predator seem kind of wimpy...I came to this movie mainly to see them cause they have not been featured in a film since 1990, and they have only appeared in two films. They should also be able to take down an alien one on one if you can kill an alien with simple bullets as was seen in many of the alien movies.  Here though the aliens can take multiple stab wounds through the chest and body and still fight.  We are supposed to believe that the predators hunt these things as a right of passage, but if they were this tough I don't think any of them would have survived.  Still though it has some good action and there is one rather nice fight between the two combatants.  Still, this movie should have been better...I mean 'Freddy vs Jason' was better than this one, at least in their fight you could see what was going on all the time.  Here sometimes you just couldn't tell.  This one was fairly predictable too as you knew something was going to happen when the predator and lady were standing over the ice and you knew what it was going to be.  A plus though for this movie is that I can not believe it got a pg-13 rating.  It is a very hard one at that and you can tell it was edited down so there probably will be an R version on dvd.  Not that I am going to get it, it was an okay time killer and better than the last movie I saw at the theater, but it should have been a better movie.",6,7,13,16 August 2004
Batman Begins," Christian Bale is Batman.
","To my surprise I have to say this is now my favorite Batman movie yet. Why? Simply put, they finally have cast the right guy to be Batman, a Batman that can stand tall and carry the movie without the help of overly flashy villains who simply say one liners and have stupid plans that really go nowhere. Bale is great as the caped crusader as he actually looks the part both in face and in stature. It also helps that he has the voice for it as he doesn't have to whisper to sound tough. Sure Keaton has his backers, but he gets to many points simply because he was the first (though he was better than Kilmer and Clooney). We have an interesting plot here about how the Batman came into being and believe me he is first and foremost in this flick. The villains are good, perfect casting for the Scarecrow and he is like the comic book, but never does he overact and try to steal the show he is just an element of the plot. All the actors here were good, the story was good, simply put this was Batman as the Dark Knight, and yes this movie was dark. In fact, a bit more darker and an R rating might have been more appropriate. The action is great as no longer does it rely mainly on computer generated graphics, but more on stunts. The city of Gotham also looked great as it looked like a real city rather than a caricature of one with all the action taking place on one obvious set or another (ala the last two Batman movies). A nice twist was thrown in here and there as well, though I thought it was headed in the direction it went. The Batmobile looked rather cool too, it matched the one of the first and second movie in that it looked like a real vehicle rather than just a big toy. So if you go see this Batman, don't look for a goofy embarrassing comedy, but rather a sleek, dark movie more reminiscent of the Batman in the comic books.",10,1,3,23 June 2005
Liar Liar," Funny, but it did get overly sentimental at times too.
","This film came after the poorly received Jim Carrey film 'Cable Guy'. While I do say this one was better than that one, it was not really all that much better. It was funny watching an attorney that could not lie and the bizarre things he had to do at times to try and get around it and win the case, but it was also a bore watching him with his son and realizing how bad a father he was. It was also just embarrassing to watch him do that claw thing. The film is about a man who has not been the best father in the world and has a habit of breaking his promises. So his son decides to make a wish on his birthday that his father not be capable of lying and strangely it comes true. Funny scenes abound like his awkward elevator encounter, his courtroom antics and a very funny scene where he beats the crap out of himself. The film is just about all Jim Carrey as the only other character that made an impact is Jennifer Tilly as a very nasty woman who is suing for custody of her children and trying to get all the money she can from her husband. Still, Jim Carrey is pretty much on fire for most of the film and he had enough energy to carry this film at this time. I realize you had to have a reason for him to be incapable of lying, I just did not really care for the son and the family parts of the movie. Just a matter of personal taste.",7,1,1,11 December 2010
Meet the Fockers," As funny as 'Meet the Parents', but not as realistic.
","Or to put it another way, I found it as funny, but not as believable as the first movie. Still it was a good comedy...once again Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro are the stars of the show, but Dustin Hoffman and Streisand are very nice additions to the cast. It isn't without its flaws however, but neither was the first one. Though in this movie DeNiro's character seems to have reverted back to the way he was during 'Meet the Parents' and in some aspects he seems even worse this time. The RV seems a bit much too, I don't think they just give those out in the CIA. However, those minor faults aside it is well worth a look. I love the way the movie started out with everything going perfect for Focker and his bride to be, but you know the exact moment when the tides begin to turn with a simple bloody nose. Then comes the trip to meet Gaylord's family and they are a bit on the eccentric side to say the least. Jinx the cat returns as do a lot of the original cast including a cameo from Owen Wilson near the end.",8,0,0,4 May 2005
The Princess Bride," Nicely done fantasy romance comedy movie.
","This movie has a grandfather reading to his grandson, and we get to see the story he is reading unfold before our eyes.  Rather good movie that entertains in so many ways.  The cast is excellent, even Andre the Giant is very good in this one.  Turns out he is the only wrestler that can act.  The story is fast moving and has some nice twists and surprises along the way, they surprised me the first time I saw this one (I won't give anything away though).  What made this film good for me though was that it contained quite a lot of humor and it really worked well.  I loved Cary Elwes delivery and Patinkin was also very good in his role too.  Billy Crystal and Carol Kane also make memorable appearances in this one.  Though one of my favorite scenes has to be when Cary's character has a battle of wits with the one guy.  One of the funnier scenes I found in this one.  There are also nice set designs like in the fire swamp.  The periodic interruptions also work, as they never let you forget that it is a simple story being read by a grandfather.  Good movie all around and fun to watch.",8,3,5,20 July 2003
Saving Private Ryan," I enjoyed this war movie for the most part, but after the initial invasion of Normandy scene it falters a bit.
","This movie was like no other the first twenty or so minutes. It took you right into the heart of war like no other movie had done before. The action was tense, the carnage was in your face, and the blood flowed freely. Then the movie added a rather sad excuse for a plot and the rest of the movie suffers because of this. Not to say it was not a good movie from the moment they get the plot on, but it just feels cheapened by the whole, 'lets rescue this one dude' scenario. Most of the rest of the film is the troops searching from place to place with a few skirmishes here and there. An interesting subplot though involves one of the American soldiers calling for the release of a Nazi that the rest wanted to kill. I found how that played out to be very intriguing. It made for one of the tenses scenes in the movie in my eyes as the one guy was trying to drive the knife in another and you just knew the other guy was going to come in and turn the tide. The cast is excellent as Tom Hanks is at his best here, I can believe he did not get an Oscar for this one and he did get one for 'Forrest Gump'. The only member of the cast I did not care for all that much is Matt Damon in the role of Private Ryan, he just did not have a 1940's look to him, or like someone who had been in combat for a while like Hanks' troop. Still, overall this is a very good picture and while I never saw 'Shakespere in Love' I am still certain this film got robbed. Granted my score is not the best, but that is my level of enjoyment for the film. As a whole it most certainly merited some awards. Change the plot a bit though after the invasion scene and I think this one could have even been a ten to me, a person who really is not all into war movies.",Null,1,2,30 June 2010
1941," 1941...what an okay year.
","This film is not considered one of Steven Spielbergs greatest movies, in fact it is usually considered one of his most disappointing flicks on his resume. Me, I actually enjoyed this movie for what it was. Its main problem from me stems from the fact it is rather long and comedies that tend to go beyond the one hour 45 minute mark are getting a tad to long. The film is basically about a Japanese submarine that causes the residents of Hollywood to get very paranoid. In their paranoia they do some wild and crazy things. Featuring Saturday Night alum Dan Akroyd and John Belushi and a whole slew of other actors this movie sends one on a crazy ride. Though to me John Belushi steals the show as he makes an immediate impression as a pilot who stops at a gas station to gas up his plane. Also making a bit of a humorous impression is fellow alum Dan Akroyd who was very funny near the end during the tank ride. Also of note in this film is Robert Stack who is not the funniest person in the film, but still manages some good laughs as he sits watching the Disney film 'Dumbo'. A lot of the film though is just things blowing up which is not necessarily a good thing in a comedy film. The story at times is here and there and I was not overly happy with the ending mainly because as a kid I wanted to know if John Belushi's character somehow got out of the situation he was in. Still, I enjoyed this film and do not understand why people dislike it so much.",7,0,2,21 July 2010
28 Days Later...," They said 'if you like Dawn of the Dead, you will love this'. They were wrong.
","I had heard all the hype and read the reviews. Everyone said this was a good movie...a 'Dawn of the Dead' type movie. This movie doesn't even come close. First of all, it is not a zombie movie at all. The people seem to have rabies and are called the infected. Sure they may attack humans, but that does not make them the undead. The undead are usually a lot tougher to kill. This one starts out promising enough with a guy waking up in a hospital naked (could have done without the full nudity) and everything in the city is deserted. The movie makers did a great job of making the city look empty. The guy goes into a church and encounters one of the rabid infected people and makes a run for it. He runs into two survivors and there are some good scenes here including the only gory death in the movie when a gal has to kill her friend. Then the movie becomes very dull and the infected are seen almost not at all. I think the 'Hulk' had more screen time than the so-called zombies in this movie. The two remaining members end up finding more survivors. A father and his daughter and this dude with a bat who for some reason is only shown once and never seen again. The group has this peppy conversation on how they need each other and decide to go on a road trip to a place they heard about on the radio. I was waiting for them to start singing 'There's got to be a morning after'. They embark on their road trip and it is a three-day trip. During the trip they have a rather good stop in the tunnel, one of the last good scenes in the movie where they encounter the infected. The rest of their road trip is nice and bland...they stay out in the open and no 'zombies' bother them. The 'zombies' apparently are drawn only to candles and not to bonfires. The heroes get to the army base and of course the army has ulterior motives that have nothing to do with the 'zombies' and the rest of the movie just sucks. I am still waiting for the violent, gory finale I was promised by a reviewer. I really have to wonder if those who compared this to 'Dawn of the Dead' have actually seen Dawn? Sure Romero used a story too, but he had lots more action and gore and horror. He never forgot that the main reason we went to his movies was to see zombies.",3,1,3,28 June 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," This movie just sucked...*warning contains spoilers!!!
","This movie was really bad.  Seeing the previews I was expecting so much, but got so little.  It is hard to find a point to start with my complaints but here goes.  First, were the previews themselves, they led me to believe the army was going to raid the island.  That would have been great some dinosaurs getting blasted, some army men getting killed. Instead the army was not involved very much and it was just the same ol look at the dinosaurs aren't they neat!  Jeff Goldblum's character is the only member remaining from the first one that remembers dinosaurs were on the island.  Who knew the old man made them sign a I will keep my mouth shut contract because know one will believe me anyway.  And what is the point of his daughter the super gymnst who can kick a raptor down, but couldn't make the team?  That is just one example of the flaws in this movie.  Another major problem was when the T-Rex was shipped to the US.  It arrives locked in the bunker and the crew is all gone except an arm here and there.  What the heck happened to the darn crew?  The T-rex was locked below, did he just decide to go back down, did the crew eat each other, or maybe they simply exploded (because let's face it there was no damage to the ship and a T-rex running amok on deck will cause some).  And who thought of the last part of the movie.  Apparently you were supposed to root for Goldblum and Moore locking the T-rex in the cargo hold and not the person about to blast the thing and end its artificial life.  This after the t-rex killed many innocent people and a doggy.  I am sorry I was close to yelling waste him in the theater.  To sum up this movie sucks, big time!  I saw this movie once and I never want to see it again. My final gripe is another stupid problem with this film.  Does every single person killed have to flop behind a tree or car before there eaten.  I understand that they wanted to keep this PG-13, but really everyone looked like rodeo clowns.",2,11,37,3 April 2001
Avengers: Infinity War," Exactly what I was hoping for and what I've been waiting for
","I enjoy the whole Marvel comic universe thing they have going on now as to me having beloved characters I have seen in the comics and were a part of my childhood on the big screen is simply amazing. Then, like a comic book, I can be watching one characters film and another hero can appear. I loved crossover comics and I love crossover movies as well! This film features several comic book characters and Thanos, whom I have been anticipating in a Marvel movie since they teased him in the original Avengers film. I was disappointed a bit by the second Avengers film (still enjoyed it overall) as they went with Ultron as the villain and then later got more disappointed when I read somewhere that the Abomination was originally going to be in the film, but they scrapped the idea. That would have really given that film the kick it needed. This one though was not a disappointment at all as I got to see Thanos be as totally awesome as he is in the comics and I got to see many of my favorite superheros on the big screen at the same time!The story has Thanos, the mad titan, collecting infinity stones as he makes quick work of both the Hulk and Thor! The Asgardian ship seen in the previous Thor film is decimated as Thanos collects yet another stone and soon sends his children to Earth to collect the stone within Vision's forehead and the one protected by Dr. Strange. Thanos, himself, goes to the collector to retrieve the stone left in the Collector's care. Tony Stark ends up getting a warning from old friend Bruce Banner who gets back to Earth thanks to Heimdall and soon the children of Thanos make their attack as Tony must once again don the Iron Man armor to fight off these attackers and try to protect Dr. Strange's time stone. He gets some help from his friendly neighborhood protege, but all three end up on the ship of this weird dude who has very powerful telekinetic powers. Bruce Banner is left on Earth and he makes the call to Captain America who has to try and hold off the hordes of creatures that come for Vision's stone and does so by going to Wakanda where he will get the aid of the Black Panther and his old friend. Meanwhile, the Guardians of the Galaxy recover Thor and soon Thor, Groot and Rocket go to a place where Thor can get a powerful weapon to fight Thanos, while the rest of the Guardians try to stop Thanos at the Collector's. The power Thanos wields though is truly terrifying and things keep becoming vastly more difficult for all the heroes!The thing I enjoyed most was seeing all the different heroes interacting together. I was not expecting Dr. Strange, Spider-man or the Guardians to be in the film as much as they were. I was expecting more like extended cameos. I enjoyed watching Iron Man and the group on Titan fighting Thanos as they did a really amazing job of combating him. The only thing I wish there was more of is Captain America as he just did not really factor into the movie much at all being a bit ineffective. I also want him back with his regular shield too! Still, just a minor complaint in a movie that completely wowed me for the most part. So yes, this was a very good comic book movie. I do believe I enjoyed it more than the first Avenger film which I also loved as this one was just so overwhelming and did so many cool things. This one also featured the best villain in Thanos, who they did really good with, making him almost sympathetic at times. The action was great in this one as all the battles were totally off the chain and as I said watching Dr. Strange, Iron Man and Starlord together on the same screen was simply great. I look forward to the next Avengers film coming thankfully next year. At first I thought it was not coming out until 2020, that would have been a very difficult wait!",10,1,7,2 July 2018
Aladdin," It was all right, but nothing you haven't seen before
","I am not sure what is up with the trend of Disney redoing their old animated classics and turning them live action. Well, okay, there is the whole money thing; however, that does not really explain why people want to see almost the exact same film again or why Disney is releasing so many of these live action adaptations in 2019 as there have been two so far and at least one more to go. I would probably spread them out a bit, hold one back for hard times or something. This one is the live action Aladdin, and it was okay, but nothing that will blow you away in terms of new content.The story is essentially the same as Aladdin dreams of wooing Jasmine the princess. He is given the opportunity to enter a cave and retrieve something for Jafar and it turns out to be a lamp containing a magical genie. Well, Aladdin now has three wishes and Jafar has schemes of his own as Aladdin wishes to win the princess and Jafar wishes to rule the kingdom!The casting was pretty good as I thought Will Smith as the genie was the highlight of the film and he held it together making it more enjoyable. The guy who played Aladdin was rather good and Jasmine was most definitely a much better looking counterpart to the Disney princess she was playing in comparison to Emma Watson's Bell. Was not wild about the guy playing Jafar though as he did not really seem all that evil and also did not really look the part to me.So, this live action adaptation was better to me than the Beauty and the Beast one, it seemed more like a movie. That one seemed like some sort of special one would see on ABC to me for some reason. It was a bit tedious at first, but once Will Smith entered the picture as the genie I thought the film livened up a lot and was more enjoyable. There are a few new things added to this as the genie has a love interest, but for the most part, it is essentially the same film with not too much in there to surprise. Next up, the live action Lion King which my wife will probably also want to go to.",7,2,5,17 June 2019
Ghost Rider," A super high concept movie that will move you to tears and change your life, no...still a fun ride all the same.
","Yes this movie was probably in the end a pure popcorn flick that many will hate, however I thought it was a good fun movie. Rather nice treatment for a comic book hero that isn't exactly super well known or famous. Ghost Rider blazes on the big screen and the effects are rather good considering the character of Ghost Rider is essentially a skeleton in leather riding a motorcycle and he is on fire. The story seems to combine the two Ghost Riders I am familiar with from the marvel universe...the first one was Johnny Blaze who sold his soul to the devil. The second one being more a spirit of vengeance who used his stare to show evildoers the wrongs they have committed. I thought Cage was rather good in his role as were the other actors...I mean this is a comic book movie not an Oscar caliber movie we are talking about here. So all in all it is fun, could have used maybe a little more Ghost Rider here and there and perhaps a trim or two here or there to cut the running time, for the most part there are very few complaints by me. Ghost Rider is a comic I collected at one time, so it is kind of cool to see him on the big screen. However, don't go by my review alone in determining whether you will see this flick, as I love comic book adapted movies to a fault...that and horror so I may like stuff other more casual fans may not.",8,5,9,23 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Good movie...but if it is the 'Last Stand' it should have been more.
","I enjoyed this movie better than the first one, but it lacked what the second movie had. Still many good things were to be found in this movie as I really enjoyed the fact Magneto really showed how powerful he was with some really jaw dropping deeds in magnetism. Beast was finally a main player and played really well by Kelsey Grammar. Great ending fight scene between our hero's and Magneto's virtual army and the Juggarnaut was just great. Still it had some flaws too, if this is supposed to be the final movie I didn't care for the fate of one of my favorite X-men from the comics (though admittedly not everyone else's favorite) though reading through some blogs I understand why now (I think I would rather have him recast instead). The plot needed more development as the Dark Phoenix plot mixed with the cure plot needed more than just an hour and forty five minutes coverage. They could have easily added at least thirty to forty minutes of movie. Then there are the characters that were not very distinct...other than Pyro and Juggernaut I didn't really recognize anyone in Magneto's army and I hear Pyslocke was one of em. And why oh why didn't two of the characters that you would expect to trade punches never did (you know who I am talking about). All in all it was a great thrill ride with wonderful special effects. Ian and Patrick Stewart once again steal their scenes, but nearly everyone did a good job. If this was the last one (and I hope it isn't) it was a rather nice end, however, if they choose to make more I will be on board and quite frankly the way the left it they need more.",9,2,4,28 May 2006
Hellboy," Ron Pearlman makes this one.
","What do you expect though, he is the title character and he is the main focus.  That is Ron Pearlman though, he is an underrated actor and it is nice to see him as the star in a rather big movie.  This movie is good too, but not without its flaws.  The main problem I had with it other than the John Hurt character and Hellboy, no other character is really all that developed.  Which is probably fine if you read the comics, but I have not so I would have liked to have known a little more about some of the characters. This is especially the case with the villains...all three were underdeveloped with the lady in the group being the most so.  I would have also liked to have seen more monsters rather than the same one they had through the whole picture.  Still though this movie was good as it had great action, the effects were good and there was good humor in it as well.  And as I said before Pearlman was great.  The plot is more of an origin type plot which is to be expected for the first movie of any comic character.  A little more development would have helped it a bit, but all in all this is one wild ride with a lot of cool looking locations.",8,0,0,3 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," As good as the first.
","This movie was as thouroughly enjoyable as the first chapter in the story. The acting was great, the special effects were great, and the story was great.  It is shaping up to be my favorite trilogy of all time.  This one follows three stories one of Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor, one of the two hobbits kidnapped in the first one, and the other of Aragon, Gimley, and Legolos and their encounters.  The one that is the main focus to me was the Aragon tale and it was by far the best.  The other two were good as well, but most of the battles happened in the Aragon parts of the story.  I also really enjoyed the expanded roles of Gimley the Drawf and Legolos the elf.  Great effects also abound in this one as the creature Gollum looks a lot better than I thought it would.  Just a great movie, I can't believe there are people that gave this movie a 1.  I mean even if you hated some part of it the scenery alone makes the at least a 3.  I am thinking these people were dragged to the movie kicking and screaming which is why you should never take someone to a movie they don't want to see cause then they give it a 1 out of spite.  It is either that or they are star wars fans who can't stand that there movies don't get the great reviews anymore.",10,1,2,19 December 2002
The Lion King," Pretty much everything you've seen before...
","Once again, I somehow avoided these films when they were animated back in the day, but forced to go to the live action remakes today thanks to the wife. I saw the original one on VHS and it was pretty good, certainly seen a lot worse; however, I never said to myself, 'This would be so much better if it were like a nature documentary'. That is pretty much all they did to change this as the story is pretty much exactly the same. I cannot really fault Disney for this lazy approach to making films as the masses are eating it up like leftover spaghetti. Why make anything new, original or that isn't a comic movie as so many things have flopped badly when they try a different formula or try and adapt a novel. The best approach these days is just keep doing the same stuff and that is what this film pretty much does and though I thought it lacked a certain cuteness and expression turned into real looking animals, I cannot argue the profits it is turning.The story, well, the king of the Pride Land and his wife have a child named Simba and the king's brother Scar who wishes to be king is not overjoyed by this arrival. He tries to hatch a plan to kill his nephew and then hatches a plan to kill the king. Simba leaves the Pride Land and meets a warthog and meerkat who teach Simba to just forget everything and don't care, but a childhood friend sends Simba back to the land of his birth to take his place as the rightful king.The film has issues for me and the main one is the facial expression is just not there. They may as well be doing the whole using peanut butter to make it look like they are talking here. I would think with all the advancements made in computer generated graphics that they could make Simba and company look happy, sad and show other emotions and still make the animals look real. Sadly, no, they either could not or wanted this to look as real as possible; however, if you wanted that, why make the animals talk at all? May as well have taken the Milo and Otis approach and get one actor to do a voice over. Speaking of voice overs, whoever thought that not bringing back Jeremy Irons as Scar is a complete and utter moron!So there you have it, my review of a movie that I feel was pointless to be made, but I am apparently alone in this thinking as the movie has done quite well. It is pretty much watching the Lion King again only with real animals and a strange change to daytime while, 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' was being performed. Seriously? What is up with that one? Too expensive to have CGI night or something? It is cute to see the lions as cubs, but the film just lacks the power of the original. I will not call it a wasted trip to the movies though as my wife enjoyed it and she is the one who wished to see it.",5,4,5,21 August 2019
The Incredibles," An 'Incredible' triumph in the genre of super hero movies.
","I am not the biggest computer generated movie fan there is, but I have to hand it to Pixar, they made one of the best movies of 2004 with this hit 'The Incredibles'. In fact, of all the movies I saw last year the only one I rank ahead of it is another super hero movie 'Spider-man 2'. Of course, I enjoy super hero flicks so they had that going for them. This movie centers around a super hero forced to live an ordinary life after certain problems arise during a rescue of a person falling from a building and a train accident. The super hero (Mr. Incredible) isn't adjusting to life as an ordinary guy to well. He keeps helping those in need even at the risk of losing money for his company. I found this trait most endearing, because it showed he was not in the biz merely for the glory, but that he truly wants to help people. So much so that he goes out one night a week with his old super hero buddy 'Frozone' and they stop some crimes. However, when Mr. Incredible gets an invitation to go to an island and do his super hero thing he leaps at the opportunity. Eventually, this leads to his capture and the rest of the family must come to the rescue. Every aspect of this film was great, I loved that this film was actually rather long as it is one of the rare animated movies that really has a chance to develop a good story. You aren't going to be to surprised by many things, but here you just do not need to be surprised. The voices are all great headlined terrifically by Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter. Good laughs, good action, and an all around good movie are awaiting you in this little treasure. I especially liked Dash's sprint through the forest. If I had any complaints it might be that I wish Samuel L Jackson's character Frozone was in it a bit more.",10,2,4,10 April 2005
The Mist," Overcomes rather weak at times looking beasties with a good story about what fear and the unknown can do.
","Yes, this movie has monsters in it...for the most part giant insects. They are, however, the weakest link in this film as they look only a bit better than say a creature from one of the sci-fi channel's original productions. I think they should have used computer generated graphics a bit less, especially when the creatures got a hold of something and this flaw could have been overcome easily enough. That being said, the story and the characters make this one and they make it rather good. I also have to agree with what is said on the DVD box...it does have a rather shocking ending and horrifying too. I hated it, yet I hated it not because it was bad, but because it did what a good horror movie is supposed to do, shock you and make you think about it thereafter. The story, nearly straight from the original short novel by Stephen King. The main differences was that there was not as much setup before the storm or during as there was in the story. That and the ending. Other than that and the military men playing a bit bigger role it is a very by the book movie. There is a storm and a father and son and neighbor go to the store to restock some groceries. However, there is a mist coming and it quickly envelopes the store and makes those inside hesitant to come out as a man runs wildly in the store talking of things in the mist that took someone. Well fear takes over as the father quickly figures out there is something about the mist and a scene of a brave, but foolhardy bag boy proves there is something in the mist. Unfortunately, not all those in the store believe this and even more unfortunately some people in the store believe this is the end of times brought on by an angry God. So paranoia and fear take a hold and general chaos is in the air. Played out very well, but man the ending. I am imagining Stephen King, the master of horror seeing it for the first time and saying 'Damn, that is dark'! Dark, disturbing, and very effective.",8,2,5,27 March 2008
I Am Legend," Good movie, but man I was depressed afterwords.
","Yes, this movie has a bit of 'the Omega Man' and 'The last man on Earth' in it, but for the most part it is its own movie. It starts out with the world in ruins, well New York in ruins and you are introduced to Robert Neville who may be the last man on earth. You are also introduced to Sam his faithful German Shepard, which struck a chord with me as I used to own one of those myself and love that particular breed. You get to see how he spends a typical day in his life and you also are introduced to those things that lurk in the darkness and only come out at night. However, at this stage those that come out at night seem to be targeting our hero. So we have some good chase scenes, and some good action, but you also have a couple of scenes that are really depressing especially if you like dogs. Our hero is not alone for the entire picture, however, as he comes across a lady and her son, well they kind of come across him. There are also flashbacks detailing the beginning of the end of civilization. The creatures are different than those in Omega Man and Last Man too as they are more like that infected from 28 days later though they do share the pale traits of the omega ones. All in all a good movie that left me depressed.",9,1,4,1 January 2008
Ghostbusters," Who ya gonna call?
","This is one of my favorite comedies of the 80's.  This movie revolves around three paranormal researchers studying ghosts played brilliantly by Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis.  They end up getting kicked off the campus where they worked and decide to open a business that gets rid of ghosts.  They basically get no calls at first except for a lady who saw a vision in her refrigerator (Signorey Weaver).  The guys soon though receive their first call and go and fight a ghost in a hotel.  This sparks a rash of callers and the Ghost Busters are in business.  This movie is great as it has good comedy and a great cast that also includes Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson (who becomes a Ghost Buster after awhile).  This movie also sparked a short-lived pizza chain and a rather good cartoon. This one is also, a whole lot better than the sequel that would come out five years later.",9,0,0,7 April 2003
Hero," Beautiful movie...both visually and story wise.
","I have to admit I was expecting a bit more action, however, I was not disappointed in the least watching this movie. This had to be one of the most gorgeous movies to look at I have seen. The use of colors and the locations were just great. As if that were not enough it had a very good and emotional story to go along with it. The first part of the movie contains the most action as there are some good fight scenes plus other visual action scenes. The arrow scene and the fight between the two women in the orchid are both very well done. Then the movie shifts in more of a story mode as things are revealed and sacrifices made. The movie unfolds from different perspectives as the one known only as Nameless tells his story to the emperor. The characters all have some rather cool names as well such as Flying Snow and Broken Sword. The movie is a bit of a sad one, but it works very well. I was also happy they kept it with subtitles rather than dubbing as dubbing can ruin a movie of this sort.",10,2,3,15 September 2004
X-Men: Apocalypse," The X-men just band together to avoid the Apocalypse!
","My expectations were low coming into this one so I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It was not perfect, a Bryan Singer X-men film is never going to be perfect at this point, but it did contain a lot of cool action and quite a few mutants. Sure, I was not happy when I initially saw that Storm, Magneto and Psylocke were three of Apocalypse's horsemen in the film when none of them were in the comics; however, the story of why those three joined worked enough that I am not quite as baffled as I first was. I was disappointed by the fact that Angel was a bit more underutilized again, not sure why they find it so difficult to do him, but he does have more of a part here than in the his other film, X-men: The Last Stand which this film takes a jab at. I thought that was uncalled for, I do not understand why everyone dislikes that one so much as that one still has some of the better action sequences and fight sequences of any of the X-men films. A lot of people have been panning this one too, but as I said, I enjoyed it as I was expecting to dislike it quite a bit more than I did. It did do some things I was not fond of, but for the most part this one delivered for me.The story brings us back to Egypt where a strange being with great powers is about to transfer his consciousness over to a person who has great healing ability. This process is interrupted by people who tire of this being, claiming he is a false god and they collapse the pyramid. Unfortunately, the false god is not killed, but only locked away in a sleep. Flash years later and we witness a young Scott Summers learning his amazing ability, Mystique still trying to rescue her fellow mutants and Magneto trying to live life as an ordinary man. Things begin to be set in motion; however, and soon Apocalypse has awakened and he immediately takes a young girl who controls the weather under his wing and gives her incredible powers. He also finds a young woman named Psylocke, Angel and Magneto and he begins his plans to destroy the world and create it anew! Only the new students at Xavier's school for the gifted stand in his way of world domination! Once again, Mystique plays an important role in this film and pretty much aligns with the good guys. Once again, this baffles me as she was never that important in the comic and she never really joined up with the X-men, at least not up to the point I was reading them. They did do a good job of giving Storm and Magneto reasons for joining Apocalypse, but I was kind of disappointed by the way Psylocke was depicted as my mother who had never read the comics assumed that she was a villain in the comics. She is a good guy and though she looks the most like her character than any other character depicted in a Singer film, he managed to make her look too villainous. Nightcrawler was done well and though I still think they do not make Scott as good as he was in the comics he was done better here than the rest of the films. He actually got some good hits in this time! Of course, Quicksilver was once again quick and the most funny of the characters.So this one was good, could have been better, but I will not complain too much. The film is rated PG-13, but it has to be a pretty hard PG-13 as there were some pretty graphic deaths throughout this one. It would not have taken much more to make it an R. It was nice to have a different villain this time in Apocalypse and from the post credit scene if they do another film it will be another villain in that film as well. Though next up will be the next Wolverine film and after that probably Deadpool before another X-men comes out; granted, Deadpool more than likely does not exist in this universe though his character is owned by Fox too. Not sure how he'd do in one of these films, but I do know he would want to be the one to drop the one F-bomb in a most likely PG-13 X-men film. This one was not perfect, but better than expected so overall I was happy with the result and not mad I dropped money to see it in the theaters.",8,15,25,6 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," This Spider-man is amazing and electrifying
","I went and saw this movie last week and enjoyed it immensely. I also enjoyed the previous Amazing Spider-man film, and quite frankly I liked all three of the previous trilogy as well. Okay, I am a huge Spider-man fan so almost anything with him in it is going to be something that in all likelihood I am going to enjoy. Heck, I even liked that live action series they did back in the 1970's featuring our favorite wall crawler in Los Angeles where he essentially shot huge ropes and fought criminal types. So yeah, I am probably not the most unbiased reviewer when it comes to our friendly neighborhood Spider-man. Still, I really like where this particular series is going, though surprisingly, this series seems like it is you either really love it or hate it. Kind of like last year's Man of Steel film. Still, to me, this film and the last one kind of capture the essence of Spidey a bit more than the previous three, in that when Spider-man is doing his thing, it just seems more like out of a comic book. Then again, the previous films were well done too and were first, so often times first trumps for no other reason than they were our first experience.The story has Peter Parker/Spider-man fighting crime and having an on again and off again relationship with Gwen as his strong love for her and his need to keep her father's promise keep colliding. A man who for the most part has gone unnoticed takes an extreme liking to the wall crawler and then there is also an extreme shakeup at Oscorp as Norman Osborn's son has returned into the picture. All are linked by Oscorp as an accident will soon spawn a new deadly Spider-man foe as well as a father's gift to his son.The villains were done very well. I liked Jamie Foxx's Electro whom many complain did not look like the Electro from the comics they read. He most certainly did not look like the Electro from the main series, but he does look a lot like the one from the ultimate series. There is also the Green Goblin and the Rhino for Spider-man to contend with as well, but Electro is by far the main one this time. All looked cool, but the best part were the fights, where James Garfield just does a better job at trash talking the enemies. Tobey made a good Peter Parker, but he never exhibited Spider-man's constant prattle that in the comics at times unhinged the enemies and lead to many a victory for Spidey, or made the enemy explode in a rage that made his trash talking backfire big time! I am enjoying this new series of Spider-man films; though, even I admit they came a bit too soon on the heels of the first trilogy. I also hate it that the first set of films never had any closure, and I hope that will not be the case here. I find this series is doing a better job of establishing super villains, as there is a source and reason for them that is tied together, while the first one it was all pretty random and the coincidences just a bit too far fetched. However, I enjoyed those Spider-man films a lot and I am enjoying these a lot. Would it be cool if Spider-man could be in the universe of Marvel characters Disney and Marvel is establishing, absolutely. With that said though, I think Sony is doing a pretty good job. The main thing I disliked about this film is the strange inclusion of an X-men clip in the credits. I saw no point to this as it had no ties to the film I had just viewed, I read what was originally supposed to be included and it was a lot better than the very random clip I got. Overall, though, Spider-man made for another fun, summer film; however, once again I am a Spider-man fan so they really did not have to do much to impress me admittedly.",9,3,11,14 May 2014
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not only does the Silver Surfer rise, but also the rest of the Fantastic Four.
","This is a summer movie to be sure. It has action, comedy, and a little heart as well. It is not going to win awards, it is not going to be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece, but it is still a very good movie. Add to that it is also short, something all summer movies should aspire to do. Granted, when first I heard of the running time I thought for sure this film would be underdeveloped, however my fears proved groundless as this movie's story was very well done with no loose ends unlike some movie's this year that ran nearly twice as long. I liked it better than the first movie as the comedy was funny and the action was rather nice too. The story has a mysterious force on Earth causing a bit of havoc as water is turned to glass and snow in the deserts. Even strange occurrences happen in Lateveria which is trouble for all. The Fantastic Four though are trying to make a wedding happen while balancing being super heroes and celebrities. The army wants Reed's help to track the force and Reed does, though without Susan's knowledge. Well the big wedding day occurs and it is promptly interrupted by a mysterious being seemingly made of Silver and riding what appears to be a surf board. The Fantastic Four must stop this being and find out his motivations before there is real trouble. Though they do get help in the form of Dr. Doom, which let's face it is probably going to be trouble later on. So yes, there is some good action, comedy and very good special effects. A great fight at the end with who you want to see the Fantastic Four fighting and a nifty climax featuring a very close call. To top it all off you also get out of the movie theater before you age a great deal as well.",9,5,10,22 June 2007
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Great anime movie from the past.
","I saw this movie as a kid under the title 'Warriors of the Wind'. Didn't really understand it much then, but I sort of liked it. Then I saw it for sale on DVD and had to buy it cause I wanted to see it with the original Japanese voicing and it was great. I was either not paying attention when I watched it as a kid, or the Japanese version made more sense than the English dubbing one. This movie revolves around this young princess and the valley she lives in. A peaceful place that lies on the boarder of a deadly toxic forest that threatens to consume the world. There is also wars going on between other nations and one of the wars is being taken to the peaceful valley. The war is over an ancient creature known simply as the giant warrior. Though in truth the giant warrior really doesn't amount to much in the end. Rather good artwork here and a good story really hook you in. And it is not a typical short cartoon movie, it is rather lengthy so the story really has a chance to develop.",9,1,3,21 March 2005
Transformers," This film is more than meets the eye, that is for sure.
","This film was a real pleasure to behold. Seeing my beloved childhood toys and favorite cartoon explode on the big screen in a way I never imagined was just way to cool. I never thought they could make a live action Transformers that could look so realistic, but they proved me wrong. The story, well it is the Autobots versus the Decepticons of course. Granted there is more to it than that as they are trying to get to this mysterious artifact called the cube before the other group. We also have a young youth in search of his first car, lots of humor and a lot of action as well. The only complaints I have are minor as I would have liked to have seen some of the Decepticons a bit more, as Starscream and Megatron are confined to the end of the film. However, I got to see Optimus Prime a good bit so I will not complain to much about that. The action is great in this movie, as we start off with one rather impressive attack on a military base that really sets up the movie with a bang. We then have numerous other scenes of the Decepticons trying to search for the whereabouts of the cube and Megatron who has a connection with the boy searching for his first car. We have a great scene involving a Decepticon cop car and Bumble Bee (one of the Autobots) and at the end all the ends tie together in one fierce battle in the middle of a city. Great fight and an impressive conclusion to this movie. So be prepared to watch one of the more fun and action packed movies of the summer as the Autobots fight the evil forces of the Decepticons.",10,1,7,19 July 2007
Men in Black II," I think the makers of the film thought we had somewhere to go.
","This movie is the sequel of course to the hit movie 'Men In Black'.  I gave this movie a six, but I felt like being generous (I probably should give it a five).  This movie is short.  I mean really, really short.  There is a short that preceded the movie so that tells you how short this movie is (the short got more laughs than the movie I think).  I went to this movie knowing how short it was, but it just went by so fast and the movie was a bit unmemorable that it was a waste of time to drive to the theater.  There was no time for character development or much story development.  In fact, the opening credit scene itself took four or five minutes.  The story has Smith's character trying to get the memory back of Jones character to battle an alien threat.  For the most part there isn't much that is funny in this one, but there are a few scenes to make a person chuckle.  Then there is the pug dog.  I think it had the same screen time as Tommy Lee Jones.  It was funny in small doses, but its role was expanded way too much for the sequel. Johnny Knoxville's character was lame as was the main villain, which had looks but no funny dialogue at all.  Tony Shaloub is back, and once again his character's role is small and underused.  So all in all this is an inferior sequel by all means with just enough to look at to keep you from getting bored.  If they ever make a part three, please let them get a director who is capable of making a movie.",6,28,53,9 May 2003
Big Hero 6," A very good movie from Disney.
","I enjoyed this Disney film as it is a movie about a group of smart kids trying to take on a villain. However, I enjoyed the movie more when it was the kid Hiro and the inflatable robot Baymax interacting as the film was more humorous during these stages. It kind of turns into more of an action film when Hiro becomes dead set on finding out and stopping the person who stole his inventions. Still, it was good in this phase, but watching Baymax cross a room and getting around stuff was super funny.The story has a young boy who has already graduated high school and instead of taking the next step to college, he instead uses a robot to win money bot fighting. His older brother tries to get him on the right path by introducing his brother to his friends from school and his invention Baymax. This does the trick and so Hiro invents something called microbots that the head of the brother's school likes enough to enlist Hiro into the school. Unfortunately, there is an explosion and Hiro's brother dies; however, the strange discovery of a warehouse mass producing Hiro's microbots sends Hiro on a quest for revenge! He soon enlists his brother's friends help as he designs suits that use the super brainy teens specialties as powers.The film has a lot of memorable moments as it is fun watching Baymax first appearances. I also liked it when Hiro was designing the other's suits. After that, it becomes more of an action film as they try and find out the identity of the villain and stop him when they learn of his insane plan. I liked the characters, Baymax being my favorite, love it when his battery is going low and he is petting the cat going, 'Hairy baby.'So, this one was a really good film from Disney. It came after Frozen and a lot of people seem to get angry that this one did not catch on fire the way Frozen did; however, Frozen did have songs that were really catchy so that is probably what gave it an edge. Seriously, I think both films were made by the same person anyways so I am sure he doesn't care that this one did not do what Frozen did as it still performed very well at the box office. Still do not understand why a film with no sets and no actors can cost over 150 million though...",8,1,1,18 December 2019
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Has more of the spirit of the video game than did the first movie.
","This movie was a bit of a surprise to me. I thought it would be a pretty decent flick worthy of passing some time, instead I find one of the better action movies I have seen all year. I am one of the few who liked the first one, but this one is much better. I just thought it was more like the game itself without taking itself to seriously or getting to campy. You are thrust into the action right away as people fight for survival against the undead in Racoon City and it all looks really good. Most impressive is the lack of rampant cgi effects or cgi monsters. I do believe the one's with the tongues are the only totally cgi monsters in the movie. The nemesis monster is done completely with makeup it seems and makes me think maybe they could have made a Hulk using the same technique. This one picks up where the last one left off as Alice finds herself in the middle of a virtual war. The additions to the cast are all welcome changes from the last movie as the person who plays Jill Valentine both looks and acts like the character from the game. Scores of undead are killed and various other monsters and enemies line the path as we follow a group of survivors desperate to get out of the sealed city. Kind of sad that this one is so good and it is based on a video game and a movie based on a comic 'Alien Vs Predator' was not nearly as good.",9,3,6,15 September 2004
Dumb and Dumber," My favorite Farrelly brother comedy.
","Yes, I like this one a lot more than Something About Mary, which was pretty good, but this one was so much more funny to me.  Mary had great moments, but there were also quite a few slow stretches...these are, however, common in all the Farrelly brother movies.  Not this one though.  This is there only comedy where there virtually are no slow stretches...it is one gag after another, never slowing up for a moment at all.  Carrey and Daniels are great with each other, they have good chemistry...it is to bad the sequel will feature neither of them, which means the sequel will probably suck. The movie is simple enough to follow, as two men of lower intelligence embark on a quest to return a briefcase to a woman.  This woman, though, left the briefcase on purpose as it contained a ransom.  So the two dummies now have killers on their trail and run into a lot of other misadventures on their quest to return the case.  All in all, a very funny flick that is funny all the way through.",10,8,16,7 March 2003
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the Galaxy was a blast and my favorite movie of the year so far
","Earlier this year I saw the Captain America sequel and remarked that so far it was my favorite of the films released since The Avengers. However, I also remarked that Guardians of the Galaxy was coming out and it looked like it might be pretty good so it had a chance to be the best. Turns out, it is the best so far! I saw it a week after its release, usually I would have written a review by now, but been busy with a new house and all and I have limited access to the internet. Suffice to say, the numbers are pretty much making me think that others think this is the best one too as the only one that it probably will not outdo is the third installment of Iron Man as far as box office. This movie features a team of offbeat heroes that come together to utilize each others strengths and hide the weaknesses and is a very funny movie with good action as well. It has everything one looks for in a comic movie and I do believe one of the reasons it is a bit better is the fact we are all a bit less familiar with these particular heroes than say those on the X-men or say the Avengers.The story has a young boy visiting his mother one last time in the hospital. The woman dies and the boy runs out of the hospital and cries in the middle of a field where he is abducted by aliens. Years later this young boy is now a young man who calls himself Star Lord. He is after a strange artifact on a planet that appears in ruins. He is confronted and then escapes others after the strange artifact. Star Lord soon finds a bounty on him as the aliens who abducted him and are basically space pirates called Grievers want the artifact as well. Also, after this artifact is one of the most powerful villains in the galaxy, Thanos and he sends his daughter after it as well. Well Star Lord soon finds Thanos' daughter and a raccoon named Rocky and his partner, a tree alien named Groot are after them and after a scramble to get the artifact and get away, they all find themselves locked up in a prison where they meet another alien named Drax, that wishes Thanos' daughter dead. However, they soon will learn to work together and learn what the precious artifact is and how deadly it potentially is in the hands of someone dastardly or anyone for that matter! The film is really good, as I've said, and I believe it has to do with the characters. They are all very unique and they all have their quirks. From the womanizing Star Lord, the can't get a metaphor Drax, to the daughter of the evil Thanos, to the mechanical Rocky with a wicked sense of humor to Groot who can only say, 'I am Groot', this group is very humorous to watch. I do believe it helps that not many people are familiar with this team, as all the members got to shine. Unlike say a film like X-men where there are so many casual fans so a character like Wolverine is always seemingly showcased and the team leader Cyclops gets portrayed as a wimp when anyone who reads the comics can attest he once fought all the X-men, including Wolverine to a standstill. That is the problem with having so many cartoons, people with limited knowledge draw conclusions and the movie studios cater to them. Like Spider-man. Anyone who has read the comics knows the villains that have been his biggest tormentors are Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. Venom is all the casual fan wants to see, even though he was only a big time villain for like a five year stretch. Here, though, no one stands out as there is no Wolverine or to a lesser degree Iron Man and I think that is what helped this movie. People thought the fact this was a lesser known comic would hurt, but in actuality it may have helped it.So, this film is my favorite of the Marvel films released since The Avengers. In fact, it is almost on par with that film. I only give that one an edge because I do so love seeing the Hulk do his thing. Though I have heard rumors that the next Guardians film may do the planet Hulk storyline, which would be awesome. This film itself was awesome as it did have a lot of funny characters and good action. Also, Thanos looks great as it almost seems they took him straight off the pages of the comics. My only complaint about the film, which it is only a minor quibble, is that they never showed Thanos really do all that much. I would like to see him do something truly destructive so that the moviegoers not familiar with his power know what is in store when he is the primary villain in a Marvel movie. I was hoping he would be in Avengers 2, but they went with Ultron instead. Hopefully, we shall see him in the third, or heck let him take a more active role in the second film of this franchise, because I like where they are going with it!",10,3,7,25 September 2014
Evil Dead," More blood than the original, may or may not work for you
","First, I shall say this right off the bat, I enjoyed the original a bit more. This is mainly due to the fact I love watching Bruce Campbell in anything. As I was watching this film, I could not help myself but ask, 'What would Ash do?' That being said, I thought they did a good job with the remake and it was not to far off the original. The plot was different enough to keep me wondering what was going to happen, but it paid homages to the original. It did subtract a few laughs, but it did add a lot of blood and gore. Though, I do not remember the original Evil Dead having to many laughs. I remember it being more of a straight horror film, it was really the two sequels where large additions of comedy were added. So why I keep reading reviews saying this one subtracted the laughs had me a bit confused as the original Evil Dead to me was a straight horror too.The story has the same premise of friends going to a cabin in the middle of nowhere. However, the reasons for them being there are quite different, as this is no relaxing getaway. Instead, it is a trip to help a young lady detox and get over a substance abuse problem. There is something in the basement though, as a ceremony took place there. A book is also found there and one of the friends, for some unexplained reason, really has to find out what the book is saying and he accidentally releases a force that will possess and tear apart the group of friends in most brutal fashion. At first, they think the young lady is going through withdrawals as she is attacked trying to get out of the woods, but they soon realize there is something evil at play here.The rehab part of the story works as there is no way anyone was going to the cabin they featured here for a pleasant stay. Most would have left after what they saw in the basement, but they were trying to help their friend. The gore was ramped up in this film, making it one of the more gory films I have ever seen on the big screen. I have seen worse though on DVD. This film relied a lot on tension, too as I was never quite sure how things were going to play out. All in all, they did a good job of making a different film, but still in the spirit of the original. They paid homage to the original by having the camera moving through the forest as an unseen force, there was a scene that was like the tree seen from the original and near the end it paid a bit more homage to the second film with a chainsaw.So a good horror film, for me anyway. I have heard many people say they enjoyed the film. However, I have heard others who did not care for it much. Just depends on your tastes. I like gore and blood and such...add to that a supernatural presence and you are most likely going to have a film I am going to enjoy to some degree. Others though may simply think the film was a bit too brutal, or gory just for the sake of thrills and the story was lacking. I can see this too, as the behavior of the David character at times had me nearly yelling at the screen! So I enjoyed it, mainly for the bloody romp it was. The gore effects were way beyond the original film, making my girlfriend avert her eyes through most of the kills and attacks. Still, though I think the original is the better film. I kept thinking, 'Ash would have had this wrapped up by now.' It was also nice in this one that if computer generated graphics were used, they were not apparent. So, I enjoyed this film and the original. In the end, though, it was nice being able to watch a horror movie like this in the theaters for me. I like a bloody gory film.",8,8,24,10 April 2013
Caddyshack," Great comedy that they just don't make anymore.
","One thing surprised me when I looked up this movie is that I did not know Harold Ramis co wrote and directed this movie.  So you learn something new every day.  This movie is very funny all the way through, a rarity these days.  Usually, comedies now have to either have a stretch of being sentimental, or they just do toilet humor the whole way through, or you have to watch fifteen other movies just to get the jokes.  This one stands on its own merit and it is funny throughout.  The caddies are the central part of the movie.  They aren't really the main part, but the bulk of the story goes through them.  They are also the least funny part of the movie, not to say they don't have their moments (Bill Murray did caddy, but I look at him more as a grounds keeper).  The cast is great, but for my money the two funniest guys are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield.  Bill's character is very funny as I love the scene with him and the priest and Dangerfield plays a wild guy who disrupts the everyday workings of the country club where this one is set.  Ted Knight is also good as a man who grows increasingly agitated by Dangerfield's presence.  There is somewhat of a plot there, but it does go here and there and that is all right with me.  There is also a pesky gopher, which sets up another great joke with Bill and the Scottish guy when Bill misunderstands him and this movie also made a floating Baby Ruth candy hysterical as well (another good scene with Murray).  Chevy Chase is in this one as well, and while he does okay he doesn't stand out like the others I have mentioned.",9,2,4,29 January 2004
The Evil Dead," The woods are full of the dead...
","Yes, this movie would go on to spawn two sequels, both of which had a bit more comic tone, however this one is almost pure horror. Albeit, with a couple of humorous scenes. The story, two couples and one sister go into the woods for a nice relaxing retreat. They end up at a cabin which is a bit run down, but not to bad of shape. Strange things happen and then they discover a secret in the basement that unleashes the evil dead! What ensues you ask? General mayhem and lots of gore. In fact this is the first time I have seen the movie in some time, I did not remember how bloody this movie got. This movie features a very young Bruce Campbell and some rather pretty girls and one other guy. They all do rather well, however, the real star is the unique style of the film which was kind of a new way of doing things back then. Basically, the foe or monster coming at a person basically being shown as the camera's point of view. Very effective...what else do you get, lots of body parts being chopped here and there and something else that is rare in horror movies a guy who is the lead and lasts the longest rather than a female. Granted there are still some of the same stuff you see in other horror movies. You will also probably say to the screen 'don't do that!!'. Still this is a very good horror movie and hey the next two movies would be very good as well.",8,3,6,4 October 2007
From Dusk Till Dawn," Cool vampire action.
","This movie is more action than horror, and almost plays like two movies. The first half of the film has George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as a couple of homicidal brothers on the run from police trying to get to Mexico. Along the way the kidnap Kietal and his family.  The second half has them in a bar, where after awhile all heck breaks loose as it turns out this bar lures drivers in to kill them as the employees are all vampires.  Great action in this movie, though not much on horror.  This movies best scene is when the vampires first attack and then the ending scene where they have to fight the vampires off.  Often bloody and violent this movie does not disappoint.  Though it does take a little while to get to the cool vampire scenes.  I think they could have shaved a little time off, but all in all it was still a good movie.  And check out Salma Hayek's brief but effective appearance.",8,0,1,9 May 2003
Jurassic World," It was cool to finally see a fully functional park complete with tourists
","This movie was a good film, lots of dinosaur action to be sure; however, I am a bit perplexed as to why this one is doing such astronomical business at the box office. While it was good, it really was not anything new...to me it was pretty much chock full of things we had already seen before with the exception of a cool working park that I kind of wish we got to see more of before the chaos ensued. Do not get me wrong the chaos was awesome and I guess that in the end is why it is doing so well. A kid is going to absolutely love a flick like this...I know I would have as a child. I just wish they had some more interesting human characters. Basically, I say bravo to the dinosaurs they did what they needed to. I just felt the human characters were a bit underwhelming, the poor dinosaurs had to take up to much slack.The story has us arriving at a fully functional dinosaur park. A couple of boys are going there to meet their aunt who is quite high up on the ladder in the park. She is so busy she pretty much pawns them off on a poor woman who really got a bit more done to her than she really deserved (I would have liked to see what happened to her, happen to D'Onofrio's character). Meanwhile, the aunt is pitching a new dinosaur as they want to wow the people so why not make a bigger more ferocious dinosaur. While this is going on, a man is attempting to train Raptors. He is asked to inspect this new dinosaur and it isn't too long before things get out of control and the new attraction is running rampant in the park! The dinosaurs are awesome and it was totally cool to see the one in the water. Not sure why they felt the need to make anything else as I would love to go to the park just to see that one in the water. The problem is other than Bryce Dallas Howard's character, no one else was really that good. Pratt was awesome in Guardians of the Galaxy did his best Mark Walhberg impersonation in this one. D'Onofrio was over the top annoying, the two kids weren't bad, but I thought the whole divorce subplot pointless. Only a very small number of the human's jokes worked for me, most felt flat. The human element just did not even compare to the dinosaur one. It was not terrible, just not great at all.Overall, the movie was good. The dinosaurs were awesome, the mayhem was awesome and the dinosaur fights were cool. I also applaud them for the amount of deaths they showed on screen. One of the things I hated about Lost World was that nearly every death was off screen while here we get to see em chomped! The movie could have been better if say Pratt was more like Guardians and less like a rock and some of the other characters were given more to work with, but the dinosaurs take up the slack and make this a very fun film.",8,6,22,22 June 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Surprisingly I liked it better than the original.
","I would say I do not know why, but I do, Johnny Depp does a very good job as Willy Wonka, even better than Gene Wilder who did a good job himself. The plot is actually better and does not take that bizarre dark twist here and there like the boat ride through hell, or the strange man trying to get the secret recipe. In fact, at the end of this one Willy does all he can to try to get Charlie to take over his family. I also like that you did not get left in the dark about what happened to all the other kids that happened to be on the tour. Another thing is Christopher Lee has a short, but very good stint in the film as Willy's dad. Funny how Depp played a movie with not one, but two horror screen legends during his career, Lee in this one and Vincent Price in Edward Scissorhands. The story has some of the same story elements here, but there are enough differences to really keep it fresh and interesting. You actually get to see Willy's time in the strange forest where he first gazed upon the ompa loomps and those guys are not as creepy this time around. So be prepared for a bit the same, but a lot of nice differences.",8,1,3,6 September 2009
Mission: Impossible II," This mission soon self destructs from your brain after watching it.
","I enjoyed this Mission Impossible more than the first film. At least I think I do, to be honest I hardly recall the movie at all. Granted it has been since 2000 since I saw the movie, but even if you asked me about it a month after I saw it I would still have trouble recollecting it. In fact, I may have liked it less possibly? Not really, I liked it a tad more only because it had more action in it, but that is really all that it has in it. A much more shallow film that one has to wonder is it even an actual sequel to the original film. Sure Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames is back too, but it just seems to be happening totally independent of the first film. The first film may as well not exist as you certainly do not have to see the first film to understand or enjoy what is happening in this one. Or the third film for that matter. The only thing in common these films share other than the name and Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is that they all are kind of forgettable movies. This one being the most so, basically a summer popcorn flick one quickly forgets upon leaving the theater back in the day. This one has Hunt going after some sort of guy making some deadly virus I think. Do not quote me on that though, the only things I remember clearly about this one is the cool fight at the end between Cruise and the guy that came close to being Wolverine in the X-man movies, but instead chose to do this film and the scenes with the very attractive gal and Hunt trying to recruit her. Oh yes, also the strange and pointless addition of Anthony Hopkins and the rock climbing scene too. Cruise is just an enigma though, he seems like he could star in really good films and I am sure there are a couple of really good ones that I have yet to see, but he ends up playing in mostly forgettable fare. I think the highest score for a film that he has been in that I have seen is an 8 for part three. I only gave it that high mainly because of the addition of a memorable bad guy. Nice one of these mindless Mission films had something that was actually memorable in it. I can not believe they are actually making a fourth.",6,0,1,19 March 2010
Rudy," Sports movies are sometimes okay to me and this one was just that.
","I was not super wild about this movie or highly motivated by this film, but all in all it was rather good and interesting. Sports films just usually do not really pump me up in that the sports scenes, or the scenes depicting the game itself being played look so fake compared to real sports. Still, this one did rather good on those points, and the actually playing of football takes a back seat to all the things the title character had to do to get on the field. The story is simple enough, a good high school football player has dreams of playing for his favorite football team, Notre Dame. So a good football player should get a scholarship, correct? Not in the case of Rudy who is very undersized. Basically, a lot of desire, but not a lot of physical talent. So he does what he can to try and first enroll at Notre Dame and then get onto the football team as a walk on. You get to see the bumps and physical pounding he endures as he basically plays kind of a practice team player, basically a guy who never sees the field, but helps the first and second and third stringers get ready for their games. So it is a bit inspiring to see this guy keep plugging away and trying his best and getting smashed. Even the regular players tell him to take it easy, but he simply tells them he has to go all out to help them prepare. Good sports movie, a genre that is not exactly a favorite, but I have a few I like of which this is one.",7,0,1,5 October 2010
Logan," Hugh Jackman in his last go around as Wolverine
","I missed this film when it was in theaters. That is probably for the best, not that I had any desire to see it then due to the fact my fianc√© had just recently passed away. If I had seen it, it probably would have triggered an attack. It still did, but at least I was in my own home so no one could see me break down. Just anything like this makes me remember the love of my life and the tears just pour out and I end up having an attack and have trouble breathing. That being said, this was a very good movie and a nice way to send off Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Sure, there are things that make me question what has happened to reduce everyone to the state they are in, but when one reads comics, one understands that the story being presented may be sort of an alternate universe story arc, rather than the main one. I say this is the case with this movie, things may not necessarily turn out the way they did in this film, just in this universe things seemed to have gone very badly. It is a way to change up the actor playing Wolverine and get some closure for the X-men films starring him and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier.The story has Logan as a limo driver trying to earn enough cash to get a boat so that he and Professor Xavier can escape to the sea. Xavier is having trouble controlling his powers in his old age and Logan watches over him as there are hints that the professor has done something rather bad due to this lack of control. Logan is being assisted by a mutant named Caliban who has the ability to detect other mutants, a power nearly worthless now as mutants have become few and far between. Well, a woman tries to get Logan to help her as she has a young girl with her and some men are tracking both of them. This girl is apparently a mutant with some very familiar powers. Logan escapes with her and Professor Xavier and they must stay one step ahead of the agents determined to capture her. However, there is another familiar face that is unleashed in the agents efforts to recapture the young girl and several other mutant children trying to flee their grasp.I enjoyed the film for the most part, the only problem I had is that I was hoping for someone cooler when they revealed the soulless mutant who had no problem killing. They really did not have anyone new as far as mutants on display as Caliban was the only one I do not think was seen before. I would have liked the reveal to show the new weapon to be Omega Red. Granted, that would have meant a few more special effects I guess so we do not really get anyone new at all on display.So the film was good and the action was plentiful and quite gruesome. I knew there would be a bit more stuff shown because this film was rated R, but I was surprised at how many heads rolled and appendages flying everywhere. From what a few people had said about the film that I know, there really was not much action in the film. Not sure what film they were watching as there was a good deal. So ends Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and he did a good job in the role. I just find the makers starting with Marc Singer really did not do the character true justice as he was a much better fighter than the films portrayed, and his healing ability was not as effective in the comics as depicted in the films either. Basically, he was more apt to dodge in the comics than go head on and he would never have any problems fighting ordinary men and most superheroes could not match his fighting skills. Still, as I said, I just think of it as an alternative universe and it still saddens me to see Jackman depart the role.",9,17,34,27 June 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," I enjoyed it, but it felt underwhelming this time around
","I enjoyed watching this film, but I have to say the first one was better. That is to be expected I guess, as it was the first time something of that scope had been attempted and all the lead up to the film with the other films. This one, just kind of felt almost episodic rather than being an epic film. Basically, as if it was a television series rather than a full length feature film I paid money to see with some very overpriced snacks from the concession stand. Even the film quality looked sub par at times as it looked kind of drained of color. I knew I was probably not going to enjoy this one as much as the first due to the main villain being Ultron as he is not a favorite of mine. I just do not see him as being that big a threat seeing as how I have a comic where Spider-man takes him down. However, that is not the only reason I feel this film underwhelms, it is just a bit hard to explain. Overall, I did enjoy the film as there was a bit more action than the previous film and there was some cool stuff going on, but like I said, something about it was off.The story has the Avengers raiding a castle which is a Hydra base right off the bat in the hopes of retrieving the scepter Loki used in the previous Avengers film. At one point a pair of siblings enhanced with strange powers attack and this leads to Iron Man having a bit of an epiphany. This leads him and Dr. Banner trying to create an artificial intelligence to protect the world from threats from space which they plan to dub Ultron. Unfortunately, things do not go as planned and soon Ultron is declaring war on the Avengers and has an extreme way of protecting the world! I will say my favorite Avenger is the Hulk and in the first film they showed how powerful he is. This film, not so much. Probably one of the things I disliked about it. Not only does he not get to really flex his muscles much, the one time he does he is taken down by Iron Man in a really big suit of armor. Anyone who reads the comics knows that the Hulk gets stronger the madder he gets so this whole fight seemed idiotic to me. No way Iron Man takes down Hulk by himself even with 'Hulk Buster' armor. You simply cannot beat Hulk down like they showed in this film, he would have continued to get more angry and torn Tony Starks' Hulk Busting armor completely apart. I have read comics where the Hulk pretty much dominates the entire Avengers team, Iron Man included by himself! So yeah, they completely undersold the Hulk this time.The film did have lots of action which was nice and it did have some good humor here and there, but it just was not up to par with the previous Avengers film. There was a strange relationship that seemed to come out of nowhere, the in fighting kept coming and going and one of the new characters is dispatched in their first film! I also think the part of the film that got my blood going the most was the scene after part of the credits as this scene sets up the villain I wanted this time. Still, it was nice to see them bring in War Machine and the battle at the end was pretty cool too, though it needed more Hulk for my taste. Ultron was done pretty good, as they found a way to make him more of a threat than he usually is in the comics, it just would have been nice if he had more lead up in the previous Marvel films as he came out of left field. I know I seem like I am complaining too much as I did like the film, just did not love it like the first one. Worth a look, but hold your expectations down a little is probably the best way to view it and if the Hulk is not your favorite you should be fine too.",8,6,14,4 May 2015
Major League," Rather fun baseball flick.
","This was a rather fun film featuring the old worst to first team. The catch here is that the owner of the team wants to relocate the Cleveland Indians to Florida or somewhere like that. To accomplish this she proceeds to put together a team that she hopes will be beyond bad. Enter a crew of misfits that feature aging players like Eddie the pitcher, an aging catcher whose knees are not what they used to be Jake Taylor, and Roger Dorn who cares more about life after baseball than playing the game with any passion in the present. Also present are some young guys like Pedro Cerrano who can hit a fastball a mile (a curve not so much), a speedy guy named Willie Mayes Hayes who invites himself to camp and Ricky Vaughn a hard throwing pitcher with no control. Well this team is not as terrible as expected and it is brought to the manager's attention and his plan is to win not only a few games here and there, but the entire division. The movie is funny and has a bit more bite to it than the sequel which is basically this movie again without much Reno Russo as Jake's girl and no Wesley Snipes at all as he is recast. For a baseball film featuring the whole underdogs trying to win it all it does fairly well. I enjoyed Charlie Sheen as the pitcher with a wild fastball that gets good by getting glasses. I also enjoyed Snipes and I was saddened when he was not in the sequel. Basically a good cast and a good funny baseball film.",7,0,0,17 November 2010
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight excels at protecting Gotham while the Joker is wild!
","Yes, this movie is as advertised...one of those big time movies that actually lives up to the hype. Once again, like in Batman Begins, the story is not the typical comic book movie formula that was ironicallysort of started by the Batman movie in 1989. You do not see the typical introductions or a sort of cartoony type world. This movie takes place in a city that looks real, the people living here look like everyday people. Batman is still watching over the city as best he can, crime is still a part of Gotham, however, the criminals are now looking behind their backs out of fear of the Batman. Meanwhile, a deranged gentleman known as the Joker is robbing the biggest mob bosses of their money and doing other things seemingly without purpose yet at the same time coldly calculating. A district attorney named Harvey Dent is doing his part to clean up Gotham and Batman sees in him a new hope for the city of Gotham. Someone who the citizens can stand behind and help rid the city of the unwanted criminal element, a 'white knight' if you would. Unfortunately, for Batman, Harvey and Lt. Gordan the Joker suddenly takes an interest in Batman and begins a sick game for seemingly no other purpose than for kicks. Great action and story twists ensue as this was a very wild ride and a great summer movie. The acting is great as Bale once again makes the best Batman, Gary Oldman a very likable Gordan and Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are both back and great too. Heck, even Murphy is back as the Scarecrow and while not in it long makes a nice little appearance. Heath Ledger though steals the show as the absolutely insane clown prince of crime The Joker. Jack Nicholson was good, Ledger is even better as his Joker is even darker. A strange person who seemingly has no past whose origins are a bit of a mystery and who has a very sinister first appearance. Though even more memorable is his next appearance at a mob meeting where he does the most amazing magic trick. A surprise to me was also Harvey Dent's role in the film as I wasn't expecting it to unfold as it did and once again it was perfectly cast. The only complaint I have is a minor one and that is the absence of Katie Holmes as Rachel. She has been replaced and I do not really care for the person she was replaced with as Katie was prettier and more lively and the new lady just seems to be a plug in. Still, it did not detract from the picture all that much as this movie is about Batman facing his greatest nemesis The Joker and you get that in spades. You also get more Batman than in other Batman movies and loads of action. You also get a refreshingly darker tone that suits this version of the Joker very well.",10,3,10,24 July 2008
Men in Black," Fast moving science fiction comedy.
","This movie was really fun to watch the first time I saw it in theaters, upon subsequent viewings, however, it loses its luster. Still though, it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story, this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny, especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie, and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny, and the dog is not over used as in the sequel, and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed, of course Tommy Lee's character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about. So for a funny movie that has great scenes of Will Smith training and becoming a Man in Black watch this film and do yourself a favor and skip part two...not that it was entirely bad, I liked it okay, but it just seems like an unnecessary sequel.",8,31,43,10 July 2005
Taken," Why daughters should always listen to their dads.
","This is a movie about a guy who does what he says in the most extreme manner possible. A father trying to reestablish himself in his daughters life has quit his job and is now living closer to where she is. He tries, but his ex wife does not seem to care for him much at all from what I got at that birthday party. Well something comes up, a chance for his daughter to take a trip to France with a friend and she needs her dad's permission to go to another country. Against his better judgment he agrees with conditions. Well they get to France and it is not anytime before the girls do something incredibly stupid and they later end up being taken as it were by men whose intentions are later spelled out. Well father now uses what he learned from his old job to track down these men and when he finds them, for the most part it is not pretty. Granted, I enjoyed seeing him do it as all these guys are scum. The movie has great action and it flows very fast. Nice to have a film that does not seem long at all. It is just fun pulling for this guy to get his hands on the bad guys. I think Liam Neeson being in the movie as the father adds something to this movie as he does a very good job. He makes a rather good movie even better just like he did in the movie 'Darkman'. So for a movie with lots of action, some thrills and a few tense moments Taken is your movie.",9,1,4,11 June 2009
The Mummy Returns," More action in this sequel, but the plot isn't as good.
","This one is very action packed this time around.  From start to finish is almost one action scene after another.  Unfortunately, it is not better than the first mummy because its plot leaves a bit to be desired.  First off, the mummy doesn't seem to be important enough in the plot.  The title of the movie is the mummy, but he doesn't seem to be the focus he should be.  Then there is the Scorpion King plot.  I don't mind that too much, but it just lessened the importance of the mummy further.  Thankfully, the Rock has no speaking lines and not much screen time to muck up the film.  Still aside from these and a few more story problems, this movie is a great action flick.  Best to just turn off your brain and enjoy all the action such as the cool bus chase in London or the forest filled with the little creatures. The effects, like in the first one, are pretty good...but nothing really ground breaking.  The Scorpion King at the end though was a pretty cool looking character that looked like one of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion creatures.  Looking for action though, then this is your movie.",8,1,2,24 April 2003
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Rami shows how to make a horror movie with comedy.
","This movie was a very good horror movie, the best I have went to see all year. I was a bit guarded about it at first when it received a pg-13 rating instead of an R, however it is most likely a rather hard rating as I am sure just a bit more and it would have been an R. The only thing it really lacks is a lot of cussing and there is no nudity and there are no trees raping girls as in the evil dead movies. This movie has a cute loan officer in line for a promotion at her job, it is between her and a very unlikable butt kisser. Well in walks a very frail looking and somewhat gross old lady who has a problem, she needs her loan extended because her house is about to be repossessed. She goes to her boss and he tells her it is up to her, so she takes the hard line and denies the request. To make matters worse when the old lady proceeds to beg for an extension the girl calls security on her and the old lady really gets mean at this point. We have a rather nifty scene in a parking garage that is rather disturbing and oddly humorous at the same time and a curse is set in motion, one that at the end of three day drags the one who is cursed straight to hell!!! So for the rest of the movie the girl desperately tries to overcome the curse with almost all of her attempts failing miserably. You also get camera angles and scares that will make one think about the evil dead movies and the humor should be familiar to any who have seen the evil dead movies as well. Though I thought the scene at the parent's house would have been more funny. Overall I enjoyed the movie, I did not care for a couple of plot points however which is why I gave the movie an 8 also a couple of effects looked a bit to fake for my tastes. Still, the way it ends is very well done, basically you get a sense of dread as you can plainly see there is nothing to be done, but watch. However, I can see a possibility of a sequel too.",8,3,6,2 June 2009
There's Something About Mary," Pretty funny comedy.
","In the summer of 1998 this was the surprise hit that came out of nowhere. The Farrelly brothers had another hit, the other being 'Dumb and Dumber', and while this one is funny 'Dumb and Dumber' is better.  Sure this made more money and stuff, but it isn't funny all the way through as Dumb is. This one focuses on a guy who wants to find the girl he almost had a date with in high school, but do to a very funny accident it wasn't meant to be. He has to compete though with numerous other guys who also really want Mary including the private investigator he hired to find her.  This movie has a lot of funny scenes, but the ending wasn't all that funny to me.  There were other times in this one that weren't that great as well, but it still plays very well.  All the actors are good, especially Stiller and Dillon.  Cameron Diaz, the title character though is rather bland with her funniest moment being what she wipes through her hair.  She is only marginally better in this than is Rene Zellwegger is in 'Me, Myself, and Irene' as the title gal in that one.  All in all though it is a very funny movie, it just may be a bit to long and the ending isn't all that funny especially compared to the rest of the film.",8,0,1,9 May 2003
Mission: Impossible," This missions plot would have been more appropriate for a sequel.
","I went to see this one in the theaters and I have to say while it was not a boring movie, it was rather disappointing. I was expecting more action and such as all the trailers showed that scene with the exploding helicopter that sends Tom Cruise's character flying, however scenes like that are few and far between in this movie. The plot was a bit much too. We are just being introduced to Mission Impossible on the big screen and their first assignment and their first team meet with failure and the lead guy, Ethan Hunt, is suspected of being a traitor of some sort. Meanwhile, Jim Phelps is missing or something, some strange computer heist is having to be pulled off with a new team and for some reason one of the members of this new team ends up being a bad guy piloting the helicopter at the end. Like I said seems more like a sequel plot to me, I much would rather have seen a more straight forward mission that was pulled off successfully first than the bungled mess that was the first caper depicted in this one. I was also disappointed by the fact Emilio Estevez was in this film and quickly removed as he could have added some good humor to this one. This film also suffers from the same problem all the Mission Impossible movies suffer from, the fact that none of them are particularly memorable. This one I remember certain scenes all right and the basic plot and the strange English woman, but a lot of the movie is kind of hazy to me as well. Though the second one of the series suffers from this problem the most.",6,0,0,19 March 2010
Super 8," Not a super 8, but I say it is a solid seven.
","Went to this film hoping it would be a bit of a throwback type film of the 80's, the one's featuring a group of kids in a crazy situation. Basically something that is a bit like 'The Explorers', 'Goonies' and a couple of other movies. You know, the one's where the children are actually likable characters before the 90's came and made them brats who were always outwitting adults...'cough' home along 'cough'. This film I happily say did that, I enjoyed the kids and I can imagine a couple of them going on to have very solid movie careers. The movie was not perfect, however, which is why I give it only a seven rather than a higher score. The film is about a boy who has recently lost his mother, he and a group of boys are making a movie for one of them to enter into a super 8 film festival. They are making a zombie film and the boy who lost his mother does the makeup. He and his father are distant with each other, the father seemingly wants to send the boy away to a camp of some sort. Well one night while filming a scene for their movie at a train station a train comes barreling down the tracks. A truck seems to get on the tracks and the train gets derailed in glorious fashion. This is one of the highlights of the film, watching the children run as the train explodes and debris falls everywhere. Well there was something on this train that brings the military to town and the boys along with a girl who has ties to a person that the boy's father who is a deputy associates with the death of his mother end up having to unravel some of the mystery behind what was on the train and why the truck literally went on the tracks. It was good, however, I kind of wish the boy who lost his mother's friends were in it a bit more, at times they paid to much attention to the one kid and the others were good too. There seemed to be more development warranted as some of the scenes with the one boy and girl were a bit to much of a bummer. I also did not care for the conclusion all that much as it was a bit anti climatic as it was really good with the town under siege and the underground scene, but kind of ended with a whimper. I also wish all the kids got to play a bigger role during the last scenes as two got left behind to quickly. However, overall the film was enjoyable, however parents be warned. This is not a PG movie that barely became PG-13, I would say it is a PG-13 that likely came close to being rated R as it is not really overly bloody or anything of that nature, but there is quite a bit of language in this one. Funny, it is like the second film of 2011 to be rated PG-13 that I have seen that has had the F word in it. Probably more than the last two or three summers combined. Once again good film, just not super.",7,1,4,18 June 2011
Sinister," Sinister turned out to be a pretty good horror film
","This film is like Lords of Salem, in that I have been wanting to see it for a while and finally got the chance one night. Unlike Lords of Salem, this one was pretty good. It was not spectacular or anything and like a lot of horror films it lacks certain things and certain things are done in such a way to prevent it from being super good, but it was still an enjoyable enough horror film. It made me wonder where it was going, the acting pretty good and it had some nice creepy imagery. With that it also had plot points that went nowhere and an ending that while not completely disappointing still left me feel it was lacking and not satisfactory. Of course, compare it to most recent horror films it was great¬Ölike Lords of Salem for instance. Sorry, but I had seen that one recently at the time of me writing this review and it just stunk on ice. Granted, it is better than all those numerous PG-13 rated flicks that populate the cinemas these days and those once a year lazy flicks that essentially have extremely small budgets and repeat the same things over and over again.The story has a true crime novelist wishing to write about a heinous crime where a family was hung and the little girl of the family is now missing. The author makes his new home the very home where this terrible crime took place. The sheriff does not like the idea of him writing about this particular crime and his wife is iffy about the circumstances as well. Of course, had the author told his wife that they had just moved into the very house where this crime took place she probably would have been way more iffy! Well, the man starts trying to connect the dots and get inside the crime, he is aided by a mysterious box full of movies that are apparently of the victims. They seem to be nothing more 'sinister' than home movies of first depicting the family during happy times, but as they progress the author sees that there is a darkness within them as soon the film shows the family being murdered. This shakes up the author, but due to his seemingly wanting to be famous once again he presses on rather than inform the authorities about his grisly find (he wrote a best seller, but has fallen on a bit of a cold streak). He soon looks deeper and finds a strange figure present during all the murders and this figure seems to be living within the film itself.So yes, one of the things that made this film good was the interesting concept. It was spooky seeing author (played by Ethan Hawke) watch the films and they did a good job making them spooky. At the same time, the film did rely a bit on clich√©s. In the film, the son seems to be suffering night terrors and this seemed to really go nowhere. Perhaps they were trying to surprise us when the ending came along, but certain facts were not revealed till nearly the end and thus making the son's night terrors just seem to be an almost pointless plot point. I also thought the one occultist should have been in the film more and I wish they would have let him respond to the author's query at the end.So, overall, I did enjoy the film, just a few too many flaws here and there and a few loose ends that could have used tying up. I do believe that a sequel to this one is being made; however, seeing as how the first on is now a couple of years old at least it is not going to be like Paranormal Activity or The Conjuring. Sure, Annabelle is not a direct sequel, but it is a sort of sequel that uses one aspect of that film that everyone loved and they stretched it to a full length film that took like a week to make. So here is hoping that if they do make another film they explain a bit more, but not too much. That is what happened to Phantasm, they made a film where they explained nothing and then just tried to explain it too much. I also do not wish to see the same film repeated¬Öthey need to do some things differently. So, overall a pretty good horror film, but it contains a couple of the flaws that plague so many horror films that prevent it from being great.",7,1,2,10 November 2014
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Hey let's make the exact same movie...AGAIN!!!
","I give this movie the same score as the last movie mainly because it is essentially the same movie only with a new setting. Yes this time most of the action of this film takes place in a New York hotel where our hero can make grown people shiver in fear with old movies that never really existed in the first place and the same two guys are after him for revenge for what he put him through the last movie. The additions to the cast include Tim Curry as a rather arrogant hotel person, and a bag lady who will teach young Kevin (I think that is the brat's name) some sort of lesson though you think he would have learned enough lessons after his last fiasco, but then how would we have the sequel which is obviously one of those sequels they rushed to get made like they did with the 'Look Who's Talking' first and second movie and when they rushed 'Moonraker' after 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and 'Batman and Robin' after 'Batman Forever'. All those examples basically use the same blue print for there movie so you end up with essentially the same movie with a few new moving parts here and there and considering I hated the first one the change in venue did not do anything to make me like this one any more or less. So I guess that is one accomplishment the makers of this film were able to do, I did not hate it more.",2,3,7,22 January 2010
The Fly," You will never see lemon-filled donuts the same way again.
","Never saw the original, but I have to say this is one of the must yucky movies ever made. Not that it was bad, but the sole purpose of this movie seemingly was to gross people out. The story of a scientist's whose teleportation experiments have a slightly adverse effect on him is rather good. As for scares, there just are not that many, the movie is mostly watching a man deteriorate to the point of being really gross looking. Still it has a great cast, and it is a well done movie, just needed some kills or something else. He isn't super fly for very long, but for the most part just the melting man. Like I said, the main point of this film seemed to be just to gross you out. The eating scene with him showing how a fly eats is particularly icky as are the many scenes of various pieces of him coming off. Before the gross out begins though you are given an interesting enough plot about teleportation pods and there is another nasty scene involving a monkey, but in the end the most memorable scenes in the flick are the ones that make you go eww.",6,0,5,31 July 2005
Groundhog Day," Murray at his best.
","This film was a rather big movie of I think early 1993.  It was one of the best comedies of that year and won over more people on its release on video. I didn't care to see it at first, but watched it when it came on cable and it won me over too.  The story has a somewhat grumpy weatherman sent to a city to do a story on the Groundhog there and the festival surrounding it. I know the name of the city, but I am not even going to try to spell it.  He hates the idea and wants to get out of there as fast as he can. Unfortunately, a blizzard hits and he has to stay longer (a blizzard he predicted would miss the area).  So he stays the night and the next morning starts out eerily the same as the previous.  At first he thinks it is just a coincidence, but realizes soon enough that the day is repeating over again. It continually repeats throughout the movie and you get to see Murray begin to loath the town and then fall in love with it.  No real explanation is given for why the day repeats, but none is really needed and it is amusing to watch Murray go through the city knowing exactly when and where things will happen and getting to know all the people as well.  The movie takes kind of a somber twist near the end when some scenes involving a homeless man come up, but it doesn't stay somber instead going for a more positive, funny conclusion.  I love the scene with the kid in the tree.  How long he stays in the day is anyone's guess, but I figure he had to be there a good 15 years worth of days...my friend informs me it takes a while to master a piano that well.  This is a very funny and entertaining movie that is heart warming as well.  I also have to give it a chuckle cause of all the time he spent trying to pursue the one lady played by McDowell...It does take forever to win over the best gals out there doesn't it?  Chris Elliot is also in this one, but don't let that scare you off, he is actually rather good and doesn't detract from the movie at all.  All in all a very good comedy, bravo Harold Ramis.",9,0,2,26 September 2003
National Treasure," A nice little tomb raideresque adventure.
","In fact, in this movie the last place they go looks more like something you would find in a tomb raider game than anything in the tomb raider movies. This was a nice little film, not overly great, but it was entertaining. The movie focuses on Cage's character Ben Gates as he tries to follow clues to one of the largest treasures ever. The main one being on the back of the Declaration of Independence. Of course, Cage's character is not the only one after the treasure so is a former ally who will stop at nothing to receive the riches himself. This character is played by Sean Bean. As usual he plays the villain very well. Also, look for Jon Voight as Cage's dad and Harvey Keitel as a FBI agent I think after Cage. The movie has some action, some comedy...it never gets really violent are anything, but you could probably tell that from the fact it is rated pg. Could have used maybe some more action, it could have also been a bit less talky in parts, but overall it is enjoyable and everyone in it plays their part well.",8,0,1,5 May 2005
Total Recall," Is it reality?
","This fast paced Arnold movie is a futuristic blood bath.  A guy who wants to go to mars (we can do that in the future apparently) decides just to have the trip implanted in his brain as a memory.  Instead of doing that though it makes him remember his past self who is a spy.  They clear his memory again and he has no recollection of his being a spy, but he is attacked again and again by everyone.  He gets to mars and there is more bloodshed. This one has a lot of action, but it has a rather good plot as well.  The effects are pretty good too, as the scenes on mars are pretty convincing. All in all a great action thrill ride.",9,0,2,26 March 2003
Rocky," Of the Rocky's probably the most realistic.
","This movie was a rather good drama starring Sylvester Stallone as the title character Rocky. It also is one of those movies that has a theme that sticks with a person because it is so memorable. The movie, too is memorable although kind of slow moving in places as well. They try a bit to hard making Rocky seem real, showing a bit to many details of his courtship of Adrien, though I have to say that these scenes while slow help with the ending making it a bit more emotional. The story, the heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is about to fight a title bout. Well the person he is supposed to fight drops out so Apollo decides to fight an unknown guy and picks a local named Rocky. Rocky is a bit of a washed up fighter, he can win but he does so clumsily. The trainer who I think owns the gym, Mickey, decides to help Rocky train for this fight and these two opposing forces meet in the ring for more of a fight than Apollo was expecting. This fight is a bit more realistic than the fight in two in that Apollo was not taking this fight seriously at all and was not training hard. An underdog that he had never really seen before could have taken him by surprise the way Rocky did here. So a good fight sequence a some filler before then to pull at the heart strings and inspire one. Still good though for a sports movie.",7,1,2,7 March 2009
Beauty and the Beast," I'll take the cartoon version thank you
","Disney has gotten on a kick of making live action versions of their classic cartoons, and why not? People are flocking to these things, so much so that this one made over 500 million in the US alone. Why come up with something original, when you can just redo the same thing and the people act like it is the best thing since sliced bread. Saves writers the trouble of being creative as you already have the basic structure of the story in place, just tweak it a bit and in this one they did not even bother to tweak it very much at all. Same movie essentially, but with a few added things here and there and a look that to me looks cheap. The beast looks good and some of the effects are alright, but it has a look of a movie that should have come on ABC as a special rather than a 150 plus budgeted movie meant for the big screen.The story is essentially the same. A arrogant prince is cursed by some enchantress and turned into a hideous beast. The only way he can become human is if he can truly love and be loved by another. Enter Belle, played by Emma Watson. She is a odd one in the village as she just loves to read and everyone in town thinks she is quite the strange one. Of course, this does not stop town hunk, Gaston, from pining over her and wishing to make her his bride. Belle's father gets lost one night and ends up in the Beast's clutches and Belle finds him and takes his place and becomes the Beast's prisoner; however, soon the selfish Beast begins to feel for Belle and she for him. I always thought Belle was one of the prettiest Disney princesses, so I am probably in the minority when I say, I thought Emma Watson was a horrible choice. She is so damn plain in the role as Belle and I have never understood why people think she is attractive at all. The rest of the cast is fine, I guess, but like I said, I just get a cheap television vibe when I watch this movie. About the only thing they really added that I thought worked was having Gaston be a bit more sinister in this one as he ties up Belle's father leaving him to the woods in this one. Makes one feel a bit better when he is killed than in the original where he was just a bit too eager to try and impress everyone and take out the Beast. He is more of an ass this go around and I think it works. They made his toady, Le Fou, gay in this one, and that works too. It makes more sense why he would keep wanting to hang around Gaston because he has a crush on him, himself. So, this thing made money, another one, Maleficent also made money and several other live action ones have as well, so the trend will continue. Of course, I thought the choice for Aurora was horrible in that film too, they seem to want to pick zipper girls with no figures for these roles are plain janes. I guess it could be I am from a different generation and prefer a different look than the younger generation. I still say the film could be a reenactment in the Disneyworld theme park sans the scenes at Beast's castle though. Basically, give me the cartoon over this any day of the week.",5,1,1,24 September 2018
The Descent," Prepare to descend into the very depths of fear.
","I enjoyed this movie about six gals mainly from England going caving. The movie was fast paced once they got to the caves and did not let up until the finish. The story has a woman who the previous year lost both a husband and daughter to a very gruesome car accident. She was apparently an extreme sports junkie, but for the past year has been in mourning for the loss of her loved ones. Now, however, she reunites with some old friends and they are going caving, girls only. They are supposed to go to a rather simple cave to explore with no real danger or thrills, however one of the members of the group has decided instead to take them to a cave she discovered...and what the girls discover there is sheer terror. This movie was very effective, even before there are any kind of creatures introduced the movie was tense. There is a great scene involving being stuck in a tight place, a really dangers climbing the wall scene and a scene involving a broken leg. I mean the poor girls have virtually no shot at survival at this point then if all this is not bad enough there is something lurking in the caves and it likes to feast on flesh. So there ya go, finally a horror movie that does seemingly indeed put our cast in a virtually inescapable situation with no apparent way out. It is not all good though, I did not care for some of the character's behavior towards the end as I would hope one would rather lean on someone for support. Instead there is a rather shocking scene that to me seems petty. Wait and try to get out then settle differences. Still this horror movie was really good and tense.",8,1,3,1 March 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The Guardians of the Galaxy are back because the galaxy is once again in peril
","I rarely watch trailers or anything anymore on upcoming films due to the fact I watch very little television these days and I find a lot of trailers give away too many things so I was not sure what to expect from the second Guardians film. I really enjoyed the first film and I am happy to report that I really enjoyed the second film too. In fact, I would have to say I enjoyed this one just a bit more than the first film due to the fact that the first film was more of an origin tale, while this one the Guardians were together right from the get go. I enjoy seeing them do their thing as every member is unique and amusing in their own way. The actors and actresses also do a phenomenal job of portraying the makeshift team of outlaws/superheroes. The villain of the piece is cool too when you take into account of what he truly is, I will not go into any detail here, but any Marvel fan would know what he is called in the comics.The story has the Guardians at the beginning of the film protecting some sort of energy devices from some sort of interstellar creature as baby Groot dances through the opening credits. After the team fights off the foe they proceed to collect their payment from a race of very pretentious gold people in the form of Gamora's sister Nebula who has quite a bounty on her head. Well, Rocket proceeds to insult the gold people and also steals the very batteries they were hired to protect. After a space battle that ends with the Guardians crashing on a planet, they encounter a man claiming to be Starlord's father. Starlord, Gamora and Drax accompany this man and his companion Mantis to Ego's (Starlord's dad) planet where this man tries to be Starlord's dad, while Rocket and Groot watch over Nebula. Unfortunately, soon an old friend comes to find the Guardians in the form of Yondu and his band of pirates. There is also something strange about Starlord's dad that Gamora does not trust.Really good film, like I said what makes it so good is the characters and the actors and actresses portraying them. There really is not a weak link among them. I could not even tell you my favorite as they all bring their 'A' game to the table. I enjoyed the expanded roles of Nebula and Yondu and I like how Gamora and Nebula are so awesome at fighting and are trying to kill each other, but in the end they are almost like typical sisters! I like the wisecracking Rocket who kind of got them all in the mess by stealing the batteries and Drax and his strange oblivious ways is always good for a laugh. Kurt Russel does a good job as Starlord's dad too. I had heard Sylvester Stallone was in the film, but his part was a bit minuscule, I am thinking that maybe it will be expanded in the next film.So, yes, I enjoyed this film immensely. Like the first movie there is just a good mixture of heart, action and humor to appeal to me. Took me awhile to finally see it too, mainly due to the fact my fianc√© really wanted to see it, but she passed away so it also made me sad as well. She would have enjoyed it too, I know as she would have absolutely loved Baby Groot. If you do see it, be prepared for not one, not two, not three, not four but five scenes during and after the credits.",10,1,4,30 May 2017
Titanic," Good movie, but hard to believe it made as much as it did.
","First off, this was a rather good flick for me.  Nothing to great...I have seen a lot of films since I have seen this one that I like a heck of a lot more, but this was pretty good.  A love story set on the Titanic is basically the story with a few plot points about class.  Seeing the ship sink of course is the highlight for me cause it really did look good.  I saw the actors did alright...I won't badger Leo, I don't hold anything against a guy just because lots of gals like him, I just call him a lucky bast#rd and be done with it.  Kate looks pretty good in this flick and does a rather good job as well.  Like I said though the boat sinking is the highlight and one complaint I have is that there wasn't enough character developement of other characters besides Leo's and Kate's...I have posted some theories on why I think it grossed so much on the message board here, because frankly I think it was a fluke it did gross so much, but I am not saying it was a bad flick.",8,2,5,19 February 2003
Rocky III," Oddly enough, my favorite Rocky movie.
","This Rocky movie is a rather quick flowing film compared to the first movies and features a bit more comedy while still having drama and inspirational scenes that were pivotal in the first two movies. The fights are different here too, as in this film we do not have the 15 round beat downs of the first films, but rather three rounds of pure hard hitting. In this one we start out with a strange charity match as Rocky the heavyweight champion of boxing goes against the heavyweight champion of wrestling, Thunderlipps (Hulk Hogan in his only decent appearance in a movie, then again it is not really a stretch). This match is rather entertaining and funny, but soon Rocky must face a new challenger to his belt, the very tough Clubber Lang played by a very tough Mr. T. Mickey does not want Rocky to fight this guy as Mickey has seen that Rocky has lost the fire in his eyes that got him the title and would most likely lose to this determined if a bit arrogant new fighter. Well they do end up fighting and Rocky loses and gets hit even worse by the passing of his mentor. Apollo having witnessed the fight and not liking Clubber Lang at all offers to help Rocky train and thus a new friendship is born. The training is nice to watch and I like how Rocky does different strategies against Clubber in the final fight. Sure this movie is a bit more over the top than the previous Rocky movies, it to me is still my favorite.",8,18,19,7 March 2009
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," For the most part this film bored me, except for seeing all the British stars in it.
","This to date is the only Harry Potter film I have sat through and watched from start to finish. I have seen bits and pieces of the others, but watching them I just feel the same thing that I did when I watched this one. In a word 'bored'. The only thing that kept me entertained was the scenery and seeing the many British A and B list stars. The most enjoyment I got out of the film is saying 'its the villain from Die Hard! he must be a bad guy!', 'That's the dude who got messed up by Gene Hackman in Unforgiven!', 'he was in a couple of Bond films!', and you get the idea. The film features Harry Potter going to wizard school for the first time. His aunt and uncle keep him living in a closet so going to wizard school or heck math camp would be a nice change of pace for the kid. Well when he goes to school he makes friends quickly with this lass and red headed boy and these three would grow up into some very poorly photogenic to old for the roles adults. Seriously, they looked like they were stoned on the DVD cover of Deathly Hallows and all three just do not look like the type of people you put in movies. Well Harry quickly becomes adept at the sport of wizardry Quiditch which involves flying around on a broom and scoring points. I know, when I hear flying brooms I think witches and witchcraft, but this is wizard school cause that is what the author says! There is also a bit of a mystery to be solved and an ending that will become very familiar with those who enjoy this series. I did not care for this one and I never continued following Harry's adventures, I am not going to fault those who do, this set of films just was not for me and man they are going on to long. Heck, by the time they are all finished they will probably remake them all again two years later.",3,0,0,26 May 2011
Thor," Thor was more electrifying than I thought it would be.
","I saw this film when it first came out in 2011 at the theater. Back then I thought it was a rather good origin story and I still believe that. This film is another in a string of films that led to the Avengers that would come out the following year. This one would introduce us to Marvel's Thor, the Asgardian who is the god of thunder and wielder of the mighty hammer. It would also introduce us to the villain Loki, the master of deceit and trickster. Like Iron Man 2, we would also get another hero in Hawkeye; however, unlike the Black Widow's rather substantial role in Iron Man 2 where she even got a battle scene, Hawkeye is in the film only momentarily and we never get to see him do his thing. The film is an origin story which pretty much has to clue us in to the background, but it does deliver a good action scene fairly soon, though the middle of the film really does not have much in the way of Thor action going on. At this point Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 had been released and I have to say I enjoyed all three a bit more than this one. Granted, The Incredible Hulk just about does not even fit in anymore thanks to Norton declining the role further.The story has a group of scientist led by Jane played by Natalie Portman trying to determine what is exactly going on with the sky. There is an event and they end up hitting a man in the midst of it. Then the film flashes back as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) tells his two sons Thor and Loki of the realms and how the Asgardians came to the aide of Earth as they battled the Frost Giants. Years later, Thor is about to become king; however, the celebration is ruined when some Frost Giants enter the castle. Enraged, Thor goes behind his father back to the realm of the Frost Giants and picks a fight. Odin finds out and banishes his son to Earth, stripped of his powers and this is where he is hit by Jane and her crew. The hammer also is sent to Earth and a lot of people try to move it and make a game of it before S.H.I.E.L.D shows up and sets a perimeter. Thor tries to reclaim his hammer, but finds out he is now unable to lift it. Loki, meanwhile learns of his origin and assumes the throne when Odin falls into Odinsleep. He then devises a plan to take out his brother so that he may never return to Asgard.The cast is rather good as Chris Hemsworth does a great job as Thor and Tom Hiddleston is even better as Loki. His character is good too, as you just never know what he is thinking as his motivations are not cut and dry. Natalie Portman just seems a bit out of place in this world of superheros though. She does alright, but I thought the girl who played Darcy was a lot cuter and had more spunk. Anthony Hopkins is good, but he generally is even when he is in a really bad movie.So, this film was good and a good introduction to the character of Thor and his realm. Could have used a bit more action, but they always seem to cap the action a bit too much in comic book movies always relying on a romantic subplot to pad the film a bit. Mad Max: Fury Road is an excellent example of a film that did not slow the film down to have a bunch of scenes of looking into each others eyes and such. I would have also liked to have seen Hawkeye do something other than draw his bow back, he has not really shined as much as others in this series seeming to be just a good archer. He has a few more skills than just that. Granted, the only real target here was Thor so I guess they could not have him put an arrow through the hero of the film's head. Overall, it was good, but I thought the sequel was better.",8,5,10,9 May 2011
The Happening," Oh no! It's happening! M. Night is trying to make an R rated horror film and failing miserably!
","I think the only reason this particular M. Night film did as well as it did was the fact it was R rated. That sure was the main thing they pushed prior to its release, which should have been an indication that the studio did not really think much of this one. I sure did not after viewing this one. That is not completely fair, I was intrigued for the first fifteen or so minutes, but there really was not all that much happening in this one. It stars Mark Wahlberg whom for a time I kept going to his movies and I kept being disappointed. The last one I saw was 'Max Payne' and I have not seen a film of his since having learned my lesson. I just do not care for him as he is the same guy in every film, a surly dour faced prick even when he is supposed to be a school teacher as he was in this one. Well things are happening as people begin dying, apparently killing themselves and in not so interesting ways. The scene where the people start falling to their deaths is almost amusing as it looks like something out of a Scary Movie film. John Leguizamo is okay in this movie and actually helps the film, but he is knocked out relatively early. So what is happening? Well I am not going to say, but the movie spells it out for you about halfway at most and it is completely idiotic. It makes the fact the characters are running here and there particularly stupid as well as the cause is all around them at some points and yet nothing happens to people in some areas while ten feet away it does! The film ends with a whimper, but at least there is no twist at the end, no M. Night this time went with the sort of twist relatively early. So while it starts out briskly it ends with a thud. It still irks me how pitiful that lawnmower scene played out as I imagined it a lot cooler and gruesome than it turned out. Me seeing this film again, likely not happening.",3,5,7,26 June 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Aside from the Burly Brawl and the Freeway chase I just didn't care for it that much.
","I know a lot of you liked this movie, but it just wasn't for me.  It just didn't have a good flow like the first one and resembled stop and go traffic for me.  The good parts of this movie though included the fight between Neo and Agent Smith generally referred to as the Burly Brawl.  It was one of the more fun moments in an otherwise too serious film.  Even though some of it was clearly digital I still enjoyed it.  Probably, because Hugo Weaving the actor who portrays Agent Smith seems to be just having fun with the role and isn't as stiff as most of the actors in this movie.  The actor who was the French guy and the gal playing his wife are also rather good in their roles. The freeway chase is just a nice car chase that is exciting to watch even if you hated the rest of the film.  Unfortunately these scenes may make up 20 or so minutes of the film.  The rest of the movie is poorly paced and just rather dull and anticlimactic for me.  The first 45 minutes or so aren't really worth watching at all, as it is very talky and dry.  There is also a very bad dance sequence and sex scene between Neo and Trinity, which isn't very appealing to look at.  Carrie Anne Moss just isn't attractive to me and at times I have a hard time distinguishing between her and Neo during that scene.  Quite frankly, I would rather get it on with Rebecca Romaijn Stamos in full Mystique makeup.  Keanu Reeves seems more tense in this movie, like the directors wanted him to do a flawless job.  In the first one he seemed to be having fun.  Fishburne also does a worse job.  All his lines are philosophic...I mean can't the guy talk normally every now and then. Yoda even takes a break now and again, but no matter what the circumstance Morpheus (Fishburne's character) always says something philosophical and he says it very slow.  Jada Pinkett Smith is in this one...sort of.  She adds nothing to the movie, but I here she is very featured in the video game. This is kind of stupid, as a person shouldn't have to do homework before seeing the movie.  Apparently, you have to watch those animated movies and play the game to totally understand all that is happening in the flick.  You should be able to go to a film though and just enjoy.  All in all I give this movie a 4, because of those two scenes I really enjoyed.  I won't insult anyone who liked this movie, but like I said it isn't for me.",4,4,5,21 May 2003
Zombieland," To survive in this land you must follow the rules!!!
","First off, is it just me or of all the genres in horror is the zombie movie the one that makes the best comedy. Not only do you have this gem you also have 'Shaun of Dead', 'Dead Alive', 'Return of the Living Dead' one and two, 'Reanimator', 'The Undead', and many more. This one is a nice little zombie comedy that is more comedy than horror by leaps and bounds as there are lots of scenes where the zombies are not seen for long stretches. Almost all the zombie munching comes right at the beginning of the film as the lead guy code named Columbus goes over the rules that have kept him alive so far and shows what happens to those who do not follow them. Then the next stretch where there is a lot of zombie action is the end which is still not quite horror, but is tense enough at times to make for a good action sequence with still just a little touch of comedy to make it perfect. The film basically follows this young man as he meets another calling himself 'Tallahasee' as everyone they meet go by where they are from rather than their name. They are just trying to survive, perhaps with destinations on their mind or perhaps nothing more than trying to find a Twinkie. The story is simple, but very effective, be prepared for a very funny cameo appearance. The acting is great, but then I always enjoyed seeing Woody Harrelson from his Cheers days so it was nice seeing him in this role. The other cast members are great too. The film does not over stay its welcome, nor does it run time feel to short. Great movie, good gore effects and very funny comedy, why oh why do zombies make me laugh so?",9,1,5,9 October 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A bit of comedy, action, and romance all in one movie.
","This movie stars Brad Pitt and Anjelina Jolie. It also has Vince Vaughn in it. Other than them, you won't really remember to many other people in this flick, but that is okay. It works and makes for a fun experience at the theater. The movie is about two contract killers who are married and neither knows what the other does for a living. The spark is gone out of their married lives, but once they find out what they do and end up targeting each other it adds a little spice to their lives. The comedy is funny, the action is great (particularly the car chase scene) and there is a dash of romance added as well. The three actors listed above all do a great job. Pitt is the more funny one, but Jolie plays her role as the slightly more professional hit-man great too. And of course Vaughn is funny in his role as well. The movie is not perfect however, as I found it sort of ran a little to long in the end and also the ending leaves one wondering just how they escaped their little predicament. Other than that, however, it was an enjoyable and funny movie.",8,2,4,22 June 2005
Die Hard," A very effective action movie.
","This is one of those movies so effective in its delivery that it almost makes you uncomfortable to watch. You have your cop in a giant office building that has been overrun with high tech bank robbers posing as terrorist, and his wife is one of the hostages. Not only that, but the poor guy doesn't have any shoes which really makes an uncomfortable scene when the glass starts to fly. Willis is great as the lead character and Rickman does an excellent job as the bad guy as does the other guy who was a Russian dancer or something before defecting here. Great performances by the other members of the cast as well. The action is great, though at times they really seem to be throwing it at our hero and things seem to be going badly. Many memorable action scenes including the roof explosion and McClain (Willis) swinging to safety on a fire hose, his many encounters with said villains and a particularly good ending with the main villain. Don't think it is all action however, as Bruce Willis adds some comedy by means of very funny quips that add a lot to the flick. Still though at its heart it is an action movie first and the action comes fast and furious.",9,1,2,8 July 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Optimus Prime shows his stuff in much improved action scenes.
","The action in this movie was great, the battles being better than any found in the first movie, so why did I give the first movie a 10 and this one a nine? Well, for one the first movie was well the first movie. I had not seen the Transformers on the big screen and not even bigger action scenes can make up for the freshness of the first one when also the story and some parts of the movie were not all that great. The story goes here and there and near the end when I knew the final showdown was looming the movie kept adding stupid dialog scenes such as Shia and his gal talking and trying to figure stuff out. Two of the new Autobot's were so annoying that I cheered when one appeared to be eaten and then there is Soundwave, I can roll with him being a satellite, but why did he have Dr. Claw's voice from Inspector Gadget rather than the voice he had on the cartoon that would have been rather easily duplicated as all you need is a voice modulator of some kind. Still, there were some humorous scenes once again involving Sam's parents and the action scenes were very great I loved all the major confrontations involving Optimus Prime that is for sure, Bumblebee too gets to kick some major booty as well. The story could use work, it is not quite as hard to follow as some claim, but it is overly complicated in areas. Basically, for the most part the movie revolves around what appears to be the Decepticons true leader known as the Fallen and his desire to use a device that would be very bad for us on Earth. So be prepared to be a little annoyed as the twins will talk, Sam's new roomie will annoy as well, and look forward to a runtime of over 2 hours and twenty minutes twenty minutes of which could have easily been cut, but with all the bad comes a lot of good too. Loads of very cool battles involving the Autobots and Decepticons, and let's face it that is the reason you want to see a Transformer's movie.",9,8,17,30 June 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Fine acted movie, has some chills, but really nothing all that great.
","I like a little bit more horror in my horror movies and this one just does not have enough. I would like to combine it with other horror movies that have lots of violence and gore, but has sorry stories and actors in it as this one does have a good story and acting. It just tends to get a bit tedious at times for my tastes, not taking anything away from the movie mind you, if you like it you probably have better tastes than I a person whose favorite genre of horror is the zombie movie, the genre most consider the lowest of the low. The story has a woman who is pregnant and something seems to be going wrong. Simple enough, eh? Actually the story is a lot more interesting and complex than that line, but that line works good too. She has some rather seemingly helpful neighbors at first, but they seem odd to. The husband also is quite the normal husband at first, but he too seems to succumb to what everyone else in the building seems to be doing. Of course, as interesting as the story is, it is also quite long and tedious to watch, I needed a break from watching it at times. Still the payoff is rather good in a underdone kind of way that makes it work all the more. Ruth Gordon is excellent in this film, it is to bad she just about undermines this role by playing in the horrid direct to television sequel.",6,2,7,11 July 2009
War of the Worlds," Not really a War of the Worlds, but rather watch character running from alien death machines with family in tow.
","It had its moments, but along with those it also had its faults...a lot of em. I enjoyed it for the most part, but there are so many scientific errors just one person can take. Even if you could disregard them all the action just about stops once Ray and his daughter enters the basement with the crazy Tim Robbins character. First what is good? The first moments of alien encounter when the tripods emerge from the ground and begin incinerating everyone and everything. The destruction as Cruise and family escape one step ahead of the tripods in the only working vehicle. Moments of humor as the family arrives at the mother's house. The destruction shown as planes apparently crashed in the night. A ferry boat ride of death. All this makes for really entertaining theater, but there are just too many faults to rate this a really good movie. In fact, so far it is one of the weakest movies I have seen so far this year. Why? Well for some reason all electrical appliances are knocked out, even watches yet somehow a video camera is still functioning? For some reason the family has the only working car yet the military vehicles work fine and many areas are still with power so the cars in those areas should work right? The aliens vaporize some people, but then capture others? Just what was the point of the red vines, granted it made for a rather creepy scene with Cruise's character looking out over a field, but in the end it just seemed to make for a rather pointless plot cul de sac. Then there is the scenes with Robbin's character, that quite frankly bog the movie down to a stand still. The basement scene went on way to long, I am guessing it was there to keep down costs as while they were in the basement they were also saving money by not having to show us the destruction caused by the tripods. Still though up to that point there were some nice action scenes and such, but still not up to par with movies that cost a fraction of the money such as 'Land of the Dead' made for 15 million, it looks just as impressive in places as this 135 million dollar movie. It needs more, more stars, more perspective than what we get. This movie just looks at one family's struggle during an alien invasion, unfortunately that has been done before in a movie called 'Signs'. There is really nothing new being brought to the table here.",7,3,8,30 June 2005
30 Days of Night," Rather good, bloody vampire movie...though not without its flaws.
","For the most part I enjoyed this movie, however, I thought it could have been better too. The story has a the town of Barrow, Alaska about to go into its yearly ritual of 30 days of night. A time when the sun doesn't come. However, this year things are going to be particularly bad as a group of vampires are coming to town for a thirty day feeding frenzy. Let's just say that they do not take to long making their presence known as they begin slaughtering the citizens soon after sundown. I was thinking at this point they should be thinking about pacing themselves because unlike the real Barrow, Alaska where I think there are quite a few people this one is limited to like 150 people during the dark month. Soon we are left with the sheriff and a few survivors doing what they can to avoid being on the menu. Lot's of blood as to be expected and for the most part it is pretty good. Still, in places the camera work and editing make the movie seem rather choppy and I had a rather hard time telling what was going on. The vampires were not distinct enough for me and for some reason spoke in a foreign language which I found rather unnecessary. Also, I doubt if anyone else thought this, but I kept thinking the way the movie was setup was a bit familiar. It reminded me of the Australian or New Zealand zombie flick 'The Undead'. I mean we have the initial stage of chaos, survivors finding rather good shelter (here in an attic, in that movie a fallout shelter), a town isolated, and even a scene in a local store where our troops gather supplies and run across another creature. Of course, that movie was funny while this one is almost completely devoid of humor. Still though, it is a nice little horror movie with a great concept...just needed a little work here and there.",7,0,1,4 March 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," When I was a kid I felt bad about really disliking the nurse, then I found out you were supposed to hate her!
","Not usually the type of movie that I would watch or like, but for some reason I really enjoyed this movie. A drama with good humor in it and top notch performances all the way around. Seriously though, when I first saw this movie as a kid I did not like nurse Rached and I did feel bad about it because she was the nurse and nurses are supposed to do what is best for you. Then later I found out you are in fact supposed to hate here, and despise her and I do feel that way about her and do not feel the least bit bad about it. One of my regrets over this film is that Jack Nicholson's character did not break that witch's neck and at least take her out. Most of the movie is not quite that dark as we have a new patient that comes into a mental ward and kind of rallies the patients to go against that nurse whenever possible. He makes friend with an old Indian who never speaks and does a lot of other things during this fine movie dealing with the patients as he makes friends and tries to make their lives a little less on schedule as it were. Nicholson turns in a very fine performance and I think he won an Oscar for his role, and if not he certainly deserved one. I am not sure but I think Louise Fletcher also got an Oscar as well, and if not one was certainly deserved in her case too as I really disliked her character. The movie runs over two hours, however it is a quick two hour run time as the story and characters are just to good for it to feel as if the film is dragging. The ending though is sad and like I sad Jack Nicholson's character could have had the same fate, but man it would have been so nice if he could have just snapped Ratched's neck. Oh my, that is a bit harsh on my part not isn't it?",9,1,2,22 March 2010
Army of Darkness," The ending to a very good, but rather odd set of movies.
","The first movie was Evil Dead then came Evil Dead II and finally this little gem, Army of Darkness. The first one was almost pure horror, while the second interjected some humor here and there, but was still mainly a horror while this one has very little horror at all and is more of an action comedy. Once again this movie sort of picks off where the previous movie leaves off, sort of as we have our hero Ash transported back to medieval times where he is mistaken for a member of an opposing army. The previous movie had him hailed as a hero right away, but here he is taken prisoner and forced to fight the evil dead in a very cool pit fighting scene. He quickly wins the respect of the ones who tried to kill him and he is sent on a quest to fetch a book that has the ability to send away the evil dead and help him get back to his own time. What ensues are some very funny scenes and a rather big battle at the end which is also rather funny, lets face it seeing a guy picking up obvious fake skeletons and acting like they are attacking is just humorous. Bruce Campbell is great in this movie, however no one else in the cast really sticks out all that much except for the main villain who also just happens to be Bruce Campbell. Still he carries this movie and he is enough for one funny action horror movie.",9,2,4,7 July 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Needs more horror.
","Yes this look at Dracula is definitely more romance than horror as there is really nothing that is all that scary in it.  Not that it is entirely bad...in fact I would say I found it an ok movie, just needed more horror. The story is of course about Dracula...Keanu Reeves character goes to work for him after his previous employee Renfield went insane.  Dracula sees a picture of Reeves fianc√© (Ryder) and since she looks like someone he used to be in love with he goes after her leaving Reeves a prisoner in the castle. Dracula makes it to where Ryder is and attempts to win her over.  Meanwhile, Reeves makes his escape.  Hopkins playing Van Helsing comes involved, as Dracula has been sucking on Ryder's friend Lucy so she is a bit ill and Helsing is some expert.  All in all not a bad film just needed a little more work in the horror department.",6,0,1,3 March 2003
Die Hard with a Vengeance," This Die Hard is the fastest moving of the trilogy.
","I like this one about as much as I like the first one. The first one had a better plot and was more tense, but this one moves at a very fast rate and it seems like it is over before it begins. A vast improvement over part two, this movie once again finds McClane in the middle of an emergency situation. This time, unlike part two, though it is very reasonable that he is involved as Irons character is the brother of the lead villain of the first Die Hard. Throw in a very funny Samuel L Jacksoncharacter and you have the makings of a great film action wise andcomedy wise too. This one centers around a mad bomber, threatening to blow up several places including a school if officer McClane does not play the game. McClane must do whatever the bomber says and boy does the bomber do a lot to get our hero down. Great action is a given as our hero desperately must try to find the bombs. Multiple car scenes a cool scene on a boat, and loads and loads of gold thrown in for an exciting ride. Irons is great as the villain, as was Rickman in the first one. Truly this is one fast moving ride that will keep you well entertained throughout.",9,90,102,8 July 2005
Con Air," Stars galore in this action flier.
","Cage is a prisoner hitching a ride on an airplane transporting dangerous criminals across the land. Is he a bad guy, not really, but apparently if you are in the army you can not defend yourself or your loved one because you might hurt someone. He does, ends up killing a guy and winds up in jail. Well he stays for a while, but now it is time for his freedom, unfortunately the more dangerous criminals want their freedom as well and they end up hijacking said airplane and taking it over. Lots of action in this one, liked 'The Rock' better, but this one has something better in it, in that it has a better bad guy played by the always good John Malkovich. It also has a whole lot of other stars too, Cusak, Ving Rames, Steve Buschemi, and even Dave Chappalle in a small but funny role. So you get it all here action, comedy, and a little romance too thrown in very small doses. You also get a great climatic ending as you get a plane crash and a chase in Las Vegas. So buckle in, and enjoy this very thrilling ride.",8,0,1,20 July 2005
Jaws," Great shark flick.
","Definately the best movie ever about a killer shark...Jaws is set in a resort town and is of course about a shark terrorizing said town.  All the actors in this one do a great job, but the person who does the best job is Robert Shaw who plays a shark hunter.  Roy Shieder plays a sheriff of the town and Richard Dreyfuss plays a marine biologist of sorts.  There is great tension throughout the movie and some good comedy here and there as well. The shark attack scenes are pretty good too, especially the one when you see the shark go for the one guy after the kids boat is tipped over.  The first part of the movie is the town, and the second is the boat scenes and them tracking the shark.  The movie though could have had at least one more shark attack though, as I think they go off to hunt it to fast.  Though the interplay between the three main characters is at its best in the boat scenes.",9,0,1,21 February 2003
Kingpin," Funny movie, but tails off at the end.
","I like this one about as much as I do 'There is Something about Mary', unfortunately it didn't get near the revenue at the box office.  Still though I enjoyed it as I saw it at the theater.  I went to the theater to see this movie with my friend, but I really didn't want to see that movie so I thought I would give this one a try and I was pleasantly surprised as I had a good time at this one.  The story is a washed up bowler who lost his hand tutors an Amish guy who wants to save his farm.  The movie is very funny with jokes flying.  Unfortunately, it is a Farrelly brother movie so it has its dead spots of no humor.  Here the last 20 minutes of the movie loses the energy and pace the rest of the movie has and there are only a few chuckles to be had.  The cast is great as Quiad, Woody, and Vanessa Angel are great.  So is the small role of Bill Murry as a rival bowler.  All in all a very funny movie, that might have benefited if it was a bit shorter than it is.  Though it is worth checking out.",8,0,4,17 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Featuring Darth Vader's most embarrassing moment ever!
","This film concludes the new Star Wars set of films, thankfully. The first two were weak, however this one has enough to it to be considered okay in my book. Still not perfect, but there are cooler things going on in this one than happened in the previous movies. Still, the guy doing Anakin is still painful to watch and Ewan still looks like he has really no interest in being in these films, but you get a few nice fights here and there and it ends so no more Star Wars films till they remake the original movies after George Lucas dies (come on, you know it is going to happen). The plot has them rescuing the guy that would become the evil emperor in the original set of films. They face down Christopher Lee's character again and for some reason Anakin has no trouble with him this time even though Lee wiped the floor with him in the last film. This also makes the last fight between Obi Wan and Anakin make little sense as Lee is still stronger than Obi Wan. Well it is not to long before the robot warriors are defeated and the emperor makes his move by dispatching Samuel L. Jackson who likes to star in as many movies a year as possible. I like him in most films, but he just did not fit into the Star Wars universe very well. What makes this one good though is the cool ending with fights between Yoda and the emperor and Obi and Anakin. With these cool fights though come awful scenes such as Darth going 'Nooooo' like a pansy, Amidale naming the kids, and their crudely made up plan to wipe C-3PO's memory. Seriously, he should have just been left out of this series all together. It was not like he was all entertaining in the first films, in fact he was a bit annoying then too. Another plus though is Jar Jar is limited to a non-speaking role as the sad people of Naboo mourn their loss and everyone in the known universe forgets about their planet in the next films.",6,1,3,7 June 2010
The Lion King," From a person who generally does not enjoy a Disney musical this one was pretty good.
","I know my score does not seem all that high, but trust me from me a seven is good for a motion picture of this type. This one, unlike many other Disney musical cartoons is a film I say was pretty good. The songs were okay and fit the story well and the animation was rather good and the story not all that bad either. The humor was funny, and though it got semi serious at times the flow of the film was good and never really bogged down even when it did tend to be a bit more on the sentimental side. The story of a young lion cub, who is the son of the lion that rules the valley is nice. You watch him progress through this life and you meet the villain Scar who hatches a plan to not only rid the valley of this cub, but the father as well who happens to be Scar's brother. He does this with help from the hyenas and after seemingly succeeding with getting rid of those two, he takes over the valley and lets the hyenas do as they wish. Well unbeknown to Scar, the son, Simba, has survived and he becomes friends with a couple of funny characters Timon and Pumbaa. They add a lot of comedy to the film and I really laughed at the scene where they sing their song as a distraction using Pumbaa as basically bait. So a nice movie that ends really quickly and is good even to a guy who usually dislikes this type of movie this one is a nice treat.",7,1,2,13 October 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Robert Downey Jr. plays this role as good as he did Iron Man, Sherlock is rather astounding.
","I really wanted to see this one in theaters, but I unfortunately never got around to it. Instead I got the DVD as an Easter gift and have to say it was a really entertaining flick that I thoroughly enjoyed. Of course when you get right down to it I suppose I liked this one mainly thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the famous detective from England. He is quickly becoming my favorite actor which is kind of funny and sad that really no one in the younger generation can really carry a movie like this man who was once in very really danger of ending up like so many young actors who achieve success at a young age. Instead, he has rebuilt himself as a person who can take on action roles and is able to deliver humorous quips while in said movie. Let's face it who else in the younger generation is even close, certainly not say Shia LeBleaf a guy they say is the next big thing, but all he has done is star opposite Harrison Ford and giant robots both of which were the primary draw for people seeing those movies. Here Sherlock is shown at the beginning of the film foiling the plans of a man named Blackdale. He is apparently some sort of black magic practitioner. Well it is not to long after that this man is hung, but after a bit it seems that this man has risen from the grave and once again Sherlock must find out what is going on. This Sherlock seems equipped with an extremely sharp mind capable of processing information at an astounding rate. At times it seems he processes to much info which is probably why he is in need of a smoke from his pipe which contains something other than tobacco I believe. The setting is nice, I like the way the movie looked and the cast apart from Robert is good too as Jude Law made an excellent Dr. Watson. I enjoyed their byplay. Good action, good mystery and good humor in this movie had it all pretty much covered. There does seem to be a huge opening for a sequel, I usually prefer a movie to be standalone unless you already have the other movies pretty much made as was the case with the Lord of the Ring trilogy, but I will forgive it here as this movie was successful enough I believe to have a sequel green lighted. I do wish though that he had one more of his narrations where he says to himself how he is going to take someone out and then they show it. All in all though a rather complete film that was entertaining, hopefully Iron Man 2 will be as fun to watch as this one was.",9,1,3,9 April 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Pretty good movie...one of those that you do not really need to watch from beginning to end.
","I like this movie all right, I would not rank it on my top movies of all time and I am also not the type of person to give every movie I see either a nine or ten or one and two. There are six other numbers in between and I use them all and I say this one warrants a seven. The movie about two inmates becoming friends in a corrupt prison has its charm. It also has its bad points that being the evil prison system with its mean warden and guards who batter the prisoners. Still, I can role with that as I can the fact that Tim Robbins is horribly cast in this film. When he first arrives at Shawshank he does the role perfectly, however his performance never changes throughout the movie. He still talks softly, still has the same look, the guy has supposedly spent some time here so he is going to change even if he does not lose his hope. There are many positives too though as Morgan Freeman literally carries the film and I loved the ending escape scenes. I also like the fact I can just start watching this movie in the middle and just go on doing something else. Maybe pick it up again later at the beginning, it is just one of those movies that I can watch it from here or there and be entertained, but do not necessarily feel I have to watch it from beginning to end. I know I am now going to be attacked though as I did not give this movie a nine or ten though. Especially attacking a movie that so many people think is the greatest thing ever, however this is just an opinion so just chill. At least I did not like it and give it a one to lower its score like some people have.",7,0,4,22 January 2010
The Cannonball Run," A lot of stars race across country.
","This movie was pretty good, not the best comedy of the 1980's its main attraction was less the plot or anything the movie had to offer, but rather its huge cast of characters. Burt Reynolds and Dom Delouise are the headliners, but aside from them there is Roger Moore of James Bond fame, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr., Adrien Barbeau and even Jackie Chan. The plot is fairly simple, the cannonball run is about to take place and a host of oddballs is entering to win the prize. Burt and Dom are on the same team and they figure out the perfect vehicle to race cross country to avoid the police if possible an ambulance. It is actually brilliant and quite frankly I do not see how they did not destroy everyone else who was racing, because most of the vehicles consisted of sporty cars, the types of which the cops are looking for. Granted Adrian's team had a nifty trick that worked a lot, but was not fool proof. The comedy also at times makes no sense, they establish that Burt and Dom know Sammy and Dean's team, early before the race yet for some reason Dom's character gets fooled by them later during the race. There is also a rather pointless fight scene near the end of this one too, where all the main stars duke it out with a biker gang or something. Also, Dom's character has a bit of a split personality which as a kid I liked, but now I have to say it was rather silly. Still, it was an okay movie and is better than the sequel. Part two is essentially the same movie and I thought even Speed Zone was better than that one.",6,0,0,22 December 2009
The Conjuring," Glad to see an R rated film do so well, but not sure why it is
","I love horror films and I think a true horror film should be rated R. Unfortunately, over the years, the makers of films have tried their hardest to make everything they can into a PG-13 film, for reasons I cannot quite explain. As if there are that many 13 to 16 year old's whose parents will not take them to an R rated film to doom a good film to failure without them. Well this film is proving that they are not needed! For that I salute this movie and wish for its continued success. However, at the same time I am baffled as to why it is exactly doing so well. I went to this film and I have to say about the only haunted house clich√© they were missing in this film was a cat scare. I was bored for a lot of this film to be quite honest. This film had some interesting story aspects and it also picked up near the end, but I just do not see what the fuss is about.The story has a couple moving into a new house with their five daughters. Meanwhile, we are introduced to another couple who investigate paranormal activities. The family who moved into the new house seem to be coming under attack by a spirit and soon the paths will cross as the ones who investigate the paranormal come to the aid of the family. Things become dire when the mother of the family begins to act oddly and the strange presence that is tormenting the family finds its way into the home of the couple who investigate the strange happenings.The acting is fairly decent which helped the film out immensely. As I said, I was getting bored here and there and it was only the acting that kept me awake. The scares were the typical loud noises in the night and at times I was reminded of various other haunting films such as Poltergeist, Amityville and a myriad of others. The film switches a bit in tone and turns into more of an exorcism movie, but that has been done before too in Amityville II: The Possession.I do not want to give the impression that the film was bad, just a movie I have seen on more than one occasion. I find it strange that people are calling it original. It had good acting though and there were aspects of the story I enjoyed and thought interesting. To often though I felt that they used the book of haunted house clich√©s and were crossing off the ones they used. Like I said, I think they crossed off everyone, but were not able to cross off 'Open door and cat jumps out.'",6,14,25,28 July 2013
Prometheus," A new start for the terror.
","I wanted to watch this film at the theaters, but never was able to make it. Part of what destroyed my drive to see it were the many people who had bad things to say about it. So I waited, and probably never would have seen it if not for someone I know buying it and me watching their copy. Suffice to say, it was rather good. I mean the film did not answer all of life's answers for me and explain everything, but it entertained me and that is what I was looking for. Seriously, you cannot spell out everything in a two hour movie, if the filmmakers went into super detail about why this travels this fast or why that got invented the film would be five hours long! No, this story tells a story about a team following what they decipher as a map to an alien world.The story starts out quickly. You see a strange alien drinking stuff and dissolving, then you see a discovery by some scientist types and then wham, they are on the ship about to arrive at their location. Sure they could have shown us more on how they got here, but that would have made the film too long and too talky. They quickly discover a facility on this planet and explore it and it is a very ominous place. Things get bad in a hurry! There are some cool deaths in this one, but I think they could have done a better job varying things up. It was awesome seeing the strange snake like monster attack the two scientists who got left in the facility when the storm struck. However, after this when the one went on the rampage I was disappointed as I was hoping for something a bit more interesting as far as the deaths of the crew. Still, some enjoyable chills in this one as we witness the creation of a new form of life.This film is a movie format I enjoy, which is explore the mysterious planet or town or forest. I love people going into an area that could prove hostile and that is why I enjoyed this one so much. There is something interesting to me about people going into a place for the first time and trying to figure out what a place really is.So the movie to me was good. It did not leave me completely satisfied, but for the most part I was happy with what was presented. It makes me want to watch the first Alien film again to see if I can see where they are going. I am wondering if they are going to do another prequel, though I do hope they do not do a remake of the first film. Science fiction horror is what we have here and it is a pretty darn good one.",8,4,9,18 October 2012
Halloween," The original and still the best.
","This movie started off the wave of slasher movie copycats and was the beginning of an era.  Though some will argue TCM and 'Black Christmas' were also partly responsible for the explosion of slasher flicks.  This was I believe Carpenter's second film the first being 'Assault on Precinct 13'. This movie has great atmosphere (a Carpenter trademark), music, and tension. This movie involves the super killer Michael Myers before he made to many movies and became increasingly annoying.  The plot was simple, no grandiose settings and bizarre situations were needed for this very good and suspenseful film.  This one simply has a maniac escaping from a mental hospital and returning to the town he grew up in, on Halloween and he isn't in the best of moods.  He ends up terrorizing a baby sitter played by Jamie Lee Curtis who is watching a young boy for the night.  This one has some good deaths and some very memorable scenes (I love it when Myers sits up). After this film a sequel would follow that would be rather good and then part 3 which was interesting, but did not really have anything to do with the first two.  The rest are just plain awful.  This movie also has the most Halloween feeling of the bunch.  You feel as if it is Halloween here and not just a few decorations scattered here and there.  The second one did it well too.  The rest of them starting with four though all feel kind of generic. They just don't seem like Halloween.",9,1,6,3 February 2004
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman makes a wondrous debut on the big screen
","Wonder Woman is probably the best known female superhero, Marvel or DC. They made a television show featuring her back in the 70's starring Lynda Carter and was probably the first introductions of her to me as a child as well as the old Justice League cartoons they used to air all the time. A bit surprising that it took so long for her to be featured in a film, but not surprised by the success this movie is having as it was good. It also features a new character and I do believe that is another reason it has been successful. DC seems to be only good at getting Batman and Superman up onto the big screen. Granted, they did Green Lantern too, but I may have enjoyed that one a bit, most however turned their backs on it. I do not think though, that this is the best comic book film ever as some reviewers claim as I can think of many that I thought were better; however, this was a good one. Like a lot of films these days though, it did run a little long, but so many go over two hours. At least this one showcased the hero a lot more than other films. Watch a Transformers film and you get so much padding that is unnecessary while they shy away from showing any action, while this one has Diane battling rather early.The story has a race of women known as Amazons living on an island that is hidden from the rest of the world. On it a young child resides whose mother is queen. Diane wants to learn how to fight, but her mother is a bit hesitant. The mother's sister convinces the mother that Diane needs to know how to fight and thus her training begins. When sparring she displays a power that seems more unnatural and powerful than even her fellow Amazons posses. A plane flies through the dome that hides the island and soon Diane learns of a war that is killing millions. She wishes to stop this war and goes with the pilot, Steve, to London where he assembles a rag tag group to try and find a chemicals weapon plant where a chemist known as Dr. Poison works to make a chemical weapon that will render gas masks useless. However, Diane's main goal is to find the god of war, Ares whom she believes responsible for the deadly war plaguing the world.I enjoyed this film as Gal Gadot does a good job as Wonder Woman/Diane. When she first arrives in London it is humorous watching her try and fit in and get clothes. Chris Pine does a nice job too playing essentially her love interest. The film also kept me guessing as to who the bad guy was going to be. I knew the one guy was too obvious, but in the end I did not figure out who it was until they revealed themselves.So the film was good and it had more action than I was expecting as a couple of people I know almost made it sound like a chick flick or something. No, it is most certainly a comic book film, in fact I would compare it to another war time comic book film, Captain America. Only in this one you do have Diane's naivety of the world outside her island differentiating it from that film as well that this one was set during World War I rather than the second World War. I have enjoyed all the DC films thus far, unlike a lot of people. I thought Man of Steel, Suicide Squad were both really good and rank this one with those and all three are better than Batman versus Superman. I am only counting the ones in this new shared universe and not going back any further than Man of Steel. So good film, nice action and a wonderful start for the most well known female superhero.",9,7,15,28 June 2017
Carrie," Teenage comes of age flick.
","This story is of Carrie, a girl who is picked on to the ridicules extreme right at the beginning of the movie.  The girls who pick on her are punished and one goes to the extreme to get revenge on the girl who had nothing really to do with her getting into trouble.  This one is so much like a typical day at a high school that it is boring.  Of course Carrie has a secret...her mom's psycho.  So when the teacher tells her about the problems Carrie has at school, she proceeds to beat Carrie and tell her how evil she is.  You just know she has a complex.  Carrie also has special powers too. So a nice girl lets Carrie go to the prom with her boyfriend, the bad girl dumps something on Carrie at prom and all heck breaks loose.  This film is just too mundane in some areas for it to be interesting.  Nothing you see is really all that revolutionary here...teens have been this way to each other forever.  The only thing interesting, or that is a new wrinkle is the powers and the really horrific prom, which for me just isn't enough to save the flick, but I can see why others like it.  It just isn't for me.",3,3,14,25 March 2003
1408," Room 1408, holds you in never letting go.
","This movie had me hooked rather quickly as the John Cusak character's job of writing about haunted places was very interesting. He goes into an old bed and breakfast place and does what he normally does and goes about his business. One day though he receives a post card that simply states a hotel's name and a warning, don't go into room 1408. Of course, being a writer of haunted places he is now compelled to go into this one. Once he arrives he is greeted by the hotel manager played very well by Samuel Jackson. They have a great conversation where Jackson's character tries everything to get our curious writer to reconsider staying in the room, a room where there are many deaths as no one has ever apparently survived an hour. Well the writer goes and at the start there is nothing really all that out of the ordinary. However, little things start to happen and before you know it spooks and such begin to appear, the room seems to be holding the writer prisoner and you begin to question what is real, or what is happening and if the writer has any chance of escaping. I was kind of relieved when he was ready to leave after the one incident, as I would have found it hard to believe anyone would not be spooked after the window and hand thing. The movie goes at a good pace and keeps you guessing, I was happy about the ending too, as I thought the sort of predictable scene that looked like the ending was going to be it. This room will take a hold of you, hopefully you can escape its grasp.",9,1,2,6 October 2007
Shrek," It was alright...nothing special.
","The way people talked about this movie I was expecting a laugh riot. Instead it was worthy of a few laughs here and there.  The first time I saw this I only caught the tail end of it (the last twenty or so minutes) and quite frankly it wasn't very funny at all.  Then I saw the whole movie and most of the best jokes are in the first hour.  Still it was only worth a chuckle here and there...I definitely don't see what the big deal was. Myers does the voice of the ogre, and he is basically doing his fat-b&st@rd Scottish voice, but he does rather well.  Murphy basically does the character he played in Mulan.  Lithgow, who does the best job isn't in it enough.  Some cute jabs at Disney in this one and their theme parks and overall it was ok, but not all it was hyped up to be.",6,1,2,2 April 2003
X-Men: First Class," This X-men movie is a first class ride.
","This X-men movie was great, out of all the X-men films this one ranks second to the second as X2 still holds the title as number one X-men film. This one is not to far behind, the only reason I did not give it a 10 are some problems this one has when tied with the other films. I know they say it is a reboot, but if that were the case why were there so many things tying this to the other films? Seriously, in a reboot you would change costumes and looks of characters, in this one when the young X-men wear their costumes for the first time Beast's costume looks like the one he wore in The Last Stand when he commented that he could not believe it used to fit him. That and it opened with a scene that looked as if it came right out of the first film, the awakening of a young Magento's powers. Enough of whether it is a prequel or a reboot, what it was for me was an entertaining film. The story has Eric (later to be known as Magneto) trying to find the man responsible for the death of his mother, a man who goes by the name of Sebastian Shaw. Meanwhile, Charles Xavier is writing papers and is a bit of a flirt as he and a young woman by the name of Raven have formed a special bond. Well it is not long before the two meet up as there is a wonderful scene where Eric finds Sebastian, and the army finds them both on Sebastian's boat. They soon join up and begin recruiting other mutants as Shaw has other mutants working for him so they think they need more to help in their struggle against him. The action is great here culminating in a great battle at the end and the full awakening of Magneto's powers. The effects are really good in this one too as is the acting. Nice to see Kevin Bacon in an extended role in this movie, when I first saw he was going to appear in this one I was afraid it would be nothing more than an extended cameo. The guy they got to play Magneto was great as I could actually see him looking like Ian McKellen when he ages. The guy playing Xavier is good too, just do not see him looking much like Patrick Stewart, but this goes back to the point of whether this is a prequel to those films or a reboot. I am sorry, but to me it seems like a prequel so the thing that happens to Charles at the end of this one does not really work in the context of the third film as in that one he and Eric visit a young Jean Grey and Charles is walking, also the fact that at the end of this one they are essentially against each other so chances are they would not be visiting her together unless even Eric felt her powers were in need of guidance at the time so he agreed to accompany Charles because of her being such a special case. Also, the end of Wolverine has an appearance of Charles at the end and he is walking, this one can be explained as the appearance of Charles could be akin to what Emma Frost did to the Russian dude here in that he simply made himself appear to the young X-men. Like I said though this may be a reboot making all these points groundless except for the many things tying this film to the other four movies. Other than this gripes it was a totally solid film, the best I have seen so far in the summer of 2011, mind you there are still many movies I intend to see. I also have to say this film features one of the best villain deaths ever, of course after that death the birth of one of the best villains ever begins.",9,6,10,6 June 2011
The Wolverine," The Wolverine has Wolverine doing what he does best, slashing
","I enjoyed this film, but then I enjoyed X-Men Origins: Wolverine as well. Though for different reasons obviously. That one was fun and I enjoyed seeing the different mutants they incorporated into the story, but at the end of the day it was a bit cheesy. This one is of a more serious tone, but this one seems more like a gateway film that was made to lead up to the super big X-men film coming out in 2014. Basically, putting the films on their course as it reestablishes the films are indeed all tied together with the exception of the origins one. So the first three films then First Class are connected. Though I do feel this film was made in part to set up next year's film, the darker tone and the setting made it a good film to me and better than Wolverine's last solo outing.The story has Logan still struggling with the fact he ended Jean Grey's life in The Last Stand. He is living an isolated existence in the wilderness of Canada; however, a young girl named Yukio finds him and asks that he comes to Japan as the person she works for is dying and one of his wishes is to see the man that rescued him during World War II. Logan reluctantly agrees and soon learns that the man did not wish to merely say his goodbyes to Logan, but to offer Logan the chance to live a normal life then die as he wants Logan's mutant ability to heal for himself. Well Logan refuses, but there are more things going on as the old man's granddaughter is targeted by the Japanese mafia, a strange mutant named Viper seems to have her own agenda and Logan's healing abilities disappear. Logan must protect the granddaughter and learn to once again become The Wolverine in order to survive the many perils that await him.The film is rated PG-13, but it probably only needs a couple of more things added to be an R. I find it strange that The Conjuring did get an R, but was not have as bad as this film as far as violence and language. The film has good action as I enjoy watching Hugh Jackman portray Wolverine; however, the story at times gets a bit to convoluted as this person is really working for that person or this man is the one that is trying to kill the other person. Thankfully, though the story is passable enough to lead to some great shots and scenes. The Silver Samurai was pretty cool at the end and also make sure to wait for an nice ending scene after a few of the credits pass. This scene does so much more than the one seen at the end of Iron Man 3 as it actually establishes something.So I enjoyed Wolverine's second solo outing, though at some point I wish they would spend a bit more time with some of the other X-Men (granted, they did that a bit with First Class). I enjoyed the setting of this one more as I enjoyed the overall feel of this film to Origins. I also liked that this film establishes that The Last Stand happened and this was not yet another quick reboot. I am very much looking forward to the next X-Men film, but it was nice to see everybody's favorite mutant slash and stab his way back into theaters.",8,4,9,5 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," I kept my expectations low which helped this movie rise.
","I went to see this film with low expectations and the film far exceeded them. It is a nice trick I learned, helped me enjoy The Amazing Spider-man more too. I just knew this film was not going to be as good as the second film and I thought it would be to long and there would be other problems with the plot. I still like the second one best, but this one was really good too. As you can see I gave all three in the trilogy 10's which will bring upon the hatred of people who for this or that reason did not like the Nolan films. I do not really understand those who liked the first two films not liking this one as it plays out in the same way, it is not vastly different in the least. It also seemed a lot shorter than its long running time suggested it would. I was hooked the entire time, I cannot believe how many said this film was boring. To each their own, I know for reasons unknown there was this war between all the comic book films released this summer, each claiming their movie was going to be superior, being a fan of comics I enjoyed all three a whole lot. Honestly, I do not get a dime from these films so the only reason I would care about the box office is for two of the films to have sequels green lighted. This one though is the finale, so this one's take means nothing to me. Its enjoyment value to me does and it did not disappoint in that regard.The story has Gotham basically at peace. Thanks to Batman taking the fall for Harvey Dent, most of Gotham's criminals are locked away in prison. Commissioner Gordon regrets letting Batman take the fall, and it is clearly eating away at him to the point he keeps a speech where he will reveal the truth to Gotham, but he just cannot bring himself to do that. Instead he praises each day the man who tried to take his son's life. Bruce has become a recluse, his days as Batman now seemingly gone. He is consumed by thoughts of Rachel and is unable to move on. However, Selena Kyle steals a necklace and his fingerprints and this sparks a bit of life in him and a terrorist named Bane brings back the bat. Things will get much worse though before this criminal can be taken care of as Gotham will be pushed to the very brink of annihilation by Bane, who has secrets he keeps in the shadows.Once again the cast is superb, I enjoyed the portrayals of Catwoman and Bane in this film. I do not understand why so many complain of Anne's Catwoman, I thought it was the cutest one yet. Well I will say she and Lee Merriwether from the 60's are tied. I just thought Michelle Phifer's was to pale and Halle Berry's to much like a stripper. Granted, attractiveness is all a matter of taste, so I will not begrudge people who they thought was the best. I will say though I did like the fact that here Catwoman is just a cat burglar as I believe that is more in the lines with the comics. Bane was also done well, as he may not be getting steroids pumped into him, Nolan was still able to give him the same basic weakness as the Bane from the comics. I also liked how he was able to make Bane look as if he towered over Batman, yet I believe Bale is actually taller than Hardy. All the rest of the cast is great two, but I mainly wanted to go over the two villains. Most of the others are characters we have seen before. Though there was an interesting addition of a young cop that played out nicely for me.Nolan nearly did the entire movie right, at least in my eyes. There were a couple of areas that could have been improved upon, but in this I may just be nitpicking. I would of liked some mention of the Joker in this one. It could of been the clown prince of crime caused this or something simple. I understand perfectly why no one was recast in the role, but why make no mention of the Joker at all? Granted, this is not the issue I expected it to be as the way scenes played out there was no need to mention him, I just think it would be cool if they did mention Batman's greatest nemesis. My guess is if Heath Ledger did not die, he would of been in this movie as there are story arc's with Joker and Bane in the comics, usually with the Joker getting pulverized. The ending to the film seems to be up for debate too, for whatever reasons I am not sure. It is an 'is he' or 'isn't he' type thing. Me I think it was pretty clear what occurred and the ones thinking hallucination are just looking to much into it, however, it does not hurt anything if this is what they believe and if they enjoy making these theories more power to them. I liked the way it ended though, as there was so much pain and tragedy that it was nice to see some happiness finally come to the character.So I did enjoy this film a lot and I did like the entire trilogy. It was nice to have a comic book series where the third film was not significantly weaker than the second movie. Like I stated above, the main reason I preferred the second one this time was a preference to the villains...they are my two favorites. This one though ended the story bringing it to a nice close as the Dark Knight indeed did rise.",10,3,7,24 July 2012
Black Panther," Another Marvel hit
","I did not think I would enjoy this film as much as I did from the trailers I saw of the film, but it ended up surprising me. This movie gives us more insight into the world of the hero, the Black Panther, first introduced into the Marvel movie universe in the third Captain America movie. The film is rather lengthy as we traverse a lot of ground in this one as the film features two villains. While the film is good, it also really does nothing to lead up to the Infinity War film coming up later this month. Then again, very few Marvel films have really done much lead in to it other than the first Guardians of the Galaxy film and the introduction of a few infinity stones here and there. Mainly, in films like this, the only we get is an introduction to a new Marvel character on the big screen.The story has the Black Panther taking on the role of king in his country after a ceremony where he can be challenged by others in his country of Wakanda. His first course of action is to take on a man who has been smuggling vibranium and selling it to the rest of the world. Vibranium is the strongest metal in the world! Well, it is in the Marvel cinematic universe, but it is actually admantium in the comics. Vibranium is a metal in the comics that is unstable and has to be interwoven in other metals to be effective, otherwise it is just a dangerous and highly volatile liquid metal that can cause great amounts of damage if left unchecked. When combined with admantium it then becomes nearly indestructible as this is what the Cap's shield is actually made of, not just vibranium. Um, kind of went on a nerd rant there. Well, they track this villain to a place in Asia, but soon another villain appears, calling himself, Killmonger. He is also of Wakadian descent and soon makes a bid for the throne himself. Soon a power struggle takes a place with the winner being head of the country with the largest vibranium deposits in the world! I liked the character of the Black Panther and I enjoyed seeing inside his world which is very ritualistic and at the same time futuristic! There was more humor in the film than I was expected and I thought the Black Panther's sister was so cute and funny. The villains were both good in this one too, as we had one that had a super weapon within his hand and Killmonger seemed such a unstable villain as he looks so reserved and then goes insane at times. The film was better than I was expecting as the trailers did not do the film justice. The film had very good action and some nice humor to fill in the spots between the action. I enjoyed the scenery in this one and the look into the fictional country of Wakanda. If another Black Panther film comes out, I look forward to seeing it as well.",8,12,23,8 April 2018
Iron Man," Iron Man was the start of the Marvel comic universe we know today
","I revisited this film for the first time in a while and I have to say, that the Marvel universe really started off on the right foot. Sure, Spider-man had already had three huge blockbusters and the X-men were successful and the Hulk, well he was in a very artsy film; however, as far as films that were interconnected and leading to big things this would be the start. Granted, The Incredible Hulk would stumble a bit, though I enjoyed that one too. This one showed that a lesser known hero could take the center stage as back then he was known to us comic geeks, but not as widely known as heroes such as Spider-man, Superman, Batman or others. Now, nearly everyone knows about him and this is the film that kicked him off and put him on the right track. An origin film that gets quite a bit right as far as how Tony Stark became Iron Man in the comics. Very good action and the effects were good too as the Iron Man armor looks very good. I always enjoy seeing Iron Man in films now because his armor always looks totally cool to me.The story has Tony Stark demonstrating his latest weapon in the middle east. He designs weapons and his company is a major player in the military. Well the convoy he is in gets attacked and he is taken prisoner. He has shrapnel in his chest and it is heading to his hear; however, a doctor has placed a magnet in his chest to keep it out. The terrorist holding him, want him to make a missile, but he decides to do something else. So he designs a arc reactor in his chest and then designs a suit to make his escape in. Once home he decides to stop making weapons and instead focuses on designing a more state of the art suit so he can do some good in the world and be a protector rather than a destroyer. Unfortunately, a man who works at Stark Enterprises and is second in command as plans of his own to build a suit and for more militaristic purposes.The first thing they got right in this one was casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He does a great job and I have enjoyed seeing him portray the role again and again. Terrance Howard was Rhodey in this film and would have continued to be the character, but a salary dispute led him to leaving the role. He is okay, but now that Don Cheadle has been Rhodey in every film since this one it is a bit strange seeing Howard in the role now for me. Jeff Bridges does an okay job as the bad guy, but the suit he wears is a bit more awesome than he is as the main bad guy.The film was good as it started up the Marvel universe of films. Nowadays, the humor and action seen in the films stem from the start which is this film. You get to see the old school Iron Man suit and the more up to date one, though I do wish you got to see the fully operational suit a bit more as the last battle has Iron Man battling at less than full power. Still, the last fight in this one was a bit better than the final fights in the sequels. The film also ends in a bit of a humorous and unexpected way as opposed to what was the standard back in the day with the hero on a rooftop or standing sulkily on a ledge.",9,1,2,13 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The first hero versus hero battle of 2016
","This film has not been doing so well with critics, but from the looks of its worldwide box office total, I do not think this film is going to be considered a financial failure. I was not sure what to expect considering the bad reviews and the fact so many seemed to really dislike the film, but overall I enjoyed it. Seems this one is going to end up being like the Man of Steel, where it was you either loved it or you hated it. I enjoyed that one as well, in fact, I probably enjoyed that one a bit more than this one. This one did a lot of good things and had great action sequences, but there were some things that were simply very puzzling going on too. Going in, my main concern was the casting of two of the characters as I was not sure how to feel about Ben Affleck's Batman or Jesse Eisenberg's Lex. Well, Ben Affleck turned in a very good portrayal of the Dark Knight making me wish he had gotten a stand alone film before this movie had come out. Jesse Eisenberg though was not the problem with Lex Luthor. He did alright, but it was how he was presented that I found some fault with and I will discuss that more later.The story has Superman still saving the day, but the events of Man of Steel are shown to have claimed many innocent people, including people working for Bruce Wayne. An incident in Africa that claimed many lives has people clamoring that Superman must be controlled and enter Lex Luthor who has found a mysterious green rock among the debris from General Zod's ship. Bruce Wayne also has an interest as he wants to bring Superman to justice for the clash Superman and Zod had in Metropolis. With some manipulation, Luthor orchestrates a scenario where the two heroes are at odds and the build up to an all out fight is eminent; however, something else is going on where no one can see it, a massive threat that may be just the thing to unite the two feuding heroes and bring another hero into the mix as well.The main problems I had with the film is the overall flow of the film. It moved slowly, but this turned out to sort of be a positive too as it really got me anticipating the showdown between Batman and Superman. I also understand why it had this pace as DC is kind of behind at the moment. Why are they so behind Marvel? Well, the first attempt at revitalizing the Superman franchise kind of stalled with Superman Returns and then the Green Lantern film also misfired. However, more than those two failures was the success of the Nolan Batman films. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed his trilogy, but he created a realistic and gritty Gotham where the son of Kyrpton just does not seem possible at all. So you cannot really have superheroes in this world, but at the same time you cannot really have this particular Batman in a world where there are super powered people, but you can't do a Justice League without Batman so you end up waiting until the Nolan films are done which takes seven years. The other main problem I had with this film is Lex Luthor. Once again, had nothing to do with the actor, but how he was presented. Why was he doing what he was doing? It made no sense, he gives a throwaway line about being abused, but that is not enough explanation as to why he wants Superman dead or why he wishes to create an abomination. It is like the fact he is Lex Luthor and Superman's number one villain is reason enough, but it isn't. We need more reason why he is the psycho that he is other than daddy hit me...at least I do. Then there was the dream sequence where Bruce wakes up from a dream and is confronted by a strange man seeming to be issuing a warning from the future or something and this too is a dream. Maybe this will be explained in a later film, but it really made no sense in the context it was used here in this film. Then again, I am more Marvel fan than DC, so someone from the DC universe may know exactly what that was all about.Overall, I enjoyed the film a good deal. It is like a lot of films I saw last year though that just were not good enough to warrant giving the film higher than an eight which to me is a good movie so in no ways am I saying it was a bad film. Batman was done really well, the film had excellent action sequences and the fight between the two titans was awesome. There was just a lot going on that just needed more work as the film spent a bit too much time getting really revved up and there were just a few holes in the story and some of the characters. This film was not as good as Deadpool to me also released this year and I am betting I like the next superhero clash more too in the form of Captain America: Civil War, but as I have said, I have always been more Marvel than DC fan, but I do really enjoy both. I enjoyed this film quite a lot and I look forward to the next installment and I hope to see Ben Affleck get a standalone Batman film sometime in the future too.",8,4,6,28 March 2016
Blade Runner," Great visuals, acting, and some interesting story elements.
","This movie could have been an easy ten as it nearly has it all. Except for one thing that would have helped immensely. Is it the visuals you ask? No, the visuals look great even for a movie made back in 1982. It captures a futuristic city so well, a dark and grimy place with technology in areas to give it a certain color scheme. It is almost a live action anime when one looks at other films such as 'Akira'. Is it the acting you ask? No, the acting could not be better, Harrison Ford playing the lead, a man who hunts down rouge androids and Rutger Hauer is always excellent if you ask me. No one does a better job if he had a more typical Hollywood look he would have been the lead in a lot more mainstream fare. And Sean Young and Daryl Hannah look absolutely great, with Daryl looking rather hot. So is it the story? Not entirely. The story has very good elements in it and there is something there. So what is it you ask? Well I know I am going to get hammered for voicing this opinion, but keep in mind it is an opinion...the main thing I had a problem with is the lack of action. I know story and such are important and yes there are lots of movies with no action I like, but this movie was about a man hunting down dangerous androids. This alone should entail that there is going to be a lot more action in the movie than there ended up being. Though the ending was excellent and everything else in this movie was superbly done, I needed some more shoot outs, more blood, and more death. At times the pacing in the movie had me a tad bored, and while it was still nice to look at and it was nice to see the actors have some good dialog, I always kept wanting more adrenaline type action. So there I said it, and I sort of regret it as this is probably one of those movies that people will not take to kindly anything negative said about it. Overall though it was a fine movie and entertaining. I loved Ford as the hunter like I said and I always enjoy Hauer. It amazes me this movie did not do better at the box office than it did. Just the visual style of it had to be something to marvel at back in 1982. So a rather good movie that could have been nearly perfect with a bit more action.",7,0,2,3 March 2010
Casino Royale," This Bond movie is a royal flush.
","I really enjoyed this film and it is the best movie I have seen this year as it is the only one I have given a ten too. Usually in a year there are at least two, and sometimes more, this year seemed destined to have none until I saw this movie. What can I say, I just had to have a little faith that 007 would save the day and movie year. Granted I enjoyed 'Die Another Day' a lot too, it was all gadgets and special effects...this one I liked because of the simplicity of it all. The gadgets are all but gone, the action is more stunt work than special effects and this one really looks at the character of Bond like no other Bond film has because this is the beginning of his 00 career. Craig is really good as Bond as I would say he is rather close to the best Bond Sean Connery. Though I have enjoyed all the actors who have played that character so far. The action is great, but that is to be expected, the emotional twists in the story were not expected and were welcome by me, this movie shows us just what has made James Bond who he is. Judi Dench returns as M and is solid as usual, and she was rather funny in some of her scenes. The story has Bond tracking a man who is sort of a banker for terrorist. This man has a plan that Bond foils and costs him quite a lot of money, which this man hopes to win back in a game of Poker. So Bond gets in on the game and is joined by a lovely lady whom he apparently is falling for bad. This movie plays out very well and I look forward to seeing it again, as I also look forward to seeing Craig as James Bond again.",10,5,9,21 November 2006
Space Jam," This one plays more like a Muppets movie.
","This movie was really bad.  The only saving graces are Bill Murray and Larry Bird's all to brief appearances.  We have definitely found something Jordan can't do and that is act.  That is kind of bad considering he is playing himself in this one.  Though most of his costars weren't there, so it might have been difficult.  At least he stopped after this one unlike Shaq who made four or five pictures...Thank God Phil Jackson came along and refocused him.  As for the plot being like a Muppets movie it is.  A few appearances here and there from a surprise celebrity, the whole working with live actors.  It just did not seem to be a Looney tunes movie.  Though they stopped being Looney a long time ago.  I liked Daffy Duck when he was, well, daffy...he has been smart aleck duck for a while now.  It just doesn't feel right.  All the Looney Tunes on one team, some being life long enemies...and what is the point of introducing the bad guy voiced by I think Danny DeVito. The Martian has always been trying to take over the world, why not just let it be him.  Also, what is up with the girl bunny?  Why introduce a new character?  I guess we just had to be politically correct.  Well this one may be good for the kiddies, but most of us are going to recognize it for what it is...one long commercial.  I saw a clip from the next Looney Tunes movie and it is even more Muppet looking than this one",3,8,19,17 September 2003
Signs," A different perspective on the alien invasion plot.
","This movie shows an alien invasion from the perspective of not those on the front line, but an average family.  They are not trying to beat the aliens and save the day, but rather are just simply trying to survive.  I think the film works well doing it as well.  Though it is also and mainly a movie about faith which it does very well too.  Mel Gibson and Phoenix do great jobs as do the children.  There are scenes to get the heart pumping and the first time I say it I worried for the family a bit.  I enjoyed this one a lot more than 'The Sixth Sense' (didn't see 'Unbreakable') because it was a lot less dreary and there was a good bit of humor in it as well.  There are some parts I had trouble with however, the fact the aliens seemed to be more like zombies or something instead of lasering everyone was a bit unrealistic, but I can overlook that in the fact it is like 'Night of the Living Dead' which I also enjoyed anyway.",9,0,3,22 January 2003
Speed," Well it does move very speedy for the most part.
","I liked this movie for the most part, fast, good music, and I like Keanu Reeves, Jeff Daniels and Dennis Hopper. It has a pretty good plot and the action is excellent. My only complaint is that there is way to much Sandra Bullock in the movie and not enough Jeff Daniels. Hopper and Reeves are in it perfectly. This is only an issue for me though cause if you like Bullock you will not mind her as much, as for me I do not care for her and I definitely was not going to see Speed 2 with her being the lead character. Here we have a guy trying to secure some funds by holding an elevator full of people hostage. His plans are foiled by to plucky members of the police force and he is seemingly killed. However, this turns out not to be the case as our mad bomber is still at large and he rigs a bus to explode if the bus goes under 55 mph hence the title of the movie. Granted, it is a stupid way to try and hold people ransom because if Reeves' character does not get to the bus on time it would have simply exploded, but hey it is just a movie. Lots of action ensues and a bit to much whiny Bullock for my tastes, but I roll with it. Great finishing fight on top of a train, however the scene with the runaway train seems just to much at this point and really is not necessary, we have already by this time put the characters through to much.",7,0,0,26 July 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," An old fashioned summer action movie.
","Yes, this is a throw back action movie when action movies in the summer meant lots of explosions, cool chases, and big name stars in the lead role. Granted you get explosions these days, but then you also have some super powered hero to save the day. Not here, here we get our old buddy John McClain. Who gets the rather simple job of escorted a known hacker to some Washington bureau, no problems right? Wrong, we get action right away and the film rarely lets up. Multiple shootings, car chases and fights...I am amazed actually that this film managed a pg-13 rating. So the plot? Internet terrorist are systematically disabling such functions as traffic, the stock market, and our utilities. A hacker hired by them to partially create this havoc unknowingly is now no longer needed and must be eliminated along with all the other hackers they hired to help create this meltdown. Well, unfortunately for the bad guys this particular one has a cop sent to get him and that cop is McClain. Amazing action ensues with a great gun fight to open it up, a cool copter chase, a fight with a kung fu babe and the explosive final showdown. It is nice to see Willis still in form, as it seems it has been awhile since one of the old action stars has done a movie of this caliber. His supporting cast is good to as I enjoyed the interaction between McClain and the hacker and the bad guy was good as well. Like I said this movie never really lets up, though still did not have quite the fast flow of part three or the amazing intensity of one, it is still a very strong entry into the Die Hard franchise.",9,0,1,4 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," Better than I expected.
","I thought this movie would be pretty good, but from the trailers I thought there would be way to many characters.  For the most part though they mainly focused on those who returned from the first movie, with only Nightcrawler and Pyro being the only new characters that showcased their powers.  I was a bit disappointed not to see much of Colossus, and Iceman didn't really do much, but aside from that this one was really good.  I also wished Cyclops was in it more, but that made for an interesting sidepiece as this movie takes place on three fronts.  McKellan is great as Magneto and all the other cast is rather good as well.  Though I loved watching Magneto escape from the prison.  Lady Deathstrike really didn't have too much screen time and she had only one line, but she had one heck of a fight with Wolverine in this one.  Though I wish their fight was a bit longer.  The highlights of this one include of course the fight with Wolvie and Deathstrike, the cool opening scene with Nightcrawler, the scene where Pyro goes berserk, and the scene where the troops raid Xavier's school.  There are other cool scenes in there, but these were my favorites.  I don't think the movie ended as weak as some movie critics have said it did, but it wasn't the best feature of the film.  I also didn't care for the introduction of the Phoenix character they gave flashes of throughout.  I don't know if it will go with the movie formula all that well.  All in all a good film, could have ended better, but I am just being picky.",10,1,3,3 May 2003
Thor: The Dark World," More Thor action this time around
","I enjoyed the first Thor film more than I was expecting, but I enjoyed this one even more. This is probably due to the fact that Thor had all his godly powers throughout the entire film. In fact, the first film played out a lot like a second superhero film as many times in the sequel to a comic book character the superhero will lose his powers at some point. The second Superman with Christopher Reeves and Spider-man 2 are examples of this. This one simply had Thor with all his powers on display and more scenes in Asgard and a unique Earth setting of London rather than the standard New York that made me enjoy this one more the the previous film and a bit more than the third Ironman released earlier this year.The story has some strange race of beings called the Dark Elves being awoken by a strange event that could spell the end of all realms if the Dark Elves have their way. Thor's love interest Jane Foster, comes into contact with this strange power and is soon the target of Malekith, leader of the Dark Elves. Thor takes Jane to Asgard despite opposition from his father Odin, but this will prove a costly move as the elves invade Asgard. Soon Thor must work with his brother Loki to lure the elves into a trap and save not only Earth and Asgard, but all realms in the universe.Once again the action is great this time and there is a lot more of it. My favorite parts though involved the scenes with Loki and Thor's uneasy alliance. This was interesting and funny at the same time. Anthony Hopkins returns as Odin and does a superb job as he usually does and Jane Foster's friends return in this one too, though with varying degrees of success as both are merely used for comic relief here.So, overall, I enjoyed this sequel more than the first film. I liked the action, Thor and Loki's interactions and the settings and look of the film. There is also sure to be a sequel considering how this one ended. There was an extra scene after a few credits role by, but it seemed so out of place from the rest of the film. I know it is a lead in for the Guardians of the Galaxy film, this is probably due to the fact I am just not really familiar with that particular comic franchise. All in all, it was nice to see a movie as there really was nothing I was really interested in seeing since July. I needed some filler as there may not be another film I want to see until next April! So nice comic action for the end of the year!",9,0,1,31 December 2013
The Sixth Sense," Interesting, but kind of a gimmick movie.
","This movie is kind of disjointed as it is over here then it is over there. The plot goes here and there also.  It is also a very somber movie with very little humor in it at all.  The color of the screen also seems to be somewhat grayed.  All in all though it is a pretty good film, but once I watched it once I wouldn't want to see it again.  I didn't really find the ending very shocking, but then I watched this one on video and not the theater so I knew to look for a surprise ending.  The story of the movie is that of a boy who sees ghosts and has other problems.  Bruce Willis is a doctor who wants to help him.  That is all I will say of the plot, because it kind of moves all over the place.",7,0,1,22 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I enjoyed this entry into the Star Wars universe more than the prequels
","My review is pretty much going to be one of those that are going to be unhelpful for all, I'm afraid. I only write these things so that when I pass on from this mortal world, something of me will remain. With this film though, I did not utterly love it and give it a ten so those that did are going to hate my review while on the other hand I did like the film and did not give it a one, so those that hated it or really disliked it will hate my review. I literally read a review where a person gave this film a one, but there were things he enjoyed about the film. Um, if you give the film the lowest ranking that means there should not be anything in it you enjoyed. There are a whole lot of numbers between 1 and 10 to use! It matters not; the film was good to me as it was better than the prequels. Why? Well for one it had better humor. Another reason? It felt more real while the prequels I felt I was watching people in front of a green screen. I can keep going on, but yeah, this one is better than the prequels; however, that being said, it is not as good as any of the originals either. I was really enjoying the film up until the final act which felt kind of rushed. After a certain character takes a fall, the film just speeds along to its conclusion and I just felt more was needed.The story is a bit of a retread of the first Star Wars film, but I was expecting it to be more so than it was. I felt it had enough new to offer to keep me entertained. Well, like in the first film, a droid is tasked with the final piece of the puzzle as Luke Skywalker has been missing and a new order has arisen to fill the void of the evil Galactic Empire left behind. A young girl and a storm trooper who has had enough will try to get the droid back to the resistance fighters lead by General Leia who is desperately trying to find Luke. They shall get help from Han Solo who has gone back to smuggling and Chewbacca ever loyal Wookie. The new order though has a new weapon that takes the power of the sun to cause devastation and a new evil has appeared in the form of Kylo Ren, a man who wishes to be better than Vadar!It was cool seeing Harrison Ford as Han again and some of the old favorites. Han is about the only one from the original films to make more than basically a cameo appearance though. The new characters are pretty good as Fin the former storm trooper was a bit interesting as was Rey, a mysterious girl who seems to harbor some force powers of her own. My favorite new addition though was Poe as he was very enthusiastic and I am hoping he has a more extended role in the next film. I liked Kylo Ren at first, but he deteriorated kind of badly as the film went along and I am kind of hoping they introduce another Sith lord in the next film, because Ren just did not seem quite competent enough to poise much of a threat without some backup. As I said, the film felt a bit weak during its final act and this character was one of the reasons I felt it weak. As for the new Deathstar, I thought it looked cool and I loved it when that one commanding officer ordered it fired and it took out three planets, but at the same time, one would think they'd stop making them with such obvious weak points! So overall, I thought it was a good film. I am not sure it really warrants all this undue hatred I have seen from various people, nor do I really seeing it being the most awesome film ever. It was a pretty good Star Wars film and to me it felt like a Star Wars film, had they put a bit more effort into the conclusion I would have probably given it a nine, but an eight to me is a good film. A lot of movies this year have gotten eights, as very few movies released lately have really pushed my buttons enough for a higher score with the exception of the latest Mad Max film which is my favorite film I saw in theaters in 2015. This one though capped the year off nicely as I did not see anything that I did not enjoy at the theater this year. If this film had disappointed me like the prequels this would have been the last Star Wars film I was going to see, but I will be seeing the next installment which would be the eighth. Still unsure if I want to watch the Rogue Squadron one.",8,16,48,29 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Very good end to a very good set of movies.
","This was probably my favorite trilogy of all time, as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me.  This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all.  This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one.  This one has epic battles and great visuals as well.  It is also very well acted.  Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one.  All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch.  I would write more, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can.",10,0,0,11 January 2004
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The best of the series, period!
","In fact it isn't even close.  This is about the only Nightmare I fully enjoy.  It is a creepy, highly atmospheric horror that delivers.  It centers on these teenagers that seem to be having the same dreams of this strange man.  This man in their dream menaces them and terrorizes them.  In fact, if he injures you in the dream you will have the injury when you awaken.  This movie had a very good story and a great killer in Freddy.  Unfortunately, in later episodes Freddy became a comedian and his overall creepiness disappeared.  This one, however, is great as there are some very memorable death scenes.",8,0,2,4 April 2003
The Truman Show," Alright, but just to hard to believe.
","This movie is kind of a take on reality TV. The show focuses on Jim Carrey's character Truman. The cameras follow him everywhere as he is actually living in this big TV studio. Everyone he thinks he knows are actors including his wife. Interesting enough, but I just have a hard time believing this show would have stayed on the air from this guy's birth to the point of being a grown man with a wife. No show lasts that long and this show would be rather dull one to watch. This one is at its best when it is more comedy oriented. Unfortunately, it is more of a drama and takes itself to seriously when it should be more fun to watch. Carrey does do a good job in the main role, but Ed Harris is just too bland for me. I can't believe he was nominated for an Oscar for this role...he just was not very good to me. I also don't think this TV show is realistic in that I would think it would be illegal to keep someone basically as a prisoner without their permission.All the faults aside though it is a rather good movie to watch, I just wish it were a bit funnier.",7,0,0,8 March 2003
The Matrix," A very good movie...but a bit overrated.
","I gave this movie a solid 8, but I definitely have seen plenty of movies that I have enjoyed more over the years.  What gets me is all the people who act like this movie is so original.  What is original about it?  It is basically a combination of the Terminator movies and any number of virtual reality movies that were released prior to this one including Johnny Mnemonic also starring Reeves.  Heck, it wasn't even the first movie to use bullet time as the movie Blade was the first time I had seen that done in a movie, granted on a much smaller scale.  Also, I think it was seen in a Korn music video as well before this movie ever came into being.  So this movie just borrows, for the most part, from a bunch of different movies and other entertainment.  Still it is good, though the parts that are the best take place in the matrix.  Some of the real world scenes are quite frankly boring.  The second time I watched this one I was basically thinking, 'Come on, capture Morpheus already so we can get to the good part of the flick'. The action at the end of this movie, more than makes up for the many dry spells in the flick.  Reeves and Fishburne are good as well, though I could have done without some of their talking scenes and their fight wasn't anything special either.  Like I said, I loved the movie when they were in the matrix and not as much when they weren't.  I hear the third installment will be entirely set in the real world too, so I don't have high hopes for it.  Carrie Ann Moss wasn't anything special in this either...if it wasn't for this movie who would ever of heard of her?  Let's face it, you could have put anyone in that role and they could have performed just as well are better.  She isn't very good looking either.  All in all it is worth checking out cause of the great action at the end, and because Hugo Weaving is great as the villain.",8,2,4,7 March 2003
Godzilla," Now that is Godzilla!
","As a child, one of my first loves was the old Showa Godzilla films of the 60's and 70's. Along with those old Japanese shows featuring dudes who raised their arms to the heavens and became robots to fight creatures or one with a family of rocket people that fought giant monsters. I loved the Godzilla films where Godzilla fought off the bad monsters and though I liked the ones where Godzilla, himself, was the bad guy I always enjoyed him more as the hero. The Hesei era Godzilla films would come along and reestablish the big G as a bad guy; however, as this series went along once again Godzilla would be more of the monster you pulled for as Space Godzilla and Destroyah would have to be dealt with. Then Millenia Godzilla series would be a mixed bag having one where Godzilla was the ultimate evil in 'Godzilla, Mothra and King Gidorah: All Out Monster Attack' and another where he is once again a good guy in 'Final Wars'. Though admittedly I did enjoy watching the evil version kick all three of those monsters butts; however, I did root for the humans to ultimately defeat Godzilla cause he was super evil. So I have to say I like Godzilla more as the hero and that is why I got super excited while others were a bit disappointed by the fact Godzilla was the good guy.The story has a mishap at a nuclear plant leading to the strange birth of a creature that is a threat to all mankind. Another beast is tracking this creature though and its name is Godzilla! The humans devise a plan to kill both these creatures as well as a female version of the strange creature that feeds on radiation as they wish to get rid of all three in one bang. A scientist who knows of Godzilla, though, tries to tell them that Godzilla may be the key to getting rid of the other two as it wants to hunt these other beasts and take them down!This Godzilla film did not really have all that big a budget, but they did rather well considering. I also understand why Godzilla was not in this film a whole lot, and it is because of the budget. This film is basically a test to see if Godzilla can succeed. However, all those complaining about the lack of Godzilla, I wonder if they watched all that many Godzilla films? A lot of the Japanese films feature a build up till the end where the fight takes place, so to me it is something very true to the Japanese films. Godzilla is territorial in the later Showa films, in Terror of Mecha Godzilla when Titanisaurus is ravaging the city, Godzilla is seen on the enemies' radar and they comment that Godzilla is coming to fight the other monster. It just felt like a Godzilla film, probably one of the Showa era, which is probably why it totally had me psyched! So this film was way better than 1998 film which was not a Godzilla film. That one should have been titled something else and I would have said it was an okay monster film, but they just had to call it a Godzilla film which is why I hated it. They did it right here as this Godzilla not only was not killed by missiles, he ignored them! I do hope a sequel is made as I would love to see another Godzilla film done in this world. They do need to bring back Wantanabe's character as he can be like Miki was in the Hesei era. Now that they have established Godzilla once again and if this one is considered a success I am sure a bigger budget will be used in the next film meaning more Godzilla and perhaps another Toho monster? Bring on King Gidorah I say!",9,4,11,25 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A fun sci-fi film.
","Unlike the recent two Star Wars this is a very fun and entertaining film.  I won't go into any more detail about how bad I think the newest two are so I will leave it at that. This film is very entertaining though Empire is by far my favorite (suprises me this is ranked ahead of Empire).  The only problem with this flick is that it doesn't really get going till they go to the bar where they meet Han.  Also, the light saber isn't used much in this one.  The only duel is between Obi-Wan and Vader and Obi-Wan throws the fight.  Other than that though it is a very solid movie.  The escape from the Death Star, the battle of the death star, and the likeable characters make this a movie worth experiencing.",9,0,0,4 June 2002
Deadpool," Deadpool arrives on the big screen! Again...
","Most fans would rather forget the character's first film appearance, but it was that appearance that did lead to this film. So while the character did not really get fleshed out all that much at the beginning of X-men Origins: Wolverine nor was he portrayed correctly at the end, the end result is one of the funniest movies I have seen at the theaters in many years. Truth be told though, I am not really big on comedies for the most part. Still, this film was a great spectacle to behold and it is nice seeing Ryan Reynold's film really take off. Not only because I always enjoy seeing him in films, but also because he made a comic book movie the right way, something Hollywood seems to scared to do. He made a comic book film where the character acts like he does in the comic, looks like he does in the comic and it has not been made for the general audience. No, we get Deadpool in all his crazed glory, doing what he does best...killing! When he is not killing, he is constantly breaking the fourth wall as Deadpool knows he is a comic book character and Reynold's portrays the crazed 'hero' with magnificent glee! The story, well that is simple. Deadpool wants to kill someone! Why? Well, through a series of flashbacks we learn of the way the merc with a mouth has become the way he is and a love that is lost to him. To not only fix his deformed face, but to also get revenge he must find a guy named Ajax, who is actually named Francis. Deadpool will get help in the form of the mighty Colossus and his teenage prot√©g√©. He also has allies in a man who runs a bar that deals with problems, a cab driver who does not seem to mind getting paid in high fives and a blind roommate who enjoys cocaine. Yes, all the typical things one tends to find in comic book movies...not! Did I mention boobs? Yep, they're in there too! So Deadpool must go find the ones who wronged him and do some slicing and dicing too! I am very happy with the film's success; unfortunately, I do believe that Hollywood will get the wrong idea by the results. They are going to just assume that making every comic book film with a slightly edgy character should contain gratuitous violence and nudity and all that when the real reason the film is doing well is the fact it was made for those of us who enjoy reading comics. Too often they soften up a character and completely change things to suit a wider audience, but this film proves that is not necessary. The characters have been portrayed a certain way and I find it insulting when those of us who read comics get dismissed and things added to other comic book films to attract say more female viewers. Seriously, did having Bruce Banner and the Black Widow have a thing really work? Never happened in the comics and this is just one example in one of the more recent comic book movies. Just look at Colossus in this movie. He finally has a Russian accent and he has a better fight scene here than he did in any of the X-men movies. This movie proves you can do things by the book and the film will do good, but the lesson they will learn is just to make everything R.So, I enjoyed this film immensely. Had it opened last year it would have trailed only Mad Max: Fury Road as my favorite film of 2015. My only problems with the film are the fact I thought they showed a bit too much back story in how he became who he was as the film did have a bit of a romantic subplot going itself. Still, in the end it was about shooting and killing and learning that if you are going to be killing and bleeding a lot to make your costume red. This film took awhile to finally get off the ground and I am glad Ryan Reynolds did not give up as he made a very funny comic book film on a rather small budget by today's standards.",9,11,29,21 February 2016
300," Just goes to show you, ya don't need 200 million to make a great epic movie...
","This movie did not cost a lot to make compared to other epic movies, yet it deserves its place among them. A grand epic adventure with loads of fighting and lots of blood. Yes, this film truly delivered the goods. Shot using blue screens and the like almost all the backgrounds and scenery is computer generated, this however does not detract from the film, but instead gives it a surreal quality. This movie is about how 300 spartan warriors stood against the massive Persian army and held their own. The story goes by quickly as this one is nearly pure fighting. The scenes without fighting are good as well as is the whole story, told back to us in narrative form. I was surprised how quickly though the Spartans set out for their battle. The battle itself was of epic proportion as you got to learn the advantages of troop formation and fighting as one and as comrades is a much better way to go about things than just charging and fighting more out of fear for one's life. You also get to see some of the best spear and shield fighting ever in a movie. The battle scenes are more graphic than those in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and emotional too, cause I was pulling for the Spartans all the way. Just something about their conviction you had to admire. All this and it was done on a rather minuscule budget, you also have to admire the director and producer as well. Though I just knew that one guy would be trouble for the troops.",10,1,8,28 March 2007
Cube," Starts promisingly ends weakly.
","I can see how people like this movie, but it just did not work for me. Granted I saw it on the Sci-fi channel so maybe all the commercial breaks had a hand to play in how I feel about this movie. I thought it started out with a bang, person in a strange room checks out his surrounds goes into another room and instantly gets shredded. Suffice to say I was compelled to watch after that. Then a group of strangers gets together in one of the rooms and begin to work together to find a way out and to figure out just what this strange labyrinth is designed by or who made it. It is good for about the first thirty to forty minutes as we see a variety of traps take out a member and other traps our crew must avoid. At the end though there is just to much in fighting for my tastes as one of the party gets a tad to paranoid. So the rest of the movie the traps are virtually ignored and we are left with people who have the key to getting out spending all their time literally trying to kill each other. So there ya, the paranoia and such takes center stage and the cool traps which caught my attention in the first place are gone. Still I can see how you need something else to bring to the table as you need more plot than just trap room, death, and this and that...I think this would have been better served as a forty five minute short rather than full length movie. However, as a lot of people out there seem to like this movie I say give it a shot.",5,3,6,2 May 2007
Apollo 13," Houston we have a problem, our movie is to long.
","I am one of those who was really happy when 'Brave Heart' beat this movie out for the Oscar in 1996. Nothing against this movie or Ron Howard, but that was a vastly superior movie to this film. Of course, I do not particularly like this one all that much either as I gave it a six, it has some good stuff in it, but it is also rather long and you feel the length of it. Not in the bathroom way of say a 'Lord of the Rings' movie where it is just super long so you are bound to feel the urge to go, but long in the 'man it is taking forever for this film to end'. The story chronicles a true event where a space mission had problems and the astronauts had to scrape their moon landing and just figure a way to get back home and it has some interesting moments. It also has way to much Tom Hanks for my tastes. He is not the only one in space yet he is the headline name so the other two astronauts are just not the focus which kind of sucks as I love both Bacon and Paxton, two underrated actors who usually do not get the bigger movies and when they do they are regulated to backup duties. For some reason Ed Harris got an Oscar nod for this film and his performance in this one is not as good as the one he had in the Sean Connery thriller 'Just Cause' which got him nominated for nothing. His performance here is oddly like another performance he would have three years later in 'The Truman Show' another film he mysteriously got an Oscar nod for. There is some nice space scenes though and at times you really worry about the guys in the dire situation they are in. So it is a watchable film, there is just to many times in this one that I was more worried about when it would end.",6,5,12,30 March 2010
Fantastic Four," Not fantastic, but a pretty good movie nonetheless.
","This movie was rather good and it was a bit light and not as serious as say 'Batman Begins'. Hey these are the Fantastic Four though and not the Dark Knight, their name suggests they are going to be a bit less serious. Could have been more action, but it had its comic moments that made up for the lack of action. All the Fantastic Four actors were great so now it is time for my number one major gripe of the film. Doctor Doom was portrayed completely wrong, I did not let it ruin the film for me, but I really did not think the actor was right and I also don't think it would have been all that hard to get his origin correct. He never had any powers in the comic book, he was simply a brilliant scientist and dabbler in magic who blamed Reed for an accident that left him permanently scarred. He created a powerful armor to combat the Fantastic Four and is one of the best Marvel villains there is even fighting the likes of Spider-man. Here he also comes into contact with the cosmic rays and the armor he built in the comic just starts to form on him. They make mention of his homeland, but I am not sure if he is the leader. To tell ya the truth I feel Arnold Schwarzenegger would have been the perfect Doom, but then I am not a movie maker so what do I know. Other than that for the most part I liked the movie. People have been complaining about the effects, but I thought they were pretty good, not top notch, but then this movie was not given an unlimited budget. Probably had something to do with the fact the Hulk underachieved, I doubt they were going to give this movie over a 150 million budget when the slightly more known Hulk didn't pull in all that much. Five or six years ago though, had this movie come out the effects would have been considered top notch, just not by todays standards. The Thing was great, it did look like rock, and all the others had their powers working good too. The fight with Doom could have been a bit longer, but this is an origin tale so they have to establish characters first. So in the end do not expect to be blown out of the water, but do expect a more basic summer popcorn flick.",8,0,4,9 July 2005
John Wick: Chapter 2," I think I would pass on the chance to take out John Wick...
","I did not see the first John Wick until well after it had come out. The trailer just did not do it justice and I was unable to discern what it was about as it almost seemed a sequel to something. However, I would get around to seeing it when quite a number of people told me it was a really good action/revenge film. So, this time around, I was not going to miss my chance to go see the film on the big screen and I am happy to report it is a very cool action film and almost as good as the first. Not quite, mind you, as I do think a lot of the emotional impact from the first is gone, but on the plus side here, you get to delve deeper into this world of crime bosses and assassins that was established in the first film. So as I said it is almost as good as the first, just not quite there. More characters are introduced and there are a number from the first film that make their return to this one as well. The action is frequent and often as you get thrust right into the chaos of Wick's world and through you get to see a number of shootouts, fist fights, knife fights and pencil fights! So yeah, you could say that John Wick is back! The story has John Wick picking up his car to finish up the business he had in the first film. Afterwards, he has officially retired and seems like he will be content living alone with his dog. Unfortunately, peace does not seem to be in his cards as a crime boss named Santino needs Wick to do a job for him. Wick wants to refuse; however, Santino did Wick a favor and now Wick owes him a marker. If he refuses he is dead, if kills Santino he is dead and if he runs he is dead. So he takes on the job after Santino destroys Wick's home to motivate him and Wick is on the job which is to kill Santino's sister! Things kick complicated and soon a lot of assassins are out to kill John Wick and there seems to be little he can do to get out of the predicament other than kill everyone! I like Keanu Reeves, I find him to be an enjoyable actor. I know a lot of people do not care for him, but I like his work. I, myself, cannot stomach Mark Wahlberg so each person has their own tastes. I like that they brought back Ian McShane as his character is very interesting and I like the whole world that they set up in these films. It almost seems like these characters are part of some established world, like a series of graphic novels or something they way that the two films have played out. There is definitely an opening for a third film and I hope it gets made as if it does not, we fans of the two films will really be kept hanging! So, yes, this film was very enjoyable. I think the first one had the more emotional impact as we got to see a terrible thing done to him and him returning to his deadly past, but this one kind of shows you how his job probably was before he decide to settle down and get married. Almost an equal trade off. The movie is definitely a sequel and feels like it is in the flow of the first film. There have been a few sequels in the past that have kind of felt off. A couple of examples I can think of off the top of my head is the two Ghost Rider films, though the second film did not feel off so much as it was like a completely different world all together and the two Thor films. This one had plenty of action and featured a lot of bloodshed. It did do some computer blood, which I wish they did not do as practical effects as far as blood goes looks a lot better. Did not look bad, but you can tell it was computer generated. Overall, though, my complaints are few and far between while my praise is early and often. I also know that if I was an assassin in this world and I saw John Wick as the hit, I would text back, 'No amount of money is enough!'",9,12,24,13 February 2017
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Somewhat interesting vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a bit boring.
","This movie has its highs and lows in it, for the most part the first half was good and the second half was rather dull.  Ironically, Rice hated the fact Cruise was picked for Lestat, but he did the best job in this picture as far as I could see.  Once he exited the movie the energy level went down and I couldn't wait for it to end.  The main problem is Pitt, who pardon the phrase, was as stiff as a corpse.  Through the entire movie he just seemed bored.  Once Cruise left we are stuck with him and then they introduce a very bland Banderos who also offers very little.  Dunst does rather good as the girl vampire and Slater is also good, though he is not in this one very much.  What to say about the plot, there sort of is none.  It is mainly Pitt telling a reporter about his early days as a vampire, nothing to horrific is really featured in this one.  Just a bunch of people in those old time clothes.  Though it was somewhat good still, mainly because of the Cruise scenes which were funny in a demented sort of way.",6,1,4,19 February 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," One of the best comedies ever.
","I love this movie, because no matter how many times I see it, it is still funny.  One of the many reasons it works is the low budget and the fact that they don't try to hide the fact it is low budget.  Also, the very serious music this movie has makes it funny because they are acting like it is a serious movie and then again they are not.  Plot summary is simple.  King Arthur must find and retrieve the holy grail and while doing so runs into one hilarious encounter after another.  The members of Monty Python did a wonderful job on this movie and they play multiple parts in it.  I don't want to give anything away so just trust me and watch this film, and I bet you will be laughing!",10,2,3,7 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Still the most visually stunning entry in the Star Wars series.
","This for me is the best Star Wars movie...I even like it more than the first one.  Even today I find it visually stunning and it looks a lot better than anything in the most recent two Star Wars films.  The plot is a bit darker as this film in the series seemed to be more aimed at adults, but kids could enjoy it too.  It is a shame that the one scene in this film that is the most memorable will be kind of wiped out thanks to the new trilogy.  You know the one with Luke facing Vader and Vader makes the startling revelation.  Anyone who watches these movies in the so-called correct order is not going to be very surprised.  Though if they do watch it in order they may never get to this classic cause they will probably stop after the Clone Wars cause lets face it the new triology just isn't very good.  Watch the original trilogy and forget the new...I just wish these were availble on dvd.",10,0,1,6 February 2003
Spectre," It was good, but thought it should have been better with the Spectre organization in it
","This was my most anticipated film of the year as I have really enjoyed Daniel Craig's turn as Bond and this film was going to feature the return of the villainous Spectre organization. I had been wanting them to come back since Quantum of Solace kind of hinted they were lurking in the shadows. So it is with a bit of regret that the film was underwhelming. Had the villains in the piece not been referred to as the organization that plagued Bond's first six out of seven films and produced so many cool villains, I may not of had the problems with the film I did. However, I just thought this film should have been a super awesome thrill ride that did not let up until the credits began to roll. It does not do this, not even close. Still, it was a good film and it seemed to mark Daniel Craig's last turn as Bond which would be kind of sad seeing as how it is set up so nicely now with Ralph Fiennes as M, a Q and a Moneypenny in place. I would hate for them to start over again, but I am afraid that is exactly what they will do as they introduce yet another actor to play the role.The story has Bond trying to kill a dangerous man, but he is not under orders from the current M, rather he has received a message from an old friend telling him to not only kill this individual, but to attend his funeral. 007 is placed on what is essentially suspension; however, with the help of Moneypenny and Q he is able to attend the funeral and uncover a ruthless organization known as Spectre. Now Bond must uncover this group's secrets before they grip the world in their hands! It had potential and I liked how they tied the films together for the most part, but I just thought the film should have been bigger considering the Spectre organization being in it and Blofeld. By bigger, I do not mean the running time, it was plenty long enough! There was just too much bloat in this one and the action seemed to get weaker as the film progressed rather than more exciting. Blofeld was okay, but I hate that they felt the need to tie him to Bond in some significant way as it is almost an absurd relationship they share. I liked Batista as the henchman, but I would have liked to have seen more henchmen like this. Most of the group was indistinct, while Batista's character stood out, perhaps a super martial arts master and a super shot villain could have been added? At times the organization looked intimidating and the film ready to take off, then they are easily taken down and the headquarters destroyed and one computer nerd is able to disable their entire plan while Blofeld's army seems reduced to like five people and a helicopter. It reminded me how Silva looked like he had an incredible group of people behind him, then in the last part of the film he seemed significantly less imposing.As much as I am complaining, I did enjoy the film. Craig is a rather good Bond and I liked the story all right and the action was pretty good even though it seemed to weaken as the film progressed. I think they should have done a couple of things differently in this one to make Craig's last turn as Bond more spectacular, but Connery's last film, Diamonds are Forever, I find to be his weakest and Moore's was not his strongest either in A View to a Kill. Both were good, just not that particular stars best Bond. This one was good too, just not Craig's strongest Bond film. Also, congratulations go to Madonna as she no longer holds the title of worst Bond opening song ever anymore. That Sam Smith tune was horrid and also congrats on weirdest credit sequence ever, if they had shown much more of the octopus and the woman the film could have been a hard R!",8,11,21,16 November 2015
Braveheart," FREEDOM!!!...and more blue paint while your at it.
","I do not usually enjoy historically accurate period piece movies, but this one really worked for me. Probably had something to do with the fact it was rather violent and had good action scenes. Still, I even liked the parts of the movie that had little action as the ending to this one was rather emotionally powerful. How Mel Gibson did not win an academy award for acting is beyond me as he did just as good a job or even better (in fact I say better) than Russell Crowe would do in the movie 'Gladiator'. Still, he got best director and best picture during the days when he was not crazy (or the days when he hid it better). This film tells the tale of Wallace a man who tried to break Scotland free of English rule back in the days. Why did he begin this crusade, well this is established in a early scene where Wallace's new wife is killed by the British guy in charge of the area. Well William Wallace quickly gets his revenge and soon begins his quest of trying to liberate Scotland from the Brits. You have a couple of rather good action scenes that involve the standard arrow attacks and the charge of two factions. Very well done and there is a bit of humor to this one as well. The movie though is not all action as we get to learn of things about the king who rules England and his son who is married to a very beautiful lady, but for some reason he does not seem to care for her much 'wink'. The final scenes of William Wallace are very emotionally charged and powerful and despite a somewhat sad fate for the main character, the film ends with one final charge. In the end a grand movie that I am always surprised did not make more money than it did as it did not even break the 100 million dollar barrier despite being a very good film.",9,2,8,26 February 2010
True Romance," The movie is kind of all over the place, but it somehow works!
","This film is about a guy who falls in love with a hooker and marries her. What a lovely story, taking this poor miscreant off the streets and showing her that he is willing to take care of her. Of course, you know everything is going to go without a hitch. Not really, from a crazed white pimp who thinks he is black to mob types to undercover cops this couple is going to have a really hard time getting to the honeymoon. The film has lots of violence, some sex, and inexplicably Bronson Pinchot who at the time was still most known as the lovable Balki from the television show 'Perfect Strangers'. Well here he plays a guy who gets caught by the cops with some white powder on his nose and it is not from a doughnut. The film's best sequence to me though was the Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper one. Great scene, I love how Hopper's character basically realizes what is going to happen to him so he does his best to insult Walken's character as a parting shot. Just wish both of them were in the movie a bit more, especially Walken who disappears from the film after this scene. I could have done without the Elvis ghost scenes, but aside from that I have a rather positive image of this movie despite the fact it is not something I typically care for.",8,2,2,8 November 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max returns to theaters after long hiatus in furious fashion!
","After viewing Avengers Age Of Ultron a couple of weeks ago and now this one, I have to give this film the edge as far as enjoyment goes. 'Wow' is just one of the words I would like to use when describing Max's return to the big screen...a return that was long overdue and it was very nice finally seeing a Mad Max film in the theater. The film put forth here is one of intensity and nearly nonstop action, a film that does not have its characters stopping in a random place so that we can see some back story that really is not relevant to the plot, no flashback scenes so the director can tell you why the characters are the way they are...no, here we have simple action and the characters' actions telling you what they are about. It would be nice to see other Mad Max films in the future and it is possible as Tom Hardy did sign on to do three films. More than likely if they did get made, Max would once again find himself in the middle of a dispute that he really wants no part of, but begins to feel the need to help.This film starts out with Max getting captured in record time as he is taken to a place called the Citadel which has water and greenery in abundance, but said greenery is controlled by a man named Immortal Joe. A woman who apparently drives for him, named Furiosa begins her next mission, but she is about to break ranks with Immortal Joe and Max will soon try to help her and her cargo escape the demented mad man and his crew of crazies in an attempt to find a place away from the madness.It was great seeing Mad Max again as Miller made sure a lot of the staples from previous films were included as well as some odes to the previous films. It was nice seeing the sawed off shotgun, the pursuit vehicles and the nitro. Makes me wish they'd let Miller direct one of the many comic book adaptations as he proves you can create a film that is nearly all action without it looking like a cut scene from a video game. Tom Hardy does admiral filling in for Gibson, had they made this film when Miller had originally envisioned Gibson would have been in the lead role once again, but Hardy looked the part and it did feel like he was Max. It was also neat seeing that Miller got the actor who originally played the Toecutter from the first film to be the main villain here, though he is most definitely a different character.So yes, really good action films with very little talking can be enjoyable to watch. Why wouldn't they be? I've never understood at times why they always feel the need to make action movies and such accessible to everyone. It is not as if they add gun fights and car chases to a musical to make it more enjoyable for a male, so why they always seem to do this for people who do not like action films seems a bit silly. Granted, you may lose some of the American audiences money, but a film like this is going to thrive in the foreign market. I at least hope it does, because I would enjoy seeing Mad Max on the big screen again; however, if I do not I will at least be satisfied with seeing this one as it was an incredibly intense action film rarely seen these days.",10,7,19,17 May 2015
The Breakfast Club," For a movie that has like one location it is really good.
","I actually enjoyed this movie though it is definitely a movie I would usually not care all that much for. Most of the time movies about people in high school or have such a limited amount of locations are not my thing. I like a movie that goes all over the place as a movie for me is an escape and the more locations the more locales I escape to. This film takes place in a library at a high school and focuses on five teens who are stuck with detention on a Saturday. Four of the five are not used to this type of situation, but one is quite used to it. I don't know, for some reason it works, it is by far the only Brat Pack movie that I really enjoy and I think it works for a lot of reasons. The humor is pretty good, the serious situations are realistic and the movie does a nice job of turning this five virtual strangers into friends. Granted, I still hate the fact the one person ended up with no gal at the end, but it is only a minor complaint to be sure. The cast does a very good job with their roles as they have to for this movie to be a success because it is sort of a character study. They only leave from the library briefly, so yes the movie does for the most part takes place entirely in that place so that scenery can be a bit boring. The guy playing the principal does a rather good job here too and like I said a lot of funny exchanges occur between him and the more delinquent student played wonderfully by Judd Nelson. I also really enjoy Ally Sheedy's performance as the shy, kind of weird girl. Molly Ringwald can do the character she played in her sleep and Emilio is rather good as the football player. Anthony Michael Hall plays the nerd and rounds out the cast very nicely. Good movie if not really heavy on the locations, heck it could be a stage play.",8,1,2,4 October 2010
Gladiator," Rather good action adventure, not sure if it was really an Oscar caliber film.
","This film was released in the summer of 2000 and was a bit more of a film than your typical summer blockbuster. However, I am a bit surprised it won the Oscar award that year mainly because as it is not in its entirety your typical summer blockbuster it has most of the elements of one. It has a lot of action and a lot of blood, granted there is some story to it that makes it a step above mindless summer popcorn film. The movie was also a hit with an R rating which is why I will never understand why they weaken so many films these days, bringing them down to PG-13 thinking this is going to bring them more money. This one proves that you can make a ton of cash with an R rating. This along with other R films like '300', the entire Matrix trilogy, 'Hannibal' (hell this one wasn't even a good movie', and a host of others yet they still insist on making most movies PG-13. Well enough of that rant, on to this film. Its story is fairly good involving the leader of an army who is basically retiring after the death of the emperor. Well his son for some reason tries to have him killed and does succeed in killing the soldier's family. Well the soldier ends up being sold and becomes a gladiator who amazes the crowd with his awesome brutality. Well he ends up competing in the coliseum where the man who had his family murder watches. So in the end a nice bloody film and one of the few best picture winners I have ever seen at the theater. I think the only other Oscar winners I have seen at the theater are 'Titanic' and 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King'. This one is good, I do not know if it really merited an Oscar, but I am not going to say something else deserved it that year either as I remember it being a rather weak year for movies.",8,1,3,14 February 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," May as well be an army versus robots film
","When this film came out in 2011 I fully intended to go to the theater and watch it, but I never got around to it. Flash years later and I found it for cheap with the fourth Transformers film so I thought I would get it as I had seen neither film. I really enjoyed the first film and I thought the second film had its moments. A lot of people had told me that this one was a better film than the second one so imagine my surprise as I found it worse...a lot worse! I literally have to scratch my head as the first film had such potential and had the makings of an awesome franchise. The second one was not great as it was too long, but the action was cool and I liked how Optimus Prime was the one to take out the bad guys instead of Shia's character Sam. This one though just was bad. When I watch a film based on Transformers I expect a film where the Autobots must do battle with the dastardly Decepticons. I do not watch it to see an advertisement for the military and see Sam get another really hot chick on the heels of the last one. I also do not watch this film to see humans perform stunts while showing the minimum amount of robot fighting it can show. It is almost as if they have a limit of a few seconds before they have to flash to more human action! The story, well it is rather a incomprehensible mess. We see that the moon landing back in the day was actually a way to examine a mysterious ship crashing onto our planet. Flash years later and we get to see Sam's latest girl's butt. We also get to see a man who has no business with her whining about not having a job and not feeling important because he saved the world so he deserves more. The humor is worse than the second film and the scenes of him interviewing are not fit for an action film. Once again, I want to see robots, not filler garbage. The film ran 2 hours and 20 minutes and they want to show a bunch of nonsensical crap. It adds nothing to the plot and is just a way to have humans relevant in a story they should not be relevant in. Meanwhile, the Autobots are doing missions for us and keeping a lookout for the Decepticons and there is something that ties in with that moon landing that may turn out to be a deadly secret and there is a boss who has nice cars and John Malkovich in a very bizarre role that makes as much sense as the rest of the film and an even more awkward scene with Sam and some guy in a bathroom stall. We get a battle at the end with the Autobots against some very nondescript Decepticons which makes me wonder if they even try. The only Decepticon that stood out was Shockwave who was sadly underused as he actually looked cool and Megatron was almost not relevant.So the Transformer films seem to get progressively worse as they continue. I am finding part of the problem is that Bay wants to focus too much on the humans. Shia was insufferable in this one and I wanted to see him less not more. I did not want to see a guy who I could beat down in a fight in less than two minutes taking down a Transformer. The guy and his gal survive some stuff in this one that makes the old Indiana Jones action scenes seem less ridiculous. I also cannot stand the way the Transformers keep getting less distinct as the series goes on. I didn't even recognize Megatron at first glance and why is it so difficult to give him his trademark bazooka gun? Why do they keep using swords and stuff? Never did that much in the comics or cartoon. Why can't Optimus have his awesome gun and have it sound the same way it did in the cartoons? So this one just was not enjoyable for me at all. I did not want to see humans versus robots, but rather Autobots versus Decepticons. That last portion in Chicago was just one long bore as you get to watch people paragliding, people in collapsing building and then you see Optimus and think, 'Oh boy, now the action begins!' and he promptly gets caught in wires. Just does not make any sense, nor does the series. Lets have little cute annoying robots because the film is enjoyed by kids, but the first time we see Shia he you get to see his girlfriend's butt. I honestly do not see how this one did so well at the box office, it was just a mess with a overly complicated story to get humans more involved. In the cartoon, the Decepticons wanted energy from Earth and the Autobots tried to stop them, that's it! Oh, and during their movie they had a huge planet that transformed! Heaven forbid they do that. Speaking of that 1986 film, it was a way to introduce kids to a new line of toys, so I find it sad that it had a better story and better action than this film! Going to watch the fourth film as I got it as part of the set, but I do not have high hopes for it; however, at least Shia will not be in it.",4,1,4,26 June 2017
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Very good third installment
","This one was a lot better to me than the Temple of Doom.  What made this one fun to watch was great action and great interplay between Connery and Harrison Ford.  Sean Connery really added a spark to this one and provided the film with some of its more humorous elements (Still like Raiders best though).  This one has Indiana looking for the Holy Grail...the villains, once again it is the Nazis.  This one starts out with kind of an earlier Jones adventure with the late River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones taking an artifact from this tomb raiders cause as Indy says, 'it belongs in a museum'.  Then the story flash forwards to him trying to recover the same artifact.  Then he goes after the Holy Grail because his father has disappeared while looking for it.  This leads Indy to Venice then to a castle in, I think, Austria where he finds his dad a prisoner of the Nazis. After they get away they have to go into the heart of Germany to retrieve a book that will help them get through traps that protect the Holy Grail. They take a zephyr and there is a cool bi-plane fight and then it is off to a Middle Eastern country to find the grail.  The trap scenes are cool and there is a great tank scene before the traps.  Then comes the only complaint I have and that is the chamber with the Holy Grail...the guy guarding it was a bit lame.  Other than that though, this was a really great movie.",9,1,2,3 March 2003
Back to the Future," Good time traveling comedy.
","I like this movie okay. It was not something that I would really want to have in my DVD collection as I am more into horror than comedy, but this movie was entertaining. This is mainly due to Christopher Lloyd than anything else, the man brings real energy to his role. Michael J. Fox was good to in the lead role, one has to wonder if 'Family Ties' held him back a little as he had some rather successful movies during the 80's and could have done more without the television commitment. This one is about time travel, time travel to the past. The next film would feature time travel to the future and the past. That one is a film I can not watch, it is just to hard to for me. It also has not aged well as the future they paint is a future of the 80's, as fashion is never going to be like that I am afraid. This one though has a guy use the professor's time machine and ending back in the past where he kind of interrupts the first meeting of his mother and father. This in turn makes it so he may no longer exist shortly. Thankfully, the professor is around and so he has to work on getting the time machine, which is a car, in working order and Fox has to work on getting his parents back on the right track. Like I said, this one works, as you can recreate a time that is past, the second one doesn't because you can not see what the future is going to be like. The third one though was okay.",7,1,2,30 October 2010
The Birds," A good nature goes berserk movie.
","This is like the only Alfred Hitchcock movie I have seen, and it is a rather good nature strikes back type of movie. That is the best way to describe this movie as you never really find out why or anything to that effect in this movie, which kind of adds to the charm of it. In another director's hands this movie would probably be rather silly, let's face it, birds on the attack does not sound particularly frightening, but it is here. Also, it is rather bloody for an early 1960's motion picture, it is certainly not toned down or anything. The story is simple enough, a lady is visiting an island or something and while boating on over she is attacked by a bird. This seems only minor at first, but it ends up being the start of something very big and nasty as soon all the birds in the area start to go on the attack. The attack on the school and the attack on the street near the diner being two of the more memorable attacks. The end it gets more into the type of movie where survivors board themselves in a house while the animal that is on the attack tries to get in and at this point the movie weakens a bit. The film is still somewhat good just not like it was in earlier attack scenes. The effects are reasonably good for the time and convincing enough to pass the test. There would be a sequel made years later, but I pretty much figure that one is going to be horrible.",7,1,2,9 July 2009
Jurassic Park," It was alright.
","This movie for me was kind of overrated.  I liked it ok, but it is really nothing special.  Most of the movie is people looking off into the distance in wonder and amazement and it is a bit slow moving.  I actually like part three the best in the series and two the least...this one is just an ok flick to me.  Jeff Goldblum is good in this one as is Sam Neil.  Neil would be good in the third, but Goldblum sucked in the second.  The kids as some have mentioned are kind of annoying, but you learn to put up with it. Samuel L. Jackson is wasted in this movie, but this was before he was really a big name.  Most of the movie is just people touring the park...then something goes wrong and the movie really gets going and is more enjoyable. Though only one character in the movie is killed in a really cool way.",6,2,8,28 February 2003
Beetlejuice," A rather unique and funny look at the afterlife...
","This movie is a rather differing look on what the afterlife might be like, and I have to say it isn't pretty. Our couple drowns and struggles to adjust to being dead, however, they seem to refuse to read the book that explains just how to go about it. If being dead were not bad enough, they have some new home owners moving into the house where they must spend the first years of their afterlife and they are not a very good match with our deceased couple. What are they to do...well there seems to be a solution, a ghost named Beetle Juice who advertises himself as a type of reverse exorcist. This of course sets up some really funny scenes. This movie I do believe is effective because its somewhat limited use of the funniest character, Beetle Juice...this just makes his scenes even more funny and over the top. Not that it is bad when he is not in it, it still has some funny stuff such as the dinner scene and the waiting room scene. Still, when Beetle Juice is in it, the comedy ramps up a couple of notches. All the cast do a rather good job, of course Keaton kind of steals the show. This movie is kind of dark, however it works as Tim Burton always can create a good dark atmosphere so if you want to see a rather humorous take on the afterlife this is the movie for you.",8,1,2,21 March 2007
The Wizard of Oz," My guess is that this is not what the writer of the book envisioned.
","The film has a certain charm about it and considering the time period it was made in it was a very well made film. However, I am betting the writer was not envisioning a musical with people dressed in what looks like Halloween costumes. Once again for the time I am sure they did the best they could, but looking back on it the characters of the Scarecrow, Tin man, and the Lion just are not that impressive, granted they are great for a child to see as that sequel that Disney put out years later had some freaky stuff that spooked me as a kid. That would be more my style now so that is why I am commenting about it, I am not really wanting to disparage this film it is just that my tastes have changed and this is not going to be a movie I can really sit through now. However, I remember it fondly from my childhood so I give it a seven which is a rather good mark to me. The witch was excellent, I do not know who played that part, but she convinced me that she was the bad witch. And while I normally do not care for musicals, the songs in this film were nice and catchy and did not detract from the film as the song sequences in other films tend to do for me. The cast is good, though I do not think Judy Garland should have been Dorthy. She seems to old for the part and at times it seems a bit strange when she is talking as she is talking like a twelve year old and she looks like she could be in her twenties. She has a nice singing voice though so that makes up for it a bit. All in all a good film, I would suggest a remake that had more edge to it, but I figure they would screw it up royally. I do want to try and find that 'Return to Oz' movie though as I hear it was rather dark and at times had very frightening imagery.",7,0,4,1 February 2010
Dodgeball," Review writing...now on espn 9.
","This was a funny comedy once again featuring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn...the other being Starsky and Hutch released the same year.  This one though basically has their roles reversed as Vaughn plays an every man gym owner and Stiller plays a fitness and appearence obsessed gym owner. Stiller's character wants Vaughns gym and Vaughn needs money so this is where dodgeball comes in.  This movie is also kind of a spoof of those old 80's comedy where in the end it comes down to a tournament or race to save the day.  Lots of goofball antics ensue, with a lot of hits to the crotch, but hey it works here.  Dodgeball was always a bit of a cruel game so might as well show how it is.  Vaughn is great as are the rest of his team of misfits, and Stiller is kind of bizarre in his role, but it works.  Lots of strange cameos in this one as well, and what was up with the pirate?  Still though this movie made me laugh and was a lot better than other comedies I have seen, though I liked Starsky and Hutch a bit better.",8,0,1,21 June 2004
Evil Dead II," The second flick in this series a gory good time.
","I did not remember this movie being as funny the first time I saw it, but then I was just a kid. Now years later with my sense of humor effectively warped I had quite a few chuckles. This is of course a sequel to 'The Evil Dead', but then it is not quite a direct sequel. The first part of the film sort of recaps the first, but then it doesn't. You will notice only Ash and his girlfriend are shown at the cabin. The cabin is significantly better looking on the inside and there are various other differences as well. Still, this does not detract from this film as I like this one better than the first. Campbell as Ash is great, the first part of the film is like a one man show of someone doing a self torture stand-up. You get to watch a man have his hand possessed and proceed to beat the crap out of himself. And the scenes of Ash laughing along with the rest of the cabin is like a demented episode of Pee-Wee's playhouse. Soon though others arrive, of course they are just fodder for the evil dead to possess and kill. The effects are good for the most part, and where they are not so good it is usually done in humorous manner. The chainsaw arm is cool, and it is a nice ending as well considering the third part. I kind of wish Sam Rami and Bruce would make more horror movies as they are very good at it.",9,3,4,6 October 2007
