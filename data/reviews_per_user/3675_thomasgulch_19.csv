The Devil's Advocate," entertaining fluff
","Al Pacino plays John Milton. John Milton was the author of 'Paradise Lost', and in this movie Milton is the devil. Isn't that clever? After what seemed like an eternity, we come to realize that the devil is a bad guy, and that people who sell their souls to him are also bad guys. The end of the movie is an absurdity, with the redoubtable Mr.Reeves committing the one unforgivable sin to save mankind from domination by the beast, or in this case, by an extremely confused fallen angel. Why does satan chant in latin as he presides over the impending culmination of his devious plan? Is Latin a native language in the netherworld? Lomax's bible-thumping mother had intimate relations with the devil in her youth, because he was a real 'good listener'? You can only tell if beings are demons by looking at them in mirrors? The devil goes to church, sticks his finger in Holy Water and someone dies? Mary Ann Lomax, who seems to wallow in psychosis given theopportunity, spends an afternoon engaging in the sports of Venus with The Big D as he bilocates? One heart felt suggestion - keep all small spoons away from directors and writers in Hollywood.",Null,0,1,11 August 2002
Marie Antoinette," worst soundtrack in modern history
","Strong visuals, good acting luscious scenery and with out a doubt the absolute worst soundtrack in the history of modern days movies. The snippets of modern 'rock'(?) set against these beautiful French vistas set up such a cognitive dissonance, it literally astounded me. The music has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, scenery or events. I thought they might play something by the cure during the royal downfall. I guess a father's indulgence shows no boundaries - poor Francis ford. I have to assume that in Lost in Translation - Bill Murray and Scarlett are such good actors they improvised their way to comprehensibility. If they had a rational person do the soundtrack over again, the movie would be passable.",1,1,6,25 February 2007
Minority Report," good show
","I come to this as a huge Phil K. Dick fan. This movie is based on Dick's story but is really fleshed out by the screenwriters and Mr.Spielberg. It seems the last couple of decades have been a bonanza for the estate of P.K.Dick -Blade Runner, Screamers, Total Recall, The Minority Report and from what I've read there are a few more stories being made into flicks. All of these movies seemed way more optimistic then the Dick's stories, read Do Androids dream of Electric Sleep and compare it to Blade Runner. The movie by Spielberg et al, is excellent - the attention to detail, speculation about the not too distant future, the plot, the ambience are all wonderful. Two thumbs and two toes up for this one.",Null,0,0,25 June 2002
The Big Lebowski," Amazing
","I like this the best of ALL the Coen Brother films, and although having seen almost every film Steve Buscemi has been in, I never have appreciated him as much as now, after having seen him in this film. Steve is absolutely, stunningly wonderful! And of course, John Goodman is, once again, one of our ten best actors. The most suprising element of this film is how good Jeff Bridges is in this. Why this movie did not get the critical acclamation that Barton Fink and Fargo got, escapes me completely. I truly enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. Most poignant for me was the archetypical hypocrisy of the 'can do' right wing doppelganger of 'the dude', which is seemingly self-evident to the general public or it wouldn't have been characterised with such nonchalance. This film brings us back to the mindset and humour of another Coen classic, 'Raising Arizona'. Great stuff.",10,0,1,28 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Magnificent
","To be brief, this is the best movie I have seen in the last 50 years. Absolutely nothing on film, (with the exception of Citizen Kane), even comes close to this masterpiece. There are scenes of such incredible, awesome beauty, that at times I was almost emotionally overwrought. It is VERY rare that you realize while you are watching a movie that you are seeing a cultural classic that will be with us for generations. If you have not seen this movie, leave the keyboard, get in your car and go see it.",10,1,1,21 March 2002
28 Weeks Later," this movie will scare the livin' willies out of you
","maybe spoilers: If you have seen the original 28 days later, you will better be equipped to understand and appreciate this film. If 28 days was scary, it was like a teddy bear compared to this movie. This movie starts out ruthlessly and things just get really, really worse from there. It seems that the inception of the virus is within seconds and immediately forces the person who is infected to expectorate to reinfect. The beginning of this movie graphically depicts this within the movies' first ten minutes. The ending is brutally depressing, but I won't mention it even in a spoiler, it's that good to see. If you want to be scared silly and you enjoyed the first movie, this movie is the bomb.",9,1,4,2 August 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," if you liked T2 you'll love T3
","This movie was virtually the same movie as T2 with different actors with the exception of Arnold. What a wasted opportunity to explore the world AFTER the rise of the machines, but what the heck, kids will spend another ten bucks to see the fourth sequel. I doubt arnold will be in sequel 4 unless nanosurgery is perfected by then. This movie is not bad, not good. Outside of the obvious fact of wanting to milk more money out of the series, what puzzles me is why they bothered to do a remake of T2.",3,0,0,10 July 2003
"I, Robot"," When will they learn?
","I know it is currently mandatory in Hollywood to insert African-Americans into roles that were written as being a race other then African-American, but when will these Hollywood idiots let up? Why not the Biography of Martin Luther King starring Mel Gibson? I try to approach these movies with hope, because I read the stories and the books by asimov, stanislav lem et al, and why the Hollywood producers insist on changing the character so drastically, it is beyond me. Is it simply a move of greed to get more African-Americans watching this crap? (Which I doubt they do, being intelligent enough to know they are being pandered to.) Will Smith is just not cut out for serious dramatic entertainment. I thought these nitwits had gotten the message with that still-life 'Wild, Wild West' which died after about two hours in the theaters, but no. Will Smith is a good comedian, why not star him in comedy movies? But then again, I have the full multi-million dollar release of 'Bewitched' to look forward to. Oh well,reading is more enjoyable....... I know that any observations along these lines will probably incur the wrath of the PC police, but really who cares?",2,4,7,5 August 2004
Dark City," magnificent
","I have watched this film at least 30 times. The plot isn't that unique, the dialog is passable - but, my god!, what a visual and ambient treat. I am not completely sure what it is about this film that makes it so addicting. The love and care that want into the cinematography, the sets, the lighting, the physicality of the actors, is simply astounding. Richard o'brien, Mr.Hand, turns in such a wonderfully sinister performance, that I have long ceased caring about this movies relation to anything other then a waking dream. Well done!!",9,0,1,31 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Superb
","In order to make a watchable movie that is under 35 hours long, tie it together thematically, and remain faithful to the overall plot, is no easy task. Many American and some European film-goers believe Jackson should have done a word for word movie, but then again it's hard to have some studio fund one movie that would require cots. Many American film-goers (mainly American teens), are angry there were no heavy rock bands or rap in the movie, no Tarrantino type mindless gore and violence and no explicit sex. Many are angry that this, God Forbid, was a movie with European characters and that Will Smith didn't play Frodo, and it was not a movie about an invalid or a concentration camp (which seem to make up all of the Academy Award movie winners for the last ten years). In short, in modern America, we want the kind of garbage you can see in still-born crap like the newest matrix - guns blasting every five seconds, multi-cultural raves, mystical mumbo-jumbo and a movie filmed in a variety of shades of green. If, on the other hand, you read the Lord of the Rings, loved it and understand a one-to-one translation to the screen is impossible, you will love the Two Towers. I guess that is what is making alot of reviewers really angry - the Two Towers has gotten a very high score on IMDB. There's a great reason -the movie is excellent.",10,1,1,13 November 2003
Children of Men," The hype is overwhelming - may contain spoilers
","After hearing all of the hype for this movie and seeing the score on IMDb, I decided to see the film, twice. The first time I saw this I figured I must have missed something, so I saw it again and still cannot fathom why this film is getting so much hype. It would be an OK made for TV movie, but not much else. The politics of this film are sophomoric and self-contradictory. A ship called 'hope' picks up quite possibly the worlds'only black Indonesian who has just had a baby, while seated in a small boat next to a lighted buoy in the fog? What next? I am surprised he didn't include the wizard of Oz - oh wait a minute, that's Jasper, isn't it. She is searching for a never explained Utopian group called the human project? Illegal immigrants, quite possibly responsible for most of the fascist state's brutal control of the general population, are the sympathy object of the movie? No country on earth could ever accommodate an infinite influx of illegal immigrants and survive. Terrorists are the Heros? Take 12 monkeys and 28 days, smash them together, throw in sympathy for millions of illegal immigrants swarming England and you have children of men. Except of course, that 28 days and 12 monkeys were much, much better. If you want to see a work of genius about a future terrorist state watch Gilliam's 'Brazil'",4,3,6,16 January 2007
Event Horizon," embarrassing
","From the commercials, this movie looked like it might have potential. Then I went to see it. Wow. Try using a plot formula that has been done about five hundred times already in B horror movies. Put it in space, because the kids are really starting to like science fiction. Get some decent actors who need work to pay the bills. Use really unique horror devices, like phantom kids running around on a space ship, (Is the lead female character so blatantly stupid that she can't remember she's on a spaceship and she didn't bring along the kids?), Sam Neil in one scene holding his eyeballs in his hands and in a later scene they're back in his head.(Must have a really spiffy demon surgeon onboard.) This movie, to put it bluntly, just stunk, should never have been made and I should have been paid to watch this crap.",1,13,27,18 August 2001
Mulholland Drive," stream of gibberish
","Now you can appreciate why eccentric directors with large budgets and cryptic films should avoid drugs. This movie illustrates the time honored adage -if you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bull. If we make it cryptic and random enough, it must mean something, right? Do your dreams mean anything or is your mind flushing out garbage to maintain rationality?",Null,0,1,7 September 2003
Pulp Fiction," absolute garbage
","Let's see - drugs, murder, beatings, more drugs and beatings, a tad of porno thrown in, and more drugs and violence. This celluloid travesty should have gone straight into the dumpster where such inane, mindless trash belongs.",1,18,48,30 May 2002
Pulp Fiction," idiotic - garbage passing for art
","Only in the U.S.A., could this crime porno be received with such moronic glee. If you love to swim in murder, drugs and filth, which a lot of people do, this piece of excrement is for you. It is juvenile on all levels and will most likely appeal to those who still have some of that teenage mindless angst in them. You would be better off throwing your money in a sewer, a sewer would have more integrity then this crap.",1,12,40,28 April 2002
War of the Worlds," moronic
","If the aliens planted the devices underground, they would have to have done so before the cities were built. Since history shows no evidence of any reports of this, they would have to been planted before any men were there to see and/or understand this, This places the insertion of the devices to many thousand of years ago. If they came to earth to use the planet and harvest it's natural resources, why would they not do it when they crossed interstellar space to plant the devices? So Spielberg has them travel across interstellar space, plant the devices all over the world and then leave for some tens of thousands of year. Why -for coffee? Then they would have had to repeat the process to come back to earth after many generations of their civilization passed. This premise -which wasn't in Well's book - is absurd. I am guessing Tom 'xenu' Cruise must have had a hand in the script's logic. Also the aliens are consuming the blood of a species foreign in DNA to their own, obviously without testing the blood they were consuming. So we have technology to cross many light years of space, but are too dumb to test the blood of the race they are consuming. This was quite possibly the stupidest movie, next to Travolta's travesty,that I have ever seen. Great special effects, OK acting, very, very stupid plot. Why can't these people actually film the book they are quoting the story to be based on?",5,1,2,28 January 2007
Platoon," one of the best scenes ever filmed
",The movie is excellent. The image of Dafoe running through the jungle with Samuel Barber's Adagio for strings playing in the background still sends shivers up my spine. This was a divine moment captured on film when just a visual with music said more that all of the books ever written on Vietnam or war. Sheer Genius.,10,1,2,24 September 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," great movie
","It seems as if Dr.Lector is so devoid of emotion and empathy, so removed from human emotion, that he has 'quid pro quo' games with Clarice having her reveal emotional memories to him, with him sublimating them almost as a 'vampire' revels in drinking blood. Thus I thought it quite apt the a policeman asks Clarice if Lector is a 'vampire'. Indeed he is, but he doesn't want blood. Lector is so totally devoid of emotion, or suffering depression to such a desperate degree, that he has to resort to the most heinous act possible, cannibalism, to evoke any emotion, any feeling whatsoever. Lector is indeed dead inside - no good, no bad, no nothing - that is the ultimate tragedy of this empty shell of a man. Lector is played as a man who always has a quiet steady voice and even indulges in classical music as he commits acts of cannibalism. The scene in which Hopkins talks to the camera is nothing short of miraculous. Ted Levine as Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumbis also is nothing short of astounding in his portrayal of someone seriously lost mentally, a man who so despises his own flesh, that he adorns himself in the flesh of others, to achieve a feeling a normalcy. A great movie about sanity and insanity with magnificent actors at their best.",7,0,1,3 January 2008
The Island," Very handsome, but idiotic movie -!!!!spoiler alert!!!!!
","This movie was gorgeous to look at and the acting was superb by all those involved. Once again the brief appearance by Steve Buscemi was wonderful. The concept was refreshing but terribly flawed. Beautifully filmed and visually convincing. Now for the bad part...SPOILER ALERT ****************************************************** How could the sheer number of employee's hired by this cloning facility operate over a number of year's without anyone revealing this place to the public? Even the NSA can't manage this (see Bush's wiretapping laws on U.S. citizens). How can you clone someone as an adult with the clone being the same age as the original? How could the memories of any one of any age be transferred to the clone? If the clones were just for organs, why not just grow the organs and minimize your worries and expenditures? These kind of movies do science a disservice by convincing many film goers to be 'memed' (to coin a verb),into a conviction against biotechnology by films that intentionally mislead.",5,1,2,13 December 2006
