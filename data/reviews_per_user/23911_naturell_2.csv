Hereditary," Nope
","Good acting but the storyline was full of flaws that could just not be overlooked.
Sorry, but this was not good.
Shame, because it started off fairly well. I was bored until about 25 to 30 minutes and was just about to bin it off, then it picked up a tad. 
Very inconsistent and unrealistic.Collette was great though.",4,0,1,4 September 2018
