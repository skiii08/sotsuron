Iron Man 3," Was a little disappointed, but over all it was good.
","Lot of you might hate me for writing this review. But I have been a reader of Iron Man comics since I was in kindergarten (almost 30 years). So in a sense there would probably no bigger Iron Man fan-boy than me. I wondered if it bothered anyone else that the president looked like a chubby Mitt Romney? Does this mean that the makers of Iron Man 3 (or Disney) was making a political statement that they think Mitt should have won? Then again this is a make believe fantasy world and the resemblance could have been coincidental. I kind of groaned after the falling out of Air Force One scene. Honestly they would have splattered on impact of the water or the people at the top should have had their arms rip out of their sockets or at least severely dislocated. At the very least they should have had massive internal injuries and internal bleeding from the impact with the water because they did not slow down that much. Then again this is comic book physics which does not really apply to the real world physics. My next biggest complaint Rhodie should have had more Iron Patriot fight scenes. I'm not going to bother explaining that the Iron Patriot in the comics was actually Norman Osborn in the comics during the Civil War story line. I don't think he even fired that big gun on his shoulder. They kind of nerfed Rhodie as a character. They kind of turned him into the token black character that is just there. Would have been nice if they had some back story on how Tony and Rhodie became friends. If I remember right he only had like 5 or 10 lines of dialog. My final complaint they turned the Mandarin who is probably Iron Man's greatest enemy into a goofy more pathetic version of Shredder from the later seasons of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the 90s. That was almost unforgivable, but.... I see what they were trying to do. The whole 10 alien power rings might not have been in the budget. I was really hoping that the ring that the guy from the 10 rings was wearing in the first Iron Man was one of the Mandarin's and he was influencing him through it. I think they were trying to do a gamble and do something different. Something no one was expecting. Honestly they could have casted Russell Brand for the part of the Mandarin and it would have produced the same results only I think that he would have matched that character a little better.Now this being said they did a lot of things right. I like how they introduced AIM into the Marvel movie world. Does this mean they are going to have MODOK in a future movie? The introduction for the Extremis is excellent. Does this mean in the next movie we will have Iron Man's Extremis armor? I think they did do a better job in this movie showing Tony's more human side when he met the kid that kind of reminded him of himself a bit. However it was a little corny.Like Dark Knight Rises, I will probably not buy this one on Blu-ray when it comes out. I might just wait until someone gives it to me for my birthday or Christmas. So I am not in a huge rush to watch this one again which is a little sad. This is the first minor disappointment from the Marvel movies after Daredevil and Electra. Electra was actually a huge disappointment. I'm also being very forgiving to The Incredible Hulk which I thought was alright. Perhaps I just need a second watching to appreciate Iron Man 3.",7,0,1,5 May 2013
