Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Dazzling
","'No one can kill a Jedi!' Anakin Skywalker boasts. Qui Gon Jinn regards the young boy with a rueful gaze. 'I only wish that were so,' he replies quietly. What better example of foreshadowing could be found in 'Star Wars: Episode 1?' The film is literally teeming with clever instances of foreshadowing, irony and theme. Consider the time when Anakin meets Obi-Wan Kenobi. I know that in my mind, the final lightsaber battle between the two flashed through at that moment. There is the point when Anakin singlehandedly destroys the Trade Federation's flagship, a vessel that resembles the Death Star in more ways than one. Yet my favorite moment in the film is when Yoda and Mace Windu discuss the existence of the Dark Jedi. They wonder which was killed, the master, or the apprentice. As their conversation ends, the camera slowly pans across the room to focus on the 'master,' Senator Palpatine. Very well done, I must say. Also delightful to watch were the moments of irony on the part of Senator, such as when he told Amidala that he hoped to bring peace and prosperity to the galaxy. Especially with an Empire up his sleeve. But it will be fascinating to watch his transformation throughout the trilogy.My only complaints about the film center around Queen Amidala. I enjoyed her performance during the first portion of the film, but towards the end, she seemed to develop a severe coldness. This was especially evident when she bade Anakin farewell right before her speech before the Senate. I understand that she may have been overcome with grief, but she was extremely harsh. Yet I did enjoy her performance in the Senate. The pain over the loss of her people and the ravaging of Naboo was evident as tears shone in her soft, brown eyes. Her costumes were extraordinary. I predict that an Academy Award nomination may find its way to the Costume Department over at Lucasfilm, Ltd, as will a nomination for Special Effects. I must applaud the men and women at Industrial Light and Magic for their genius on the pod race and space battles. The sound scheme was phenomenal as well. I could actually feel the floor rumble beneath my feet in the theatre as I watched the film. The lightsaber battles were flawless in their execution, and the choreography excellent. I hated to watch Qui Gon die. The first time I watched the film, I literally gasped as he fell to the floor. There was such a tortured expression on his face. I doubt I will ever forget it.On a lighter note,I enjoyed watching young Jake Lloyd do a fantastic job as Anakin. I refuse to buy the critics advice on this young actor. They termed his performance 'wooden. If I nearly cried when Anakin left his mother, I would not call his performance 'wooden.' He was absolutely adorable,especially when he asked Padme if she was 'an angel.' A friend of mine called his pickup line 'smooth.' I think that this was a powerful attempt at the 'Star Wars' story. Although it had its flaws, it still followed the classic mythological framework laid out by Joseph Campbell in THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES. With 'Star Wars,' it isn't about the special effects. It is about the story of the hero, and the timeless truths that have been passed down for centuries. I salute George Lucas in his fine attempt to continue this essential tradition.",Null,0,0,25 June 1999
Shakespeare in Love," A film that swept me off my feet!
","Watching 'Shakespeare in Love' was like falling in love for the first time. The passionate enthusiasm of the characters, the gorgeous costumes and masterful script swept me along until the close of the film. I do not know where to begin when discussing this delightful film. I adored the little 'in' jokes, such as the wording 'Stratford-Upon-Avon' on Shakespeare's mug, or the man on the street discussing a rose, and how by any other name it would bear the same sweet fragrance. There was the classic balcony scene, swordplay, and passionate romance. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes made a wonderfully charming couple, although I will admit that the film could have cut down on the nudity just a bit. But other than that, it was a flawless piece. Geoffrey Rush, dastardly evil in 'Les Miserables,' was simply hilarious as a theatre owner in financial straits. I loved his quirky facials and mock terror. Finally, Dame Judi Dench's performance as Queen Elizabeth was so subtle that it nearly caught one offguard. Yet it too was quick, witty and quite worthy of the Oscar it won her.The film's script was a masterpiece in itself, weaving the beatiful wordplay of Shakespeare with some of the brilliance of today. There were plenty of plot twists and unexpected circumstances to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. And I believe that the ending of the film was simply perfect. I recently appeared in a production of 'What You Will,' and it was refreshing to see a familiar moment on screen. Clearly, 'Shakespeare in Love' earned its Oscar for Best Picture. I sincerely hope that it will remain a favorite for years to come.",Null,0,1,22 August 1999
X-Men," Wow
","I was incredibly impressed by this film, despite its mediocre reviews in the local newspaper. Director Bryan Singer truly captured the themes of loneliness and isolation that many experience in society today, even without mutant abilities. The struggle against prejudice was also another key element in this remarkable film. I was amazed by the haunting opening scene, as well as its continuing effect on the rest of the film. Also compelling were the relationships between the characters, and how in a remarkably brief amount of time, they had formed genuine bonds. The performances of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman? truly stood apart from the rest. Finally, I think that this film demonstrated than anyone can find acceptance, all they must do is find the right group of people. In a society bound by Internet access, cell phones and pagers, we must remember that there are people who feel left behind, who we must reach out to. This film reminds us that everyone deserves our respect, and therefore we should not judge others simply because they are different.",Null,0,0,17 December 2000
Snatch," Holy diamonds, Batman!
","Wow...this film was a whirlwind of trendy visuals, ugly violence, colorful one dimensional characters, and of course, a sparkling 84 carat diamond extraordinaire. I must give director Guy Ritchie snaps for his cutting back and forth between scenes, lovely parallels like the (spoiler!) dogs and the hare, as well as the corresponding action in other quarters. But the suggestion of certain methods of feeding pigs, as well as the excessive appearance of blood and violence could have been avoided. On the other hand, the comic appeal of this film was first-rate and original. However, I was saddened that Benicio del Toro did not have a larger role in the film. I think that his character could have gone much further than it was given a chance to. In any case, with its breakneck pace, swift-moving soundtrack and gripping story line, 'Snatch' was a definite entertainer.",Null,0,0,11 February 2001
The Patriot," Heart-wrenching drama
","I was simply astounded by this film. From the moment that Mel Gibson brooded over the prospect of his prior sins to the touching ending of the film, I was spellbound by the strength of the characters and the emotion of this film. Mel Gibson presented us with the image of a war-hero who wished that he could undo the past. Unlike the other zealots at the town meeting, he alone saw the dangers of fighting a revolutionary war, and the high prices that the innocents would pay. Yet even his character could not foresee the terrors that his own family would face, and the dear consequenes of undertaking such an endeavor. This film is a testament to the human spirit, a force of reckoning for revolutionaries anywhere. It is such a contrast to learn about the American Revolution in a history class and then to see it reenacted onscreen, with bayonets slicing, tomahawks flying and cannonballs wreaking horrific havoc upon the enemy. Yet what is most moving is the devotion that these soldiers had to their families. Never mind the societal taboo that men cannot cry, for these men cared deeply for their families. I absolutely adored this film, and I strongly urge everyone to see it.",Null,0,2,20 July 2000
Lawrence of Arabia," Stunning
","'Lawrence of Arabia' rightfully deserves its reputation as a masterpiece. Its stunning footage of towering sand dunes, quirky camels and blazing sun set a high standard for future cinematographers to meet. I could almost feel the heat of the desert in my living room, as well as the intense strain of the Arabs. Watching the film was almost reminiscent of reading 'The Old Man and the Sea'; they both have that wearying effect on a person.
Officer Lawrence himself reminded me of Kurtz in 'Heart of Darkness.' He began as an officer stifled by civilization, who later found himself in the unknown, in this case, Arabia. Lawrence's fellow officers also resembled the men in 'Heart of Darkness.' They were more actors than people, never realizing what the Arabs truly faced, what their ideals were. Lawrence found himself among them...yet he discovered that there were parts of himself he did not care for. The film also asks questions about the morals of civilization,and basic human rights.'Lawrence of Arabia' reminded me of several other films. First, because of the involvement of Alec Guiness and the desert setting, I was reminded of 'Star Wars.' The camels reminded me of 'Indiana Jones,' as did the white clothing. Lawrence's costume resembles Indy's in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Speaking of costumes, notice the use of color in the movie. Ali is dressed in black, Lawrence in white. The classic bad guy v. good guy colors used in many films that followed. I could continue on forever about this film, yet I will simply state: I have never before seen a film quite like this.",Null,0,1,23 March 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," It's called depth
","I am one of the few who believes that the sequel is actually superior to the original. Now don't misunderstand me, I like Jurassic Park as much as the next person. But The Lost World had more depth than the first film. It expanded Malcolm's character, not to mention his past. It also allowed time for more character development on the part of Sarah Harding and Kelly. The emphasis of the film was on respecting nature. The movie carried a theme, for goodness sake. It had a darker mood, which also added depth. Who could forget Roland's infamous line, 'I believe I've spend enough time in the company of death.' Pete Postlethwaite did a marvelous job as Roland, and Jeff Goldblum performed well also. Although some scenes could have been excised, such as the one where a man is devoured by compys, the rest of the film is good. It has the most depth for an action flick that I have seen, and it asks some interesting questions.....For another film that asks even more thought provokers, see 'Pleasantville.'",8,0,0,17 November 1998
Coyote Ugly," Surprisingly enjoyable
","After I read a movie review for 'Coyote Ugly' in my local newspaper and watched the trailer for this film, I expected it to be a mediocre picture lacking in plot, depth and clothing. Fortunately, a trip to the theatre to see 'Coyote Ugly' proved me wrong. This film was an absolute treat. I'll grant it forgiveness for its cliches of the innocent girl in the big city seeking her fortune, the barista babes who befriend her, or the time-honored boy chases girl scenario, or in this case, how the ferociously handsome Mr. O'Donnell chases Violet Sanford.On the subject of the male lead, Adam Garcia gives a sizzling performance as the dashing Mr. O'Donnell. Female fans in the audience will be thrilled to see Adam Garcia in his prime at the bar, but I won't divulge any details here. (Darn!) Although the film does feature some provocative female rug-cutting, some of the numbers are well-choreographed and pay homage to genres of dance like line dancing or 'Riverdance'-esque moves. The soundtrack takes pages from The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Kid Rock, Third Eye Blind, and LeAnn Rimes, who performs the film's trademark song 'Can't Fight the Moonlight.'This film has its share of pitfalls, such as the moment when Violet describes her stage fright to Mr. O'Donnell or Violet's weepy friend (why is she in the film again?) Yet on the whole, it was a solid, humorous, cliched film. I would give it **1/2 to *** stars. Thank you!",Null,0,0,12 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Spell-binding
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' could be considered one of the most fascinating films of the century. Its influence can be found everywhere, from 'Star Wars' to 'Contact.' Its special effects were extraordinary for the time period, and the musical score was simply breathtaking. Surely it must have been a spell-binding sight on the silver screen, because it was fascinating on the small. As I perused the comments of others on this website, I noticed the term ambiguous was applied to the film in nearly every entry. This element allows viewers to interpret the film in any number of ways, and allows them freedom to think for themselves. It's a nice touch. I have a few ideas about this film myself...First, the 'Dawn of Man.' I got the impression that violence was the only manner that someone would get ahead in life. There was the cheetah that attacked the ape, the ape that attacked the theropod, and the ape that attacked the other ape. The film is filled with death imagery: the dead theropod, the dead ape, the dead humans. The sets are stark white and sterile. The only breath of fresh air, of new life, is the new baby at the end. Everyone is so isolated. They eat in front of their little computer stations and talk to the computer. Their conversations are so limited in scope. There does not seem to be anything worth fighting for, no truth, beauty,or religion. Nothing is powerful enough to stir things up. It's almost reminiscent of 'Brave New World,' because people have nothing worth living for. They also seem to be overly dependent on technology. At least one message of the film would be not to let technology rule your life, or it will come back to haunt you. There is the concept of technological advancement. In 'Jurassic Park,' Malcolm tells Mr. Hammond, 'Your scientists were so preoccupied if they could, they didn't stop to think if they should!' When technology has its own artificial intelligence, emotions and dialogue, what separates it from humanity? When the people become as two-sided as cardboard cutouts and humanity has less personality than a computer, something is wrong. People need to reach out to one another.So many things can be said about the film's ending. I am still unsure exactly how it fits in, except to provide a contrast to the death imagery. It could be the BIRTH of an idea. It could provide innocence to a struggling race. It could simply be a random idea, or a connection in the circle of life. In any case, the film is fascinating. I can see its influence on 'Star Wars,' 'Contact,' 'Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home' (the wall is like the cylinder that attempts to evaporate Earth's oceans. You never discover its true purpose), 'Lost in Space' (new movie), and many others. We will probably never discover the true message of the film, but it is a nice challenge to try and figure it out ourselves.",Null,0,2,25 April 1999
Final Destination," Ok, I can breathe again now.........
","What a film! I'll grant that the acting was mediocre and the plot questionable at times, but this film had an enormous impact. I was reminded of the Greek tragedies and their inexorable element of Fate. As Oedipus was fated to do the unthinkable, these young students were fated to die in a plane crash. But Fate did not account for the psychic impulses of Alex, nor their effect on Clear or his compatriots.    I absolutely loved all of the conceptual elements of foreshadowing; the word 'Terminal' flipping, the words 'Final Destination' on the tag, the announcement of the 'Departure.' Even moments in the dialogue which mentioned having the rest of one's life ahead of them simply pointed the finger towards an unfortunate end. Notice the subject of Clear's book at the airport, with its photos of Diana in the car crash...or Miss L's record...or all of the instances where Alex feels the presence of death. This film is incredible when it comes to suspense. I was literally holding my breath as I watched. It took me a good half hour to calm down afterward. And sleep? Ha. I couldn't fall asleep for hours. Yet despite the film's masterful concept of Fate, we also see the determination of the human spirit to survive, as well as courage, devotion and the notion of self-sacrifice. The film's only setbacks are the moments of stupidity by the main characters. (e.g., Would you ever put a beverage on a computer monitor? Hello?) Otherwise, this film was incredibly powerful and causes the viewer to contemplate its ideas for hours afterward. Also, consider the fact that there is an alternate ending on the DVD version and see which one you prefer.......:)",Null,0,2,9 November 2000
The Truman Show," Eerie
","Watching 'The Truman Show' was like watching an episode of the 'X-Files'-a creepy, yet fascinating experience. Many elements of the film do not make sense until a few hours after one has seen the movie. Christof, his booming voice emitted from the sky represents God...yet he also reminded me of a Communist leader. I think it was the idea that Truman and all of the other actors were equal under one producer. This went for the staffers as well. There was also the allegorical concept of the film, such as Truman's name. Truman, was the only 'true man' on the island. He was also true to himself at the end. Then there is the motif of the eyes. The cameras serve as eyes, but we also see Sylvia's eyes gazing at Truman, and Christof's piercing gaze. A fascinating motif. Finally, there is the aspect of water. Biblically, God created a flood that covered then earth. Christof creates a storm that kills Truman's father. It was chilling to watch Christof stroke the picture of Truman on TV. It was a sickening reminder of the lie that Truman was forced to live.The entire concept of the film is frightening. To have your entire life on television for the world to see is difficult to swallow. Yet most importantly, like  'Pleasantville,' 'The Truman Show' asks you to think. And films that accomplish this feat are fine accomplishments indeed.",Null,0,0,15 February 1999
The Matrix," Indescribable
","I honestly do not know where to begin. I found 'The Matrix' to be simultaneously mind-altering, exhilarating, gasp-inducing, nauseating and maddening. Yet I believe that the true power of the film lies in its ability to make the viewer truly believe in the power of the Matrix. As I watched the film, I lost myself in the world of the 21st century. Yet the most chilling part of the film was the concept that machines could overrun the world. The concept of artificial intelligence with emotions and needs was addressed well in '2001: A Space Odyssey,' but this film goes far beyond HAL. The idea of artificial intelligence considering us to be zoo animals, and accusing us of exhausting supplies-since when is artificial intelligence a natural commodity? Since when do computers deserve the earth more than humans? And since when did people lose all worth? I truly wanted to attack Agent Smith as he hurled these depraved comments at Morpheus.
On a lighter note, I loved all of the little allusions in the film. Obviously, 'Follow the White Rabbit' came from 'Alice in Wonderland,' and Morpheus' comment about tumbling down the hole followed in the same vein. There was also a great deal of Biblical imagery. Neo was like a present day Jesus. There were also numerous references to religion, including Trinity's name, Adam Road, and the idea that he was THE ONE to save humanity. You could also consider Cypher a type of Judas, who would betray his friends for riches. Yet I also saw a bit of the X-Files in this film, with the theme of conspiracy; Star Wars, with Morpheus as a sort of Jedi master ('Don't think about it, do it.') and Neo as a sort of Luke Skywalker. Even Morpheus' comment had a Yoda-like feel about it. I think that the film took great pains to demonstrate the values of humanity, and the price they put on life. The artificial intelligence was a sharp contrast. Although Smith confides that he too wants to be free, he hates humanity. Neo and friends aim to preserve life. We hold a higher value on life than battery fluid. The idea of infants ingesting the fluid of the deceased also made me nauseous. Soylent green as a liquid. Fun. Yet despite all of the nauseating blood, vomit and liquid people, I was simply blown away by this film. It challenged my entire viewpoint on life, challenging me to consider the idea that life is but a dream......It was a fine effort, and I hope that the 2 window-washing brothers come up with another provocative film.",Null,0,0,2 October 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A tale of epic proportions:)
","What a film this was! From its commencement with the words of Homer to its dynamic finish, this film was an extreme departure from the mediocrity of most mainstream film today. Its score, filled with lovely harmonies and dixieland style tunes, suited the film perfectly. I especially loved the song of the Sirens...      Although the film was based upon the Odyssey by Homer, it bore little resemblance to the original, and was a delight in its own way. (Spoilers follow) John Goodman, with his one remaining eye was a dangerous Polyphemos, and of course, the Sirens by the riverbed and 'Penny' rather than Penelope were all nods to Homer's epic. Yet what I loved about this movie was the way it built. Granted, it was a bit slow the first half hour, but once the audience realized the importance of Ulysses' journey and his need to reach his 'treasure,' then the interest built and built. The most frightening moment by far occurred when the three convicts crashed the 'meeting' of the secret society and beheld the unmasking of its leaders. In short, this movie was a definite departure from the mainstream and most definitely worth your $5. :)",Null,0,0,14 January 2001
