Alien 3," criminally under-rated
","By a narrow margin, this is actually my favorite entry in the Alien series. Maybe it's because I recognize all the British actors from 'Withnail & I' and 'Doctor Who,' and I get nostalgic...but I think there's more to it than that.I prefer the notion of one all-powerful Alien creature to the hordes of mindless drones that appeared in 'Aliens.'  I also quite like the strange cast of characters on display here - the soft-spoken doctor played so well by Charles Dance, the hapless '85,' and Charles S. Dutton's bad-a** preacher man.  They're so much more distinctive than big bunches of marines, and even the Nostromo crew members in the first 'Alien' film.  So I care more, here, when people die.Granted, the special effects are a bit lacking - there's none of the action spectacle of 'Aliens' in this film, and the creature itself looks obviously animated in far shots.  But the sets are truly stunning, and the level of violence is balanced pretty well - it's more frightening than gross. 
The longer special edition, available now on DVD, actually hurts the movie a bit - I prefer the leaner, meaner original.  And I don't particularly care that the director has disowned the film in all its versions - since he went on to direct rubbish like 'The Game' and the forceful but too-grotesque 'Fight Club,' I think we can dismiss his opinion and just enjoy 'Alien 3' ourselves...",9,12,20,22 January 2004
3:10 to Yuma," All Aboard the Hype Express!
","Now here's another movie that critics seemed to love, and I just plain hated. Sometimes it's annoying to be out of step with the Universe, and yet in this instance I think I have a strong case.Frankly, I think '3:10 to Yuma' is an excessively violent, utterly unbelievable and even somewhat mean-spirited film. In vintage Hollywood tradition, the movie tries to make Russell Crowe's character - a crazy, murderous, gun-toting maniac - into a sort of folk hero, by pitting him against other characters who are even sleazier than he is. However, I did not like Crowe's character for a single moment; nor did I appreciate the film's attempts to put him on some kind of pedestal.My other major problem with the film is that it's paced terribly. There are actually too many action scenes, and each one becomes progressively more unbelievable. An incredible number of people get killed - too many people, in fact. I simply can't believe that so many people would sacrifice their lives to perform some of the senseless missions depicted in this film. And, unbelievably enough, Crowe's character is considered to be a highly successful gang leader - despite the fact that he keeps getting large numbers of his men killed in clumsy operations. Ridiculous.Worse yet, the action scenes are interspersed with repetitive 'character development' moments in which Crowe, seated at a dinner table or near a fire on the prairie, talks trash to the other characters, who just passively sit there and allow themselves to be psychoanalyzed by a crazy gun-toting murderous maniac. Hmm...right.I know that a lot of people like this movie. It is exactly the kind of movie that looks great to many critics and film buffs, but I just can't enjoy it because I think it's packed with movie clich√©s and it's got a messed-up moral compass. The more I see of sensitive foreign films, the less I like this kind of American movie - the kind where lots of people get shot in the head, and it's supposed to be OK because the bad guy is more interesting than the good guys. Yikes...",3,4,10,10 February 2008
Casablanca," Claude reigns
","Ah, Casablanca...everyone's second favorite movie!  On the recent DVD commentary, Ebert remarks that he's never heard a bad review of this film. I think he's asking for it there, because I've certainly heard some negative comments in my time, but usually these criticisms come from the sort of people who have a seizure the moment they're forced to watch something in black-and-white.  So, we can disregard their opinions then!  Every movie lover seems to like Casablanca, and that kind of almost limitless appeal is certainly remarkable.I consider this movie a triumph in the name of good screenwriting.  The directing and production values are certainly fine, for their time, but it's the great LINES that everyone remembers; yet Hollywood still rarely acknowledges the key role that writers play in movie-making, preferring instead to pump up the myth that directors are the sole creative forces that drive production (I'm not denying directors' importance here - merely arguing that it is perhaps exaggerated, as this movie's classic status indicates).My favorite thing about Casablanca?  Strangely, it's Claude Raines, who is simply so funny and seedy that he sticks in my mind every time I watch it. I love him, but because he's such a sleaze, I feel uncomfortable for it; in many ways, he's the most morally ambiguous part of the movie!  Of course, Bogey rules too, and the supporting cast contains two of the greatest character actors...well, ever.  Greenstreet and Lorre (or, as I prefer to call them, the Fat Man and the Bug) have more personality than most of today's 'stars' combined, and they're just two of the many highlights here.",10,3,4,19 March 2004
Kung Fu Panda," Cute but trite
","Kung Fu Panda is a cool-looking movie, and fun, and unlike many summer movies, it did not annoy or offend me. So yeah, I'm sort of glad that I saw it.That said, though, I would've appreciated a more original script. As it stands, Kung Fu Panda feels like it was cobbled together from the leftovers of 100 other movies involving chosen warriors, sagely mentors, crises of confidence and spooky supervillains. I recognized scenes lifted from Star Wars, from various karate movies, and even from the long-forgotten (or so I thought) Judge Dredd! This is not exactly a trailblazing film, in other words.Also, I actually disapproved of Kung Fu Panda's underlying message about always 'following your dream,' even if it's (a) utterly implausible and (b) involves telling your family to buzz off. You see, at the start of the film, the panda is working in his dad's noodle shop, but he dreams of being a karate master - even though he's lazy and fat. So, in order to become the hero, the panda has to reject his father's life's work and, through no particular effort of his own, become a super-powerful warrior.Call me Mr. Cranky-Pants, but I think that message might actually be bad for little kids. The film, in short, tells kids to be dissatisfied with ordinary jobs - like working in a restaurant - and encourages them to pursue ridiculous unlikely jobs, like unstoppable warrior hero. It annoys me, really, that hundreds of Hollywood movies are all about vaulting over ordinary people (like the panda's dad) in order to make it big. Foreign films, you'll notice, don't always have this 'become a rock star' message, and are actually about realistic things and realistic people. But not American movies, noooo...American movies tell you that you can become a karate master without exercise and leave your boring dad and his boring everyday job in the dust.Right, enough ranting. I suppose I've been spoiled by watching too many foreign movies lately, and I can no longer get behind cute formula fiction like Kung Fu Panda. That doesn't mean I hated this movie. The animation was nice, the action was cool, the celebrity voices impressed. I just wish that a single original idea - or even a shred of realism - had been displayed as well.",5,8,22,11 June 2008
The Big Lebowski," The perfect roommate movie
","I've never had a roommate who didn't like 'The Big Lebowski.'  It is quite simply a perfect film to watch with friends.  It's funny, fluffy, and it goes down really well with the mind-altering substance of your choice.Bizarrely, this now-classic film hit the theaters like a beached whale; it barely recouped its costs, and was generally regarded as a lightweight followup to the Coen brothers' acclaimed 'Fargo.'  I can see why people were disappointed, actually.  'Fargo' is a tightly plotted thriller, and 'Lebowski' is shamelessly meandering lunacy.  But both films are masterpieces in their own ways.What's so great about this movie, then?  Without sounding too pretentious, I'd like to submit the theory that it captures the rhythms of modern, everyday life.  Think about it.  We all have stupid hobbies and annoying friends, we'd all rather get trashed than work, and we'd all be pretty hopeless morons if we were suddenly plunked into the middle of a tortuously complex film noir plot.  That's the genius of 'The Big Lebowski'; it puts the average schmuck into a Chandleresque world of intrigue, and the results are hilarious, in a rather strange way.I know lots of people who think this is the best comedy ever made, and I'm almost on board with that - Walter alone propels the film to greatness - but in the end, 'The Big Lebowski' is just slightly too strange for me to wholly embrace.  Oh, it's great, four stars all the way kind of stuff, but after I watch a 'deeper' comedy like 'The Odd Couple' I feel more fulfilled, more enlightened about the human condition.  After I watch 'The Big Lebowski,' I feel...silly.But silly is good, when you're in the mood.",9,1,2,30 March 2004
Fight Club," a fatal miscommunication
","Here's a movie that pretends to condemn violence (by the end, Tyler Durden is unmistakeably a villain), but it makes fighting look so cool that thousands of people have misinterpreted its message.  Maybe I'm being too harsh here; I've met two people who were inspired to start random fights because of this movie, and that really irritates me (especially since they took pokes at me!).  However, I do think that a fatally flawed message is enough to sink a film, even a great film, and this is not quite a great film.Oh yeah, there's social commentary in this movie...commentary for angry 15 year olds.  Okay, commercial society stinks, so we should rebel, we should reform popular culture by...by...going to the basement and punching each other out?  No, that doesn't strike me as a viable solution.  Even the movie knows this, and it does some quick back-pedaling at the end and tells us not to trust Durden...but he's been the hero all along!   
So, in the end, the film points out problems but offers no solutions.  It generates anger, but channels it in the wrong direction.  It's clever, but it's not actually smart.  It's satirical, but it doesn't have a point. Violence is good, until it kills Meatloaf, and then violence is bad.  Sorry, it doesn't work.As for the film's actual style...gross, innit?  So, I ask myself - why watch a gross movie with a flawed message?  Good question.  The answer is, don't watch it, and go find an actually good, actually wise movie instead.",5,0,3,23 January 2004
Dawn of the Dead," attack of the zombie marathon runners
","I've soured on horror films lately - aren't they just the most repulsive things ever? - and yet 'Dawn of the Dead' won me over simply by being, well...exciting!  Most of the gore is confined to the first few minutes (the worst of it, anyway), and the rest of the film relies more on tension than violence.  So there's not too many long, lingering shots of people being eaten alive - thank goodness.Of course it's no masterpiece, but then again neither was the original (I don't think that a few comparisons between zombies and mall shoppers makes for an insightful social commentary!).  The main thing is that it's a bloody good siege story, and the characters - though thinly developed - are likable enough that you want them to survive.   I figured that Rhames and Polley would be good, but the surprise show-stealer here is Jake Weber's Michael, who distinguishes himself from the crowd by not shouting all the time. 
Huge gun battles, a pair of cool armored buses, and loads of tragic deaths keep the film rockin' on until the surprise climax, which is a bit too snide for me, but nonetheless effective.  I'm not sure I like the running zombies; they're very '28 Days Later' and very human-like in their movements, whereas the original lurching brand of zombie seemed more alien and therefore more frightening.  Still, faster zombies means extra action and a greater chance that the heroes will be caught, so there's both pluses and minuses to the new approach.",7,0,0,22 March 2004
Alien: Resurrection," The weakest link
","Ugly. Slow. Tacky. Stupid. I have a truckload of negative adjectives that I feel like applying to Alien: Resurrection, and I think they all fit.I know some people don't share my appreciation for Alien 3, but good grief, I think it's miles better than this installment. Indeed, Alien: Resurrection strikes me as one of those train-wreck movies that leaves the average viewer scratching her head, wondering why a studio would ever give the green light to such a misguided project.Alien 3, unpopular though it was, brought the Alien saga to a very definite close by killing off the protagonist, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. In this film, Ripley is not-very-convincingly brought back to life as a clone. Indeed, this whole movie focuses on the cloning issue to the exclusion of all else; it's clearly trying to say something about genetic manipulation, or parenthood, or whatever, but the message (if any) is lost in a quagmire of grossness and bad writing.Speaking of bad writing, the movie's scriptwriter was none other than Joss Whedon, he of 'Buffy' fame. I gather that Whedon has sort of disowned Alien: Resurrection because he doesn't like the way his script was realized, but I'd argue that the script was fundamentally unsound to begin with. It's loaded with techno-babble, profanity and pilfered ideas, and populated by a cast of seedy, cardboard and thoroughly unlikable characters. Apart from Ripley, the only character who gets any development is Winona Ryder's cyborg-lady, but Ryder's acting stinks and her motivations aren't that interesting anyway.Really, this film is the worst possible blend of elements from previous Alien movies. Unlike the first Alien and Alien 3, it lacks the presence of a single, unstoppable, awesome alien creature - and unlike Aliens, it lacks the excitement of a whole hoard of alien creatures. In Alien: Resurrection, there are 12 *somewhat stoppable* aliens - ho, hum. So we haven't got the sheer terror value of the first film here, or the raw energy of the second. We've got 12 aliens milling around yet another boring spaceship setting. What an ill-conceived idea.There's only one really good scene in this film - the underwater action segment, which is more sophisticated than any of the battles in the other Alien films. But since I don't care about the characters, I don't care about who dies in that scene. And, apart from that one exciting bit, the film has few merits, choosing to get mired again and again in disgusting concepts and disgusting imagery of mutants, clones, and a half-Alien half-human creature with saggy boobs. Gross.If the tagline for the second film was 'this time, it's war,' the tagline for this one should have been, 'this time, bring a barf bag.' Or, better yet, 'this time...stay home.' Atrocious stuff.",2,0,2,27 June 2008
Rocky V," A step up for the series
","Often slated as the worst of the bunch, 'Rocky V' is actually superior to the two films that preceded it.  Unlike the glossy third and fourth entries, this one tries to be down-to-earth.  Rocky loses his money, and is forced to go back to his old neighborhood.  Back in the grime of his past.  That's where he belongs, not in a mansion!Granted, there is some cheese on display here.  The music is dated and some of the dialogue is just too obvious - the reporters at the press conference pressure Rocky in all kinds of ridiculous ways.  I also don't understand the patriotic references; why is the villain 'George Washington' Duke and why does he say 'only in America' at the end? (only in America can Rocky prove his superiority in a street brawl?)  It's also silly that the film is set right after 'Rocky IV,' since all of the actors have visibly aged. 
Nevertheless, there's good stuff here.  Paulie finally redeems himself, and Tommy's corruption is an interesting counterpoint to how Rocky's career developed.  The final battle is very satisfying, particularly the visions of Mickey which inspire Rocky to get up for 'one more round!!!'  Ah, how I love the moment when he rises to kick Tommy's butt.  Dah-dah-dum-dum-dum-dee-dah-dah-dah! (etc.)I also love the last line - a great summary of what Rocky's character is all about.",Null,58,86,2 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Arr, this movie be overrated!
","There's a slew of classic films that haven't made it into the IMDb top 250, but at the time of writing, 'Pirates of the Caribbean' has achieved a comfortable place among the best films of all time - presumably because Kiera Knightley is hot and Johnny Depp is funny, right? I mean, I can't think of any sensible reason.Truth is, this is a fun little potboiler that is way too long (people complain that Harry Potter is padded?) and completely lacking in anything resembling drama. The script has the same cringe-inducing qualities as the average Hollywood blockbuster, including the Mandatory Irksome Catchphrase that is continuously spouted by characters even though it wasn't funny the first time ('they're not rules...more like guidelines!'). If Depp didn't spend the whole movie wobbling and acted brain-fried, viewers would all be bored to tears.I must confess that the sets and costumes are impressive, and I enjoyed seeing the spectral pirates marching to attack the ship. I can see liking this movie - I can even see loving it - but a classic? I think everybody gave 'Pirates of the Caribbean' an '8' because it's a crowd-pleaser, and somehow that's enabled it to rise way above where it ought to be in the rankings, which is definitely somewhere below 'The French Connection.'P.S. Forgive a quick aside about Roger Ebert. I like his reviews of classic movies, but he seems out-of-touch when commenting on recent ones; he thinks 'Van Helsing' is better than 'Spider-Man,' for example, and he labels the third Harry Potter the weakest in the series. Most bizarrely of all, he argues that Kiera Knightley is not attractive in this movie. Does anyone, in the entire Universe, agree with that assessment?",5,4,8,22 June 2004
Elizabeth," so close to great, but falls far short
","Queen Elizabeth was perhaps the most powerful woman in history, so I find it hard to accept this film's portrayal of her as hesitant, dithering, and totally indebted to her advisers for her success. Even as a fledging queen, I think she was probably tougher than she is shown to be here. The way this film tells it, she wouldn't have lasted a week without the help of Geoffrey Rush - he orchestrates her every victory.So it's not really a tale of female empowerment, is it? Granted, the movie isn't necessarily obliged to be feminist in its outlook. But I still find it disappointing on several levels. Elizabeth only becomes the formidable figure of history in the very last - and admittedly great - scene. So we never get to witness her oversee the defeat of the Spanish Armada, or commission Shakespeare to write the Merry Wives of Windsor, or anything like that. We merely get to see her order Rush to 'whack' various spies, foreigners, and rivals. It's like an Elizabethan mobster movie - and it's clearly trying too hard to be sexy and violent to work.I wanted more boring stuff - more religion, more politics, and definitely more character development. The whole point of the movie is that Elizabeth rejects her suitors and becomes a self-governing 'virgin queen,' but her suitors are such cardboard characters that her choice seems preordained. Joseph Fiennes is okay as Sir Robert, but his supposedly wonderful relationship with Elizabeth is already established at the beginning of the film - we don't see it grow, we don't really know its foundations, and I, for one, didn't care about it. And Elizabeth's French suitor, Anjou, is such an idiot that of course she can't help but turn him down. I hate conflicts like that - since Anjou is a flighty pervert, it's a forgone conclusion that Elizabeth will reject him, so all that remains is for the viewer to watch her patience with his antics slowly diminish. Yawn.I also could've used more characterization of Christopher Eccleston's Duke of Norfolk, who basically just spends the movie stalking up and down corridors and looking surly. And was it necessary to make Queen Mary look like some weird creature of the darkness? I felt manipulated into seeing every character and situation in a particular way - Attenborough's character is obviously meant to be misguided, Queen Mary is crazy, everything Geoffrey Rush says is right, etc. All of the active, interpretative sectors of my brain simply shut down and went along for the ride.And that's a shame, really, because this is a well-produced and superbly acted movie. But it's so fundamentally thoughtless that I ultimately can't recommend it. I wonder if they'll ever make a sequel in which Elizabeth actually accomplishes something on her own...",5,4,6,17 January 2005
Spider-Man 2," eh...the original is better
","I'm sensing a new trend here. A few years ago, everybody agreed that sequels pretty much reek. But now, studios are 'pumping up' their sequels with more money and more hype, and suddenly, it's cool to say that installment number two is better than its predecessor. Directors have jumped on the bandwagon - they'll happily admit that their earlier efforts pale in comparison to their latest blockbusters - and critics are following suit. 'X2' was judged better than 'X-Men,' when it wasn't, and now 'Spider-Man 2' is being universally hailed as better than its predecessor...which it isn't.Trouble is, the only thing that's really better about this movie is - come on, you can guess it - the special effects. The CGI Spidey looks better. He moves well. The fights are beautifully choreographed. But you know what? He's still CGI. And a good special effect is still nothing more than a momentary diversion. It's the script that counts.And this script is old news. At one point, it was rumored that the movie was to be subtitled 'Spider-Man No More.' They should've just called it 'More of Spider-Man,' because it's a rehash of the original. We get more of Spidey being a loser (a lot more...like an hour), more of Spidey mooning over Mary Jane, more heroism in a burning building, and more evil scientists with a serious case of hubris who decide to tamper with forces that are best left alone. It's a virtual remake, only without the cool origin story and the iconic scene on the bridge. Even Uncle Ben makes a return appearance, but in a form so cheesy and strange it must be seen to be disbelieved.I must admit that Alfred Molina's Doc Ock makes a great villain; he's both a sympathetic character and a kickass opponent for Spidey. The scene when he awakens after his 'accident' is truly horrifying, effective stuff. But I couldn't understand his plan, or care a whit about his giant gizmo. So many important plot points are glossed over, particularly the exact nature of his tentacles (What do they actually want? To steal an exasperated actor's catchphrase, what's their motivation?) Many of the things that happen to Spider-Man are inexplicable, too. He's supposed to be making some big life choices in this movie, but his decisions seem to be dictated more by unexplained physical changes that he's experiencing, and not his own judgment. One thing that the script does make clear, however, is the moral of the story, which is pounded into Spidey's head every time he asks for some gaseous advice from a friend or loved one.Right, griping done. Certainly an entertaining movie, and the train segment is fabulous. But the first was better, make no mistake. Refined CGI is not the key to a superior film.",7,2,4,30 June 2004
Batman Returns," highs and lows
","Here's the one-sentence review of 'Batman Returns' - any scene with Catwoman is great, and any scene with the Penguin is awful.There are exceptions, of course, but the quality of this film undeniably see-saws based on these characters.  Whereas Catwoman is genuinely sympathetic - isn't it horrible, watching a nice woman get brutally murdered by a heartless tycoon? - the Penguin tries to evoke sympathy but is ultimately too grotesque to move me.  Am I really supposed to care about a character who bites people's noses off, plans to murder children, and spits up loads of forest-green goo?  It doesn't help that DeVito overplays the part terribly, burying any potential for subtlety by screaming out all his lines.  Listen to how he mangles 'they wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so now, I'm layin' them on a slab.'  That line could be pathetic and sad, or maybe scary, but the way DeVito plays it, it's merely loud.Thankfully, DeVito is the only acting dud here.  Pfeiffer plays it just right, volleying between her vampish and cutesy personas with incredible skill.  Walken is also great; he chews the scenery like a madman, but that's exactly the kind of acting that's called for in a movie where even the sets are outrageously over-the-top.  And of course, Keaton is still good, although one can understand why he quit after this film, since he's given very little to do.On balance, 'Returns' is the best of the series, because there are many genuinely emotional moments.  But there's a distinctly grotesque quality to the movie that forces it slightly out of the mainstream, which is a shame - its relative commercial failure led to the series' descent into mindless popcorn drivel, starting with the next entry.",8,0,0,17 March 2004
Hot Fuzz," Color me disappointed.
","I was looking forward to Hot Fuzz - but Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright let me down for the first time.This is a very, very weird movie. It's a hybrid comedy-action-horror piece, and the different elements don't sit well together. Somehow, Pegg and Wright's 'Shaun of the Dead' successfully crossed genres, but the same experiment doesn't work here. The action scenes seem tacked on, the horror comes out of nowhere, and the comedy simply isn't strong enough - the good laughs are scarce.Part of the problem is that the film is simply too intense. It's too loud, the cutting's too rapid, the scenes are too short. Oftentimes, Wright introduces tension and unease in a scene for no particular reason. This technique worked fine on half-hour episodes of his sitcom 'Spaced,' but it gets wearisome in a feature-length film; beside, it undercuts the real (deserved) tension that develops later.Another problem is that this movie is distinctly lacking a feminine touch. There are no major female characters - in fact, there are hardly any minor ones. It's very much an overdose of testosterone. (Perhaps 'Spaced' is so good because comedienne Jessica Stevenson contributed to the scripts and prevented them from descending into this kind of boy's-own stupidity?) I don't mean to suggest that 'Hot Fuzz' is terrible. The opening scenes have got something, and Nick Frost is always at least cute. But the jarring shifts in tone, relative lack of laughs, violence, and darkness all work together to produce an unsatisfactory result. I'm looking forward to seeing more work from this comedy team, but they'll have to beat this effort to keep me interested.",5,11,24,21 April 2007
Troy," maltreated - a great movie
","Bad movies come out in droves these days. The majority of critics must be on autopilot, bombing new releases left and right, because they missed this perfectly good movie and gave it the same shoddy treatment as the typical brainless blockbuster. But anybody with sense can see that 'Troy' is clearly a cut (or ten) above the average summer fare. Beautiful sets, thrilling battles (particularly the one-on-one clashes), and a terrific ensemble cast elevate this film to the status of epic greatness. I wonder if it will be reassessed with kinder eyes in the future, when we're not all so cynical and burnt out from watching too many CGI spectacles.Common criticisms of this movie just don't hold up. Orlando Bloom makes a fey Paris, yes, but that's the nature of the character. Perhaps his love scenes don't give off enough heat, but they're merely a preamble to the real focus - the war itself. Brad Pitt is better than you've heard as Achilles; once again, the controversial aspect of his performance (he's sulky) is true to the original character. Of course, the real show-stealer is Eric Bana's Hector; after his lackluster and low-key performance as the Hulk, I didn't think much of him, but here Bana infuses Troy's greatest warrior with wisdom, power, and passion. If junk like 'Lord of the Rings' nets Oscars, then Bana should definitely be up for Best Supporting Actor, but I doubt that'll happen.True, the movie is not particularly faithful to the original myths in many important respects. But it doesn't pretend to be anything but a modern re-interpretation; the title isn't 'Homer's Iliad,' after all. It's pretty ridiculous that critics slam the movie for not sticking closely enough to a poetic work that is obviously an exaggerated and embellished account of the war. By eliminating the gods (their actual presence, not their influence), 'Troy' makes the Trojan War seem more real than it was in 'The Iliad,' and that's not a bad thing. It was a real war, after all (probably). And I'll bet the gods didn't show up in reality, either...Perhaps 'Troy' has too much moral grey area for modern audiences, who have grown accustomed to black-and-white, good-vs-evil conflicts from both the movies (Star Wars, LOTR) and the political rhetoric of the day. But I love the ambiguity in this movie, and every time a character dies - whether he's Greek or Trojan - I feel bad. I never know which side is really right, which side I want to win. That's because the story has genuine complexity; nice to know that Hollywood is still capable of generating something with more than a surface layer of gloss.'Troy' is also exceedingly manly, which could be alienating, as it celebrates not only combat and good muscle tone but such outdated concepts as honor, duty, and courage. Watching this, I couldn't help but think we're all complete wimps these days, in terms of our fallen virtues as well as our flabby bodies. But I'm drifting into weird territory now. Suffice to say that 'Troy' is a beautiful and underrated story of honor, love, and cool battles between cool characters. Try to catch it in the theaters while you still can; epics always look their best on the big screen.",9,6,12,22 June 2004
X-Men," superior to the sequel
","*minor spoilers follow*I know many people prefer 'X2' because it boasts superior production values and more action, but in all the important respects - character development, measured pacing, intellectual stimulation, etc. - this film BURIES its successor.  Whereas 'X2' collapses under the weight of a huge cast and contents itself with running helter-skelter from one battle to the next, 'X-Men' concentrates on a few characters and takes its time setting up a fascinating universe.Believe it or not, Senator Kelly is the most important character; he establishes the essential moral conflict that faces mutants and society. And while he's clearly supposed to be wrong, the film allows him to have a point.  The Brotherhood is, after all, a sinister bunch (THESE are the mutants he's worried about!), and we are clearly supposed to feel sympathy for Kelly after he is tortured and killed by them.  Ultimately, the film does have a powerful (and Liberal) message of tolerance, but it treats its message's opponent with respect, and I admire that sense of fairness.Aside from all the deep stuff, the movie is also a rockin' good time. Stylish direction, nifty effects (that are not overused, as in the sequel), and a few good action sequences keep the proceedings from becoming too pompous and preachy.  Magneto's origin segment is effective, if a tad thoughtless (I'm not quite sure if it trivializes the Holocaust or not), and poor Rogue's isolation is well-conveyed.  Jackman is a cool Wolverine (I'm glad he was basically unknown), and even Cyclops and Jean Grey aren't bad. The only real loss is Halle Berry as Storm, who can't act to save her life; I haven't seen 'Monster's Ball,' but I can hardly believe that such a wooden performer won an Oscar for another film!  Perhaps she thinks that she's too good for this material; in that case, she shouldn't have been cast.That bump aside, this movie is all good.  Kamen's score is over-the-top but it fits, and is certainly more engaging than Ottman's annoying orchestral blasts in 'X2.'  Production values are solid, if already dating (the rapid advance of computer technology is such a nuisance).  There are some great set pieces, especially Magneto's confrontation with the cops.  You know, there's really nothing to complain about, except that they hacked out some good scenes that are available for viewing on the DVD releases.I don't even like the 'X-Men' comic, but I LOVE this movie.  That's a testament to how good it is.  After the dramatic final scene with Professor X and Magneto, I was jazzed for the sequel; I wanted to cheer as the closing theme music started.  Too bad I was letdown in a big way...",9,0,2,24 March 2004
Spider-Man 3," Spidey on autopilot
","I had fun watching Spider-Man 3, but I can't deny that it's a mess.What the critics are saying is true; this is a stale movie, packed with too many villains and too many supporting characters who are completely wasted. Thomas Hayden Church has a few great scenes as the Sandman, but he disappears for huge chunks of the film, and his storyline never quite comes together. Bryce Dallas Howard has even less to do as Gwen Stacey, and James Cromwell, playing her dad, barely features at all. And Venom - the most famous Spider-Man villain of the 1980s and 1990s - has what amounts to a glorified cameo.Why on earth is this film so overstuffed, so overwrought, so sloppy? Who thought it was a good idea to include three villains? And who actually believed that the tedious soap opera scenes between Mary Jane and Peter worked? I'm sad to say that they produced groans and derisory laughter in my local theater.The worst problem with the film is that Spidey isn't even properly characterized. I've been sort of a Spider-Man fan for twenty years now, and I understand the character. He is supposed to be *funny* - witty, sarcastic, charming. Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man is none of these things. He's just a depressed, charmless drag. A total social misfit. He's nowhere near charismatic enough to be Spider-Man, as I envision the character.So, saddled with a drippy Spidey and a messed-up plot, this movie can only be so good. Even the much-vaunted special effects aren't so great; they look like a super-advanced computer game or cartoon. Frankly, I'm sick of CGI, and I'm ready for a new special effects revolution. I want more real stunts and more 'physical' special effects in my blockbusters. For goodness' sake, I actually think the action scenes from 1950s war movies eclipse Spider-Man 3 in the excitement stakes, and that's bad! I also had major problems with two important plot points. Point one: the symbiote is never properly explained. Point two: some random butler character comes out of nowhere and resolves the most important conflict in the film. Good grief, why?Despite having all these flaws, Spider-Man 3 delivered about two stars' worth of entertainment for me; I give credit to James Franco, who rises above the material and gives a likable performance. But I still think this movie might kill the now uber-expensive Spidey franchise, or at least blunt public enthusiasm. Audience members in my theater seemed disappointed and lacking in energy. And who can blame them?",5,3,7,4 May 2007
A Bridge Too Far," my favorite WWII movie
","'Private Ryan' may have served up more blood and guts, but it had a fanciful plot and it didn't really tell audiences anything about D-Day.  By contrast, 'A Bridge Too Far' is like something the History Channel would produce; it's full of maps and narration and endless tactical discussions that, amazingly enough, really held my attention - and really enlightened me about the battle of Market Garden.It helps that the ensemble cast is great - perhaps the best ever assembled - and the characterization, though a bit thin (as in most war movies), is certainly good enough considering how heavily the plot dominates.  The film's one major weakness is that it telegraphs the battle's result from too early on; all the smart characters think that the operation will be a disaster, and lo and behold, it's a disaster.I love this movie anyway, maybe because of the production style, which is more realistic than the cornball war films of previous decades but not quite so over-the-top as 'Private Ryan.'  The battles are both thrilling and terrifying, a nicely struck balance.  When the end credits roll, I always feel tired - like the characters - which is a testament to how involving (and effective) the movie is.",9,91,108,23 January 2004
Cloverfield," A decent time at the movies, but no classic.
","I like monster movies a lot, including both 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Godzilla' (the Japanese one, not the Matthew Broderick one). So I guess it was inevitable that I'd see 'Cloverfield,' which is frequently described as the love child of those two films.Unfortunately, I didn't find 'Cloverfield' to be as good as its source material. This movie, unlike the Blair Witch or Godzilla films, focuses an awful lot on character development. That might work, except the characters in 'Cloverfield' are mainly annoying yuppies involved in really shallow, neurotic romances. I felt sympathy for them during certain scenes, yes, but that was only because they were suffering - not because I especially liked them as people.The other disadvantage 'Cloverfield' has in comparison with its predecessors is that it features a sort of lame monster. I mean, sure, Godzilla looks fake and all, but at least I can identify him as a dragon-dinosaur hybrid, which is cool. Without giving too much away, the beast in 'Cloverfield' just looks...bizarre. Icky. Messed up. I didn't think that it had a particularly iconic or memorable design, in short. I doubt that anybody will remember what it looked like 10 years from now.I guess I'm being a little harsh, though, because 'Cloverfield' has some good suspense moments and memorable apocalyptic imagery. And the characters aren't a total loss - at least they're loyal to each other, and occasionally one of them gets a good line.It's just not a great movie, that's all. I'm a little tired, I guess, of horror films that focus on 20-something 'beautiful people,' and I long for the days when monster movies featured wise middle-aged professor characters and plucky journalists instead of rejects from 'Dawson's Creek.' Still, if you're interested in enjoying a few scares and experiencing mild nausea in the process, 'Cloverfield' will deliver for you.",6,0,0,22 January 2008
MASH," is this a generational thing?
","Three very intelligent and literate twenty-somethings, including myself (how's that for modesty?), once watched this movie after a big turkey dinner.  Within ten minutes, we were chatting amongst ourselves.  Within twenty minutes we were silent, not because the movie had hooked us, but because our heads were falling slowly, drawing ever closer to the couch...and the blissful release of sleep.Our elders (and perhaps betters) nevertheless seem to think that this is a really hilarious, really insightful movie.  Hmm...interesting.  I, for one, was bothered by the episodic plot, which never stuck with a conflict long enough to get me interested.  I also thought that the humor varied wildly in tone; many of the early segments are downright disturbing (I actually think our 'heroes' are callous jerks for much of the time), but we wrap up with a silly slapstick football match.  It doesn't help that this film, like the subsequent TV show, is downright ugly to look at - like a love letter to tan and olive drab.  I suppose that's the ugliness of war, but I've never been so I wouldn't know...again, maybe it's a generational thing.This is the second time that Altman has bored me into a stupor!  If he serves up another turkey, I'll be ready to declare him the most overrated director of all time.",Null,8,17,19 March 2004
Battleship Potemkin," Fantastic to look at, but...
","Over the past couple of years, I've made it my mission to watch many of the most famous films ever made. And while I've greatly enjoyed some of these films, others have struck me as overrated drags.'Battleship Potemkin' falls somewhere in the middle of the scale. I admire the film for its groundbreaking direction and sequences of extreme suspense and horror. But, on the other hand, much of the film is a little ... dull. Indeed, my girlfriend is now snoozing heavily in the next room, having passed out during the long sequence of the Potemkin approaching the rest of the fleet. (I suspect that I liked the film a little more than she did. Bless.) Now, I should unpack what I mean by 'dull,' because I hate it when people are imprecise with their criticisms. I quite like a lot of films that can be construed as 'dull' -- Twilight Samurai, Alphaville, Tokyo Story, and so on. But these films aren't boring to me; they're paced in such a way as to invite contemplation rather than generate excitement. And because I care about the characters in these films, this pacing doesn't bother me at all; indeed, it draws me into the story even more deeply.The trouble with 'Battleship Potemkin' is that it doesn't have great characters; nor does it really invite you to contemplate anything. At heart, it's an action movie designed to appeal to the most basic of emotions, not your brain. So, in the slow stretches of the film between action segments, 'Potemkin' sort of grinds down. This problem doesn't spoil the film completely, but it does in my opinion prevent it from being an all-time classic.So why did I give it an '8'? Because it truly is fascinating to watch. Because the Odessa steps sequence is rightly celebrated (and the imitations aren't as good). Because the propaganda bits are actually sort of interesting. And, of course, it's full of memorable images that are both beautiful and terrifying.And yet, I can't help being a little annoyed at film critics for over-praising films that were groundbreaking for purely technical reasons. Even though film is a largely visual medium, shouldn't we be more invested in plot, characters, and themes than in novel use of cuts/dissolves/montage/etc.? There's more to movies than clever trickery with the camera -- or there should be, anyway.In short, 'Battleship Potemkin' looks great and is a fascinating piece of film history, but it might not entertain you, and it almost certainly won't enlighten you. I liked it fine, but I can think of quite a few movies I'd rather watch -- many of them foreign, and most of them slow-paced.",8,0,0,23 August 2010
Rocky II," curse of the sequels
","I wanted to see Rocky beat Apollo Creed.I also did not want to see Rocky beat Apollo Creed.Like so many sequels, 'Rocky II' undermines its predecessor.  It's rather like a two hour epilogue to the first film, a tacked-on 'happy ending' to a movie that was supposed to be more realistic and downbeat.That said, it's wildly entertaining.  It's more footage of Rocky, one of the most compelling characters in cinema history.  And it's got some great 'rage' scenes featuring Apollo Creed, Rocky's worthiest opponent.So, as sequels go, this isn't too bad.  It does damage, but it's also got worthwhile parts (a great training segment and a spectacular climatic battle, to name two).  It pales compared to the original, since it drags in certain parts (Rocky is training lazily...blah blah...Adrian is still sick...blah).  But when it works, you can still see flashes of the 'Rocky' genius. I guess they had to make it.  Hey, at least it was pretty good, right?",Null,1,2,2 February 2004
Fargo," even better than you've heard
","'Fargo' seems to be drawing flak lately; I think it's part of an anti-Coen backlash. The brothers have been serving up heavy doses of irony and dark humor for years, and some viewers are getting tired of them. Still, that's no reason to retroactively criticize their masterpiece, is it? Yes, the film has a very queer sense of humor, but if things like the Minnesota accent drive you nuts, you're not getting the joke (BTW, this doesn't mean that you're stupid, just that you don't share the Coen sense of humor!). I usually hate 'funny' gore, but I do think that the violence here, though occasionally 'amusing,' is also quite horrible and repulsive. So, it's not quite like a Tarantino film then, where violence becomes a supercool thing to emulate. What ultimately distinguishes this film from a Tarantino effort - and indeed, from the Coens' other films - is that it is, in the oddest way, sentimental. McDormand's character lends warmth and humanity to a story that is otherwise quite cold and detached. Her presence makes 'Fargo' accessible, even if you're not a big fan of black comedy, and her 'normalcy' elevates this above even 'The Big Lebowski,' which is a great movie as well, but also too much of a freak-fest.Enough apologies - this is one of the best films of the 1990s (surprise surprise, it didn't win Best Picture!). The photography is gorgeous, and the icy landscapes lend so much atmosphere to the proceedings. The script is fast and snappy without seeming artificial, and the acting is across-the-board great; Buscemi's comic role is often overlooked, but in fact he may give my favorite performance. Burwell's score is evocative (what a great, bombastic opening!), and it is of course a wonderful novelty to see locales in a movie that aren't in New York or California. Classic stuff.",9,1,2,26 March 2004
Predator," smartest use of mud in motion picture history
","Several years ago, when I was still hacking my way through college, one of my psychology professors decided to bring up 'Predator' during a lesson on adaptive intelligence.  'Smearing mud on yourself may not seem smart,' he said, 'but if it blocks the Predator's sensors, this apparently meaningless act becomes an intelligent act.'  As it transpired, no one in the class had seen the movie but me, and one guy kept shouting, 'I don't get it!  How does spreading mud on yourself equal intelligence?!'  My frustrated professor eventually declared that men who hadn't seen 'Predator' didn't qualify as real men.  Just thought I'd share.  Anyway, my professor was on to something; this is a really manly, tough guy sort of movie.  And, like so many tough guys, 'Predator' is both powerful and stupid at the same time.There's lots to loathe about this movie, including Silvestri's monotonous and silly music score, the ridiculous opening scene packed with cliched dialog ('It's been a long time!'), and the totally unrealistic battle with the rebels, who can't even manage to kill a single American while they're being mowed down by the dozens.  Then there's the dreadloked Predator itself, who is a memorable alien, but not nearly so memorable as, say, the Alien.  He's a bit silly-looking, you know.But then again, there's lots to love.  Carl 'Apollo Creed' Weathers can elevate even the lowliest material (well, maybe not - I haven't seen 'Action Jackson' yet), and Arnold gives a very natural and laid-back performance. The Predator's cloaking effect still holds up, and some of the sequences are suspenseful.  When the girl calls the Predator 'the demon who hunts men's skins' (or whatever), I always get a little chill.Still, this is a pretty silly movie, even if you're in a charitable mood. My biggest problem with the upcoming 'Aliens vs. Predator' is that the former series is venerable (it produced three classics - yes, I count Alien 3!), whereas the latter series is tacky junk.  But, thanks to Dark Horse comics, these two basically unrelated properties are now fused together into one ghastly whole.I'm rooting for the Alien.  But the Predator is still my goofy, manly buddy.",Null,1,3,25 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," a moderate opinion
","This is the best film I've ever seen...involving lots of short people walking through the woods, fighting orcs! Fans of the novels will adore this movie, and they are no doubt the people who have puffed up its ratings on this site.  But I'm convinced that, beyond the realm of the Internet and the adolescent guys who love this kind of stuff, the film will have very limited appeal.  Harry Potter - which is, incidentally, the better film - produced a tremendous buzz among the people who work in my office, particularly women, since it has a broader appeal and a more charming story that is easy to relate to.  Everyone has gone to school and been intimidated by teachers and other students, like Harry Potter.  Everyone with a unique talent has been sometimes rejected out of envy, like Harry Potter.  Not everyone has had to trek through woods and swamps to chuck an all-powerful ring into the furnace of Mount Doom (and, indeed, that is all that Lord of the Rings is about - just think of it as a really long walk peppered with fights). Let's face it, the nine-member Fellowship contains not a single woman to stem the free flow of testosterone.  The movie is preoccupied with axe-swinging and monster-maiming, with only a few genuine moments of emotion coming from Ian Holm (Bilbo) and Ian McKellan (Gandalf), who are the by far the best actors in the picture.  But Tolkein - and the film makers - seem to have a problem with Gandalf being too powerful, so at various points in the film he is conveniently injured or whisked away so the other characters can blunder into danger and generally be incompetent.  Think of Gandalf as a star quarterback on a team that otherwise completely lacks talent... The rest of the cast is fine, though some of the characters (Gimlee, Legolas, any hobbit who isn't Frodo or Bilbo) seem very skimpy and poorly developed.  My brother referred to Gimlee as 'nothing more than a talking axe,' and he's dead right!  Most of the flaws in the film are glossed over by the beautiful production values (though I wish the fans would stop whining that $100 million isn't a big budget - it's enormous) and Peter Jackson's exciting direction (though he hardly deserves an Oscar).  I certainly didn't hate the thing but, like Star Wars, I find it overrated by critics and enthusiasts alike.  I'm actually a big fan of fantasy/sci-fi, generally speaking, but when the fantasy universe is completely divorced from reality as this one is, my interest wanes. Final verdict?  Three out of four stars, though I felt obliged to make my review largely negative to counteract the floodtide of praise.  Somehow, I don't think that the line 'Let's go hunt some Orc' is going to replace 'This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship' in the hearts of movie fans!",7,0,1,13 January 2002
28 Weeks Later," more of the same good stuff
","I enjoyed '28 Weeks Later,' even though it felt exactly like '28 Days Later,' only with more splattering blood.This is, indeed, an action sequel to a thoughtful little horror movie. For me, the original version was better. '28 Days Later' had stronger characters and a certain freshness to it (even though it was obviously based on older zombie movies). This sequel feels like a retread with extra action tossed in. It's still good - the apocalyptic imagery is wonderful - but it's like good leftovers. You already had the same thing last night.I shouldn't be too critical, though. The filmmakers saw they had a good formula with the first movie, and didn't change it. Better that than changing the formula into something dumb, right? It helps that this movie has a strong cast. Robert Carlyle is good, as usual, and his role takes a rather interesting twist mid-movie. Jeremy Renner makes for a likable and quite unexpected hero. And, as a bonus for genre fans, Idris 'Ultraviolet' Elba has a decent role as a military commander. Perhaps the only casting stretch is Rose Byrne; she's beautiful, and a good actress, but she looks too young to be the chief medical officer for a program to rehabilitate zombie England! Another minor downside is that the film strains credibility on occasion; for example, the manner in which the infection breaks out again is vaguely outrageous. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just moan in general that the army does a really lousy job of security in this film. Implausibly lousy, in fact.Yet this is still reasonably intelligent, good horror. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission - it's the stuff that nightmares are made on.",7,0,2,24 May 2007
Pitch Black," sorry, folks, but it's distinctly mediocre sci-fi
","I love 'B' science fiction...but I don't love 'Pitch Black.' The first half of the film is turgid junk, and the second half - while exciting - feels like a sub-sub-sub-standard version of 'Jaws 2.' In other words, you've seen this kind of scary movie a million times before, and it was done better 900,007 of those times.I must confess that Vin Diesel is an arresting screen presence, and Radha Mitchell is as lovely and compelling as ever. They often carry the movie when the expletive-ridden script falls completely flat.Aside from their performances, though, there's not too much to recommend this movie. The villainous creatures look like exactly what they are - modest special effects - and fail to generate sufficient tension.Really, the most intriguing aspect of the film (to me) is that it features several religious Muslim characters, which is practically unheard of for Hollywood. But, as you can tell, I'm really stretching to find points of interest if I'm reduced to remarking on that.Amazingly, this bog-standard movie was followed by two sequels - one animated, and the other a shiny CGI spectacle. Together, they form the so-called 'Riddick Trilogy' - which will, unless I miss my guess, never become the 'Riddick Tetralogy.' We must be thankful for small mercies.",4,1,4,24 May 2007
Duck Soup," no wonder it bombed - it's a masterpiece
","I'd like to start out by saying that I've been laughing at Duck Soup for twenty years.  I always expect the film to feel stale after too much re-viewing but, dammit, I laughed hardest the tenth time I saw it!Sometimes I think that every long running movie series has to contain one very atypical, very arty entry that polarizes viewers.  For Godzilla, it's actually the quite serious and violent first film.  For the Marx Brothers, it's Duck Soup, a movie completely devoid of sentiment, as Hollywood understands it (there's no happy couples on display here), and internal logic.  It's actually quite a challenging viewing experience; Duck Soup has many unpleasant things to say about war and government, and the barrage of jokes (ranging from broad slapstick to puns to sexual innuendo) can actually be tiring, especially since it hurts to laugh continuously for over an hour.We don't make 'em like this anymore.  Is this a broad comedy, a political satire, or a lavish musical?  Of course, it's all three, a strange cross-breed of genres that would give today's concept-oriented studio execs a heart attack.  So many modern movies are monotonous in concept and execution, but Duck Soup zings all over the map and somehow manages to excel in every way.  The musical numbers are lush and hilarious, and bizarrely, the special effects beat almost anything attempted by science fiction until the 1970s!  Groucho's verbal comedy is beautifully complimented by Harpo's pantomime, and even Chico does okay with his stereotypical Italian schtick. Far from being one trick ponies, the Marx Brothers can do just about anything and everything, which is why they remain more popular - and relevant - than any other old time comedians, including Chaplin, who sometimes gets more credit as an artiste.  At the end of the day, the Marx Brothers are funnier, smarter, and more lovable (in their mangy way) than their rivals. Since this movie is so very strange, I can understand why it occasionally gets a negative review.  It's so far ahead of its time that we're still catching up to it!  (Yes, it is ahead of its time, and yes, it is a satire - pay no attention to people who say otherwise)Too bad comedy is so dreadful these days.  Groucho's nudge-nudge wink-wink sex jokes are a thousand times funnier, and more provocative, than the crass and explicit commentaries we get on the subject today.  And the Marx Brothers understood, better than anyone else, the importance of having a good 'straight man' - hence Louis Calhern as the long-suffering Trentino and Margaret Dumont, who deserves some kind of posthumous Oscar for allowing the Brothers to torment her so.In short, this is the funniest seventy minutes of cinema ever made.  It's the only Marx Brothers movie that dedicates itself wholeheartedly to pure anarchy and biting criticism, and so it's the only film in the series that might qualify as art.  But why try to classify it?  It's just awesome.",10,1,3,10 June 2004

Rocky IV," boy, is this one dated
","Stallone was the ultimate anti-Russian actor of the 1980s (see also 'Rambo III'). Since we're at peace now, some of his films have become rather embarrassing. 'Rocky IV' is obviously a case of 'us' against 'them,' and by the final reel, even the Russians are rooting for Rocky the all-American hero. Very strange indeed, especially given the series' roots in serious drama.A Russian friend once noticed this film on my DVD shelf (I must confess that I bought it for completeness). I put on a grim face and said to her, 'I'll never forgive you b****rds for killing Apollo Creed!' Thankfully, she knew that I was making fun of the movie, and not Russians.The only highlight? Apollo, of course, who steals the middle entries in this series. His speeches about the pain of aging and losing the title still resonate.

The 40-Year-Old Virgin," What passes for a thoughtful comedy these days.
","A lot of reviewers seem to think that this is a thoughtful movie, a film that really captures some elusive truth about - I dunno - male/female relationships, or our society's attitudes towards sex, or whatever.But in reality, this is pretty much your average sophomoric comedy, with perhaps a tiny bit more insight than you'd expect. The title character is presented in a somewhat sympathetic fashion (I guess), and I suppose that's surprising in a good way. However, this movie only appears sensitive and smart when viewed alongside, say, South Park; it's hardly a great character study like The Odd Couple, or a really novel and intelligent comedy like Groundhog Day.The problem is that everybody in this movie is grotesque. Carell's character is an endearing dweeb, somewhat reminiscent of real dweebs, but in the end I found him too weedy and bizarre to be genuinely likable. His oversexed friends, meanwhile, are all pathetic jerks themselves, and the various chicks who show up during the film are usually trashy and scary. I suppose the only character who's really supposed to be nice is Carell's main love interest, Trish, but she comes across as bland compared to all the lunatics on display.But maybe the real problem I had with the movie is that it's not actually laugh-out-loud funny. I thought they really tortured the scene when Carell's chest hair gets ripped off, for instance; it would've been boring enough at half the length. And some of the 'famous' lines - 'they felt just like bags of sand!' - really ain't as hilarious as all that.Yeah, I think this movie ultimately doesn't know what it wants to be - insightful social commentary, or dumb frat-guy comedy. It settles for a middle ground, so it gets a middling rating from me. Just don't be fooled by glowing Ebert reviews or anything like that.",5,5,12,5 March 2007
Collateral," A-list stars, Z-grade movie
","America's film critics have finally succumbed to madness. Collateral enjoys a healthy 85% approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes site, yet it is easily one of the ten worst films that I have ever seen. I'll grant you that the average moviegoer will probably not hate it as much as I do - nobody goes to a modern thriller expecting a masterpiece - but I think it's fair to say that many discriminating viewers will find this film trite, instantly forgettable and deeply disappointing. Worse yet: it's boring.Beware, for some minor (and hopefully vague) spoilers follow. I need to give away some of the plot in order to convey just how inane this movie is. I'm sure you already know that Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who picks up a hit-man played by Tom Cruise. Foxx is placed in the unenviable position of ferrying Cruise around the city, watching helplessly as his passenger bumps off key witnesses in a major trial. Think about this plot for just a second, and a host of potential problems will rear their ugly heads. Surely, Cruise will have to kill Foxx at the end of the night - otherwise, Foxx will go to the cops and spill his guts. Yet Foxx doesn't seem to realize this. For the first half of the film, he goes along with everything Cruise says, putting up only a frustratingly wimpy front of resistance. His character is so clueless that he actually visits his mother with Cruise in tow, not realizing what everyone in the audience knows; Cruise only wants to meet mom so he can hold the threat of her death over Foxx's head. Though Cruise runs rings around Foxx for quite a while, our hapless cab driver actually has about five or six great chances to escape, all of which are squandered. He fails to give Cruise the slip in a hospital, in a bar, and in a crowded nightclub. Cruise threatens to shoot innocent bystanders, but since he's already killing people, surely it behooves Foxx to make an escape attempt anyway? Of course, Foxx does panic and flee at one point - and, within seconds, runs from a crowded area into a completely deserted one. Like you would, under those circumstances.Why is Foxx so scared of Cruise? Maybe because the hit-man is virtually indestructible. He shrugs off injures from car crashes and bullet wounds to the neck, soaking up damage like the Terminator and springing back to life every time he apparently dies. At one point, Cruise actually takes on a whole squad of cops and bodyguards in a packed dance club¬Öand kills them all. Never mind that there are dozens of people around, and all anyone really has to do is grab him. I mean, come on - since when does one hit-man take on an entire crowd? Aren't assassins supposed to be subtle? Credibility is stretched so far that, even by Hollywood standards, the movie is goddamn absurd. Naturally, Cruise has to inexplicably wimp out in time for his final battle with Foxx, because we can't have the evil guy winning, can we?If only the action was the only lame part. Alas, the screenwriters pour salt into the wound by veering into 'philosophical' territory. Cruise waxes on about his abusive father (is this supposed to make him sympathetic?) and gives Foxx a tedious series of 'seize the day' speeches about following your dream - recycled, no doubt, from the equally annoying scripts of Fight Club and Dead Poets Society. Hollywood writers would have you believe that, if you just apply yourself, you can go from convenience store clerk or penniless cabby to successful entrepreneur in a matter of weeks. All you need is an eloquent bad guy to give you a boot in the a**! Any moment now, I expect Doctor Doom to come crashing through the wall and give me an inspirational speech about cultivating my writing talents. Or not.Shameful! It's just shameful. There's not a line or a scene in this movie that hasn't been lifted from another source and put through the trivializing machine. There's even a subway chase that feebly echoes The French Connection. The horror...the horror...Time to shut up now. You know how it is with bad movies; there's so much to complain about that it's tempting to overindulge in the smorgasbord of sarcasm. Incidentally, the increasingly silly Roger Ebert gave this three and a half stars - the same rating he gave The Shawshank Redemption...",1,86,148,6 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the best entry in a strong series
","'Prisoner of Azkaban' is the best Harry Potter movie so far - and I'm not at all embarrassed to admit that I enjoyed the first two films as well. Critics of this series puzzle me; the books are good potboilers, and so are the movies, so what's to complain about?  The casting and production design in each film has been pretty much perfect.  Certainly, the Potter films are closer in 'look' and tone to the books' vision than the mysteriously acclaimed Lord of the Rings movies, which drain much of the whimsy out of Middle Earth and turn the whole saga into an Orc-hewing action fest.The only thing that was missing from the first two Potter films was an arty director, and lo and behold, they got Alfonso Cuaron to replace Chris Columbus for Azkaban.  But I certainly didn't hate Columbus' directing, and arguably his straightforward style was well suited to the material, since the early books were not particularly atmospheric.  Only with Azkaban did the Potter books begin to truly emphasize elements of mood, horror, and danger, and so the movies shift in tone at exactly the same point as the source material.  This was the right time to bring Cuaron on board.Defenses of Columbus aside, Cuaron inarguably takes him to school here by managing to tell a coherent story and getting fancy with his camerawork at the same time (Columbus had trouble with the latter trick).The special effects get better every time, with Buckbeak the Hippogriff making the biggest impression here.  It's funny how much they can make you care about some CGI creature!  The Dementors are awesome, swooping Reaper-like creatures who add a welcome stab of Gothic horror to the proceedings.  Every segment that features the Dementors is wonderfully suspenseful - much more suspenseful, in fact, than the flat attack scenes involving the Wraiths in Lord of the Rings.  It's amazing what a director can achieve when he's got a sense of good pacing and actually holds his shots...Casting is great again, with Emma Thompson giving a memorably loopy performance as the seer and David Thewlis making a very charismatic Lupin. The Harry/Lupin scenes are in fact my favorite part, and the character development in this film clearly eclipses what we've seen before, particularly in the more action-oriented Chamber of Secrets.  As for Michael Gambon - well, he rocks.  I'm not on board with comments that he's inferior to Richard Harris.  For goodness' sake, Harris was almost impossible to hear in the second film!  Gambon is louder, more colorful, and more brash, and that's good.  Shame his role is quite truncated, but I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in the next film.  Ditto Gary Oldman, who seems to be having fun playing a ridiculously OTT Sirius Black.I'm glad to see that the movie's early box office receipts are so strong - and people thought the era of Harry Potter was over!  I can hardly wait for the fourth film, which is in Mike 'Donnie Brasco' Newell's capable hands.",10,0,0,10 June 2004
Ocean's Eleven," attack of the heist movies
","Let me confess something straight away - I hate heist movies.  As my Dad is fond of pointing out, in real life people hate thieves - yet Hollywood insists on turning them into heroes, time and again!  I wonder why.  Could it be that Hollywood loves underdogs?  That can't be the case in 'Ocean's Eleven'; somehow I can't see Clooney, Pitt, Damon and co. ever qualifying as 'underdogs.'  They're rich pretty boys who want to steal some cash so they can become richer and prettier.  Yuck.  Here's a few disturbing elements to chew on: we've got a full range of stereotypes on display here, from the Funny Asian Guy (defined exclusively by his physical ability) to the Angry Cockney Guy (defined exclusively by his accent and his anger!).  Julia Roberts, the only woman on display - and boy, is she ON DISPLAY - is defined exclusively through her relationships with men.  What, can't she have a subplot that doesn't involve romance?  No, of course not - she's a female character in boys' own rubbish. 
Still, somewhere in the depths of my cynical being, I am mildly entertained by these gaudy proceedings; some deeply-buried part of me enjoys watching the white collar crime antics of these People magazine celebrities.  But for brainless entertainment, I'd still take the likes of Godzilla over this crowd any day.",4,1,2,16 March 2004
Alien vs. Predator," and you were expecting a masterpiece?
","Ah! So stupid, yet so sweeeet. Alien vs. Predator is ever-so-slightly better than I expected, though I wasn't expecting much. I enjoyed the film's pseudo-Aztec sets and cool creature action, though as I expected, the thinly drawn human characters pale beside the awesome monsters.Much-reviled director Paul W.S. Anderson acquits himself pretty well here. He wisely shies away from CGI, relying instead on robotics and other mechanical special effects. (Apparently, 70% of the SFX are physical-cool!) He also paces the film pretty well, using the first hour to build up audience anticipation of the final rumble. I'm glad that this unfolds like a proper horror movie and doesn't start with all-out action. The fights, when we finally get them, are pretty exciting, although Anderson employs too much fast cutting and murky photography-the twin plagues of the modern action film.What really lets the side down is the aforementioned human cast, which pretty much stinks to a man (and woman). Henriksen's magnetic, gravelly voiced presence adds weight and class to an otherwise unknown and talentless group of actors. I've heard positive comparisons between Sanaa Lathan's heroine Alexa Woods and Sigourney Weaver's classic character of Ellen Ripley, but since Ripley is both tougher and better acted, I can't say that I agree. Lathan is merely competent-nothing more-and she only looks good because she's playing against a cast of silly ethnic stereotypes.I have mixed feelings about the setting, which is quite atmospheric but also very familiar and conservative. I'm tired of watching Aliens stalk people through claustrophobic corridors; when are they going to cut loose in a city or jungle? That said, the arctic scenes are great, and I loved the abandoned town. I wish it featured more heavily in the action.I note that most Internet reviewers are already gunning for this movie in a big way. Not really a shocker; science fiction fanboys are notoriously hard to please. I, for one, anticipated a total bomb, and was pleased to discover a two-and-a-half star guilty pleasure. Frankly, I always thought the whole concept of cramming Aliens and Predators into one movie was stupid. The Aliens belong to the world of Gothic horror, whereas the Predators were spawned in the action-adventure world of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Alien films are legitimate movie classics (minus number four), and the Predator films are silly (though enjoyable) action movies. It's a weird mix, and a sign that both franchises are desperately ailing (actually, Predator never was a franchise!). I certainly didn't anticipate that any movie based on such a gimmicky clash of 'titans' would be better than this; by all rights, it should've been worse. * SPOILERS BELOW * One final, quick note-isn't it just beautiful when one Alien houses two Predators? Naturally, I was rooting for the Aliens all along; they're like lions or tigers, while the Predators are the British guys with big hunting rifles. Who's got more natural skills? The Aliens. Without their technology to hide behind, the Predators have got nothing'. Heh heh heh. That's the secret reason why I liked the movie, folks...Aliens kick butt!",5,0,1,13 August 2004
No Country for Old Men," Beautiful but barren...
","I'm maybe not the best person to review No Country for Old Men. I long ago became tired of movies about assassins, drugs, shootings, and suitcases full of money. I feel as though Hollywood has been recycling the same seedy crime material for years - and so have the Coen brothers. Movies like this one, Fargo, Blood Simple, Sin City, Pulp Fiction, and Smokin' Aces all seem to come from the same mold, and that mold is getting mighty overused, in my opinion.On the plus side, I think the Coen brothers are uniquely gifted at presenting this kind of material. Indeed, No Country for Old Men is, in many ways, one of the most beautiful and suspenseful films that I've seen in a long time. It's full of striking images of the desert, interesting point-of-view shots, and incredibly intimate close-ups of actors with fascinating faces. Even the sound effects are great; they're loud, vivid and realistic, and they genuinely enhance the action.But beyond all that surface glitz, what is the movie about? I never really understood or cared for any of the characters. The protagonist is unsympathetic from the beginning, for instance. Tommy Lee Jones, meanwhile, gives a good performance but seems to be virtually trapped in a subplot. Furthermore, his 'deep' dialog did very little for me - 'mock profundity' is perhaps an apt description. The villain is great, I suppose, but once you've seen him kill twelve people, there's not much point in seeing him kill a thirteenth, is there? I don't want to bury this movie, because it's very well done. But I'm annoyed that, at usual, film critics and students are heaping an avalanche of praise on a movie that's really violent, really strange, and really alienating. Yeah, sure, it plays with narrative conventions in interesting ways. But it doesn't take true genius to frustrate an audience's expectations, and storytelling gimmicks alone can't save a story that's so barren. I suppose you could hunt for deeper meaning - as people tend to do on message boards - but I don't think there's much to find. The movie is a beautiful toy, and not too much more.",7,26,52,10 November 2007
28 Days Later...," in a word, stylish
","**some minor spoilers follow**There's been a bizarre renaissance in zombie movies lately.  This is my favorite one, probably because it's merely zombie-like.  In place of the usual cannibalism and excessive gore you'd expect from a film like this, '28 Days Later' focuses more on character development and atmosphere.  The early scenes, set in a deserted London, are the most effective; it really does feel like the apocalypse has come, and nothing about the production appears phony or staged.  Later on, the action is confined to the more modest setting of a manor house, and things slow down a bit.  But the opening segment is still some of the most effective horror I've ever seen.I saw this in the company of a good buddy who thought that the characters were badly developed, and I guess she has a point - we don't get THAT much background - but by horror standards, what we do get is exceptional.  What really matters to me is that I like the heroes (and I do), so I don't want them to get killed.  And that's all you need to drive a movie like this.Could it have been better?  Well, yeah - everything can be better - but overall, this is a stylish take on zombie films.  My only real reservation is the happy ending, especially since it's tacked on after a sequence in which Jim goes berserk and kills the soldiers.  I get the message - Jim succumbs to 'the rage' without contracting the virus, proving the theory that 'people killing people' is the norm for humanity - but how am I supposed to switch over to cheerful mode after being fed this depressing line of thinking?  To me, that's the film's only substantial weakness; a grim ending would have served it better (and such an ending does exist, tacked on to the DVD release as an extra).",Null,1,2,22 March 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," Beats X2 in my book...
","I know, my subject line is heresy. But hear me out.I thought 'X2' was a dull film because the human antagonists, led by the extremely hammy Brian Cox, were too weak to pose a serious threat to mutantkind.'X-Men: The Last Stand' circumvents this problem by giving humanity the mutant cure, the first truly effective weapon against Magneto and company. The cure ensures that the battle scenes are actually exciting.It also forms the basis of a solid plot, rich with the kinds of ethical issues that nudge the X-Men films above your standard action-movie fare. I particularly like Rogue's dilemma over whether she should take the cure. Her story arc is brought to a very satisfactory conclusion.The special effects are great, too; I wanted to cheer every time Ian McKellan hurled a car. (That's superficial, I know, but hey, I'm a superficial guy!) The closing battle scene is truly thrilling - much better than anything we've seen in the previous two films. And it was nice that some unusual X-Men, like Shadowcat and Beast, finally got good parts in this film. I always had a crush on Shadowcat, to be honest...I guess I liked this so much because of the aforementioned cure plot, and because it focused on Magneto, my favorite character. Ain't Ian McKellan brilliant? He manages to be extremely dignified and chew the scenery at the same time.The Dark Phoenix elements of the story are somewhat glossed over, I admit, but then again I always thought that story was overrated. Certainly the Wolverine/Jean romance works well here, even if it doesn't get a ton of screen time, and lends the film emotional punch. I think people wanted this film to be bad, before they even saw it, because of some weird prejudice toward Brett Ratner. I think he did a fine job, while Bryan Singer, by comparison, sort of dropped a bomb with 'Superman Returns.'",8,1,1,23 July 2006
Hellboy," a little bit Heaven, a little bit Hell
","'Hellboy' is an outrageous cut-and-paste of ideas that shoehorns Nazis, Rasputin, a fish man, hell-hounds, and a Lovecraftian tentacle monster into the familiar 'X-Files' setup involving a government agency in pursuit of supernatural forces.  Unlike 'X-Files,' however, 'Hellboy' is not a complete snoozer.  There's action and spectacle aplenty, and the film's look actually far exceeds the expectations I had based on its modest budget (CGI must be getting rather good - and cheaper!).Lord knows why Ebert thinks this is a 3 1/2 star movie, however.  Frankly there's too much action, and it gets repetitive; Hellboy fights the same monster three times, for example.  I wasn't too fond of the villains, either; Rasputin in particular is a bore who exhibits none of the charisma attributed to his real life counterpart.Thankfully, the good guys pick up most of the slack.  David Hyde Pierce's fish man voice is hilarious, and it's always great to see John Hurt (why is the old guy always the coolest part of these movies?).  Perlman's Hellboy is good fun, and I'm glad that his makeup is unapologetically cartoony.Entertaining, then, but not a masterpiece - not even in the popcorn movie genre.",Null,0,0,4 April 2004
Amadeus," my number one
","Now, this is my idea of a movie - spectacle, religion, sex, envy, and some of the most stirring music ever composed.  And it all seems so modern; a bad visit from Mozart's father is awkward in the same way as a bad visit with my own parents!  Here's a film that makes ancient history seem like yesterday, using the same trick employed by all classic films - solid characterization.It's a shame that so many of these actors never did much else, but maybe that's a blessing in disguise because it allows them to embody their characters without other movie associations getting in the audience's way.I was worried that the extended edition would hurt the film's pacing (most extended editions are a bad idea - the material was cut for a reason!).  But in fact, all of the restored scenes are excellent.  I should have expected no less!  Beautiful costumes, beautiful locations, beautiful everything...very fittingly, 'Amadeus' stands above and apart from the mediocrity.",10,8,11,23 January 2004
Hero," Poetic and cool and definitely not for everybody
","I'm not exactly sure what I thought of 'Hero'; I was distracted for much of the movie because the crowd at Loew's Jersey Gardens Cineplex kept heckling it.  Sure, these naysayers were dumb, loud teenagers and their comments were easy to dismiss (they didn't even seem to understand that the movie tells the same events from multiple points of view), but nevertheless I feel obliged to point out that 'Hero' is clearly not mainstream.  Those of you who are seeking gory summer action fare must seek elsewhere; even the fights are not exactly thrilling, and are more memorable for their balletic choreography than copious spurts of blood (of which there are none).Yeah...I did like it, notwithstanding the rubes in the front row.  I enjoyed the surprising pacifist message and the touching love scenes (even if they were a tad over-the-top).  The sets, costumes, and cinematography are all quite gorgeous.  It's good stuff - if you know what you're in for.  Which is subtitles.  And symbolism over realism.  If that sounds unappealing, please stay away.Two side notes: Firstly, this seems to be an alternate version of the same historical events portrayed in the even-better film 'The Emperor and the Assassin'; I was intrigued by the two very different portrayals of the same emperor in these two very different films.  Secondly, Zhang Yimou has directed some of my favorite dramas ('Raise the Red Lantern,' 'To Live,' 'Shanghai Triad'), and this film - though cool - is not his best work.  It's a bit silly that it's higher rated than his earlier stuff, but I suppose we're all still in the mindset that Chinese movies must = kung fu action. Oh, well.",Null,0,0,28 August 2004
Moulin Rouge!," shallow and shrill
","Remember when Nicole Kidman got a Best Actress nomination for her...ahem...'work' in 'Moulin Rouge'?  Remember when they showed a clip from the movie on Oscar night that consisted entirely of her shouting and whooping and flapping her arms like an idiot?  And remember how, when they cut to Kidman sitting in the audience, she looked embarrassed by the clip?Who can blame her?  T'was a stupid clip from a stupid movie.  She's capable of better, of course, even if she's not my favorite.  But this is clearly the worst dreck of her entire career.Where does one begin?  Nice costumes - check.  Cool and intentionally fake-looking sets - check.  Decent script - erm, pass.  'Moulin Rouge!' indulges in silly romantic cliches on purpose, because there seems to be some unwritten law that all musicals have to be superficial and shallow love stories.  Shame it didn't really try to improve the formula.  If you think that hearing someone croon 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn...is to LOVE...and be LOVED...in RETURN!' is real deep and touching, then you might get something out of this.  If, like me, you think it's mindless drivel, all style and no substance, and a whooping Nicole Kidman annoys you...avoid.",3,0,2,20 July 2004
The Illusionist," A neat trick.
","'The Illusionist' is a beautiful movie, artfully designed to seduce lovers of period pieces and high fantasy (such as myself). It's not particularly deep - nor is it necessarily all that brilliant. But, like any good conjurer's trick, this film is so delightful and entertaining that I think you're a spoilsport if you criticize it for being too insubstantial.The high points are the production design (which is gorgeous) and the acting. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti speak in weirdly soft tones for much of the film, but they manage to convey a wide ranges of emotions anyway, and both of them play very compelling characters. I had no problem with Jessica Biel, either, perhaps because I never saw her 'teen' movies and I'm not saddled with the preconception that she's a lightweight. Let me put it this way; she's certainly beautiful enough that I understand Norton's obsession with her! Now, about that script. It's actually a bit simple, a bit fanciful. The plot twists are not too hard to predict, if you really want to predict them. But so what? I enjoyed the movie even though I suspected what the ending would probably be. And, unlike many commentators on this site, I didn't feel 'superior' to the film simply because I figured out the mystery. Sometimes it's fun to watch even a predictable plot unfold.I'm actually glad that Norton made a film like this, because I usually associate him with darker, more downbeat fare. 'The Illusionist' is a very pleasant movie by his standards - like a dreamy sort of fairy tale. I enjoyed seeing him in something that's so much fun.If you insist on over-thinking this film, I'm sure you'll figure out - and start to resent - all of its tricks. You'll see the wires, so to speak. As for me...I never look for the wires. I just let myself be carried along for the ride.",8,2,3,16 September 2006
Donnie Brasco," not your average mobster movie
","I have no particular interest in mobsters or their movies, but I make an exception for 'Donnie Brasco.'  I'm a sucker for true stories, and this is one of the wildest ones out there; I can hardly believe that an FBI agent so effectively infiltrated the mob, but apparently he did, and it makes for great drama.There's a bit of everything in this movie.  We see Agent Pistone's developing relationship with hit-man Lefty (played to perfection by a hilarious Pacino), his domestic troubles, and his struggle to stay connected with the FBI as his fellow agents keep letting him down.  There's even a lion thrown in the mix for good measure; can you beat that?Although there are mobster trappings all over this movie, it's essentially a compelling story of friendship and betrayal that would work even without the guns and slang and seedy New York locales.  Unlike so many other movies, it doesn't rely on criminals being intrinsically fascinating; it makes them fascinating with genuine character development.  And that's what won me over.",10,1,2,23 January 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," not a pretty picture...
","Fairly often, I find myself pressured to justify my dislike of Quentin Tarantino movies. I've taken to saying that I simply don't care about stories that involve 'killers killing killers.' That's Tarantino's obsession - gangsters vs. vampires, hit men vs. other hit men, and here, a vengeful ex-assassin vs. her entire old gang. Every character involved is - forgive the George W. Bushism - 'evil,' and so I have no one to latch on to, no one to root for. Uma Thurman's Bride is really only *slightly* less repulsive than her opponents. And actually, since David Carradine is a better actor than Thurman, I'm tempted to root for Bill!I'm glad that Tarantino has found an outlet for his...ah...'vision' in movies, because I shudder to think what else he could be doing right now. I can admire his stuff only to a point, because it carries such a deeply disturbing (and disturbed) taint. The animated segment of 'Kill Bill' comes across as particularly gratuitous, and seems to serve no real purpose except to build up a villain who amounts to nothing much.I've noticed that, over the past few years, certain film-makers and writers seem determined to 'elevate' the childish genres they loved in their youths to new levels of sophistication: sci-fi, horror, super hero comics, fantasy, and now martial arts movies. So we get 'Lord of the Rings' adaptations that cost eight gazillion dollars, great directors like Ang Lee and Bryan Singer devoting their talents to silly popcorn flicks, and here, an arty-farty version of all those grainy-looking Hong Kong action yarns that are available on $5 DVDs. You know what? Sometimes schlock is just schlock; I didn't really need to see a 'literate' kung fu potboiler. Good photography can only elevate poor material so far.In fairness, I saw the closing scenes of 'Kill Bill, Vol. II,' and thought they were great. But they contained little violence and were clearly more original than anything seen in Volume I. Perhaps there is one good movie waiting to be discovered in the midst of two mediocre ones...",Null,3,6,3 December 2004
From Dusk Till Dawn," Every hack in Hollywood contributed to this disaster
","*some spoilers follow*Looking back over my reviews, I see that I have a somewhat inconsistent reaction to violence. Maybe not inconsistent, but complicated. In general, I'm bothered by 'funny' or glorified violence, and 'From Dusk 'Till Dawn' wallows in both. From the moment that the 'heroes' set fire to a convenience store clerk, they lose all of my sympathy. They're every bit as repulsive as the vampires - so who cares if they win or lose? An essential element of horror is that the victims should be likable, so we can be alarmed at the prospect of their deaths; here, they're a bunch of jerks.The film could still be good, if viewed on an entirely superficial level, but it's not. Rodriguez's over-the-top action just looks tacky. The CGI effects are already ludicrous, the vampire makeups are silly (rubberized demons - what is this, a BBC production?), and the violence is neither exciting nor scary - it's merely gross.Check the trivia section and note that Quentin Tarantino - that fiercely original screenwriter and director - ripped off all of the film's best lines from older movies. I guess it was too much effort to come up with an original script, right? Of course, the siege aspect of the story comes right out of 'Night of the Living Dead' and about 10,000 other horror films. At least Sex Machine acknowledges one debt - the improvised cross is lifted from Peter Cushing's 'Horror of Dracula,' a film that's superior to this pile of crap in virtually every respect.This is horror for the stupid set, a movie where the coolest thing in evidence is a 'crotch cannon.' It's SO mindless that I can't even appreciate it on the same level as bad Godzilla; it's TRYING to be campy and stupid, but at the same time masquerading as a piece of decent film art created by famous people, and it's that clash of styles that bothers me so. This film is dishonest. It's a turd wrapped in silk. It thumbs its nose at horror while trying to horrify. In short, it's maybe the worst film I've ever seen...and I've had to sit through it twice! Do I get some kind of endurance award for that?",1,7,19,24 March 2004
Big Fish," Burton goes sentimental - and I like it!
","Until 'Big Fish,' I had pretty much written off Tim Burton; I can only watch so many freakish displays of carnival showmanship, after all.  But this time, he got me.  He actually injected character development and a compelling family conflict into his usual grotesque tableau of weirdness.  I am officially a fan again.Ebert says that this movie is basically just an excuse for special effects, but I would argue that it works beautifully on a fable-like level; true, there is a larger-than-life quality to the proceedings, but surely that's the whole point?  Yes, the MacGregor/Finney character is supposed to be somewhat ridiculous, but he also represents Burton's answer to his critics. He proves that tall tales and fanciful images have a legitimate place in storytelling, and can in fact reflect reality in unexpected ways.That said, the movie did get a tad heavy-handed at the end.  I didn't need Billy Crudup (who has a pretty thankless, drippy role for most of the way) to explain the moral.  Still, I was hooked for ninety-nine percent of the way, and of course I must recommend the film simply on the grounds that it teams up Danny DeVito and 'B' sci-fi legend Deep Roy!  Quite delightful, and another strong entry in an unusually good year for films.",9,0,0,26 March 2004
Quiz Show," honesty for its own sake
","This may be Bill Clinton's least favorite movie, because it argues that honesty is essential even if there isn't much at stake.  The central question of the film - are quiz shows dishonest, and if so, is that really a problem? - may seem like small potatoes by Hollywood's standards, but this modest scale is actually what makes 'Quiz Show' work so well.  Lies - even little ones - should not be tolerated, right...?The peripheral issues are interesting as well.  The movie has a lot to say about image perception and prejudice; poor John Turturro, who plays a homely Jewish character, is bumped off the quiz program and replaced by handsome Protestant boy Ralph Fiennes.  The nature of intellectualism and entertainment is another area of focus - do we watch quiz programs because we like smart people, or because we like suspense and high money stakes?Despite these great concepts, and wonderful performances from all concerned (especially Paul Scofield), 'Quiz Show' is missing a little something - dare I call it 'pep?'  The film is oh-so-slightly slow.  And it tends to raise more questions than it answers, which is of course perfectly legitimate, but it can leave viewers frustrated.  'Quiz Show' makes American society look pretty damn shallow and obnoxious - advertisers and showmen are in complete control here.  And that's rather depressing.  The movie doesn't go very far beyond pointing out such harsh realities, but then again, maybe there's nowhere left for it to go.",9,1,3,16 March 2004
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Another solid adaptation
","To me, the Harry Potter films are all solid, perfectly reasonable adaptations of J.K. Rowling's books. The cool special effects, stunning sets, and eccentric English character actors work together beautifully to bring the world of the books to life. Certainly, the movies are not as deep or rich as the books - but that's only to be expected, since they're shorter than the books by necessity.Alas, a lot of Harry Potter fans seem to attack the movies because they 'cut out' parts of the books. I can understand their frustration, but really, it would be impossible to adapt the books in their entirety without making the movies about 4 hours long apiece. So, cut-down versions are simply inevitable.And, in the case of 'Order of the Phoenix,' I think the filmmakers were right to trim some fat off the book. Rowling's novel is pretty good, but I remember finding it frustrating in parts. The plot concerns a lot of petty bureaucrats in the Ministry of Magic denying that Lord Voldemort has returned, and their obstinacy gets a little tiresome after a while. Even the 'edited' film version drags a bit in the middle, as ministry officials Cornelius Fudge and Dolores Umbridge do their best to tie Harry Potter up in lots of red tape. I suppose it's a realistic plot, but it's also borderline tedious.Thankfully, both the book and the movie end with satisfying action. The climatic confrontation between the good and evil wizards was fun to read, but arguably the action works even better on screen. Pleasingly enough, the old professor, Dumbledore, gets to joint he fight and show off some funky wizard moves.Speaking of Dumbledore, I should like to defend the actor who plays him in this film, Michael Gambon. I enjoy his performance a lot; his Dumbledore is a little more eccentric and aloof than Richard Harris's, and I think that take on the character works well. Some Potter fans tend to slam Gambon, suggesting that he's some kind of unworthy successor to Harris. But honestly, I think Gambon's awesome - and he did star in 'The Singing Detective,' which is often praised as the greatest TV miniseries of all time. So he's hardly a total Piltdown man, is he? Unfortunately, I've ended up writing a defensive review of this movie, since people have slammed it for the plot trims and Gambon's performance. But I guess I just wanted to address some of the common criticisms. I'll admit that this certainly isn't the best Potter movie - it's too draggy in parts, and the direction/design are just OK - but it is definitely another worthy adaptation that doesn't deserve a lot of stick for not being completest.",8,0,0,31 July 2007
Grindhouse," Half a good movie (sort of)
","I'm not exactly sure why I went to see 'Grindhouse.' I tend to admire Tarantino's movies, to an extent, but I also find them rather too gross and vapid to be genuine film classics; Rodriguez, for his part, has directed some of the very worst action movies that I've ever seen ('From Dusk 'Til Dawn' and 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' leap to mind).But hey, this has been a boring month for movies, and I guess I counted on 'Grindhouse' to liven things up a bit. And it certainly did jolt me, so for that reason at least I enjoyed it.The first segment, directed by Rodriguez, is mostly mediocre. It's pretty much just a lame zombie movie, with a minimal plot and poorly developed characters. It's so violent that it has impact, but there were a few too many moments of 'penis horror' (so to speak) for my tastes. If you enjoy constantly squirming at revolting scenes of bodily mutilation, then yeah, I guess this segment might float your boat. Me? I'm sick of gross zombie stuff - but I did enjoy seeing Michael Biehn in action again.Tarantino's segment is better, but not perfect. I loved watching Kurt Russell's performance as a grizzled stunt driver (was he really not the first choice to play the part? That's strange - he's perfect for it). Thankfully, Tarantino actually reins in the violence a bit, which is nice after Rodriguez's endless splatter-fest; he also serves up one of the more exciting car chases in film history.Even the Tarantino segment has dead wood, though. He introduces us to two virtually interchangeable groups of young women, who all speak in that ultra-cool 'Tarantino Talk' that is supposed to mirror real-life speech (but doesn't). Frankly, I found it hard to relate to these pop-culture-referencing, pot-smoking, potty-mouthed and generally surly females, but I suppose Tarantino meets people like them all the time. Anyway, their endless yakking was not particularly interesting to me, and I found myself longing for Kurt to show up more often.Still, 'Death Proof' is cool overall.Easily the most fun part of the movie is the fake trailers - they're pretty much all hilarious. Interestingly, at least two of them seem to be based closely on real movies - 'Werewolf Women of the SS' is almost certainly inspired by 'Isla: She-Wolf of the SS,' while 'Don't!' looks a lot like 'The Legend of Hell House.' Incidentally, there's a simply awesome cameo in the Werewolf Women trailer.So yeah, I kind of enjoyed 'Grindhouse,' on balance. But the main thing that's sticking in my head is the gross images, not the ideas or the characters or the dialog. Once again, I must conclude that critics and film enthusiasts have overrated a bizarre product from two very bizarre directors...but at least it provoked me (a little).",5,3,9,9 April 2007
Reservoir Dogs," I still don't get it
","People sure love this movie.  I have a friend who says that it's good because of the ear-slicing scene; most directors would cut away from such violence entirely, but here, we get to see the aftermath of a maiming.  Well yeah, 'Reservoir Dogs' does push the envelope - but towards what?  Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?My ex-girlfriend says this is a Greek tragedy.  If that were true, the violence would be entirely justified, because it would help elevate 'Reservior Dogs' to the level of an enlightening commentary on human nature. Alas, none of the characters is particularly noble; they start off as low-lifes and have nowhere to fall.  So, that defense doesn't seem to work either.In short, people have long tried to convince me that this is really a masterpiece.  But even the best parts - such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant - seem artificial and engineered.  Tarantino is ripping off older, better films and directors wholesale.  There are shades of 'The Taking of Pelham 123' here, and there's also a dash of 'The Omen' at the end.  Hitchcock, Frankenheimer, and even John Carpenter did this kind of stuff before, and they did it better.  No doubt Tarantino was a breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movies, but he was not much of an innovator, and I don't think that his super-cool style has stood even the shortest test of time; he has, after all, practically dropped off the face of the earth.",2,78,142,16 March 2004
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," somebody wake me up when it's over
","After all I'd heard about 'Salo's' fearsome reputation, I was surprised when I needed caffeinated tea to make it through a mid-afternoon viewing without dropping off to dozeyland.This controversial film that is 'not for those with weak stomachs' is, in fact, crushingly dull.  What little message there is ('fascism = bad') is made immediately apparent to the viewer, and all that remains is to slog through scene after scene of the kind of sexual sadism that would only shock anyone who hasn't surfed the darker side of the Web.It didn't help that I was watching a fuzzy VHS copy, I'm sure.  Certainly the film didn't look 'beautiful' to me, and I was only impressed by a handful of shots; many of the camera angles were actually quite boring.  I might've thought the direction was fine if Pasolini hadn't been pumped up so, but given that he had been I couldn't stop thinking that he didn't measure up to the other 'great' directors in any way.This is, simply put, a film about blood and poo.  And torture.  But the minute you start thinking 'hey, that's probably just chocolate they're eating,' which is usually the same minute you realize that the film contains no character development whatsoever, it all starts to seem exceedingly pointless.Intellectual?  If you call pushing the envelope towards nothing 'intellectual,' then maybe it is.  Disturbing?  Only in its heavy-handedness and amateurism.",Null,2,9,3 May 2004
Rocky," Stallone's first and best
","I grew up when Stallone was making shallow stuff like 'Judge Dredd.' It was actually shocking to dive into his past and find that he had written and starred in 'Rocky,' a film of such...well, beauty!The novelty of 'Rocky' is that the main character is truly good-hearted, a rarity for 70s films. He tries to take care of the people in his neighborhood (even the unappreciative ones who call him 'creepo!'), and his love for Adrian is pure and unwavering. He may be dumb, and he may be poor, but he's got honesty and guts and that's why he deserves to beat Apollo Creed, who's skilled but too blown up with his own hype.Of course, Rocky doesn't beat Apollo in this movie, which is another reason why it's so good. Talk about frustrating an audience's expectations! Too bad this realistic ending was spoiled by the sequels, but what can you do?",10,0,0,2 February 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," cool for cool's own sake
","'Lock, Stock...' falls into a category of movies that I particularly loathe - the movies that are cool for the sake of being cool. There is no other attraction here: the plot is garbled, the characters clich√©d, the dialog barely comprehensible. We must like this movie, though, because it's just so dang *cool.*Or we could watch something good, right? I mean, honestly, what is the appeal of this story? A bunch of low-level gangster losers get into debt, and totally unrealistic criminal hijinks ensue. The plot twists are too numerous and too silly, as are the characters - I dare you to even keep track of which stupid thugs are in which bozo gang. That is not to say that I hated the movie - I still have the cheap DVD in my collection - but I certainly wasn't impressed. This kind of movie - violent, foul-mouthed, pointless - really defines the 1990s as a decade in cinema terms, and a very bleak decade it was. Virtually any realistic, well-acted crime movie of the 1970s is really far superior to this kind of...what would you call it, exactly? Teenie-gangster fare?",Null,0,3,5 December 2004
Rocky III," Stallone, and Rocky, go soft
","How ironic is this movie? Success goes to Rocky's head, and he loses his edge. The same could be said for Stallone, who was really adrift at this point. Rocky III is a big step down from the previous two movies, and even though I can see Stallone trying to make it great, he's not succeeding.Best part? Apollo Creed, of course. The segments in his dingy gym are really alive, and his motivational speeches are great. By comparison, Rocky's slow-talking, slow-thinking character is becoming tiresome. Worst part? Oh, for Heaven's sake, that Mr. T does not work at all. After topping a class act like Apollo, Rocky is beat by this dumb punk? Both fights are quick and one-sided - note how quickly Rocky thumps Clubber in the final battle, which is rather unsatisfying after his two epic clashes with Apollo.Nevertheless, I own this movie, because hey, it's Rocky and it's got rousing music and stuff. You could do worse.",Null,3,9,2 February 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A good adaptation, and the most cinematic Harry Potter yet
","'Goblet of Fire' is my favorite of the Harry Potter books, so I was particularly looking forward to this movie. It did not disappoint.The main reason why I like 'Goblet' is that it kicks the major storyline - the second coming of Lord Voldemort - into high gear. No longer is the Dark Lord a bogeyman villain, hiding in the shadows and merely threatening to return. Here, we get to see him in all his malevolent glory. Ralph Fiennes plays him in a suitably suave, sadistic and extremely memorable fashion. His resurrection is, as I expected, a great scene, and it's also genuinely scary.Equally exciting are the dragon duel and the underwater sequence, both of which are beautifully realized on the big screen. Unlike the previous Harry Potter films, 'Goblet of Fire' boasts blockbuster-level spectacle; the special effects, for the first time, are epic and amazing instead of merely lovely and quirky. The trademark Harry Potter quirkiness is still present in this movie, of course, but it's blended very smoothly with big-time action and arresting imagery. In other words, it looks cool.Of course, the book's plot has been edited down somewhat here, and I see a lot of users on this site are bugging out about that. I understand that, if you love the source material, it's hard to see it chopped down so much. But that's what adaptation is all about, folks. A film is not - can never be - a book. Movies are, by their very nature, shorter. Material must be excised. In this case, I think screenwriter Steve Kloves did a good job. He cut out quirky little subplots, like the house elf business, because they weren't necessary to the main action, and because they'd pad out the movie to a heinous length. To be honest, I didn't miss anything he removed. All the essential stuff is retained.One day, maybe, a forty-hour Harry Potter miniseries will be filmed that'll cover every last event in the books. Until then, I'm fine with the edited-down movies.In fact, I'm ecstatic about the movies. The casting continues to be great, with some fun new faces joining the already-awesome series regulars. The seemingly ageless Miranda Richardson does well, with just a few scenes, as the oily reporter Rita Skeeter, and new Doctor Who David Tennant is gloriously OTT as the panting lunatic Barty Crouch Jr. And finally, the semi-new Albus Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, really gets a chance to shine. I've heard some criticism of his performance, which really mystifies me, since I think he captures both the whimsy and the gravity of the character perfectly. He's like a scatterbrained Merlin in wizard pyjamas with bread-twisties in his beard - what's not to love?Another newcomer to the series, director Mike Newell, also acquits himself well. I've enjoyed Newell's work for years - particularly 'Enchanted April,' 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' and the sublime 'Donnie Brasco,' all of which are great films in very different genres. Here, he successfully tackles the fantasy genre, striking a nice balance between Chris Columbus' nuts-and-bolts directing style and the arty-farty (but really quite superb) work of Alfonso Cuaron.Newell proves particularly adept at romance scenes. There's definitely a strong scent of hormones about this movie, but thankfully the teenage angst never gets too overwhelming. The scene when Moaning Myrtle tries to sneak a look at Harry in the bathtub is very strangely sexy. It works.Speaking of Harry, Radcliffe gives his best performance here. He's turning out to be a good actor. All I can say is...bring on the next one. I'm game.",9,1,6,19 November 2005
The Departed," One-third as good as Donnie Brasco
","I guess film critics and movie buffs are going to give four stars to any old Scorcese-directed gangster movie, huh? Even ones that don't deserve four stars, like 'The Departed.' I must admit that it's not a bad film, by any means. The performances are mostly solid, the Boston setting is unique and interesting, and there are some genuinely suspenseful scenes. But, on the other hand, there are also plenty of scenes that feel either completely unbelievable, or totally flat, or a noxious combination of both.The plot, which gets needlessly convoluted at times, involves a mob 'mole' in the police department and his counterpart, a police 'rat' in the mafia. Apparently, it's based on a Chinese film called 'Internal Affairs,' but I've never seen that movie so I can't make any valid comparisons.Personally, I couldn't stop thinking about 'Donnie Brasco,' the similar Johnny Depp/Al Pacino movie about a rat in the mafia. That film contained genuine emotion, complex character relationships, realism... all qualities that are pretty much absent from 'The Departed,' which feels like an unrealistic Hollywood production all the way. The only apparent advantage that 'The Departed' boasts is that it has a trendier director than 'Donnie Brasco.' But I think Scorcese pretty much drops the ball in this case and doesn't deserve to be automatically credited as a genius - just how cutesy and self-indulgent is the last shot of 'The Departed,' anyway? Some people complain about Jack Nicholson's performance, but it didn't really bother me. His scenery-chewing is a nice change of pace from watching DiCaprio and Damon act all earnest and depressed all the time. (Incidentally, I also thought Mark Wahlberg's foul-mouthed cop was very funny and entertaining.) The real weak link in the acting chain is Vera Farminga as the love interest. She's supposedly a psychiatrist, but she gets so emotional and confrontational with her patients that she completely fails to come across as a professional. She's also a bit insipid and doesn't really have chemistry with DiCaprio or Damon.My other major gripe with the film is that the editing is often choppy and strange. Scorcese doesn't linger long enough in most of the scenes - he simply dives into the middle of the action, and jumps out again as quickly as possible. This MTV-style editing doesn't really enable me to get immersed in a movie. And some of his choppy little scenes are downright bizarre and don't seem to fit in the movie (like the weird one where Nicholson goes to the opera.) I suppose that modern films are so bad that critics freak out when a remotely competent movie like 'The Departed' shows up in theaters. It's a welcome relief from movies about CGI animals and superheroes, sure. But is it really a masterpiece? A top 100 movie on IMDb? Hardly.",6,1,1,3 November 2006
War of the Worlds," great moments, but a flat movie
","The book is always better, isn't it? H.G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds' is a little soft on characterization, but it's still a fascinating showcase for Victorian scientific theory and anti-imperialist sentiments. Spielburg's ill-conceived adaptation leeches out all of Welles' science, speculation, and social commentary, replacing them with typical action-movie thrills and weirdly inappropriate 9/11 imagery. If Spielburg went further in transforming 'War of the Worlds' into an exploration of terrorism's effect on modern American life, I might've liked his version more, but all he does is recreate moments of chaos and violence from 9/11 in a science fiction context, which seems superficial at best.There are other problems with the film. Cruise gives his usual likable performance, but he simply doesn't convince as a grizzled working man. There are about a dozen 'average Joe' supporting characters in the movie who would've made more appropriate heroes. The strained relationship between Cruise and his son is clich√©d and annoying, and there's really no need for a screaming little girl character. Certain shots simply don't make sense - why is Boston deserted at the end, except for Cruise's family, who all seem to be dressed in their Sunday best? Why can a thin line of soldiers hold back an entire crowd that's trying to storm aboard a ferry? And why are all the refugees wearing dark clothes and wooly caps, like they're peasants from World War II?The movie's entertaining enough anyway, of course. The war machines are impressive (if impractical - no doubt they would look even better in a Victorian setting), and the special effects are predictably spectacular. But the alien invasion kick is getting old now, and this seems like one sci-fi blockbuster too many. If Spielburg had set the action in the 1880s, or included some of the science from the book, this movie might seem more unique. As it stands, it's just another in a long string of summer action movies. It's better made than most, but no more intelligent.",5,7,15,30 June 2005
30 Days of Night," Have we forgotten that vampires are supposed to be seductive?
","I grew up watching really olde English vampire movies, typically featuring buxom actresses in flowing white gowns and Christopher Lee swanning around in a big Dracula cape. So, I have a pretty romantic/sexual picture of vampires in my head.Contemporary vampires, of the sort you get in this movie, strike me as too demonic, sexless and savage. These new vamps just rip people limb from limb instead of trying to seduce them. Where's the fun in that? If showing disgusting gore is the whole point, then why not just make a werewolf or zombie movie instead? Right, rant over. Once I accepted that the vampires in '30 Days of Night' would be gross, I actually enjoyed the movie somewhat. The snowbound setting is really eerie and cool, and the directing is pretty good for a modern horror movie. Even Josh Harnett manages to be likable, and the main vampire has an occasional interesting line.I never fully bought into the main premise of the movie -- namely, that a rag-tag band of characters could successfully hide from a swarm of vampires for a whole month. The vampires start off seeming really powerful and clever, but they must take their stupid pills afterwards because they don't even think to search the general store for human survivors. I mean, come on, where else are people gonna hide? All the supplies are there.But despite the grossness, and the odd lapse in logic, I enjoyed this movie. I got a few good scares out of it. Vampires + snow = creepy. It's certainly worth a look for horror fans.",6,1,5,3 November 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," This Dracula bites
","Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula is a curious thing. The movie is faithful to the book's storyline, sure, but it completely subverts the morality of the book at the same time. So, in the end, I'd have to say that it's not really faithful at all.The trouble is that the book is pretty conservative, and this movie is not. Dracula is not depicted as a romantic hero by Stoker, nor is the count a sexual liberator of repressed young Victorian girls. He's a demon parasite, basically, and he corrupts Mina and Lucy, he doesn't free them from the confines of their society or show them the true meaning of love. Therefore, the whole thread in this movie about Mina being Dracula's long-lost wife is clumsily grafted onto the source material, and it's clearly not at all what Stoker intended.Even if you can ignore the original book and its old-time morality, this movie is still lame. In addition to being unfaithful, the romantic storyline is ridiculously over-the-top and corny. I think Winona Ryder is terrible as Mina - passionless and dull - and she doesn't generate any heat with Gary Oldman. Speaking of heat, I don't think Oldman is as attractive as Frank Langella, nor is he as mysterious as Bela Lugosi or as imposing as Christopher Lee. In other words, Oldman makes a pretty poor Dracula, and watching him traipse around Victorian London in a goofy top-hat and blue-tinted sunglasses is sad indeed. So much for the Prince of Darkness, huh? The rest of the casting is pretty bad, too. Keanu Reeves is, like everyone says, painfully wooden as Harker. Richard E. Grant and Tom Waits, meanwhile, hit the total opposite end of the spectrum and ham it up like crazy. Worst of all, though, is Anthony Hopkins as a kind of perverse, religious lunatic version of Van Helsing. The character is supposed to be, y'know, a beacon of morality or something - not an old pervert who enjoys hacking up young women. In the book, Lucy and Mina are quite fond of him; in this movie, they're creeped out by his weirdness. And who can blame them? One of these days, I suppose somebody will make a definitive version of Dracula, but this ain't it. The BBC's 1977 'Count Dracula' is much more faithful than this over-the-top nonsense; meanwhile, 1958's 'Horror of Dracula' is a lot more fun (and spiritually faithful to the book), and Werner Herzog's 1979 version of 'Nosferatu' is quite poetic and beautiful. All of these films are more satisfying to me than Coppola's bloody awful mess.",4,2,4,5 March 2007
Casino Royale," Business as usual (which ain't bad)
","I enjoyed 'Casino Royale,' but I felt a little cheated when I left the theater, because the movie has been falsely advertised as a radical new start for the James Bond franchise. It's not.I had heard, for example, that 'Casino Royale' was going to be more realistic, in the vein of Ian Fleming's novels. Now, I haven't read any of the novels, but I've heard that the prose version of Bond rarely does crazy stuff like, for example, takes on thirteen machine-gun-wielding guys simultaneously - and win. But he does so here, within the first twenty minutes of the movie. He also runs through a wall and hops between girders on a construction site like Spider-Man. So much for realism! It helps, though, that Daniel Craig is built like a human tank. Unlike most previous Bonds, he's convincing as a tough guy. He's not that charming or even that smooth with the ladies, but that might be because this is supposed to be Bond's first mission and he hasn't developed his teflon coating yet.Lest I sound like I'm burying the movie, I should mention that I liked the lovely European locations, the cool casino setting, and even the action scenes, which manage to be exciting and easy to follow despite all the rapid editing. I like Texas Hold 'Em poker, too, so it was fun to see Bond trying his hand at it (typically he plays Baccarat, I think, but I never had any idea what that game was about!) Of course, most of the poker hands in this movie are ridiculously strong - 'my royal flush beats your full house!' and that kind of rubbish.On the downside, the film lacks a strong villain (Mads Mikkelsen with a bleeding eye doesn't count), and the romance scenes seem halfhearted at best. The script makes weird and ultimately unnecessary concessions to modern-day feminist sensibilities. Ye olde love interest, Vesper Lynd, spends about forty minutes psychoanalyzing Bond (don't bother, dear, he's a cardboard character) and insulting him before melting to his charms (sort of). I suppose this is 'modern' romance for some people; to me, it's just a bore. If we're not gonna see any nudity, can we just get back to the shootouts and the card games, please? My other minor complaint is the peculiar scene when Bond's... uh... family jewels are abused by the villain. Another odd attempt at 'realism,' it didn't quite work for me. (Whatever happened to fun, campy torture scenes, like the one featuring Goldfinger's death ray and the immortal line, 'No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!') As you may or may not have guessed already, I'm not the world's biggest Bond fan - how many movies can one watch about a pompous guy in a tuxedo seducing chicks with suggestive names (boringly), playing cards in exotic casinos and defeating lame super-villains? I think the franchise needs an overhaul to stay interesting, and 'Casino Royale' only partially - minimally - fits the bill. It flirts with realism, but doesn't go all the way.Note to the production team - either push the realism further, or return to your fun camp roots. This movie lies in a somewhat awkward and self-conscious realm between extremes. It's still fun, though.",7,2,4,29 November 2006
X2: X-Men United," United we falter
","Everyone seems to think that X2 is superior to its predecessor, merely on the account of its larger budget.How unimaginative and superficial we've all become.  X2 is a bloated, noisy, action-oriented sequel to a more thoughtful, far superior film.  Special effects aside, everything about X2 is weaker.  The massive cast prevents sufficient character development, the film is edited like an MTV video, and the plot meanders terribly.The most interesting characters from the first film - Rogue and Magneto - are sidelined here.  Ian McKellan is wasted in a minor role, and suddenly his morally ambiguous character - who was so fascinating in the first X-Men - is just evil, to the point where he taunts Rogue after having tortured her, and advocates the total destruction of humanity.  Rogue, meanwhile, gets to have a poorly developed romance with Iceman - every bit as thin and unconvincing as Wolverine's romance with Jean Grey.  Why bother hiring such talented actors as McKellan and Paquin if they must take a back seat to digital trickery and junior high school-caliber 'romance'?Alan Cumming makes a terrible Nightcrawler (I can do a better German accent - 'my name eez Kurt Vagner,' indeed!), and Halle Berry is once again a totally flat Storm.  Brian Cox makes a cheesy villain (his name is Striker, for goodness' sake!), and his human troops are so outmatched by the mutants that he never provides a credible threat.  In fact, the conflict is so imbalanced that I have to root for humanity - we're going to get our backsides kicked!On the plus side...well, I liked Jean Grey, and Magneto's escape, but they weren't worth the ten bucks.  Here's hoping that X3 gets its budget lowered, so it might turn out smarter than this soulless, cash-powered clunker.",3,5,11,7 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," B-list material disguised as an 'A' movie
","It's the movie event of the century...and I am completely unmoved! I didn't like the first two entries in the series, and I don't like this one. Right around the middle of the film, when I saw the tenth shot of a CGI soldier falling off of battlements and screaming, I realized that I was watching a farce - a big overblown video game more concerned with mindless action than telling a proper story. The character development is thin and far too sentimental, and even some of the effects are strangely flat - I didn't think Sauron really worked as an enormous spotlight, and Gollum should've been played by an actor in make-up (impressive as he is, he still looks unreal). The battle sequence is practically a re-hash of the fight from 'Two Towers,' and the Liv Tyler scenes are distinctly repetitive, too. Any of the dialogue that wasn't from the books stuck out like a sore thumb - the wince-inducing Gimli jokes, for example. Suffice to say, I'm looking forward to the day when the special effects in these films are surpassed, and everyone has to look deeper at their dramatic content - which is sadly lacking.",4,3,7,22 January 2004
A Night at the Roxbury," secretly wonderful
","I'm going out on a limb here.  I've just bombed 'Joe Dirt,' and now I'm going to do an about-face on modern comedies and argue that 'A Night at the Roxbury' is brilliant.  Most critics didn't see a distinction between these two bombs, but I do.Comedy oftentimes depends on suffering.  Comic protagonists always take a beating, and we either laugh with them, or at them, or maybe we laugh not at all because we couldn't care less.  The essential question is, are the protagonists of 'A Night at the Roxbury' lovable losers or just totally annoying dweebs who deserve all the grief they get? You know my answer already.  I love the Butabi brothers.  They have a strong fraternal bond, they're obsessed with Emilio Estevez, and they can't get any play.  What's not to love?  Dan Hedaya is great as the brothers' disgruntled dad, and Chazz Palminteri does a hilarious cameo as an entrepreneur obsessed with ass-grabbing. Richard Grieco demonstrates a remarkable sense of humor about himself by allowing the Butabis to build him up as a big celebrity, when the joke is obviously that he's a total has-been.  What a sport, eh?Nice song, too.  I like this stupid movie.  Really, I do.",8,137,157,22 June 2004
A Nightmare on Elm Street," in danger of becoming unfashionable
","This movie has not really aged gracefully.  It's a showcase for wooden actors, klutzy mechanical effects and silly genre cliches, and even if you dig the premise (which is definitely cool), you gotta admit that the execution is rather clumsy.Still, this is a refreshing change of pace from the smarmy and self-aware horror we get these days.  Craven's own 'Scream' thumbed its nose at the conventions of the horror genre and 'Buffy' followed suit, but for those of us who don't necessarily want horror to be a postmodern laugh-riot, a movie like the first 'Nightmare' has something to offer.  A proactive heroine, creepy dream segments, a menacing atmosphere (the one quality that excessive humor is sure to destroy), and a novelty appearance by Johnny Depp add up to decent entertainment.    In the final analysis, this is a superior example of teenage horror. But I still think that the best horror movies star adults (what's the appeal of seeing adolescents get hacked up, anyway?) and are treated in an adult way...anyone up for watching 'Curse of the Demon' instead?",Null,0,0,17 February 2004
The Matrix," mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched
","I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who ('The Deadly Assassin'). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.",4,9,20,10 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," a fun flick that spawned too many dire imitators
","Though I like 'Star Wars' in isolation, I'm angry about what it did to science fiction and to movies as a whole. Let's be honest; although this is great entertainment, it does lack depth and sensitivity. The characters are all archetypes: the roguish Han, the sagely Kenobi, the brash youngster Luke. And let's not forget Darth Vader ('Dark Invader'?), who seems to have stepped right out of a 1950s pulp magazine. I like these folks - I grew up with them - but fascinating people they ain't. The film only works because it plays to very basic emotions and themes. Luke wants to leave home and see the universe. The Empire is evil - just evil, who needs an explanation? And though there's hardware and technology on display everywhere, it's ultimately faith and spiritualism (in the form of the Force) that saves the day. It's a very positive flick, but what is really the message? If you have a moment of Zen in the cockpit of your X-Wing, you'll be able to guide your torpedoes right down the throat of that evil space station? Strange that this moment means so much to so many people.Don't get me wrong; I love good sci-fi. But I was actually raised on the more cerebral stuff - the sci-fi that discusses issues instead of wages wars. 'Star Wars' is firmly in the latter camp; it has great combat, but not great drama. And it has inspired so many feeble imitators (pick one, there's a million of them) and forced the advancement of special effects so far that movies have been forever changed, for the worse, because of it. After this, movies were all about faster paces and bigger bangs. The 1970s, a very meaningful decade for cinema, gave way to the shallow sci-fi spectacle of the 80s...and this is the movie that's responsible for that regrettable shift in emphasis.",7,2,4,8 October 2004
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," thin-blooded
","I grew up on the macho vampire tradition of Hammer horror films, which featured powerful and highly sexualized vampires who spent entire movies chasing women and wasting villagers without sparing a thought about the true nature of their cursed existence.  It was therefore a shock to me when I first encountered Ann Rice's bisexual, whiny bloodsuckers who seem to get no joy whatsoever out of being immortal, irresistible creatures of the night. In place of fun Hammer action, 'Interview with the Vampire' serves up a constant nasal whine from Louis.  This is a vampire movie for a depressed crowd; it oozes ennui and stagnancy.  The only characters with life are Lestat and Claudia, but most of the screen time goes to boring Brad Pitt and his problems.  There are really no human characters, nobody you can relate to...unless you think your life is like being a bored vampire.  Weird, sadistic, slow.  And the production style is already dated.",Null,6,11,9 July 2004
Sin City," Too much for me...
","I went to 'Sin City' expecting a slick film noir crackling with sharp dialogue and arresting black-and-white imagery. What I got was a monotonous slop of gore, fast cutting, cartoony action scenes, and lame one-liners that sound like Raymond Chandler's unused cast-offs. In other words, I wanted a Bogart movie, and what I got was a sicko movie. Tarantino and Rodriguez are, quite frankly, beginning to scare me.I like violent stuff when it's well-done. Really, I do. 'Night of the Living Dead' is a masterpiece. But that movie actually has proper characters and suspense and style. 'Sin City' doesn't pause long enough to have suspense, a meaningful scene, or even a meaningful moment. The male protagonists are all interchangeable - grizzled guys with a penchant for helping fallen women - and the villains are all equally repulsive and dull. There are so many scenes of violent revenge-taking that the whole thing becomes tedious; I was never satisfied by the 'payoffs' because I was never emotionally invested in the proceedings. The film is figuratively monotone, as well as literally.And, needless to say, the treatment of women is repulsive.Did I appreciate the style? Yeah, but it got old, like everything else. At the end of the day, this is nonsense. Come on - there's an evil guy who manages to regrow his penis, but it turns him yellow and rancid. That's not noir...that's not stylized...that's not interesting. It's gross and stupid. Like the whole movie, then.",3,8,16,1 April 2005
Donnie Darko," this one got past me
","Quite by coincidence, I watched this film back-to-back with 'Harvey.' 'Donnie Darko' was definitely the inferior giant rabbit movie.Every once in a while, a movie aimed at teenagers comes along that just completely zings past me.  And when I run to catch up with it, I find that it wasn't worth the effort.  This is that kind of movie.  I simply found the pacing too slow, and the message too obscure, to become really involved. Most of the pleasure I got out of this movie was in seeing good actors who have been out of circulation for a while.I'm not saying that this was terrible by any means - it's got a good atmosphere and a good build-up, but it poofs out at the end - rather like a big, clunky, plummeting, malfunctioning jet engine.",5,2,5,17 February 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'I should've mailed it to the Marx Brothers!'
","This is my favorite Indiana Jones movie, because it features great action, cool locations (ah...Venice!), and a highly interesting and amusing father-son relationship.Thanks to the presence of his dad, Indiana Jones becomes a much more well-rounded character in this film than he was in 'Raiders' and that clumsy disaster, 'The Temple of Doom.' Sean Connery gives a great performance as Henry Jones Sr.; he's a little camp and silly, but it works perfectly, especially since he's playing against his James Bond image.This movie also benefits from some great jokes, one of which I quoted in my summary line. Other hot ones include 'they don't come any closer than that!' and 'you call this archeology?' It's really a quite witty script. My only reservation about the humor is that Denholm Elliott's character becomes a little too dumb to be believed, but that's just a minor complaint.Some people criticize this film because it borrows too heavily from the formula of 'Raiders.' I can see their point, but I don't really agree. I think 'Last Crusade' refines the formula and improves it by adding more character development. Also, the ending of this movie is much more satisfying and thoughtful than the deus ex machina conclusion of 'Raiders.' Oh, and the Holy Grail is really the ultimate artifact - thanks to the King Arthur legend, I think it has even more resonance in our culture than the Ark.This is one of the last populist action movies that I really care about. It comes from a time when plots and dialogue were considered as important as special effects and spectacle. I guess you can blame Spielburg and Lucas for inspiring a lot of dumb imitators, but it's hard to criticize them when their actual work is so good.",9,0,1,30 December 2006
The Godfather," a strange choice for best movie (but sure beats LOTR)
","Hollywood has some strange politics.  Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops.  Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves.  And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow).  Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to 'The Godfather' because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs.  I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power.  I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of 'bestest picture ever.'I actually think 'The Godfather: Part II' is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the 'human' element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here.  And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with 'Star Wars,' mistakenly remembering Yoda and 'Luke, I am your father' as elements from the 'classic' first film).  Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.I prefer 'Donnie Brasco' because the character development is richer, and even 'A Bronx Tale' because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world).  But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day.",7,3,8,25 June 2004
