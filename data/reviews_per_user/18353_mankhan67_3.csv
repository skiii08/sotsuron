First Man," THE BIGGEST LIE EVER TOLD TO MANKIND
","Can anyone tell me here what is the distance between earth and space? It is 100 KM, means after travelling upwards to space, one may enter space just after 100 KM. Now second question what is the distance between Earth and Moon? it is 384,400 KM. Which mean after entering space the space shuttle or ship must have to travel another 384,300 KM. Is there anyone here dare to answer that in which science or rules of physics one may travel in space for 384,300 KM? Your answer shall resolve all the issues concerning making fool the whole world and mankind.",3,0,16,11 March 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Worst of all Spider-Man Series
","I am giving this movie 1/10. The worst of all spider-man series. Someone write that it should be called spider-kid and not a spider-man. There is no man here in this movie. This movie might be good for kids but not for mature audiences. I honestly cant figure out what was in the minds of makers of this movie? Tobey Maguire's spider-man were the best and he was 100% well suited for the series. Present spider-man is simply even shameful to watch this movie for an adult. Simply horrible, a bad spot on spider-man character.",1,6,10,18 October 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Total Disappointment
","I had the chance to see this movie with my daughter who is now married. I saw the really Disney animation with her while raising her may be a 100 times and we went to cinema with great hopes but came out of cinema with utmost disappointment. After all the best technology and available CGs, the movie did not have any grip to the real spirit of the animation made many years ago. I wish we would not have seen the movie and instead would have gone home and would have seen animation on my home theater.",1,8,16,22 May 2017
