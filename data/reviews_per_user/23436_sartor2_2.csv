Walk the Line," A very good movie all around!!!!!
","I was in college when Johnny Cash started being popular. I followed his career almost until he passed away. I bought his last cassette which had a very old favorite of mine >The One Rose< the only mistake is where he sings >Rosie, haunts me, makes me think of you < in the original written version by Lani McIntyre who wrote the song it goes like this >Rosies, haunt me , make me think of you......otherwise Johnnys version is still a haunting, one. I enjoyed the other songs as well, especially with Marty Dtuart playing backup instruments. The movie itself was very good, it dwelled on Johnnys drug problem quite well. Also the music was very, very good!!",9,0,0,9 May 2008
Remember the Titans," A great movie about high school football
","This movie is one of the best about high school football that i have seen. There is one slight error. When the Titans are returning from a game, Ronnie Bass (Sunshine) is seen wearing a Lettermans Jacket; Letter awards are not given until after the season is over..........The movie dealt about the problems that occurred in the south when athletic teams were integrated. One of the most poignant issues was how the team came together thru the football season including both coaches. Whatever differences that started with the schools integration were soon worked out by the athletes themselves. I think the saddest scenes is the graveyard scene where coaches, football players all come together as one.",10,1,2,15 May 2008
