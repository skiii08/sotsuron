Hereditary," Worst film in my life.
","Totally pointless, slow, nerve-racking.
Is this an art film, or what? And why were screende in cinemas? Everybody protects theirs own opinion, that movie is not a 'ghost - horror ' and not like nowadays horro as Insidious or something. And thats because this film is good? This is a totally bullcrap. I dont understand why get this film 7.3 point... I mean this is possible for just one way: because just degenerated people watched this and hyped this, and normal peoples dont want to see it again or rate it good and not rate. Joke. com ...Most wasted time of my life. My girlfriend told me, the 'Midsommar' is also a bullcrap...i dont want to watch that, beacuse i need to watch, so i can tell that this is a bullcrap too or not (i mean advance that is).When i saw Hereditary in cinema, all the people came out like: 'what the hell was that?' 'worst movie in my life' , and when i checked out the reviews on internet, everybody just prais the film...i dont understand.",1,1,2,16 April 2020
