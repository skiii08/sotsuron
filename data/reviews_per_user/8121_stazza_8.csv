Blade Runner 2049," Replicants don't have souls. Like this movie.
","LOVED the original, this one was just marginally okay. Lacked all the humane depth the original succeeded at. Without spoiling anything, I will say I felt the MAIN part of the plot SEEMED important, but only because some dialog TOLD you it was. They didn't show it or make you feel it at all, they just tell you how important it is. I guess it really isn't a spoiler because the trailer says, 'This breaks the world'. Yet over 2.5 hours I never felt anything remotely close to something getting that broken. Except they tell you its important. So, yeah, it's a movie like that. Personally, I'd rather be drawn in to the importance of the whole drive behind the plot, but that's just me.I recommend it to BR fans, of course, and anyone liking CGI SCI-FI eye candy. I had rated it a 6, but the more I ponder it, the weaker it becomes. Kind of the opposite of the original.And I should remove stars for expressionless Gosling. Because he does it again.",1,13,29,8 October 2017
Dunkirk," DUNKIRK: Now in 'MUMBLE-rama'!
","Fine movie, did what it advertised. Nice to watch. HORRIBLE to listen to. I have GREAT hearing, watch a ton of movies that sound fine, but Nolan's films often times have the DIALOG too low to hear or understand clearly. This is another case of that, and I wish someone on his team would find this and start to correct this issue. If Nolan is okaying the final mix, he needs to turn down that studios center channel, because it, apparently is not balanced like real movie theaters.Also, FYI, I first watched it in a huge, gold standard, 70mm, IMAX theater with like 24,000 watts of tuned audio. Thinking maybe because it was so loud that may affect the live listening, I then went to a top of the line digital XD theater, and guess what? STILL missed a couple of major lines of dialog explaining their situation. Why is this? It is 2017 and mixing audio is not new.I'm not alone. My friend attending with me also missed some dialog. Also, there is a post where people will MOVIE CHAT at an ORG that discusses this issue, and many others notice it.Watch the film and enjoy the presentation, but don't expect to understand all the dialog. Again. In another MumbleRama Nolan production. I'd given it a 10 because I enjoyoed it that much, but knocked it down one for the fail audio.",9,0,5,10 August 2017
2012," Perfectly Enjoyable
","There is nothing wrong with this movie. It is a perfectly good time. What you see is what you get. In my case, in was more enjoyable than I was expecting. I went for the large screen, hi-definition effects plus the theater sound of all the action. The plot was fine and about what you expect. I might even go again just so I can see more of the fun.Not sure why it gets such low ratings, but I feel it hit the exact niche it was aiming at. And is apparently interesting or fun to people since it took #1 in the box office.It's no life changing, thought provoking event, it is JUST a FICTIONAL movie with fun action and great effects. I'll be buying the Blu-Ray also.",8,0,4,17 November 2009
Avatar," There's just something disconnecting about computer graphics
","I wanted to really love this movie. Yes, it looks cool and has epic shots displaying the planet, and I've always loved Cameron's work but there is just something NON-CONNECTIVE about computer generated movies to me. There is no 'real' peril felt for a bunch of computer charchters and sometimes the characterizations feel souless. I do connect with well written characters, good acting and touching situations, but found very little of that here. The graphics are an amazing shell, but the egg is empty and flavorless. Again, I REALLY wanted to LOVE this movie, but it lacks things to 'love', other than the graphics. If the writing was shared with some very skilled writers, it could have been a 'game changer' but it's more about being interesting techincally, behind the scenes. I sense no real pull to go see it again and again, not like Star Wars, the Matrix and other similar movies. The visuals are a 10. The story maybe a 5 thus my rating of 7. Definitely go see this though. Why? Because it does LOOK FANTASTIC on a large screen in 3D. That part was worth the price of admission. just realize it is not emotionally equal to Titanic or Private Ryan etc",1,6,10,23 December 2009
La La Land," Should have love it, really didn't
","This is the type of music film I should be all over loving it, and wanting to watch it again and again. I enjoy many of the old school Hollywood music movies, and many of the newer ones as well. This film did nothing for me except make me check my watch.... over and over... in movie time, it felt like four hours to me. Songs felt shoe horned in, and unimportant and even forgettable. As an musician, and artistic dreamer that has touched fame myself, I should have connected with their dreams and goals and failures. I didn't. Again, just felt like it was cookie-cuttered together.I don't HATE this film at all, in fact, it is well made. The leads did great with their dance numbers, even if Ryan looked a little robotic by the numbers and the singing was too 'auto tuned'. Still, I've seen better, much better, and will not be watching this again. Just my opinion.Having recently watched 4 movies from the 50's/60's era, this felt like a pale imitation that WANTED to pay respects to those style films, but acted like cheap knock offs instead. Shocked it got all this praise, and that others don't see right trough it like I did.",1,5,10,7 May 2017
Kong: Skull Island," slogs along through generically fine effects
","with no more place to discuss a film like this, I guess I'll just post a review with 1 star to let people know this film does almost nothing. It just goes from point A to point B with lots of wiz-bang cartoon (CGI) creatures fighting, some people doing stuff, and none of it we really care about. If I was 10, the cartoon (CGI) parts might impress me, but as an adult, I just didn't care about any of it, have no interest in ever wasting time watching it again, and CERTAINLY DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. Seemed like just a money grab that was missing MOST of the King Kong stuff from previous versions. Disaappointed. Money Wasted.",1,35,72,27 March 2017
Annihilation," Kind of a 'TV' movie at best.
","People (shills?) toss out the term 'Masterpiece' far too easily these days. As seen in almost every review below mine. What qualifies THIS as a masterpiece? Nothing. The whole thing feels average at best, and I don't recommend it at all. And I love smart sci-fi. This had potential but traded it off for.... what, I don't even know. It's kind of a 'chick flick horror/sci-fi'. Was looking forward to this, WANTED to love it, fell flat. A couple sort of interesting sci-fi ideas, that went no where, and just kinda not much good as a movie. I thought the ARRIVAL was much more interesting.UPDATE: dropped rating to one star to counter act all the fake/paid 10 ratings",1,123,267,25 February 2018
Donnie Darko," Darko beats Blade Runner?
","How can Donnie Darko beat out Blade Runner in the scifi category? It is BARELY even a scifi at all. Listen to the director's commentary if you want to find out what the film is really about, as he explains each scene you can hear how that scene failed to deliver - thus needing it to be explained. The movie is watchable and filmed well but fails to deliver what it was really trying to - and that according to the directors own commentary. Although a 5 [1-10] on the watch-ability and production values, I gave it a 1 to correct the curve from fake reviews I am sure many of the votes and posts with glorious reviews are merely marketing plants, and that, sadly, really skews the ratings here at IMDb. Also checkout how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is #4 for all time best scifi? Even beating the Matrix? Anyone else notice this trend? I bet they hired a temp to sit around logging in fake email addresses and short 4 line raving reviews.",2,4,10,26 December 2004
