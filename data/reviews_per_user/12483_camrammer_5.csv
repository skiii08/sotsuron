The New World," Pure Art.
","Terrence Malick comes through to deliver a beautifully crafted story of John Smith and Pocahontas. With very unique divides between the environment of 'The Naturals' as well as Jamestown, simply hearing this movie can help you envision so much about the situation the film was engaged into. The camera work provided by Malick never seems to fail to become pure eye candy on the screen. Although sometimes finding me dumfounded, this film is an experience nevertheless. In fact, the sometimes confusing situations seems to be Malick's way of conveying the experience given to John Smith and Pocahontas alike, introducing many new engagements throughout the whole film.  The movie seems to demonstrate three very separate 'New Worlds' as given by the title. The first being the introduction of North America to the initial settlers, such as John Smith. While this is a very important aspect of the film, the world of Jamestown introduced to 'The Naturals' shows itself to create quite a conflict within the story, causing a fully-fledged war at a point in time. However, these are not the only two 'New Worlds' detailed within the film. When Pocahontas marries John Rolfe, she leaves with her uncle as well as many other individuals to England, in which a whole new experience is presented to her. Referring back to the sound design, there is an iconic seen in which bells can be heard and continuously become more and more overwhelming as the film progresses, telling a story within itself. To conclude, Terrence Malick comes to provide a truly amazing story that could only possibly be told in such a way by himself. The camerawork, sound design, and overall reactions and experiences displayed by the cast show a true work of art that deserves to be revered.",8,1,1,30 August 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Amazing... when I wasn't bored.
","'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is known as one of the greatest western movies throughout all of history, and many can argue in support of that statement. I can see how this title was given such reverence, as there are many points in the movie that left me in awe due to the creativity within this film that has influenced many westerns to date. However, there are just some things about this film that left me in awe... and not with a positive intent.It should be known that the film follows two main characters: Butch Cassidy (played by Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). These two are bank robbers that continue to be chased by police and law enforcement until the end of the film. While this does provide great sequences of action and entertainment, the whole chasing sequence that lasts around 20 minutes just seems so unnecessary. Finally, following the dive into the river by the two men, this sequence comes to an end. There is simply just ways to tell a story, especially a western, that doesn't leave me and my fellow classmates in my US History Through Film Class constantly looking at the clock, wondering why time is passing by so slowly.The music sequences in which the camera switches between multiple scenes (and even pictures) definitely intrigued me. Although some would argue that the Hill's implementation of a slide show is not the best move, I felt as if a story was told throughout that really didn't require a full, extended scene (Unfortunately, Hill didn't think this was needed for that damn chase scene).In conclusion, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is in no way a perfect film. However, when it comes to westerns, this definitely deserves a spot in the essentials, as it still provides an element of history that is subtly delivered throughout the plot. Despite scenes that left me snoring, this film did leave me on edge for the majority, and works well for both a great watching or napping experience based on your position.",7,1,3,23 October 2018
The Alamo," Should I feel guilty?
","On release it was met with disdain at worst, indifference at best, and now historically it stands as the second biggest box office failure. The pre-release word of mouth wasn't good, and with 'difficulties' of the financial and creative kind leading to Ron Howard leaving the directors chair-and Russell Crowe and Ethan Hawke dishing out roles for two of the main characters, the film has never had an equal footing from which to try and sell itself as a worthy epic. Yet if there is a western styled war film most likely to improve with age, then Hancock's Alamo is it. You see, in time it's hoped that people can embrace that this take on the Alamo legend thrives on humanistic depth, telling it not as a 'hooray' hero piece, but as it was, men doomed to die. And more pertinent, men who 'knew' that in all probability, they were waiting for death to come. Hancock should be roundly applauded for having the courage to craft such an honest depiction of the siege, and it's not as if we aren't warned about it, either in history as fact, or during the downbeat opening five minutes of film. So a film rich with in depth characterizations, then, but also a picture layered over with considerable technical skill. Hancock himself only really misfires by having a tacked on coda that shows Houston defeating Santa Anna and gaining his surrender. Who made the decision for this uplift I'm not sure, but it feels forced and doesn't have the impact intended. It would have been more telling and poignant to just have a title card flash up to tell us that Houston defeated Santa Ann in 18 minutes. We don't need to see a hurried recreation, the somber mood needed to be kept up right to the last end credit rolled. For that's the true pain of The Battle of the Alamo. In other words, if you're movie is more depressing than a funeral, don't try to cheer someone up with a 5-minute scene.And now returning to the present day. As watching this from my 'US History through FIlm' class, I think to myself, 'Should I feel guilty?' I believe I shouldn't, but there's a constant voice in my mind asking me why not... how my American ancestors are responsible for making this happen. However, I then remind myself that I'm supposed to be an arrogant teenager, so I try to forget any problems that exist in our society. Anyway, I'm getting off track, so I'll return to the review. Although 'The Alamo' has several flaws, it is still a movie worth the watch, and will help educate many individuals on the great, dire battle that lacked meaning in all ways. This movie: 7/10 The battle this movie is based on: 0.00001/10",7,0,1,9 October 2018
Wonder Woman," A World Wonder.
","'Wonder Woman' director Patty Jenkins succeeded in hitting all key points in this film. The emotion, direction, and storytelling aspect of this intense, WWI-based film. Yes, this isn't necessarily the most accurate when referring to the actions within World War I, but it finds great ways to relate events within the story with events in real life, such as the battle within No Man's Land.The gender role switch is also a great element of this movie. Yes, in current times, superhero movies don't necessarily have a female protagonist, but this is also reflected in the time period, with Diana being noted multiple times of her malpropism involving elements especially surrounding her appearance. It does, however, display a great deal of the commotion of the world during the war, with multiple scenes showing struggle and conflict.Overall, 'Wonder Woman' is a film that shows anything from love to pure struggle. It's a great film that covers all the bases that should happen within a superhero movie. I would say my rating is still generous, however this is easily a 24,000/10 for a DC movie in the past 5 years. If I see another great movie like this from the company, I might consider subscribing to DC Universe.",9,5,7,7 December 2018
Cinderella Man," Undoubtedly Stellar.
","'Cinderella Man' follows a venture by James J. Braddock, a popular boxer within the 1920's. However, his title is diminished following the start of the Great Depression, and the story follows the struggles he and his family face within the 1930's. This film is absolutely magnificent, and is a thrill to watch over and over again.The Great Depression within America was nothing short of a catastrophe. It is described by several as the worst war the United States has ever fought, and left many to fend for themselves and even starve. The severity of the situation is greatly portrayed through the story of 'Cinderella Man.' Braddock himself goes through several challenges throughout this period, one being trying to keep his head above debt by working at the docks. All of these personal struggles within Braddock's life helps with the relative and personal aspect of the Great Depression, and really provides an aided eye to the viewer when trying to understand the time period.This piece is more than extravagant, and gets more praise simply by providing an unbelievable amount of depth than just the life of a boxer. It expands upon the socioeconomic issues of the time, and helps viewers further understand the kinds of struggles that were faced within the Great Depression. It is a rare occurrence for director Ron Howard to fail in covering all bases within effective storytelling, and this film stands as one of his triumphs, continuing to knock out the competition for decade to come.",10,1,1,4 December 2018
