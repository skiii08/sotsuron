Hereditary," Save your money
","Honestly one of the worst films I've ever watched. I don't even know where to start with explaining why it was so bad. Firstly it felt like it went on for 17 hours. Secondly I came out of it still not quite sure what had just happened. It wasn't in the slightest bit scary, I felt like I needed a masters degree to understand the 'supernatural' element of this film and it wasn't explained well, just a lot of gasps and 'oh god' when the characters worked something out that was still a mystery to me. The only positive was that the acting was very good but I don't go to the cinema to see good acting, I go to see a good film and this is certainly not one of those. Don't bother",1,4,9,28 June 2018
