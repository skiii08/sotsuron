Hereditary," Masterclass in Horror
","It's really a shame that people who are too lazy and desensitized to appreciate this film gave it negative reviews. The fact that anyone would rate this movie any less than a 9/10 is despicable to me. This film was an absolute masterclass in it's genre. From the opening scene you will feel a tremendous level of discomfort and apprehension that only intensifies as the movie goes on. The performances by all those involved are excellent. No jump scares, no unbelievable characters, no exaggeration of blood and guts. This film is exactly what horror should be: terrifying. A movie that will sit with you well after you leave the theater.",10,20,36,12 June 2018
