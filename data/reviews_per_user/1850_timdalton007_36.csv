The Rock," Visually Striking, Intelligently Plotted Action
","The name Michael Bay and the phrase 'great film' don't often appear together. Bay has proven with films such as Armageddon and the Transformers franchise to be the poster child of the current Hollywood 'wham-bam-thank you ma'am!' style of filmmaking. That is to say, the kind of filmmaking that emphasizes style over substance. And yet, back in the mid-1990s, Bay got the mix right for one film. That film was The Rock. Part of which is down to the film's cast and, in particular, its trio of lead actors. Sean Connery was having something of a comeback in the 1990s, and the film is a prime example of that. He exudes presence from his first scene nearly a half-hour into the film (despite his top billing) right up to his final shot. Whether he's making quips ala James Bond (perhaps appropriately enough as his character of Mason is a former British agent) or taking on antagonists half his age while being a reluctant father figure to Nicholas Cage's character, Connery is watchable throughout. As are the other two members of the leading trio. The Rock seems to be the film that established Nicholas Cage as a bit of an action star, and it is here that his quirky but reluctant hero persona works best. That might be down to how well the thrown together relationship between his character of FBI chemical weapons specialist Goodspeed and Connery's Mason works. Rounding out the trio is Ed Harris' villain, Marine Corp Brigadier General Frank Hummel, the proverbial 'good soldier' gone bad. What's fantastic about Harris' performance is that Hummel is in many ways sympathetic, a commanding officer who has seen too many men fight and die for their country without recognition. What he's after isn't some madcap take over the world scheme but a desperate, last-ditch attempt to have his men recognized but going about in a way that can only end tragically. Harris brings all these elements out in his performance, rounding off the lead cast with an underrated villain.The supporting cast is strong as well, often featuring character actors. There's the late John Spencer, on the eve of success in The West Wing (a series created by uncredited Rock scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin), as the FBI director reluctant to bring an imprisoned Mason out into the world again but forced to watch as events unfold. William Forsythe and Michael Biehn both come across well in their roles as the FBI special-agent-in-charge and as the leader of a Navy SEAL team sent in alongside Mason and Goodspeed. The highlights of the supporting cast though lie in the men occupying the former prison alongside Harris' general from David Morse as his second in command Major Baxter as well as Tony Todd and Gregory Sporleder in stand out supporting roles where they offer a considerable amount of menace. They are just a few highlights from a strong cast.Being a Bay film, it's a visually stunning action film. From the stealing of the nerve gas by Hummel's Marines to a destructive car chase across San Francisco, the film's first hour showcases kinetic action sequences alongside its exposition to keeps the viewer's attention glued to the screen. Once the film gets Mason and Goodspeed to Alcatraz in its second half, the film becomes a set of running battles involving the duo against the Marines. And yet, Bay proves he is just as capable of handling somber pieces such as the military funeral that helps form the opening credit sequence or the quieter scenes with Connery. Bay's direction, the cinematography of John Schwartzman, and the editing of Richard Francis-Bruce make The Rock an action spectacle.One with a difference, however. What separates this film from virtually everything Bay has directed to date (and his many imitators) is its script. The Rock is an intelligently plotted thrill ride full of intriguing characters and plot twists from its well-realized lead characters to its conclusion with all the complications that ensue. It also helps that the film is full of witty dialogue from Mason's quips to many of the exchanges between Mason and Goodspeed. In a way, that the script is so good is a surprise given that a team of writers worked on it from the three credited writers (David Weisberg, Douglas S. Cook, and Mark Rosner) to uncredited contributions from Aaron Sorkin in addition to favored Connery script doctors Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement. The result, however, is a better-written action flick than one might expect and the one example I can think of many hands producing a superb script.The Rock then stands as perhaps the single best thing to come out of Bay's directorial career. It was here that he found the right recipe between casting, action, spectacle, humor, and plot. Maybe that's why, more than twenty years later, the film holds up as one of the best action films of the 1990s, as thrilling now as it was then.",9,2,2,27 July 2018
The King's Speech," The Reluctant King And The Speech Therapist
","History has long served as an inspiration for filmmakers. This is especially true of story's from the past that serve to inspire. Director Tom Hooper's new film The King's Speech, with its tale of a reluctant king trying to over come a speech impediment with the help of an unorthodox speech therapist, is a perfect example of just such a tale. It is more then just an inspiring story though in that it is also a fine example of the art of film-making.There's the performances of the two lead actors, Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as his speech therapist Lionel Logue respectively, for example. Firth brings King George VI, known as 'Bertie' by those closest to him, to life as a man who has struggled all his life to overcome his stutter only be to thrust into a role he hoped he'd never have to take. The role is a perfect place for Firth to show off his range from the almost comedic exercises to overcome the stutter to his occasional bad temper. Firth's best moments in the film comes in the scene where he talks to Logue about his childhood in a scene that is so heartbreaking that it threatens to reduce a viewer to tears and in the climatic speech as Britain enters the Second World War. Rush plays Logue as a man of seemingly infinite faith in his patient and who must overcome the skepticism of all those around to help George VI. Like Firth, the film gives Rush a chance to show off much of his range in the process. Watching the film, it is not hard to see why both have received well deserved Oscar nominations.Both Firth and Rush are backed by a fine supporting cast. Leading it is Helena Bonham Carter, herself receiving a much deserved Oscar nomination as George VI's wife Elizabeth who becomes his greatest supporter not only once he becomes King but in his battle to overcome the stutter. Guy Pearce plays George VI's charismatic and much loved older brother Edward VIII who eventually abdicates the throne for American divorc√©e Wallis Simpson (played by Eve Best). Much of the supporting cast is made of up of actors and actresses who makes the most out of otherwise small roles. These include Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Michael Gambon as King George V, Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife Myrtle, the aforementioned Eve Best and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. Overall the supporting cast of The King's Speech does what any fine supporting cast does: support the lead actors and stand out in their own right.The film's production values are just as fine as its cast. Director Tom Hooper has made something of a career in expertly bring the past to life and this film is no exception. The production design Eve Stewart brilliantly recreates the numerous 1920s and 1930s settings of the film to the point I suspect that only an expert would know the difference between real locations and film sets. Much the same can be said of the costume design work of Jenny Beavan which helps to believably bring the character's to life with the actor's help. The cinematography by Danny Cohen, while perhaps a bit too dark in places, serves the film well. In particular there are moments when the cinematography, combined with the editing of Tariq Anwar and Hooper's direction, even gives the viewer a sense of what George VI's nervousness must have felt like when trying to publicly speak with his stutter. The result is a film that is as visual engrossing as the performances within it.Last but not least is the script by David Seidler. Seidler's script takes a little known story about a member of the British royal family and turns it into a drama that is both engrossing and inspiring. Seidler also sprinkles the drama with little touches of humor throughout that helps to illuminate the fact that these figures from the past were all also flesh and blood human beings. That said the film (and by extension its script) is not 100% historically accurate, though it doesn't claim to be. In particular, the film's treatment of Edward VIII and his abdication are a bit off. This is especially true of a scene with Edward being perhaps a bit too antagonistic towards his brother and where the future Queen Elizabeth mentions a rumor of Wallis Simpson having learned 'skills' while in Shanghai (a rumor that has long since been proved untrue). The film also seems to give the impression that Churchill strongly supported the abdication (where as in in real life he seems to have done everything in his power to avoid it). One charge leveled at the film I disagree with is how it supposedly glances over Edward VIII's apparent Nazi sympathizing which certainly does not seem to be the case upon watching the film. For the most part though the film stays true to known history and is at its best doing so.From the fine performances of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush to the fine supporting cast apparent throughout, to the as equally splendid production values and the script by David Seidler, The King's Speech presents an engrossing and inspirational true story. It is a tale of a reluctant king trying to overcome a speech impediment that threatened to ruin him and the man whose unorthodox methods helped him on the path to doing so. It is also a fine example of film-making, and the ability of film-makers to bring the past back to life, as well.",9,0,1,5 February 2011
Frost_Nixon," Howard's Best Film Since A Beautiful Mind
","Real life has proven time and again to be a fertile ground for the creative. The career of filmmaker Ron Howard is no exception with such films as Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind being among the most successful and acclaimed of his career. There's also Frost/Nixon, his 2008 film based on Peter Morgan's successful stage play. While not as financially successful as those earlier works, it is every bit a choice piece of filmmaking.That it is so is something owed, in large part, to the pedigree of its script. Morgan not only scripted the original stage play but its screen counterpart and it is something that shows. Comparing his original text with the film, it becomes even more clear how faithful of an adaptation Howard gives viewers. The dialogue is all there, expanded upon in places, and the director isn't afraid to 'open up the play,' that is to broaden it for what the screen is capable of presenting versus the stage. It can sometimes be the kiss of death to do so, but Frost/Nixon stands as an example of how to do it and do it right.Perhaps that is down to Howard and his production team understanding what the story they're telling is. The director described the film in special features on its home video release as 'a thinking person's Rocky,' and that is a solid description of it. Frost/Nixon is ultimately a power struggle between its two titular characters, both men down and out in their way and trying to clamber back up their respective ladders. It's interesting that in the 'documentary' segments of the film, where the chorus aspects of the original play are utilized and expanded upon, don't feature either of the leads. The film is an intellectual boxing match between those men, the four interview sessions becoming rounds in the sport between them, that final session where Frost can ask questions about Watergate becoming the all-important moment. Along the way, the film raises questions about the intersection of politics, celebrity, media, and our perceptions of reality, something which makes the film perhaps even more relevant a decade after its initial release.The film has another Howard trademark: the ensemble cast. Leading it in the eponymous roles are the two actors who created the characters on stage: Frank Langella as Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen as David Frost. Nixon has been portrayed on screen many times and in many different ways but Langella's take on the still controversial 37th American President ranks with Anthony Hopkins as among the best screen presentations of him. Langella captures, despite being considerably taller and broader than the real man, the sense of Nixon the introvert. That here is a shy, sweaty, insecure man who has thrust himself into the public eye and is doing so once more because he knows not what else to do with himself. Further, Langella's Nixon is a man who would prefer not to be looking back into his past but who is forced to do so, perhaps subconsciously driving himself to face his demons in front of a massive television audience. It's an immensely watchable, engaging performance and it remains a shame Langella did not win the Oscar for it.That is not to diminish Michael Sheen in the role of David Frost, the oft-overlooked half of the titular duo. Sheen as Frost is everything that Langella's Nixon is not: handsome, well dressed, a ladies man, and pushing himself into the public eye because it's what he does. Frost is an entertainer whose drug is adulation and ratings with him seeing the Nixon interviews as a chance to try and make it big in America. In doing so, like any gambler, he is putting a lot on the line to the point of risking outright failure. But while he may not have started on this path with the noblest of intentions, Sheen's performance makes it clear that Frost realizes he's placed himself on a mission that he must succeed at and not just for his own sake. Sheen's performance is every bit as gripping as his co-star's and one of the best of his career to date.Backing the pair is the rest of an ensemble cast assembled by Howard. Keeping up the boxing analogy, they can almost be divided up into teams for the lead characters. On the Frost side, there's Matthew Macfadyen as British producer John Birt in an understated role with Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell as the researchers brought in with Rockwell Jim Reston being almost a voice of conscience for Frost. An extension of Frost's team is Rebecca Hall in the role of Caroline Cushing, the charming British socialite who gets drawn into events and manages to about charm everyone she meets. On the Nixon side, Kevin Bacon plays Nixon's chief of staff Jack Brennan in a part that sees the actor slide into solid character actor territory and the ever dependable Toby Jones as Nixon's agent Swifty Lazar. Add on Howard regulars such as his brother Clint in addition to cameos from Googy Gress, Marc McClure, and Joe Spano and the result is as steadfast a cast as you're likely to get in one of his films. One which brings the events the film depicts to life superbly.Ably backing both Howard and his cast is his behind the scenes team. The challenges of a film like Frost/Nixon is to recreate the past both faithfully but also in a cinematic fashion. All involved do so nicely with particular attention to detail played to the house used in the actual interview. Elsewhere, production designer Michael Corenblith and costume designer Daniel Orlandi create a vision of the 1970s that is at once believable but also cinematically pleasing to the eye. The latter down in part to the excellent cinematography of Salvatore Totino with an almost fly on the wall approach to much of the proceedings. The sparse but effective score from Hans Zimmer is the icing on the cake, with all of these elements helping bring the film to life beautifully.The result? Howard's best film since A Beautiful Mind at the start of the decade and one he still has not topped. More that, it stands as a superb example of how to take a successful stage play and bring it to life on film. It also tells a story that remains, perhaps surprisingly given its subject matter is more than four decades in the past, relevant to the here and now. That speaks to the power of both Morgan's script and Howard's skills as a filmmaker.",10,0,0,3 February 2019
Skyfall," Welcome Back, 007
","After the lukewarm reception that Quantum of Solace received in 2008, the direction of where the James Bond films would go next was uncertain. That uncertainty was worsened when MGM found itself going into bankruptcy, delaying another film by years. The series though would rebound and a new Bond film was to be out in time for the series' fiftieth anniversary. Would this anniversary film, and twenty-third entry, be able to bring the series back on track? The Craig era of Bond has been about developing Bond as a character and this film goes far in that direction. Taking cues from latter Ian Fleming Bond novels, Skyfall does exactly that. Craig's Bond in particular seems well suited to this as we see a Bond who, after being left for dead after a mission, eventually finds that he must return to MI6 and rediscover who he is again. The film also sees some humor come into the character as well and Craig for the most part handles it well. If Casino Royale was Craig's debut as Bond, then this is the film where he slides into the role of experienced agent.The film's two female leads are quite interesting. Naomie Harris as Eve is an interesting, if flawed character though the character due to her lack of chemistry with Craig and being perhaps just a bit old for the whole 'junior agent' idea to be believable. The other is B√©r√©nice Marlohe as S√©v√©rine who fits much more into the traditional role of the Bond female lead yet is also given some interesting space to develop as well. While neither is perfect, both are memorable and serve the film well.Last but not least is Javier Bardem as the villainous Raoul Silva. From the moment the character is introduced in what seems to be a long single take, it's clear this is a villain quite different from what we've encountered before in Bond. While he does arguably have echoes of a couple of previous Bond villains as well as the Joker from The Dark Knight, Silva is more than just another madman. He's a compelling figure and a villain that, for the first time in a while, rightfully fights with Bond for your attention whenever he's on screen. There's also a feeling of discomfort that exudes from the character as well, especially in his first and last scenes. The result is perhaps the most compelling Bond villain in some time.The film also features a strong supporting cast. Returning yet again is Judi Dench as M, getting her largest time in the role here. The film makes good use of her talents and takes the character away from being a stuck behind the desk bureaucrat and makes her a vital part of the film. There are also fine performances from Ralph Fiennes as Mallory, Ben Whishaw's excellent debut as Q, Rory Kinnear as Tanner and an excellent appearance by Albert Finney as Kincade. The result is one of the strongest casts yet put together for a Bond film.The film also heralds some impressive action sequences. From the opening sequence in Istanbul, the film takes its viewers on a journey around the world from fights in Shanghai to a chase below and on the London streets to a final climatic battle that seems reminiscent of the finales of the classic Bond films of the 1960s yet also incredibly different from them at the same time. The sequences are all well done and are perhaps the most impressive yet seen in the Craig era.For all of its impressive action sequences, Skyfall feels like that it is as much a drama as it is an action film. Skyfall explores questions of age and legacy, perhaps appropriately for a film series celebrating its fiftieth birthday. These range from questions about Bond's fitness to be a double-o to M's own suitability as head of MI6 to the secrets of both of their pasts which come into play as the film goes on. While the middle part of the film in London echoes The Dark Knight quite heavily (and indeed uses the nearly identical 'he wanted us to catch him' line as well), the film works well at bringing together both the action scenes and the dramatic scenes to create a coherent story (and a great improvement over its immediate predecessor). Add on some nice references to the series' own legacy (including the much welcomed return of a character missing from the Craig era as well as icon of the series dating back to almost its beginning) and the result is fantastic all around.So how does Skyfall stand up as both the fiftieth birthday film and as a Bond film in general? It celebrates the legacy of the series by using the plot to ask its relevance in the modern world and ultimately saying that Bond (and the series by default) does indeed. As a Bond film it pushes the boundaries of mixing action with the dramatic in a way not really seen in the series before now. On both counts then, Skyfall succeeds and does so fantastically.",9,2,10,28 November 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," When A Good Premise Goes Astray
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter seemed destined to be a good film. It was based on a New York Times bestseller with a fantastic central idea that wonderfully blended real history with the supernatural. It seemed even more so since the writer behind the novel was adapting it for the screen. Yet as a film, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter seems to be lacking what made its book counterpart so good.Before delving into the main problem with the film, let's look at the casting. At first, most of the casting works especially Benjamin Walker's Abraham Lincoln and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Mary Todd both of whom do well. It's when the characters age that they run into trouble. Be it the laughable makeup to age them up or their performances I'm not sure, but what I am sure of is that the two of them are utterly unconvincing once the film makes its jump to Lincoln being elected and heads towards its conclusion. More successful are Dominic Cooper as Lincoln's vampire hunting mentor Henry Sturges and Rufus Sewell as the over the top vampire villain Adam. There is one character that is ill served by the film which is Anthony Mackie's Will Johnson but more on him later. The cast overall then is good for the most part, if a bit off after a point.The production values are mixed as well. Between the production design Fran√ßois Audouy and the cinematography of Caleb Deschanel, the film looks rather good. Audouy's sets do fairly convincing takes on early to mid-1800s America but while Deschanel's cinematography gives the film a polished and sleek look. Sadly other parts of the film don't hold up as well, especially the frequent and mainly unconvincing CGI work that hampers two of the films biggest action sequences. The film is also hurt to a certain extent by its editing which causes sections of the film (including action sequences shockingly) to drag. The results are mixed at best.Where the film really lacks though is in the script. Seth Grahame-Smith adapted his own novel into the script but frankly it could have been anyone. While initially faithful for the most part (if only in its broad strokes), the film diverges more and more as it goes on often to its detriment (there's a plot twist later in the film involving one of the character's that is revealed immediately upon that character's introduction in the novel). After Lincoln becomes President though, Grahame-Smith seems to have thrown out his own book for the most part, especially in the transparently obvious and over the top climax to the film. It also doesn't help the film that there's a new and completely unnecessary character (Anthony Mackie's Will Johnson) crudely inserted into it, something that hurts both the actor's performance and the film as a whole. One of the novel's pluses was that it blended fact and fiction into what was 'plausible' while the film (and shockingly the writer of both) seem to have forgotten that. The result is a cool premise (and a good book) that is torn to shreds for reasons that aren't quite clear.Ultimately, the film version of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a disappointment. It forgets what made the book work so well and tries to bury it under an ill-fitting action move skin and casting that initially works and then doesn't. If you've read the book, skip the movie. If you haven't read the book, go read it. As a wise man once said: 'The book is much better.'",4,0,2,12 December 2012
Star Trek," May This New Trek Live Long And Prosper
","Let me say up front I am not a die-hard Star Trek fan. I did grow up watching original series re-runs, the tapes of the movies, I've seen episodes from the spin-off shows and I've read some of the novels here and there so I've got a good working knowledge of the show. Having assumed that Star trek was dead after the lack-luster Nemesis and the cancellation of Enterprise (a show that remains underrated in my opinion) I was rather surprised over a year ago when the teaser trailer for this movie popped up before Cloverfield announcing that J.J. Abrams was bringing it back. Having raised my expectations since then I went to a screening last night with hopes for a good Star Trek movie. That in short was what I got and more.To start off with there's the cast. It's never an easy task replacing a well known cast with a new group of actors especially when the cast in question is those of the original Star Trek series but not only has this film done it has done well. I was initially skeptical of Chris Pine as Kirk but Pine not only fills the rather large shoes left before him but fills them admirably and by the end of the movie you have no doubt that he is Captain James T Kirk. In truth that statement can really be applied to the entire cast of 'new' old characters but in particular it can be said of Zachary Quinto as Spock and Simon Pegg as Scotty as both fill some rather large shoes very nicely indeed. There's also a nice (if underused) villain in the form of Eric Bana as Nero plus a fantastic supporting cast including the ever excellent Bruce Greenwood plus Ben Cross and a woefully underused Winona Ryder as Spock's parents. And then there's the return of Leonard Nimoy to the role that made him famous in some of the best and most unexpected scenes of the movie. In short it's one of the best Star Trek casts.This has also got some really good production values. The set designs have echoes from the original series but give a nice modern feel to them and this is especially true of the bridge of the Enterprise itself. The film's CGI is (in two words I use very infrequently) awe-inspiring especially when it comes to the various ships sued in the film but especially of the Enterprise which looks like a perfect meshing of both the original TV series ship and the one used in the original series cast movies. In fact if one can find nothing else to say about this film it is that it has the best special effects in the history of Star Trek to date.The film is an action film with a good story. From the opening teaser sequence right thru to the end the film is full of space battles, sword fights and fist fights. The fights are all well staged and put similar sequences in the two most recent Trek films to shame. The space battles, thanks to the excellent CGI mentioned above, also come across as the best yet done for Star Trek as whole. Yet while this might be an action film it hasn't lost what makes Star Trek so good to begin with: story. In what can be called increasingly rare in the Hollywood action movie the writers actually take the time to explore character development. In fact it is the journey of these two young men whose destines has always been intertwined that forms the emotional center of this movie. That really brings us to the Nimoy scenes and the sticky issue of continuity.As I said I'm not a die-hard Trek fan so continuity doesn't really bother me in this case but I know it bothers some out there so let me say the following. While this film features the original group of characters from the original series they're different versions of them. This is thanks to one of the tried and true plot devices of Star Trek: time travel and interference with the past. That said the interference causes a lot of changes from the subtle to moments where I can see some going 'blasphemy on the alter of Roddenberry!' In particular there's two plot points (one of them being a relationship) which might do that but for those of us who realize (as the movie itself says) that the past has been altered and this is a new time-line it shouldn't be anything too upsetting and if fact it makes for some fascinating viewing. The film is also full of nice little references to various Trek stories of the past especially the best of the Trek films The Wrath of Khan. The scenes with Nimoy (including the most impressive Vulcan mind meld I've ever seen) illustrate this point beautifully: this is the end of the beginning and the start of a whole new Trek.Another aspect that brings the point of this being both an ending and a new beginning is the score by Michael Giacchino. Star Trek has always been known for some nice film score and this film is no exception to the rule. The score is bombastic when it needs to be and personal when it needs to be. Giacchino also makes very sparing use of the classic Star Trek theme itself until the end credits to let the audience know for certain that while things might have changed this is still Star Trek.If this new Star Trek movie is any indication there's a life for this little TV series after all. With a fine cast, well designed sets, fantastic CGI work, well staged action, nice scripting and good music I can say one thing for certain. If this is the future of Star Trek then may this new Trek live long and prosper.",9,8,20,8 May 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Going Rogue And Loving It
","Who would have thought we would see the day where we would get two Star Wars film within a year of one another? Though Rogue One, given the subtitle of 'A Star Wars Story' couldn't be more different from The Force Awakens released in 2015. Though it is a prequel to the original 1977 film ('prequel' being a word likely to strike terror into the heart of even the most casual Star Wars fans after two of the three films in that ill-regarded trilogy), Rogue One couldn't be more different that what has come before in terms of what we've had from the series on the big screen thus far.Which isn't to say that it not quite being what one might expect is a bad thing, quite to the contrary in fact. Unlike The Force Awakens which worked so well in part because of its playing into nostalgia, Rogue One subverts that. To be fair, the entire premise of the film is rooted in the same elements of nostalgia as that film. Instead of taking familiar elements and story beats, Rogue One builds on references (well the entire opening scroll of A New Hope to be fair) to create a prequel to that all important 1977 film, telling the story of the race to steal the plans to the Death Star. That being said, if you're expecting a puff piece though, you're in for a surprise.Rogue One takes the familiar elements and uses it to tell something bolder. This is a grittier, much more 'lived in' version of the Star Wars universe than certainly I, as something of a casual fan of Star Wars, has been used to seeing. It's a film that explores what it's like to be the rebels fighting on the front line of the struggle against the all power Empire and what it's like for some on the inside of the Empire's biggest weapons project. There are hard choices to be made on both sides, internal power struggles, and people who just want to get on with their lives without getting involved. In a way, Rogue One is a Star Wars take on the Second World War commando genre with teams behind enemy lines trying to sabotage an all important enemy project, albeit one in a science fiction context and with some more depth to it. If you're one of those people like myself slightly put off by the black and white nature of previous Star Wars film, then this is the film for you as puts some much needed shades of gray into the equation along the way. Yet this is definitely a Star Wars film. One of the most impressive things about this film is how it takes a few details and turns it into a fully formed two hour story that really, if one thinks about it for more than a moment, really exists to fill in a major plot hole from nearly forty years ago. Yet you would likely never think that watching the film as it presents a highly engaging story in its own right. Not only that but there are Easter eggs and references throughout but not enough to alienate anyone who isn't the most die- hard Star Wars fan including a couple of cameos that will likely come as a surprise if they haven't been spoiled for you already. It's a Star Wars story quite unlike any other as a result.In telling this story, director Gareth Edwards has assembled quite a cast. Felicity Jones cements herself as an up and coming leading lady with her role as Jyn Erso, a role that is at times written all over the place but made all the more effective by Jones' skills as an actress. Diego Luna's rebel intelligence officer fills in the Han Solo role in effect, something Luna does well by bringing a world weariness (or should I say galaxy?) to the part. They are aided by Alan Tudyk in a memorable droid role plus both Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen in interesting supporting roles. Playing the role of chief villain for this film is Ben Mendelsohn as Krennic who while not on the level of a Darth Vadar comes across as a genuine threat due to his position and his experiences dealing with his project. Mads Mikkelsen gets a memorable supporting role here a scientist who plays an all important role in proceedings, one that leaves him conflicted and torn by his experiences plus Forest Whitaker gets a small but pivotal role in proceedings as well in a memorable series of appearances. The supporting cast is solid as well with several Star Wars veterans returning to their roles from other films in the franchise plus some unused footage and some very skillfully done effects work in a couple of cases. The results are solid all around. It's hard then not to recommend seeing Rogue One. It's an entertaining and engaging piece of science fiction action/adventure that takes one of the most black and white tales out there and not only fills in some details but gives it some much needed shades of gray as well. It's perhaps too different to be the best Star Wars film but it may well be someone's new favorite film from the series and, if nothing else, it finally proves that the words 'Star Wars' and 'prequel' might go together after all.",8,6,11,22 December 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Looking To The Past While Boldly Going Forward
","Following on the successful reboot of Star Trek in 2009, the question was where the series would go next. After four years of waiting the answer has finally arrived with Star Trek Into Darkness. So how does this new film stand up? The film's cast is strong, especially with its supporting cast. If 2009's film established the new versions of Kirk, Spock, McCoy etc. than this is the film that cements them. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in particular are given the chance to go further in their roles of Kirk and Spock and their sometimes fractious friendship. Most of the main Enterprise crew is put to go use as well including Zoe Saldana as Uhura and Simon Pegg's Scotty who is given a much welcomed larger role in this film. There's a strong supporting cast including Bruce Greenwood's welcome return as Admiral Pike, Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus and Alice Eve as Carol as well as those in smaller roles such as Noel Clarke who has a small but pivotal role early in the film. The real star of the film though isn't any of them.That would be Benedict Cumberbatch as the film's villain. With him the film brings us the most fleshed out Trek villain we've had in some time which, given who it turns out to be, might not come as a surprise. What is a surprise is that Cumberbatch brings to this villain something that villains of any type are so often lacking of: unpredictability. Cumberbatch is anything but predictable in his choices as he goes from what the publicity has called 'a one man weapon of mass destruction' to the point of even managing to get the audience's sympathy at one point. While the film as a whole works, it shines at its brightest when Cumberbatch is on screen.Though it doesn't have the galaxy hopping locations of its immediate predecessor, Into Darkness is blessed with some strong production values. The mainly earthbound locations of 23rd century London and San Francisco are well realized with their mix of iconic locations of the past and modern day with more futuristic architecture. The film also gives us our first glimpse of the alternate universe Klingons, who are used sparingly, and their homeworld of Kronos. The film is also dependent upon CGI for much of its special effects and the film has its share of impressive moments involving the Enterprise in all its glory that really need to be seen on the big screen to be truly appreciated. While it may lack some of the scale of the preceding film, it is nevertheless an impressive piece of work from a visual stand point.Then there's the script. Star Trek in the past has proved that it can be at its best when focusing on its characters and by reflecting our present day world into its futuristic setting and Into Darkness does both. As mentioned earlier, the film develops the friendship between Kirk and Spock along with the friendships and relationships between them and the other crew members of the Enterprise. Like Star Trek VI reflected upon the end of the Cold War, Into Darkness reflects the post-9/11 world into Star Trek's 23rd century setting, something which there has been some talk about elsewhere. As part of the background that makes the films plot, it works quite well though I can't help but wonder if the point of it has been lost on some (Does the film's villain secretly being used to help in a Cold War style situation against the Klingons before turning against his former ally and giving its militaristic elements the context for a war sound familiar to anyone?). If you notice that it adds an extra layer to the film but if you don't notice it then it is just part of plot and you can enjoy it anyways.The film also continues the trend set by its predecessor of making use of already existing elements from the Trek universe. They range from possibly obscure references to characters (some perhaps more obvious than others) and plot points. Just how successful they are will likely depend upon how much you know of Trek going into the film, especially when it comes to the films last act which is either an incredibly good homage or a downright shameful rip off of one of Trek's best endings. Which of those it is I can't quite decide myself but I do think that this film perhaps over relies on it and, combined with something quite predictable, does undermine the film somewhat. Yet the mixing of old with new works for the most part, as it did in the last film, and shows that the filmmakers are looking to what came before as much as they are looking to the future.For some of its flaws, Star Trek Into Darkness' successful continuation of the franchise has proved that 2009's film wasn't a fluke either creatively or financially. While the alternate timeline still has its detractors for some of the changes it has brought about, the film works because of its mix of old with new as it looks to the past while still boldly going forward. As a result, there can be no doubt that the franchise will continue on for the foreseeable future. The only question is, to quote a line from the film itself, 'Where should we go?'",7,3,6,21 June 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After Tomorrow Revisited
","2019 marks the fifteenth anniversary of the release of The Day After Tomorrow. Co-written and directed by Rolland Emmerich in the midst of his being the modern 'master of disaster,' it was a sizable hit in cinemas and a TV re-run staple. How well has it aged though?One thing that the film has going for it, as does so many of Emmerich's films, is its cast. Dennis Quaid's casting as paleoclimatologist Jack Hall is something of a foundation for the entire film with Quaid bringing both an everyman quality to the role as well as a sense of intelligence necessary to make him believable as a scientist. The other significant bit of casting is Jake Gyllenhaal who is just about believable as Hall's teenage Sam who becomes the audience's main in-road to the incredible weather events taking place in the plot. That Gyllenhaal has strong chemistry with his co-stars closer to being the actual age of their characters helps while the handful of scenes early in the film between father and son help establish their relationship as potential loving but slightly estranged. It's something that, while invoking cliches perhaps at times, helps anchor the film all the same.It also helps that the rest of the cast is solid. A young Emmy Rossum shines as academic decathlon contestant Laura who becomes a love interest for Sam in the New York portions of the narrative. Though not a sizable role, Sela Ward does well in her brief appearances Dr. Lucy Hall, Jack's ex-wife and Sam's mom who is trying to care for patients. It's also a cast nicely filled with veteran character actors such as Ian Holm in a delightful role as a fellow climate scientist, Kenneth Welsh as the Dick Cheney like Vice President, Dash Mihok as Hall's aide Jason, and the ever reliable Jay O. Sanders as Hall's longtime colleague Frank Harris. They're just the tip of a strong cast, something which even in recent turkeys like White House Down and the Independence Day sequel Emmerich has been good at putting together.It is also, perhaps not surprisingly, a special effect feast. From the still impressive all CGI opening credit sequence to tornados in Los Angeles, a tsunami striking Manhattan, and British Royal Air Force helicopters frozen out of the sky, it is everything that one might ask from an Emmerich film. It's also well realized with much of the CGI holding up after all this time with the singular exception of a pack of wolves who even by the standards of the time look unconvincing. Combined with the sound design and music of composer Harald Kloser, the results are still incredible to watch. Of all of Emmerich's films, it is perhaps only second to Independence Day in how well its effects hold up.Where the film suffers, as does so much of the director's work, is in its script. There are more than a few cliches and thin characterizations at play in the film's two-hour running time which are grating at times. More often than not, especially with the Sam and Laura relationship, the film is saved from going too far by the sheer chemistry of the cast. Well, that and well-timed uses of humor to boot. Just how right and wrong the film gets its science too is interesting and has, of course, been discussed far better than I can hope to do so here. Needless to say, as someone who has read the film's non-fiction source material (The Coming Global Superstorm by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber), it's hard not to find the ideas compelling even if the timetable undergoes sizable, if not implausible, acceleration.Despite some of those issues, The Day After Tomorrow is a film that, even after fifteen years, still plays to all of the director's strengths. It's a bold, epic tale that takes in a large cast of characters and a worldwide scope. Despite that scope, it's principally focused on the United States with glimpses of what is happening elsewhere. It's a tale of survival told in as unsensational a style as it can. In short: It's the War of the Worlds of the climate change era, doing for it what HG Wells did for alien invasions.Plus, as I write this, it's hard not to find the scenes of Americans fleeing into Mexico funny. Heaven forbid if something like what the film portrays actually happens. In that regard, at least, it could well be The Day After Tomorrow...",7,2,2,21 January 2019
A Bridge Too Far," A Triumph Of The War Film Genre
","Launched in September 1944, Operation Market Garden was meant to be the battle that would be the beginning of the end of the Second World War in Europe. An ambitious plan to drop 35,000 paratroopers behind German lines in Holland before being linked up with by British ground forces, to say that things didn't go to plan would be an understatement. Based on Cornelius Ryan's 1974 bestseller, this 1977 film present a epic portrait of the incredible highs and lows of the operation.Ryan's previous book The Longest Day had been turned into a film in 1962 and it is difficult as a viewer not to make comparisons between the two. Both are large scale films with large all-star casts (with the two films even sharing at least two cast members in different roles Sean Connery and Wolfgang Preiss), action sequences, large budgets and an emphasis on telling a dramatic story while sticking pretty closely to actual events. As with The Longest Day, all of these elements serve the film well. Given the sheer number of characters that the film presents, the all-star cast is something of a bonus to the film. While having recognizable actors playing roles can be distracting at times, this film is a case of where that casting actually helps rather than hinders. Having actors like Connery, James Caan, Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Gene Hackman, Anothony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier and Robert Redford allows the viewer to have someone to latch onto and remember who that character is and where they are during the film's nearly three hour running time. Even better, all of them turn in solid performances that add to the film's mosaic like portrait of events though each gets a moment to shine from Fox's briefing scene as British Lt. Gen. Brian Horrocks, Connery as British First Airborne leader Major General Roy Urquhart, Hopkins as paratrooper Lt. Colonel John Frost who leads British troops clinging onto a vital bridge and Hackman as Polish paratrooper leader Sosabowski who serves as something of a voice of oft-ignored reason. Even in smaller roles are well cast including Frank Grimes's Major Fuller, Jeremy Kemp and Denholm Elliott as excruciatingly bureaucratic RAF officers and Arthur Hill as an American Army surgeon. It's a solid cast to say the least.The film's production values are strong and come across at their best in the film's many battle sequences. The recreation of the largest paratrooper operation of the Second World War is no easy feat today, let alone in the pre-CGI era. Yet the film pulls it off magnificently thanks to a combination of effects, costumes and making what was likely a handful of surviving pieces of equipment (including transport planes and armored vehicles) which brings it to life splendidly. There's also some strong camera work as well from legendary cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth as well as some incredible point of view shots of paratroopers jumping during the film's two biggest sequences. The use of location filming which often returns to the actual places helps with the film's verisimilitude as well. The editing is strong as well, especially in the battle sequences which create the air of chaos and confusion to give the viewer an idea of the 'fog of war' first hand. Combined together with the direction of Richard Attenborough, the film is a triumph to watch from a technical point of view as much as it is acting wise.Screenwriter William Goldman deserves significant praise for being able to take the 670 book and create a workable screenplay that, like the book, tells the story of Market Garden from all sides. Having recently read Ryan's book, it was surprising to see how much of the events and dialogue in the film came from the book and were well presented in the film. Indeed, many of the sequences that might seem corny and unbelievable such as the sequence where Caan's Sergeant Eddie Dohun rescuing his captain and forcing an Army doctor to look at him, Connery's Major General Urquhart becoming trapped behind German lines and many of the frustrations experienced on both sides can be directly traced to the original source material. Like The Longest Day before it (which Ryan adapted), this film allows the viewer a chance to get the feeling of history unfolding throughout.Yet it does more than just play as a highlight reel of Ryan's book. Perhaps even more impressive, Goldman's script (and the film itself) captures the tone and message of the book. That brave and good men acted courageously and against great odds but for what purpose many were left to wonder. The film's final minutes portrays this beautifully with little dialogue and a haunting final scene. It's something that further sets the film apart from many others in the war film genre. Which isn't to say the film isn't without flaws. Goldman's screenplay is rather unfair to British Market Garden commander Browning (play by Dirk Bogarde) who becomes something of a stand-in for British Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery who always stays off screen which might explain the odd quality to both the writing of Browning and Bogarde's performance. There is also the score from composer John Addison which is sporadic but full of a heroic tone that oddly seems out of place with the tone and events depicted by the film. Both are fairly minor quibbles though given the film as a whole.A Bridge Too Far is far from your typical war film. That is in large part due to its combination of all-star cast, strong production values and attention to historic events. It's a faithful adaptation of a book that captures its sweeping vision and rich details. Despite some flaws, it's a film that nonetheless stands as an example of both its genre and good filmmaking in general. It also shows the power of film to bring history to life without being patronizing, overly dramatic or dull. That's something rare in its own right.",8,2,5,4 February 2016
Cloverfield," Don't Let Your Curiosity Get The Best Of You
","There's an old saying about how curiosity killed the cat. My curiosity was raised by the trailer for this film I saw when I saw Transformers and the lack of anything really being said about it. So my curiosity led me to seeing the movie. And the old saying is true...seeing this almost killed me. Don't get me wrong it's got some good stuff about it. First off the concept of doing the film from the point of view of people running around with camcorders is an original idea. It helped to ground the film in some kind of reality, something that was desperately needed in this genre. Unfortunately, nothing else does but more on that later. Then there is the special effects which were terrific, particularly with the creature and its minions (for lack of a better word). Then there's the music over the end credits by Michael Giacchino. And that's about it.Noiw on the bad stuff...or should I say the rest of the movie? There is not one good performance from anyone in this film at all! Everyone is self-absorbed so much that you can't have sympathy for them. Not to mention that everyone in the film seems to be able to handle cameras without too much difficulty considering that they were under attack from a giant 'soemthing'! I mean even the military comes across that away and it takes a stretch of logic to understand why anyone in their right mind would let an unarmed group of civilians run around Manhatten without at least some military back-up! There's no logic to it at all.And then there's the script. The dialogue is either terrible or bad. It is just like every other disaster/monster movie ever made, except with a camcorder telling the story of a group of self-absorbed people caught in the middle. And then there's the lack of explanation. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of 2001: A Space Odseey and Donnie Darko, two films that didn't leave too many clues as to what was going on. But those were cases where explanation wasn't necessary because they were films that didn't need it because they left you with enough to work from to come to some sort of explanation. Coverfield doesn't and its hurt big time from it. These films need (to paraphrase its writer) scientist in the white lab coat who shows up and explains things like that. As I wrote above, the idea gives a sense of reality to the movie but between the bad acting from the horrible script that gives no explanation as to what is going on. They say every film is redeemable in at least some of its aspects. Those would be concept, the special effects and the end credits music for the record. Otherwise, Cloverfield is a disaster. In plain and simple terms that's what it is: a disaster. As I wrote, it is just like every other disaster/monster movie ever made, except with a camcorder telling the story of a group of self-absorbed people caught in the middle. Avoid the film, save your money, and don't let your curiosity get the best of you.",1,50,107,18 January 2008
Gettysburg," An Epic In Every Sense Of The Word
","The American Civil War seems to speak to the epic nature of filmmaking. Indeed, it has inspired some of its most important and controversial cinematic works including Birth of a Nation and Gone With The Wind. The 1990s saw something of a resurgence in Civil War filmmaking with films such as Glory and the release in 1993 of Ronald Maxwell's film Gettysburg. Originally filmed for television as a miniseries, it nevertheless received a theatrical release as one of the longest films ever released in American cinemas. More than 25 years on, it also remains an epic.I mean that sincerely: Gettysburg is a genuine epic. Take the sheer size of the cast, for instance. It features dozens of speaking roles including a dignified Martin Sheen as Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Jeff Daniels as professor turned Union officer Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Tom Berenger as Confederate GeneralJames Longstreet, Sam Elliot as Union cavalry officer John Buford, and even a bearded George Lazenby as a Confederate general. And those are just a few of the highlights from the cast which also includes appearances by any number of familiar faces. Keeping track of everyone can be easier said than done at times, especially when the battles come down, and that's something that rewards those willing to sit through the film on more than one occasion.Beyond the cast, Gettysburg lives up to the word epic in both scope and length. It benefits, for example, from its filming taking place in and around the actual battlefield with what certainly seems to be thousands of reenactors taking part which gives it a further air of authenticity. Their presence can be felt in sequences such as Pickett's Charge which gives the impression of what it might just have looked like on that hot July day. To tell the story of this climactic clash of the Civil War, the film dedicates roughly an hour to each day that it features, portraying events from both sides and the decisions that led to them. Then there's the added addition od Randy Edelman's score built around a rousing main title theme that's put to great effect at the narrative highpoints. The resulting work is a film that feels grand in both artistic intention and presentation.Is it a perfect film, though? Probably not. The script from director Maxwell gets oddly preachy at times, a little too caught up in speeches delivered by its characters on both sides of the conflict. Whether that's down to the source material, Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Killer Angels, I can't be certain of those others have spoken to the film's faithfulness to it elsewhere. Those talks are all something that definitely adds to the running time, once causing Martin Sheen to quip in an interview that the film lasted longer than the actual battle. That being said, it's something that doesn't hurt the film too much either as their wonderfully by the likes of Daniels, Sheen, and Richard Jordan in his last ever film role.Perhaps as a result of all that, from the cast and production to the sheer scope of the narrative the film recounts, Gettysburg may remain the last great film made about this defining American conflict. Unquestionably, Maxwell's follow-up prequel film Gods & Generals didn't recapture the lightning in bottle greatness of this film despite its own lengthy running time. But, even now, watching those opening credits or the 20th Maine swinging their way down Little Round Top or Lee being cheered on by his men still sends a shiver up my spine. That speaks to the power of filmmaking and to the lasting legacy of Gettysburg as a film.",9,1,1,23 July 2019
Interstellar," Going Interstellar
","I must confess that I've been interested in Interstellar for awhile now. Then again, I've been interested in space exploration since childhood, a side-effect I suspect of growing up near NASA's Marshall Spaceflight Center where the Saturn V rockets of the Apollo era were designed. Also being something of a fan of Nolan's previous films, the idea of him doing a space film was something that seemed irresistible. Indeed, Interstellar is a film not only didn't disappoint but improves with each new viewing with the result being that it could well be the best science fiction film in recent memory.Those familiar with Nolan's work may be surprised that the man who brought us perhaps cinema's most successful take on Batman and films like Inception would be interested in taking us out into the realms of interstellar space. Yet the film contains many of the hallmarks of Nolan's films that make it something that only he could make. It certainly has the epic scale we've come to expect from Nolan's recent films as it takes the viewer from agrarian future Earth, the spacecraft Endurance and distant planets in another galaxy as well as showing Nolan's ability to take often difficult ideas and ground them in a reality viewers can understand.Nolan, speaking in the 2011 documentary These Amazing Shadows, talked about liking films that make the audience come back again and again for which he specifically cited Kubrick's 2001. Interstellar most certainly falls into that category, partly because Nolan makes use of one of his favorite storytelling techniques: non-linear storytelling. Nolan grounds the film within the theory of relativity and its implications, something that becomes increasingly important as the film progresses. That non-linear storytelling also becomes a strong emotional force late in the film as we see father and daughter, one in space and one on Earth, struggling to overcome difficulties as each tries to carry out their end of the plan to save humanity. Yet where that non-linear plotting comes to the fore with the films ending which, I must confess, initially left me wondering if Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat had taken a pass at the script. All of which invites viewers to come back to it again and again in search of answers.Those willing to return to it will find much to appreciate about it. There's the performances for example. Nolan films tend to be well cast affairs anyways but with a cast including Matthew McConaughey, Nolan stalwart Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain in major roles with Mackenzie Foy, John Lithgow, and Ellen Burstyn in supporting roles, it's hard to find a single role miscast here or to imagine anyone else in those parts. McConaughey's performance especially is powerful with it being more than equal to his Oscar winning performance in 2013's Dallas Buyers Club. Mention must also be made of the trio of actresses playing Murph, especially Foy and Chastain, as they become the film's emotional anchor to the Earth once Cooper launches out into space.Production wise as well, there's plenty to be impressed by. The film's five Oscar nominations were for production values and it isn't hard to see why. There's the Oscar winning special effects that, thanks to the input of science consultant Kip Thorne, present us with an as-accurate-as-possible journey through a wormhole as well as distant planets and a trip to that strangest of all phenomenon: a black hole. There's some fantastic production design work covering a wide range of sets and locations which presents us with the most credible depiction of a near-future you're likely to see anytime soon.The icing on the cake though might well be the score from Hans Zimmer, which is the exact opposite of what one has come to expect from him. This score sees him taking a minimalist approach more comparable with Phillip Glass' work on the documentaries of Errol Morris than say Man Of Steel. Yet Zimmer's score also can build to incredible moments of raw musical power as demonstrated by the scene where Cooper leaves home, the music during the sequence on Miller's planet and the sequence that closes the film. That the score didn't win an Oscar is one of the biggest upsets in recent memory.Yet what makes this stand out from something like 2001 is its script. 2001, despite some of its big ideas and visuals, is at times a cold and clinical film where the most human character is the HAL 9000 computer. Interstellar definitely has its share of striking visuals and fascinating scientific concepts but that's not really what the film is about at an emotional level. The film explores humanity's place not just on this pale blue dot but out in the universe from our potential as a species to that fight or flight reflex that leads some of us to do incredible things and others to commit terrible acts of cowardice Interstellar speaks to what drives us and asks what we are capable of, telling us that, in the words of the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas that becomes almost a refrain throughout the film, we should not go gentle into that good night and rage, rage against the dying of the light.For me, Interstellar is Nolan's best film yet. It's a remarkable piece of film-making filled with strong performances, incredible visuals and a stunning score. Those things though are all just part of what makes the film as good as it is. Unlike so much out there today, the ultimate message of the film is one of hope. It's a stirring and inspiring tale, told in a science fiction context that brings to my mind what the late Carl Sagan, speaking thirty-five years ago in Cosmos, said: 'The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to stars.' Interstellar shows that we can and that we might just do it too.",10,2,8,6 May 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Cap Takes To The Screen
","On the surface, perhaps no member of The Avengers would seem more difficult to bring to a modern audience than Steve Rogers aka Captain America. Seen as perhaps something of an artifact of a time gone by, here was a character whose jump to the big screen had long been stuck in development hell. Despite a somewhat ironic title (the irony being that this would be the last of the origin films released before The Avengers), 2011 saw Cap make the leap successfully in Captain America: The First Avenger, bringing with him an interesting new angle in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.A large part of the success of the film might well be down to the choice of leading man. Chris Evans was an initially controversial choice to play the role, due in large part to his already having played another notable Marvel hero in the two Fantastic Four films some years previously. Yet like Daniel Craig's James Bond, once given the chance to see him in action the criticisms were largely silenced. Evans managed to successfully play not just the almost superhuman commando we've come to know and love but also the man Steve Rogers was before that: a puny, young guy from Brooklyn who seemed to embody the old saying about nice guys finishing last. Evans keeps that good guy aspect of the character in sight throughout the film from his interactions with his fellow characters to his reactions to events. Evans managed to take a potentially clich√©d superhero from another time and make him into a genuinely likable character.For that matter, the film all around has a strong cast. Hugo Weaving makes a fine nemesis in the form of Hydra leader Johann Schmidt, bringing a suitably sinister air to the character right from his very first scene in the film to the dramatic moment about midway through when he reveals the Red Skull persona (itself a triumph of prosthetic makeup). Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes is notable as well both for his chemistry with Evans' Rogers which makes their friendship believable even when their roles are reversed but for also firmly establishing an idea of the character in the mind of the audience (something even more important in light of where the character would eventually be developed in the future). Filling in more traditional roles with memorable performances are Toby Jones as Hydra scientist Arnim Zola, Tommy Lee Jones as the initially skeptical commander of the Strategic Scientific Reserve and Stanley Tucci as ex-pat German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine who recruits Rogers.Though the film's setting during the Second World War means that female characters are fairly few, the character from the film besides Rogers that perhaps stands out the most is Haley Atwell's Peggy Carter. While she does, as she did in the comics, become something of a love interest for Rogers, thankfully there's far more to the character than that. Atwell in interviews described the character as 'She can do everything Captain America can do, but backwards and in high heels,' and the action sequences in which Carter appears certainly rather prove that point. As a result, it's something that makes her now having her own TV series not the least bit surprising.The film's production values are strong, especially given its Second World War setting. Through its combination of script, production design and costuming, the film successfully blends the technology and weapons of that conflict with aspects of the previously established Marvel universe (both comic and cinematic, the latter perhaps being more as a result of Joss Whedon's uncredited work on the script). In fact some of the seemingly more outlandish designs form the film such as the rocket like craft Schmidt uses at one point or the large flying wing plane where the film's climactic confrontation takes place are in fact based on real life plans drawn up by the Germans during the war (the Triebfl√ºgelj√§ger fighter plane and the Horten H.XVIII respectively). Director Joe Johnston, whose previous films include period set works such as the cult film The Rocketeer and October Sky, was a perfect choice to direct the film which combines period setting and characters with action sequences (indeed The Rocketeer arguably bares some similarities to the film itself). The icing on the cake might well be the score from Alan Silvestri which manages to be exciting and yet timeless at the same time. The results make the film as strong as it is.Despite the film really being done to establish the Captain's origin story, The First Avenger is book-ended by two very important scenes in the present day. The first of which reveal the discovery of a mysterious object between Arctic ice (revealed late in the film to the Hydra flying wing) that sets up the journey the viewer is about to go on while the latter presents us with a sequence where Rogers finds himself in the present day which, as well as giving us the seemingly pre-requisite appearance by Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury, also firmly establishes that other iconic aspect of the character: that he is a man out of time. With that complete, the stage was set for The Avengers and the rest, as they say, was history.First Avenger on its own though holds up quite well. Of the phase one Marvel films it's one of the most successful in bringing its characters back-story to life while also presenting a genuinely enjoyable film in the process. The result is a strong, period based action film and one of the best Marvel films to date.",8,2,3,5 June 2015
The Battle of Algiers," An Uncommonly Powerful Film
","There are few films with the power of The Battle Of Algiers. It is a film based on real events that gives you, the audience, the feel of those events actually unfolding before your eyes, which is a rarity to say the least. What is even rarer is what makes this film so good: it is perhaps the most successful documentary approach recreation of actual events ever produced.One of the biggest keys to the documentary approach of the film is the fact that the actors do not seem to be acting. Often it is the very fact that actors do seems to be acting that can kill the reality of a film like this one yet this represents one of the successful attempts at using not just actors but non-actors to create a seamless whole. In fact one of the best decisions made by Gillo Pontecorvo was to cast Saadi Yacef who was directly involved in the real events to effectively play himself. The advantage of this is that it adds an even greater degree of verisimilitude to the film and its approach.The documentary approach is in fact the very key to the success of The Battle Of Algiers. The cinematography wobbles, zooms and frames in the way that a documentary film would if filming these events as they were taking place and gives the film the visual reference of a documentary. The result of this is the feeling in the midst of riots, shooting, bombings, meetings, torturing etc. In short the film gives the feeling of being in the midst of a modern revolution from both sides of it.In fact it is the very fact that The Battle Of Algiers covers both sides that makes the film stand-out. It is true that the filmmakers have an obvious bias for the FLN, yet one must look deeper into the film. Despite that bias the film pulls no punches on the morals of terrorism. The very fact that is shows shooting and bombings up close and personal and the aftermaths as well in perhaps the single best example of this. Neither side be it the FLN with their terrorist attacks of the French with their paratroopers using torture is portrayed as the definite good guys or bad guys to put it in more conventional, literal terms. The film proves that one point of view is as valid as the other, something rather unique to this film. The bias is for the FLN and the journey of Ali La Pointe from average Algerian to revolutionary yet the fact is that the film shows both sides. The point of this: nobody is right yet nobodies wrong and both sides of any conflict must understand this. That fact alone makes the film as relevant today as it was forty plus years ago.Another strong element of the film is its rather sparse score. The score was a collaboration between films core master Ennio Morricone and Pontecorvo and it is proof of the old saying less is more. The score provided emotional clout to an all ready emotionally charged film from the almost thunderous paratrooper theme to the heartbreaking piece used in the aftermath of both the French and FLN bombings. In fact that latter piece alone makes clear the intent of those scenes: human suffering in universal no matter which side of a conflict you are on. It is a unique score for a unique film.The Battle Of Algiers is a unique film in many ways. From the verisimilitude of its cast to its documentary approach and unique view of modern revolutions and terrorism, few films can match the sheer power and realism of this film. It is this uncommon aspect that makes the film unique even some four decades after it was made. For anyone seeking a unique insight into modern terrorism or seeking a fine example of how a film can bring history to life after the event I recommend The Battle Of Algiers without hesitation. Watch it, learn from it and be all the better for it.",10,0,1,26 August 2008
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Stranger Than Fiction
","There is an old saying that truth is stranger than fiction. It is perhaps no surprise then that filmmakers have often found inspiration in true events in bringing stories to the screen. In what is definitely a case of 'stranger than fiction' is The Men Who Stare At Goats, the 2009 film depicting the military's attempt to harness the forces of the paranormal in the name of national security. The results, like the film itself, are quite surprising.Going into the film, it's worth remembering that the credits state that it is 'Inspired By The Book The Men Who Stare at Goats by Jon Ronson'. Like many a fact based film before it the film combines characters, events and locations together to create something that can fit more easily into a ninety-three minute package. Keeping that in mind though doesn't mean that the film is a complete work of fiction. On the contrary, many of the events shown in the film have a serious basis in reality. These include the New Earth Army, remote viewing programs (including the specific example used in the film) and indeed the film's very title. While the more 'present day' elements are certainly more fictitious than other parts of the film, the film largely portrays real events within its more fictional context.Keeping all that in mind, there's plenty of enjoy about the film as a whole. The performances throughout are solid, playing up the absurd nature of the events being portrayed. Ewan McGregor as Bob Wilton (a character apparently inspired by author Jon Ronson' is the viewer's in-way to events and acts as narrator as well as participant. George Clooney is Lyn Cassady with whom McGregor's Wilton spends much of his time with and whom we see through decades of his life in a performance that Clooney plays perfectly on the fine line that constantly leaves Wilton and the viewer alike wondering about his sanity. Much the same can be said of Jeff Bridges as the New Earth Army's founder Bill Django (based on the real-life Jim Channon) and which Bridges is perfectly cast to play. The film's supporting cast is strong as well including Kevin Spacey, Stephen Lang, Robert Patrick, Stephen Root and Waleed Zuaiter who all play up or down the comedy in their scenes to great success.The film, as a production, is solid as well. Peter Straughan's script finds the right balance of parody, comedy and occasional seriousness which sets much of the film's tone and that director Grant Heslov brings to the screen wonderfully. The film covers a large span of time from 1972 Vietnam to 2004 Iraq, a challenge that production designer Sharon Seymour and costumer Louise Frogley do a splendid job of bringing to life. If Straughan and Heslov create a quirky sense of tone, it's Seymour and Frogley who give it the sense of reality that makes it all the more incredible to watch. The result is a quirky, odd but definitely funny hour and a half. With an excellent cast and solid production values, it brings us the tale of the absurd measures that members of the US military went to test and use the paranormal with often surprising results. While not perhaps for all tastes, The Men Who Stare At Goats does prove one thing: that truth is more certainly stranger than fiction.",8,3,4,19 February 2016
Quantum of Solace," Full Of Promise But Disappointing In The End
","With the announced reboot of the Bond franchise with Casino Royale in 2006 and with Daniel Craig being announced in the role, nobody was sure that the reboot would be successful. Yet with its release in 2006 and with Craig having proved himself in the role of Bond, anticipation was high for its successor. Yet Quantum of Solace would prove unable to reach the bar set by Casino Royale.The problems seem to stem for the cast but, thankfully, not from Daniel Craig as007. Craig proves that the Bond he portrayed in Casino Royale could survive into another film. Craig proves himself again and again between the action sequences and the (relativly small amount) of dramatic sequences as well. The real shame is that Craig doesn't seem to have the chance to really act in the way he did in Casino Royale.Moving on from Craig, the rest of the main cast is questionable. Playing the role of Camille is relative newcomer Olga Kurylenko. The problem with using a relative newcomer is the fact that Kurylenko doesn't have much acting experience and it shows. Kurylenko lacks screen presence and chemistry with Craig or anyone else she happens to share the screen with at any given moment. It seems a shame because with a better actress, the role of Camille could have been much better.It has been said that a Bond film can be judged from the strength of its villain. If that is the case then Mathieu Amalric's Dominic Greene sums up Quantum of Solace: full of promise but disappointing in the end. Mathieu Amalric is a good actor without a doubt but the role of Bond villain is not a role for him. Dominic Greene is amongst the series least threatening villains who, like Moonraker's Hugo Drax, tries to be the 'silent but menacing' type and only succeeds in being a self parody. The one time that Greene gets into a fight with bond it turns into one of the series unintentionally funny moments (people in the theater I saw the film in were laughing I'll leave it at that).The supporting cast thankfully is better, if extremely underused. Perhaps the best example of this is Gemma Arterton wonderfully done Strawberry Fields. I ask the filmmakers what is the point of introducing a character who in her introduction alone is more interesting that your female lead just to give her the least amount of screen time possible? Like Miranda Frost in Die Another Day, the 'secondary' Bond girl should have been the primary one and vice versa. Much the same is true of the returning characters from Casino Roayle: Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) and White (the wonderfully menacing Jesper Christensen) who all deserved far more screen time then they eventually got. Back to the question: why introduce them if you're not going to use them much? Judi Dench makes a welcomed return as M, who in her screen time builds on to the Bond-M relationship established so well in Casino Royale and thankfully there are plenty of those scenes. The real shame is that, outside of Dench's M, the supporting cast is underused massively.Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that the film suffers from an action overload. While the action sequences of Casino Royale were stunning, the same can not be said of those of Quantum of Solace. The filmmakers apparently took the Bourne films as a model because this film copies many of the action sequences right down to the foot chases and even a knife fight that is so reminiscent of the Borune series it could be called a rip-off. The film does have a few original action sequences in the film including the boat chase and one of the series best airborne action sequences. It's a shame that while there are good action sequences surrounded by a whole series of not so good ones. The filmmakers have made the same mistake they did with Tomorrow Never Dies: letting the action override the plot.One of the pluses of the film is David Arnold's score. Arnold adheres a little more closely to the traditional Bond score. After making the James Bond Theme non-existent in Casino Royale, Arnold allows it to slip in without it being intrusive. In fact Arnold with one moment in particular perfectly captures the feel of the earlier John Barry scores with the scene of Bond and Fields. Arnold uses Quantum of Solace to show off his ability to make a good Bond score. Unfortunately the main title theme 'Another Way To Die' is amongst the series worst with some odd lyrics and an odd performance (the duet was a good idea if only the song had been better).Perhaps it was the raised expectations, but Quantum of Solace seems lacking in many areas. It's mixed main cast and action overload are its biggest problems and while it has many pluses (a good performance from Craig, an underused supporting cast and a good score) the minuses of the film are very hard to overcome. As a Bond fan I hat to say it but I will: Quantum of Solace is full of promise but disappointing in the end.",4,2,3,23 November 2008
Independence Day," ID4 At Twenty
","It seems difficult to believe that Independence Day turns twenty years old this year. One of the biggest films of the 1990s, ID4 (as it was known in publicity material) became one of the biggest crossing films of the decade and a template for the current era of disaster films. Yet despite its age, it's a film that continues to stand up remarkably well.For one thing, it's well cast. While Will Smith has become a well known name as a result of this film and others like it, the ID4 cast is perhaps wisely made up largely of character actors who all give performances that help sell the incredible events of the film. These range from Jeff Goldblum as an MIT educated computer expert, Smith's fighter pilot Steve Hiller, Bill Pullman's President of the United States who comes into his own during the film's events to a supporting cast that includes Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Mary McDonnell, Randy Quaid and Brent Spiner among others. Each has standout moments that helps to make the film work though with the potential exception of Smith no one really steals the show. It's as good an example as any of what an ensemble cast is capable of and especially so in a Hollywood movie.What the film is perhaps best remembered for is its effects. Two decades later and shown either on large screen televisions or projected on screens, those effects hold up pretty well. From the opening scene on the Moon to the ship's entry over major cities to dogfights above cities and deserts, the film's is a powerful showing of what was being done on the end of the physical effects era and the beginning of heavy CGI effects. Yet the film's iconic moments as the White House, Empire State Building and other landmarks are wiped out (done with impressive physical models) makes a compelling case for a way of doing effects that has largely vanished in recent years. Perhaps the makers of this film, who helped to spur those efforts, might need to take a look at their work from two decades ago?Beyond that, the film might well be the best thing that director Rolland Emmerich (and his producer/co-writer Dean Devlin) have ever produced. Independence Day is a surprisingly well constructed film, using the classic three act structure in a big budget sci- fi/disaster movie complex as we get set-up, defeat and then one last battle all in the space of around two and a half hours. Despite showing the worldwide nature of the film's events, it only rarely seems to hint at it briefly which makes the film feel at times oddly American centric (something overseas reviewers have noted for years) yet perhaps it notable that the filmmakers at least made the effort to expand the story at all. Combined with dialogue and knowing homages to some of the genre's classics, the result is a film that is tense and utterly enjoyable to watch.It's also worth mentioning the the film's extended version as well. That version, which has seen the light of day on home video, contains some nine extra minutes of footage which is immensely helpful to the film. Not only does it help to flesh out not only characters but also some of the plot points that have been somewhat criticized over the years including setting up the film's ending. In a way it's a shame that version wasn't the original theatrical version or the one that came to be so well known on home video initially as it is a superior cut of the film to say the least.Also worthy of mention is David Arnold's score. Though Arnold has already scored Stargate and was a year away from scoring the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, it's this score that likely brought Arnold to greater attention than anything else. Though British, Arnold created one of the definitive American film scores of all time that includes rousing action scores and a memorable main theme. Yet Arnold's score also proves adept at both tension in the film's first hour and most especially in the lead-up to iconic moments as well as mournful sounds in its aftermath. It's a fine piece of work and a calling card for Arnold even today.Keeping all that in mind, it isn't to see why Independence Day was a success both then and now. It's a well-cast, visual spectacle that uses classical story structuring, witty dialogue and a rousing score to produce a story that is as much a joy to watch now as it was twenty years ago. However one feels about its belated sequel, there is no doubting the power and success of this film. And long may it continue to entertain generations to come.",9,0,0,1 July 2016
Batman Begins," 'Are You Ready To Begin?'
","Seven years after Batman's last woeful appearance on the big screen, the Dark knight would receive a second chance to start a big screen franchise. The result was a Batman film 180 degrees different from its predecessors in its tone and presentation. In fact the title said it all: Batman Begins.Christian Bale makes a remarkable Btamn / Bruce Wayne in the film. Like Christoher Reeve in Superman The Movie almost three decades earlier, Bale makes the remarkable journey to superhero seem believable. Whjat makes Bale's performance (and arguably the character's journey as well) all the more remarkable is the fact that batman is not just your average superhero either. Bale makes the journey from man to symbol remarkably and believable. The one downside to Bale is really his voice as Batman which is unbelievably deep to put it nicely. Yet despite that he makes a good candidate from the best film Btamn yet from this film alone.Like how director Richard Donner surrounded Christopher Reeve in Superman The Movie with an all star supporting cat, director Christopher Nolan surrounded Bale in much the same way. There is Michael Caine who makes a wonderful Alfred with a terrificly understated performance, Gary Oldman's realistic Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman's excellent Lucius Fox for a start. Then there's the villains like Tom Wilkinson's mob boss and Cillian Murphy's Dr. Crane. Don't forget a the stand-out performance of Liam Neesom as Dukar who helps to firmly anchor the film in reality. There are one or two miscasts like Katie Holmes and Ritger Hauer who both seem nowhere near in their roles as the rest of the cast. Overall though it is an excellent supporting cast backing up an excellent leading man. One of the big reasons this film works is that, unlike the art deco inspired films of Tim Burton or the overly stylized films of Joel Schumacuer, Nolan choose to put his Batman in something close to the real world. Everything about this film from its real world technology(or thereabouts)to Gotham itself signals this. Nolan and fellow writer David S. Goyer have taken the Btman mythology out of the comic book and into the real world. This is a dark world for the Dark Knight indeed.What would a Batman film be without action? Though it is essentially action less for much of its first third, the film has no shortage of action after wisely allowing for plenty of time for character development. Nolan wisely chooses not to fall into the usual trap of having a plot that revolves around the need for action sequences every few minutes. In fact Batman Begins is quite the opposite by using action to forward the plot. The action might be amazing but it never overwhelms the human drama going or the most important thing: the story. And that is how it should be.From strong performances to a real world setting and amazing action sequences, Batman Begins is a terrific action film. It is more then that though. With its blend of human drama with action it is a new beginning for a amazing hero. As the title says: Batman Begins.",9,2,2,12 September 2008
JFK," Compelling To The Last Frame
","Few events in American history stand out quite so heavily as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Besides the shocking nature of the event with the American president being gunned down in broad daylight in a major city came the psychic scars caused by unanswered questions due to an alleged assassin gunned down before he could ever be tried and an official investigation that was at best botched and, at worst, a whitewash. Perhaps no single film or work of fiction has done more to raise questions about the event than Oliver Stone's 1991 JFK with its exploration of events through the perspective of Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney who brought to trial of the one alleged conspirators.Stone, along with his co-screenwriter Zachary Sklar, craft a peculiar film around the biggest unsolved mystery in American history. Indeed, JFK as a film owes much both to political thriller films such as Z (which also focuses on the assassination of a government official with multiple versions of the same events seen from the perspective of witnesses brought forth by a determined investigator) and the murder mystery genre. The only difference is that this is a murder with far more scope, far more suspects, and far more consequences than your garden variety murder mystery. It's a tale that takes in a large portion of still recent history and an era in time before distrust in government would reach its zenith (and perhaps has never truly subsided) and when terrible things very likely lurked in the shadows. Incidentally, anyone convinced that Stone's vision is overly paranoid should seek out the published script book for the film with dozens (if not hundreds) of annotations. The film's vision, while leaning perhaps a bit far in cases, turns out to be far plausible a vision than it's often given credit for. The result is at nightmarish with its implications, so perhaps it's no surprise that the film led to an act of Congress to release more of the classified files related to the assassination which is still being released even as I type these words.To bring the story to life, Stone assembled a first-rate team both in front of and behind the camera. Borrowing another trope from some of the better-filmed murder mysteries, the film has an all-star cast of actors in roles both big and small. Leading it is Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney who becomes both investigator and the audience's guide into the twisty world surrounding the assassination. Costner, though quite different from the real Garrison who was taller and more built, was nevertheless a perfect piece of casting as the intelligent everyman armed with a large amount of dignity and a determination to get to the truth no matter where it leads. Costner's performance plays up all of these elements and even the dark side of Garrison's obsession while also creating someone the audience is willing to follow for the three-plus hours the film runs for. The rest of the film's cast is equally as strong. The Garrison investigation turns up a number of fascinating characters, any of whom could very well the protagonist of their own film, ranging from Tommy Lee Jones' quietly menace as Clay Shaw, Joe Pesci's eccentric David Ferrie, John Candy as the ever-shifting lawyer Dean Andrews, and Kevin Bacon as Willie O'Keefe (a composite character, one of several the film uses) among many others. There is also Gary Oldman's Lee Harvey Oswald is not only uncanny in his resemblance but a fascinating portrait in its own right, presenting many different versions of one of modern history's most enigmatic figures. The film also has its fair share of strong female performances from Laurie Metcalf as an assistant DA to Sissy Spacek as Garrison's wife torn between supporting her husband and being drawn into the world he's uncovering. That's without mentioning the effective cameo appearances from the likes of Edward Asner, Jack Lemmon, and Walter Matthau or the scene-stealing monologue delivered by Donald Sutherland as the mysterious insider known as X. Few films can claim to have perfect casts but, for my money, JFK is one of them. Those behind the camera are the other half of the equation. Stone's team includes superb costume and set designs from Marlene Stewart and Victor Kempster which gives the film its sense of time and place. Yet as cerebral as the film is, a thinking person's thriller in many ways, it's also an immensely visual work with Stone often relying on the editing of Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia as well as the stunning cinematography of Robert Richardson. The three of them together weave in footage both archive and newly shot together into a tapestry that captures the viewer's eye as well as their brain. Underpinning it all is John Williams' score, perhaps one of his most underrated, that plays up not only the sense of unease but also the sense of what was lost all in the space of the film's opening titles and haunting themes elsewhere in the film. It's a remarkable tapestry all around.Indeed, that is a nice summary of the film as a whole. Stone's JFK is, in essence, a murder mystery. One whose stakes have a firm basis in reality and based on a crime whose particulars are still hotly debated decades after the fact. With his cast and crew, he created a fascinating piece of film-making that crosses genres and time, presenting an incredible and paranoid vision of an earth-shattering event. Except that, if what's in the film is even half true, has deeply disturbing implications. That thought and the fact that the film led to documents being released speaks to the power of film-making and JFK as a film in particular.",10,5,8,8 November 2017
2012," The End Isn't Near...It's Here!
","Though I admit to being a fan of Roland Emmerich's previous films I was skeptical about 2012. Not because of Emmerich but because of the subject matter: the supposedly prophesied by the Mayan's end of the world on December 21st, 2012. While I don't believe that the world is going to end, I did see the film. While it isn't a great movie by any means it is still a fast-paced, well-acted film with some jaw dropping special effects.Continuing an Emmerich tradition the film has an all-star cast that do well even with a script with issues. Leading it is John Cusack as struggling science fiction writer John Cusack who, while initially an odd choice to be playing the lead in an action film, proves to be up to the challenge and gives a fine performance. Joining Cusack as his ex-wife Kate is Amanda Peet who gives an admirable performance instead of a potentially one dimensional performance. Another fine performance comes from Chiwetel Ejiofor as the scientist who sounds the alarm on impending doom and becomes a voice of reason amongst the chaos. There's admirable performances from Oliver Platt as the White House chief of staff Carl Anheuser, Danny Glover as the President caught up in the greatest crisis ever to face humanity and Thandie Newton as his daughter plus a wonderfully over-the-top performance from Woody Harrelson as the conspiracy-theorist radio talk show host Charlie Frost. Then there's fine supporting characters including Professor West (John Billingsley) and Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric) amongst others. All that said 2012 features what quite possibly be the worst impersonation of Arnold Schwarzenegger ever committed to film though thankfully he appears very briefly and just long enough to be noticeable. Besides that this is a well-acted film.Now onto the other big thing about 2012: the special effects. Those who have seen Emmerich's work (Stargate, Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow etc.) know his films are showcases of special effects and CGI. 2012 is no exception with some absolutely incredible CGI and special effects sequences that are, quite literally, jaw dropping and worthy of being seen on the big screen. They range from earthquakes to volcanic eruptions to tsunamis in as many different forms and settings as you can imagine. Many of them are quite unexpected and help to give the Emmerich clich√© of landmark destruction some variety. Meaning that once again Emmerich has outdone himself with his biggest and best disaster effects to date.Outside of the effects the film also boosts some fine production values as well. This is especially true of the sets from Production Designer Barry Chusid who once again creates an incredible White House set (another Emmerich clich√© it seems) and the fabulous interior sets of the Arks. The film is rather fast paced, not not terribly so, in the hands of editors David Brenner and Peter S. Elliot. Then, to add tension to the film, is the score from composers Harald Kloser (who previously did The Day After Tomorrow) and Thomas Wander whose score, while not a classic by any means, is as fine a score as any of those accompanying Emmerich's previous films. All together they help boost the film's cast and effects.Not to say the film is perfect of course. While it may be well acted and full of incredible special effects it is fair to say the script is rather lacking. It isn't just the use of the supposed end of the world in 2012 as a launching off point either. The film has quite a few pieces of clunky dialogue (especially in the President's lines) which thankfully the actors manage to do their best to make it sound sincere and natural though not always successfully. There's also the matter of the plot as well of course which requires quite a few leaps over some sizable plot holes to make work and without which there wouldn't be a script. To put it bluntly if, like me, you thought an alien invasion being foiled by a computer virus in Independence Day was a bit too much to swallow then don't try to connect the dots in this film. That said the film does have some nice dialogue (especially in scenes with Helmsley and Anheuser on the ethics of whether or not to issue warnings) plus some elements that hearken back to the disaster films of the past, especially George Pal's When Worlds Collide. While not a great script it is still a good one even with some of its issues.So where does 2012 stand then? Well it has a script with some issues (some clunky dialogue and plot holes) for one thing. On the other hand the cast make good use of the script to the point of some improvement, incredible special effects sequences and with plenty of fine production values to boot. It also hearkens back to some of the better disaster of the films of the past (especially the aforementioned When Worlds Collide) and actually makes good use of the 2012 end of the world idea. 2012 isn't a great film but as a tense disaster film with a fine cast and great effects it works rather well.",8,1,7,14 November 2009
Hidden Figures," IlluminatIng The Past & Inspiring A New Generation
","Real-life events have often proved to be fertile ground for filmmakers. Even when events are apparently well documented, such as NASA and the American space program, they have made for fine pieces of film- making as they can sometimes find the little known stories and illuminate them. Hidden Figures is a prime example of this as it takes viewers back to the early 1960s as America pushed headlong into the Space Race and the role that a group of female African- American mathematicians, effectively tasked as human computers, played in that effort.In telling this story, the film brings together a strong cast. Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon√°e, and Taraji P. Henson play the three leads of the film who find themselves facing different tasks and circumstances as they work at NASA's Langley Research Center. Of the three it is Henson who perhaps gets the largest role of the three as Katherine Johnson, whose work becomes crucial to the success of early Mercury missions. Mon√°e's performance is solid as well, playing a woman struggling not just with the racial elements of the time but also institutionalized sexism as well. Yet out of the trio the best performance might come from Spencer who is an effective scene stealer throughout and does not surprise me in the least that she has received an Oscar nomination. Together, these three women (both as characters and as actresses) anchor the film solidly.The supporting cast is solid but nowhere near as strong. Out of them, it is perhaps Kevin Costner as Space Task Group head Al Harrison (a character inspired by the real life Robert Gilruth) who stands out the best as an authoritative but sympathetic boss. Many of the performances though ranging from Jim Parsons' NASA engineer, Kirsten Dunst as the trio's immediate supervisor, Glen Powell as John Glenn , and Mahershala Ali as Jim Johnson all suffer not so much from their actual performances but from often feeling like little more than cardboard cut-outs filling out the film. Which is a shame in a way as some of them feel either superfluous or wasted in their roles with some such as Powell (who is way too young to be playing the forty year old astronaut) perhaps being mis-cast. For what they have to work with though, they do good work.Outside of its leading trio, the film has strong production values. The film does an excellent job of taking the viewer back to the early part of the 1960s, a time of both optimism and yet still rooted firmly in the past. This is something the filmmakers work to their advantage with the costumes and sets especially feeling straight out of the period. The film makes strong use of archival footage over CGI effects to bring the actual missions to life though the mixture of the two together is well done so that it takes being familiar with the actual footage to spot the difference. The music score, despite coming from three quite different composers, suits the film well ranging from simple but highly effective orchestral pieces from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch to songs by Pharrell Williams. Combined with the direction of Theodore Melfi, the film becomes a strong mix of elements that take the viewer into the period while also telling an engaging story.None of which would be possible without the script. Melfi and co- writer Allison Schroeder are to be commended on taking a tale that takes in the early history of NASA, the math of space flight, the burgeoning Civil Rights movement, plus life in the 1960s south to create a script that not only is informative but engaging as well. They do so by injecting a good deal of humor into the film and I have to admit to being surprised by the amount of times I laughed over the course of the two hour running time but also tension. It says something that I heard sharp intakes of breath during the climatic sequence involving Glenn's mission as the film manages to make a tense sequence despite the audience presumably knowing that the astronaut lived into old age before passing away recently. Yet the script, and the film itself truth be told, does tend to delve into unsubtle melodrama that undermines it at times. There are scenes that, even sitting in the cinema, feel entirely invented such as confrontation involving Katherine Johnson and her white colleagues and a scene that immediately follows it. The film is also guilty of some historical and technical errors as well from a newscaster's line of dialogue about the Mercury capsule 'achieving an altitude of 116 miles per hour' to the lack of figures such as NASA rocket engineer Wernher Von Braun or condensing NASA's facilities down to the point that less knowledgeable viewers might think that Mercury mission control was in Virginia (it was really down in Florida). It is something that perhaps undermines the film somewhat though not to a fatal extent.On the whole though, I can forgive the writers and the film for its occasional lack of subtlety and over-simplifications. Hidden Figures tells a little known story into a highly engaging way thanks to a combination of strong lead characters, first rate production values, and a script that takes what could have been a heady combination of historical events and infusing it with humor and tension. It is a fine example of what a historical drama can do: illuminate the past for a new generation and inspiring them.",8,3,11,28 January 2017
The Imitation Game," The Man Who Saved Britain
","The story of the breaking of the German Engima code during the Second World War is one of those incredible real-life stories filmmakers seem drawn to, like moths to a flame. That seems due, in part, to some of the remarkable figures involved with the effort. One of them was Alan Turing, a young Cambridge mathematician whose work not only helped crack the code but give birth to the modern computer age. Helping tell Turing's story to a broader audience is 2014's The Imitation Game, with Benedict Cumberbatch as the man himself.Let's be honest: If you were going to cast someone to play Turing, you could a lot worse than go with Cumberbatch. The man who had brought to life a modern-day Sherlock Holmes and, before that, Stephen Hawking in a BBC TV movie, clearly had a pedigree for bringing to life those blessed with genius and eccentricity. Even so, his performance as Turing stands as something of a triumph. All the facets of this incredible, if at times distant, man is there on display with Cumberbatch finding ways to play them with both subtlety and, at times, explosiveness. The shift from vain to vulnerable can happen in the blink of an eye, the raising of an eyebrow, and Cumberbatch presents all of that wonderfully. It's a remarkable performance, and it is no surprise there was an Oscar nomination in store for his work.Elsewhere, Cumberbatch is given ample support by the supporting cast. Keira Knightley's Joan Clarke is a prime example of this, a little known figure in her own right, whom Knightley brings to life with a performance that hits all the right notes. Turing's fellow codebreakers are likewise well-cast, from Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander to Allen Leech as John Cairncross. One good bit of casting is Alex Lawther as the young Turing, offering the viewer an elegant depiction of the up and coming mathematician. Elsewhere, the film features a procession of the UK's leading character actors from the likes of Charles Dance as Commander Denniston to Mark Strong as MI6 chief Stewart Menzies and the ever-reliable Rory Kinnear as the policeman looking into Turing in the 1950s. It's a choice cast and one that brings out the best in their roles and, ultimately, Cumberbatch as Turing.The Imitation Game is also a handsomely made film. From the cinematography of Oscar Faura to the sets of Maria Djurkovic and the costuming of Sammy Sheldon Differ recreating Britain of the forties and fifties, it's a gorgeous film to look at, rich in detail. It also sounds impressive, thanks to the score from Alexandre Desplat which is every bit as idiosyncratic and remarkable as the performance of the film's lead, capturing the intricacies of the moods and racing mind of Turing, as if musical quicksilver. Brought together under the direction of Morten Tyldum, it's an impressive combination that elevates the film that much more.And then there's the script from Graham Moore, an Oscar-winning one at that. Working from Andrew Hodges' biography of Turing, Moore crafted an immensely compelling piece of work, one that highlights so many aspects of Turing's life and works. Yet, Moore frames his story around what, ultimately, became Turing's downfall, meaning he would never be known for his work during his lifetime. It's a remarkable story, without a doubt, and Moore finds ways to turn an often complex narrative into something understandable for those who aren't either mathematicians or experts on the Second World War. It also means, at times to the detriment of both script and the film, that there's the invoking of cliches, not to mention stretching of historical facts to their breaking point. That isn't to take away from Moore's achievement or what the film does, but perhaps suggest why such a remarkable piece of work has the occasional air of being formulaic at times.Even with sometimes playing to a formula and stretching historical truth, The Imitation Game does a fine job. From Cumberbatch's performance to the work of its cast and crew and even the finer moments of Moore's script, it succeeds beautifully in bringing to life again one of the remarkable minds of the 20th century. For that reason alone, it stands out as a piece of filmmaking worth seeing.",8,0,0,3 April 2020
Logan," An Instant Classic?
","There is the old saying that tells us that 'all good things must end.' For Hugh Jackman, the actor who has played Marvel's comic book character Wolverine since 2000, now would seem a good time to say goodbye to the character. Thus Logan, released earlier this year, was announced to be his last time in the role. Not only that but the film looked to be quiet different from any of the previous X-Men films or even the solo Wolverine outings. The resulting film is an interesting piece of work to say the least.A large portion of what makes the film different is its tone from the script through to the performances. If previous films in the franchise had been largely overblown pieces of work more interested in set pieces than in its large cast characters (see last year's X- Men: Apocalypse), this is the film that set out to turn that whole notion on its head. For all of its action sequences, this film is first and foremost a character piece as we follow not only Wolverine but Charles Xavier (played once again by Sir Patrick Stewart) in a somewhat dystopian world not too far removed from our own where mutants are on the brink of extinction. The film then is something of a third act for both their characters and the results are fairly dark and bleak with Jackman wonderfully portraying a man who was apparently immortal now coming to terms with his own mortality while also being given something his life has apparently lacked for many years: a purpose. The flashes of humor, well played by both Jackman and Stewart, stop the film from ever going too far into the darkness though and help keep it on a more level playing field. That being said, it is far and away the darkest film the franchise has yet produced.It's also a far more bloody and violent film than one might have expected as well. Though the character has featured in eight previous films where Jackman has played the role (not to mention several animated TV series), none of them showed the level of violence that this film has with liberal amounts of blood flying and no attempt to shy away from gore. Having read the Old Man Logic comic that helped inspire the film, this didn't come as too much of a surprise. What did come as a surprise was that the film set aside the decidedly over the top violence of the comic and instead portrayed as being far more realistic than one might have expected. While it is never gruesome, Logan as a film never shies away from blood and the consequences of violence which definitely separates it from the rest of the franchise without a doubt.Speaking of Old Man Logan, it is perhaps because of that comic that Logan the film bares far more similarities to an entirely different genre of film: the western. It is comparable to something like John Wayne's final film The Shootist which touches on many of the same themes of an old legend coming to terms with his morality and legacy while also passing on the torch to the next generation. The cinematography even evokes the genre in the film's opening and closing acts to a large extent with sweeping vistas of often bleak landscapes. There's also scenes set in a casino, horses, and the modern equivalent of the little guy being squeezed out by the rich cattle baron's men. The film even goes so far as to feature footage from and to pay homage to one of that genre's best known works in the form of the 1953 film Shane. Also, taking a cue perhaps from the aforementioned Old Man Logan, the film is something of a road trip film that gives us a tour of the US in the post-mutant age. The result of these factors coming together is a film that is far different in tone and better made than any of its predecessors. Yet, one left the cinema without the sense of 'Wow' that a film like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight left me with. Maybe it's the lack of a thoroughly menacing antagonist (though the combination of both Boyd Holbrook and Richard E. Grant is quite effective) or the fact that, if one stops and thinks about it, the action sequences become repetitive after awhile. For a reason or reasons I can't quite put my finger on, Logan didn't leave me with the same sense of having watched a genre being reshaped in front of me that I was left with at the end of Nolan's seminal film (which this film has often been compared to).While it is not perhaps the instant classic that some have made it out to be, there is plenty of reasons to see Logan. It is far and away the best X-Men related film we've had to date and one of the strongest comic book films out there at the moment. There's also its performances and its overall look and tone, something which makes it that rare film that defies expectations. Above all else though, it delivers a worthy last act to Hugh Jackman's long career in the role. For those wishing to see how to give a performer a proper exit from an iconic role, this is a prime example of how to do that right.",8,3,7,29 May 2017
Dark Shadows," A Bloody Mess
","Translating television shows to the big screen is part and parcel of popular film-making dating back to the 1950s. So it was no surprise that Dark Shadows, the legendary Gothic horror soap opera that ran from 1966-1971, came back to the big screen in 2012. Unlike the earlier low-budget films made after the show's demise, this one was to be a big budget star vehicle from director Tim Burton with a cast that included Johnny Depp. On the surface, it looked to be a wonder mix of a director and star getting the chance to bring a mutual favorite of theirs to life once more. What it became instead was something of a mess.To be fair, translating any long running program to the big screen would be a challenge. Never mind if that series ran for something like 1200 episodes like Dark Shadows did while covering everything from vampires to witches, werewolves, and ghosts not to mention usual soap opera tropes like family secrets and twisted relationships. Yet for its opening twenty-odd minutes, Burton and his writers (John August and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter writer Seth Grahame-Smith) seem to do it as they quickly introduce the series most famous character, the vampire Barnabas Collins (played by Depp) and set the stage for the film's main setting: the Maine town of Collinsport in 1972. For these opening minutes, it's a wonderful Gothic film full of atmosphere and menace as Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) is introduced to the Collins family and their home. It doesn't last very long though.Sadly, once Depp's Barnabas reappears, the film can't figure out what it's meant to be. Is it an adaptation of the TV series? Is it a Gothic horror film? Is it a parody of the series? Instead of picking any one of those (which, under Burton's direction, would undoubtedly have been interesting), the script tries to be all three. For nearly ninety minutes of its running time, the film moves along from one genre to the other. Worse, it often does so within the same scene which leaves scenes feeling even weirder than one might normally expect within a Tim Burton film. One never knows where to laugh, cringe, or be scared and the result is a film that is immensely unsatisfying to say the least.It also plays merry havoc with every single performance in the film. Depp's Barnabas has some good moments but the ever shifting nature of the film, especially the attempts to make it comedic, never give him anything really solid enough to play with. The havoc really takes its toll on the usually reliable Eva Green as the villainous witch Angelique who instead gives a performance that, outside of her appearance in the film's opening minutes, becomes overplayed to the point of lacking either menace or humor. The rest of the cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haley, and Jonny Lee Miller are all effectively wasted as nobody gets anything solid to do in the film with Carter and Miller in particular playing parody versions of their TV counterparts. Of the entire cast, Bella Heathcote as Victoria Winters fares better but largely because her character becomes the audience's in-road to the Collins' family and by her becoming Depp's love interest, something that allows her to shine ahead of almost everyone else. It's a potentially good cast let down by a poor script.Yet the film does have some positive attributes. The aforementioned opening minutes are superb with the combination of script, Burton's direction, and production values creating a wonderful atmosphere that the film then throws away. Even in the lackluster parts of the film, the production values are first rate though. The 1972 setting of the film is interesting with 1970s fashions conflicting nicely with the Gothic mansion. Indeed, Collinwood itself is a wonderful piece of pastiche Gothic design though Burton has always had that on his side. There's a number of nice cameos as well including some members of the original Dark Shadows cast that eagle eyed viewers might spot. If one was to rate the film on style instead of substance, it would be pretty good.Yet for all of its aesthetic attributes, Tim Burton's film of Dark Shadows is a mess. The biggest fault lies in with a script that can't ever quite make up its mind what kind of story it's trying to tell which in turn leaves virtually the entire cast out to dry. The opening minutes hint at a film that could have been good but instead it feels like a trailer for a film that should have been made but wasn't. Bigger isn't always better and this film is a perfect example of how not to bring a TV series to the big screen.",3,6,10,24 October 2016
The Good Shepherd," The Best Spy Film Since The Spy Who Came In From The Cold
","Not since 1965's classic The Spy Who Came In From The Cold has a spy film taken on the murky world of Cold War espionage in such a realistic fashion. The Good Shepherd takes the potentially boring story of the founding of the CIA and turns it into one of the compelling dramas you will ever see. Thanks especially to great writing and terrific acting, this film makes history come alive.The film's two leads, Matt Damon (Edward Wilson) and Angelina Jolie (Wilson's wife Clover), have both been involved in more action driven spy thrillers. This film gives them the chance to flex their terrific acting mussels. Damon is an engaging actor and he becomes Edward Wilson. He is both hero and villain throughout the film and one watches as the young idealist becomes a hard cold warrior. He fits into the world of the film so well that at times one could forget you are looking at an actor. Jolie is the emotionally torn wife who, in her words 'lives with a ghost' and the film is, in my mind at least, at least as much about her journey through the times as Edward's. Behind them is a strong supporting cast who make way too many brief appearances. William Hurt's Philip Allen is the mentor of sorts to Edward and he is not as he seems. The same is true for Arch Cummings, played excellently by Billy Crudup, and the defector played by John Sessions. On top of them are the virtual cameos by Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, Timothy Hutton, and Joe Pesci. Each of them tells an important part of the story though and without them the film would not be the same. And then there is Eddie Redmayne, who plays the son of Edward Wilson. His performance is stand-out and I suspect there may be a future for this guy.The writing is a ture masterpiece. While the film is certainly not a documentary (there are numerous factual errors of dates) is does make the past come alive. Many of the scenes and techniques are based on real events and techniques used by the CIA. The history of the CIA's founding and early years from its beginnings in Yale's Skull and Bones through the WWII organization of the OSS and all the way to the disaster at the Bay of Pigs is full of a lot of facts that could have bogged down any film. Yet Eric Roth's script does exactly the opposite. Whiel loaded with facts, the script never loses site of the human drama unfolding in the midst of the events. Not to mention so many excellent pieces of dialouge used in the film including one of my favorite lines:'You're the guys that scare me. You're the people that make big wars.''No, we make sure the wars are small ones.'The rest of the film's production values are excellent as well. The sets are amazing and the use of real locations helps out immensily as well. The music score is at times haunting and never fails to hit the right emotional cord. Then there is the excellent cinematography by Robert Richardson. The film is a visual masterpiece on its own without either the acting or script to back it. Director Deniro brings power to the screen and even in what might be an otherwise boring moment our attention is rivited to the screen. To be honest I am surprised by the lack of attention given to this film by an of the major awards. The Good Shepherd is the best spy film in more then four decades (the last one being of course 1965's The Spy Who Came In From The Cold) and that is saying something. This is not only a history lesson, it is a study of those who keep us safe and the price they pay for it. If there is anyone who doubts both the power of espionage and the price one pays for it this is a film they must see. Don't miss this film.",10,3,7,24 April 2007
X-Men: First Class," X-Men: In The Beginning
","We seem to be in the midst of the summer of franchise building and rebuilding this year. As such then, it perhaps shouldn't come as any surprise that a new movie that restarts the series based on the Marvel Comics X-Men character's has been released. Yet to dismiss X-Men: First Class as simply being little more then just yet another movie that is starting (or in this case restarting) a franchise would be wrong. It is that, but it's also something more then just that.Considering the mark left by the previous X-Men cast, the casting of this movie is all important and the results are fantastic. James McAvoy as Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr (aka Magneto) both take roles upon which huge marks were left by two very well known actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen respectively) and very much make them there own, especially in McAvoy's case. Indeed the entire cast of young actors and actresses does well including Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert, Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy aka Beast and January Jones as Emma Frost. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie is the villainous mutant Sebastian Shaw played by Kevin Bacon, who clearly enjoys the chance to play a bad guy and is a fine villain at that. Backing them is a supporting cast made up of fine character actors including Oliver Platt as the 'man in black suit' (seriously that's how he's credited), Matt Craven as CIA Director John McCone and Don Creech as William Stryker plus a couple of nice cameos from two previous X-Men stars. The result overall is a nicely acted movie all round.The production values work well in bringing the 1962 setting of the movie to life. Indeed the production design of Chris Seagers is highly evocative of the Ken Adam designed sets of the 1960s James Bond movies (indeed the movie seems to replicate Ken Adams Pentagon war room set from Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr Strangelove) especially with their now retro-futuristic feel. The costume design does much the same job of evoking the era, especially with the costumes for the X-Men and the female character's. The use of archival footage to set-up the Cuban Missile Crisis and the threat of nuclear war also highly evokes the era as well in a way that neither sets nor costumes can. Mention should also be made of the score by Henry Jackman which, though not necessarily evocative of the era, is nevertheless a good score that adds much to the movie as any good score should.After three X-Men movies and a prequel movie for Wolverine, First Class restarts the franchise by taking us to the earliest years of the X-Men. The year is 1962, the year that the world found itself on the brink of nuclear war with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Suppose, just suppose for a moment, that a plot by power hungry mutant Sebastian Shaw to destroy humanity and cause the rise of the mutants was behind the entire crisis? That in a nutshell is the plot of the movie. True, it has more historical errors then I can list at the moment but, for once, I'm excusing it. Especially as without them there would be no climatic battle and what would a superhero action movie be without that?Thankfully though, the movie does more then just action. Perhaps taking a cue from the 2009 Star Trek film, the story is as much about bringing the character's that have become so well known and giving them a new beginning. Indeed the movie plays up the friendships, rivalries and relationships between the various members of the 'first class'. In particular this restarting of the X-Men series brings the at times testy friendship between Xavier and Erik and the relationship between Mystique and Hank are brought into focus which is made all the more intriguing because we all ready know where both of those are going, even if the latter does evoke some clich√©s in the meantime. The result is a refreshing new beginning.Indeed X-Men: First Class is just that: a refreshing new beginning. From good acting from a new group of X-Men to production values that evoke the 1962 setting, the movie shows a new side to the world of the X-Men. Indeed the script lays much of that groundwork as well with a story that's full of action yet brings the character's into focus as well. As a result, it'll be interesting to see where this 'first class' goes from here after what might well the best X-Men movie to date.",8,0,1,13 June 2011
Casino Royale," Best Bond Film Yet!
","It has taken fifty-three for Casino Royale to make its way to the big screen (not counting a 1954 TV film and 1967 spoof) and it now seems both fitting and ironic that the first, and arguably best, Bond novel should serve as the first Bond film of Daniel Craig. Even more ironic is the fact that one of the best Bond novels has lead to the best Bond film yet.Daniel Craig's debut as Bond is nothing short of stunning. Many wondered if this blond actor better known for his more serious acting roles could be an action hero. The answer: a definite yes. Craig brings a physical magnetism to the part of Bond missing really since the early Sean Connery films and he is believable in all of the films action sequences. But what really sells Craig is his acting abilities. Craig brings a very serious approach to Bond. He is everything Bond should be: cold, ruthless, and capable of being a human being. And when it comes to humor, which a lot of fans were worried about, Craig is just as adept. Any doubts about Craig as Bond, they should be taken away at the very end of the film where Craig gets to say 'The name's Bond James Bond' for the first time. Craig is the best Bond since Timothy Dalton and arguably he has even surpassed Dalton.Eva Green plays Vesper Lynd, the representative from the MI6 sent with Bond on his first major mission as a 00 agent. Green brings a considerable amount of acting ability to this role and she is far from your average Bond girl. While beautiful and truly stunning physically, Green is an actress and she gets to prove it more then really any other Bond girl. Green is truly an amazing Bond girl and a welcomed relief to the stereotypically cardboard Bond girls.Mads Mikkelsen, a relatively unknown Dannish actor, makes an impressive Le Chiffre. Bond villains generally lack either believability or acting ability, especially since in Die Another Day. But there we get arguably the best Bond villain of the series to date. Le Chiffre is a villain, he is after all the man who serves as financier to the world's terrorists. Yet there is a surprising amount of humanity in him. He deformed eye that weeps tears of blood and his sense of both menace and humor make him the most three-dimensional Bond villain and even at times sympathetic. Mikkelson is the new face of Bond villains.The supporting cast is also great. Judi Dench returns as M, the head of MI6. Her scenes with Craig have a sense of menace to them that surpasses similar scenes with Pierce Brosnan. Dench had more or less inhabited the role of M since Goldeneye but in this film she once again makes the role her own. Jeffrey Wright makes a brief, but welcomed appearance as CIA agent Felix Lieter and we can only hope we see more of him in future films. Caterina Murno seems to be little more then window dressing as Solange, a girlfriend of one of the villains, but she leaves one wishing we'd seen more of her in this film.The script is also perhaps the best to be written for a Bond film. Based on the novel by Fleming, the films plot is an update of the plot of Fleming's novel. The plot is realistic and the lack of gadgets doesn't hurt the film at all. The love story, the first in a while, is a nice addition to the film. The lines are well written and time is taken to actually develop the plot to its fullest and Fleming would be, in my opinion, proud of this film adaptation.The action sequences of this film are stunning. From the gritty black and white fight in the opening teaser sequence the to the running sequence in Madagascar to the attempted bombing of Miami international airport to the stairwell fight and the gunfight in the falling house in Venice at the end, the action sequences have a sense of realism missing from many of the Bond films.Campbell, who directed Brosnan's debut in Goldeneye, does another stunning job in this film. Working with cinematographer Phil Meheux (who also did Goldeneye) and editor Stuart Baird, Campbell created a visual style that brings a new sense of style to the series. From the excellently done black and white teaser detailing how Bond got his 00 number, to the shaky hand held sequence during which Bond is poisoned, and the darkness and shadows in the brilliantly done torture sequence, there is a sense of realism. The sets and costumes also help thanks to production designer Peter Lamont and costume designer Lindy Hemming.The music score by David Arnold is the icing on the cake. No longer having to adhere to the typical Bond score, Arnold creates his best Bond score yet and overall the best Bond score since John Barry's score for On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The score uses the Bond theme sparingly and when it comes back in full force at the end you welcome it back. The score makes good sue of a new love theme and sparingly uses electronics that had hampered the previous Arnold scores. The films theme song, You Know My Name by Chris Cornell, is a welcomed addition to the Bond theme songs and is a vast improvement over the last two or three Bond theme songs.With strong performances from the entire cast, one of the best scripts for any Bond film, strong direction from martin Campbell, terrific cinematography and a great score by David Arnold, Casino Royale delivers. This film was meant as a Bond reboot and it has more then done that. It the process of rebooting the series, the filmmakers have created the best Bond film yet.",10,1,4,20 November 2006
Midway," Another Emmerich Spectacle, But This One's True
","Since practically the dawn of cinema, there has been something about war films that have captured the attention of filmmakers and the public alike. Perhaps due to it taking place amid Hollywood's Golden Age, World War II especially has earned something of a prime spot. Midway, the latest film from Rolland Emmerich, proves that interest is still very much alive.In looking over Emmerich's filmography, there are usually three things one can be confident about going in knowing. The first is that he can assemble an excellent cast, and Midway is no exception to that. To tell the story of a tide-turning battle and the man who fought it, he's assembled one that takes in a wide range. There are the comparatively fresh faces of Ed Skrein and Luke Evans as the lead characters, two naval aviators who take viewers into the heat of battle. Elsewhere, established character actors like Patrick Wilson take us into the back rooms, as do the likes of Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson playing Admirals Halsey and Nimitz, respectively, showing the strategies been laid out at the upper levels of command. The Japanese side of the cast is equally steadfast, lead by Etsushi Toyokawa as Admiral Yamamoto. Meanwhile, the civilian side of the war comes from Mandy Moore's character, the wife of Skrien's pilot, though it is something the film doesn't give much time toward portraying. On the whole, though, they do an excellent job bringing the history to life sincerely.The second point of confidence is that an Emmerich film will be a special effects feast. Midway, too, scores on that point. From the attack on Pearl Harbor that comes a short way into the film to the Doolittle raid and the climactic ait attacks during the titular battle, the film does everything in its power to make viewers feel like they're flying alongside these men. Something which the film does with some fine CGI work that creates everything from early war Hawaii, to the ships and planes involved. Combined with all the other tricks of the trade, from the editing of Adam Wolfe to the score from frequent Emmerich collaborators Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser, the result is some of the finest aerial dogfights you're likely to see anytime soon.The final thing on our Emmerich checklist regards the script. As has been the case throughout his career, but especially in the last decade or so, he's a director with a habit of getting ones full of interesting ideas but often cliched or merely functional dialogue. Midway, though based around historical events, does suffer from some of these faults as well, especially where its dialogue is concerned though the actors do their best with it, helping to mitigate the worst of it.On the other hand, it's the historical elements that make Midway stand out. In presenting what is essentially a Cliff Notes version of the early Pacific War, Emmerich and writer Wes Tooke pack a largely accurate history lesson inside an action movie. Viewers get to see battles going down, the decisions leading up to them, and what it was like to face life and death during them. It allows the film to cover a lot of ground in a mere138 minutes, something which isn't always to its advantage (as the short-shifting of things like the Doolittle Raid and an underutilized Aaron Eckhart can attest). Despite that, it's hard not to think of it as the best script he's had since at least 2012 and maybe even longer ago than that.Indeed, one might go so far as to call it Emmerich's best film since that 2009 outing. It has all the ingredients of his better work, as well as some of the flaws, and tells a fascinating real-life story to boot. Along the way, it also proves one adage to still be true: that truth can be just as compelling, and stranger, than fiction.",8,5,7,21 November 2019
300," A Visually Stunning Yet Hollow Film
","Don't believe all the hype. 300 is not the great film that it has been made out to be by many viewers. While it does have some of the most stunning visuals yet done in CGI, the film is hollow in terms of its acting, writing, direction, and practically everything else.The film's main draw is its amazing CGI effects. Here at least the film doesn't fail to live up to expectations. The battle sequences are incredible if one looks at them only if taken at face value. They are what kept my attention during the film and the fact that the entire film is practically nothing more then CGI is a good thing because otherwise this film would have been a complete waste. The CGI effects might be great, but they certainly can not make up for the lack of other elements in the film.Everything else in the film is effectively a hollow shell. The acting is among the worst you will see in a major release though I will Gerad Butler credit for trying to make the best of the truly terrible script he was handed. What makes actors of his caliber do these types of mindless films is beyond reason. Outisde of him the entire cast should have been fired and replaced by someone a little more capable of acting. The writing is horrendous. The historical battle was thrown out of the window entirely. The dialouge is every clich√© we have come to expect from any ancient epic movie Hollywood has ever produced. There is not a single memorable piece of dialouge I came out of this film with and I certainly don't plan on wasting my money to go see this again. I understand the want to bring the Frank Miller graphic novel tot the screen but do we have to throw out everything real about the battle out do it? I mean, when you are stripping warriors almost entirely out of their armor and changing battle formations just so they, in the words of director Zack Snyder, 'look cool' then what is the point of a film? The answer: none at all. In short, if you are looking for some mindless action film then go see this. If you re looking for something more intelligent then avoid this film like the plague. Might I recommend waiting for this to come out on DVD and then renting it instead of wasting money by seeing it in a theater. You won't regret it.",2,24,51,28 March 2007
The Thin Red Line," Mallick Takes The War Film To The Art House
","When one reads or hears the term 'war movie,' it brings with a certain amount of baggage. One perhaps thinks of the British war films of the 1940s and 1950s with stiff upper lips or Hollywood epics such as The Longest Day or Patton or Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Then you get a film that has the apparent look of the genre but is something quite different when viewed closer. The Thin Red Line, Terrence Mallick's 1998 film based on James Jones' 1962 novel set during the US Guadalcanal Campaign against the Japanese during World War II, is just such a film.For one thing, this film is without many of the pretentious things war film clich√É¬©s and tropes. There's no big speeches about patriotism or glory or the righteousness of the cause being fought for. Not a single one of the characters presented here likely cares or thinks about that. These are ordinary men in extraordinary situations, some in the Army before the war started, others caught up in events that see there fates bringing them to this small Pacific island. As a result, their reactions to the battle are many and varied. They range from bravery to boisterous, brutality to thoughtfulness and a whole sweep of emotions in-between. The choice of voiceovers is intriguing, giving word to the emotions and thought processes taking place in the minds and behind the eyes of many of the soldiers the viewer meets. Indeed much of the film is based on those emotions rather than huge, sweeping battle sequences which is something that is likely to upset some viewers. Yet it may be for the film's betterment.For it's brought to life by a series of strong performances. The film's cast is massive including both name actors in small roles and then unknowns who've gone on to greater fame is some cases all playing soldiers of varying ranks caught up in the incredible campaign. It's hard to argue that the film has any central character though both Jim Caviezel as the thoughtful Private Witt and Sean Penn's pragmatic bordering on cynical Sergeant Welsh come closest to that with their very different reactions to the events taking place around them. The film's massive cast includes Elias Koteas, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson with cameos by Miranda Otto, John Travolta and George Clooney as well. The combination of on screen performances and voice overs present one of the most unique mixes of talent one is ever likely to watch.As well as its strong performances and interesting emphasis on the human cost of war, the film is also a visual feast. Mallick and cinematographer John Toll set The Thin Red Line apart from many 'war films' with lush cinematography that contrasts the beauty of the Pacific and Guadalcanal with the horror and violence of the battle being fought there. Sequences such as the film's opening and closing minutes are superb examples of this from both before and after the battle. Plus, for all of its focus on the human cost, the film's battle sequences are each superb examples of well staged and photographed chaos that celebrates not the triumph of victory but the desperation of men trying to stay alive. Backed by a haunting Hans Zimmer score that also incorporates music by John Powell, the result is powerful.At the end of the day, The Thin Red Line is an unlikely mixing of an art house flick and a big budget Hollywood war film. It is a feast for the senses with its combination of striking visuals, superbly staged chaotic battle sequences and a haunting music score. Yet it's more than a typical war film as it examines the effects of war on the men who fight it and the contrast between the beauty of the island with the horror and chaos afflicted upon it. The film remains a unique look at war from one of cinema's most unique directors.",9,6,10,6 March 2016
Spectre," Looking Backwards & Forwards With 007
","It has been three years now since Skyfall opened to rave reviews and became the most successful James Bond film to date. If anyone had any doubts that Daniel Craig had what it took to be 007, chances are they were silenced by Skyfall. The only question then was how to top it? The answer would seem to be equal parts look backwards and forwards with the release of Spectre, the twenty-fourth Bond film from Eon Productions and Craig's fourth outing as the British secret agent with a license to kill. Craig's performance here, his first in any film post-Skyfall, combines all the best elements of his Bond performances to date. There's his agility in the action sequences which suits him well but also a more sensitive side that remains buried most of the time but does surface, perhaps more here than in any other Bond film including Skyfall, where Bond's past comes back to haunt him in more ways than one. Craig also gets the chance, for the first time since Casino Royale, to explore Bond's romantic side as well. Overall, there's a more confident feel to Craig's Bond this time around that comes through that serves both actor and film well. One place where the film perhaps improves over Skyfall is in its leading female character in the form of up and coming French actress L√©a Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann. Swann certainly fits the more traditional Bond girl mold though without many of the clich√©s that go along with the role as she's clearly intelligent but there's also a vulnerability to her when she, like Bond, is forced to confront elements of her past that have remained buried for so long. It is that element that Seydoux plays marvelously as the character's layers are exposed. It also helps that Seydoux and Craig share some excellent chemistry together which makes their relationship all the more believable. Perhaps the most interesting piece of casting was Christoph Waltz as its villain. Waltz certainly didn't disappoint though the character's identity was easily figured out by simply looking at the film's title. What is more interesting that his identity is Waltz's performance which makes this perhaps the best iteration of the character we've seen thanks to a performance that is never over the top but cool and calculating. He's not a physical match for Bond but is every bit his intellectual equal, something that Waltz seems to instinctively sense. The result is a solid performance and one that works well within the film. The film's supporting cast is solid as well. There's the returning cast of Bond's MI6 allies including Ralph Fiennes as M and Ben Whishaw's excellent Q who continues to make an excellent foil for Craig's Bond. Joining the supporting cast for this film is Andrew Scott as British government official Max Denbigh and Dave Bautista as the henchman Hinx who both do well with the limited amount of material they're given to work with. One minor disappointment is that after the hype of Italian actress Monica Bellucci joining the cast, her role is effectively a cameo with a grand total of maybe seven minutes worth of screen time for a sequence that has an uncomfortable air to it. Moving beyond the cast, Spectre features some of the best production values of any film in the franchise which perhaps isn't surprising given reports that this is the most expensive Bond film yet produced. The production design from Dennis Gassner and the cinematography of Hoyte Van Hoytema are superb at evoking not just the look but the feel of the film's varying locations which makes it a visual feast. There is also an impressive opening shot of the film which lasts a couple of minutes at least and might well be, on a technical level at least, one of the most impressive shots ever put into a Bond film. All of which are admirable to say the least.After the impressive action sequences of Skyfall, Spectre had a challenge ahead of it. While it never tops previous Bond action sequences, it is certainly a thrill ride. From the slightly overblown opening chase in and above the celebrations for the Day Of The Dead to a car chase through Rome and a series of gun battles, the film puts all of the best action tropes of the series to good use though it never quite manages to top the same type of sequences which have come before. In a way that sums up the film itself rather nicely, especially in regards to its script.The script is where Spectre is at its most mixed. Despite the return of the same writing team from Skyfall and the addition of Jez Butterworth to the writing team, the script lacks a sense of polish to it at times. While it does an admirable job of tying together the entire Craig era, the basic idea is bringing back elements that the series hasn't used in over forty years and bringing them into the present day. As a result, the script does little more than retread old territory and attempt to give it a new face, something that has often produced less than stellar results in the past such as A View To A Kill or Die Another Day. That isn't to say, as some have said, that this is the worst Bond film as it definitely isn't that but it seems to lack the spark that made Skyfall especially standout.At the end of the day, Spectre is a good Bond film. It has a solid performance from Craig as well as the rest of the cast along with impressive production values and good action sequences. Yet its script seems to largely play it safe, retreading old territory while also tying together elements from previous films. Spectre is a good Bond film but one that should have been a great.",8,6,14,8 November 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A Visceral, If At Times Clich√©d, Piece Of Work
","Real life has always proved to be fruitful ground for filmmakers, dating right back to the beginnings of film. Stories set at times of war, especially those with a heroic angle, have been particular favorites. In a way, Mel Gibson's latest film Hacksaw Ridge follows in that tradition as it recounts the story of Desmond Doss who earned the U.S military's highest award for honor and bravery without ever firing a shot. It's a visceral and at times inspiring tale.The film is anchored by its lead actor, British actor Andrew Garfield (best known for the title role in the two Amazing Spider-Man movies). Despite being British, Garfield plays the role of a young man coming from Appalachia exceedingly well right down to his accent. Garfield is the film's focus and he plays the various aspects of Doss well from young man in West Virginia to someone who goes on to do something truly incredible. In fact, Garfield's performance is superior to the material he sometimes has to work from but nevertheless remains an often effective and even moving performance.Having said that, now seems a good moment to talk about the script from writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan. Bringing true stories to the screen is, as I said above, part and parcel of what Hollywood does. That a good deal of the actual events make their way to the screen is something that is commendable though the film's first half sees it engaging it a significant amount of hyperbole and clich√© regarding Doss' life before the war as well as his treatment by his Army unit, including a court-martial sequence that is largely a work of fiction. That the film has a strong faith based message to it is clear, though not out of place given both its subject better and it being a real-life story. That the film tries to cite this as part of an ongoing 21st century political narrative of 'a war on Christians' come across quite hollow and does the film no favors.Indeed the film really finds its feet when it moves on to firmer territory: the Battle of Okinawa and the attempt to take the titular Hacksaw Ridge. Though it seems to condense things down to a single day and night, by and large this part of the film faithfully tells Doss' truly incredible efforts during one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific theater of war. Not that events needed much hyperbole because the facts alone are incredible enough. Gibson as director presents a visceral portrait of battle, one that is free of more traditional war film heroics but most certainly full of 'the fog of war' and which finds moments of absolute terror as well. For all the faults with the first half of the film, it's latter half makes for compelling viewing. Though it isn't always easy viewing. This portion of the film is not for the faint of heart as Gibson, who showed he was not afraid of gore in his two earlier outings as director, used it to full effect here. Here though it is used in service of conveying an incredible real story from the comparative recent past and which helps to convey the magnitude of what Doss went through. It speaks to the skills of not Gibson as director but to the stunt, effects, and make-up teams in bring this harrowing vision to life.Indeed from a purely production side of things, the film is solid. The production design and costumes do a very nice job of recreating America on the brink of and during the Second World War even before it gets to the battlefield. The cinematography of Simon Duggan is something to behold across the length of the film as it takes in not just the inherent natural beauty of Appalachia but half a world away to the bombed out island of Okinawa. It's also interesting that the film doesn't put much reliance on CGI effects or at least on all too apparent ones. The results make for a solid recreation of the era as well as a well produced film.That phrase could very well sum up Hacksaw Ridge as a film. It's a well produced piece of work with a compelling and believable performance from its leading an. Though the film's first half often delves too far into the bags of hyperbole and clich√©, the second half of the film becomes one of the most visceral and inspiring pieces of film-making in recent memory. it may not be a perfect film but it is definitely a good one that is more than worthy of viewing.",8,3,7,8 November 2016
Donnie Darko," A Thought-Provoking Modern Masterpiece
","(Note: Review is based on the Director's Cut version) This film is one of those films you truly have to see to both believe and understand. To be perfectly honest I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film the first time I saw it due to its, for lack of a better term, strangeness but upon repeated viewings the film begins to make sense and you'll begin to appreciate the intricate plotting of Richard Kelly's script, the fine acting of the cast, and the overall excellence of the film Donnie Darko.Jake Gyllenhaal is the one who carries the film and his performance is nothing short of hypnotic to watch. Gyllenhaal is perfect in the role as the weird, troubled, and confused title character. Gyllenhaal never steps out of character and it is his performance that keeps you glued to the screen even during some of the film's weirdest and confusing moments. In short, the talent that he has that would appear during the years that followed this film's release is seen here in an inkling.The rest of the cast is not very far behind Gyllenhaal in terms of their performances. Jena Malone gives a surprising performance as Donnie's girlfriend and she is in many ways the emotional anchor of the film. She is also the source of sanity for Donnie throughout the film as it goes along and even she is drawn into whatever is effecting Donnie. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell play Donnie's parents who seem not to be sure of what to make of their son's unusual hallucinations. Added to the family is Donnie's sisters played by the seemingly innocent Daveigh Chase and with, a nice sense of sibling rivalry, by Gyllenhall's sister Maggie. Add to these appearances by Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore & Noah Wyle as the authority figures of Donnie's life plus Patrick Swayze as some self-motivator and the highly unusual appearance of Frank (played by James Duval) and you get a spectacular cast.And now onto the script. Richard Kelly has managed to create a script that is both gripping, well-textured, and confusing as hell upon the first viewing (or two). The script is layer upon layer of story, character development, and a plot involving parallel universes and time travel (I think). The script explores issues of acceptance, existence, and everything short of and including the meaning of life. Not east stuff to get the first time around but as I wrote above, repeated viewings makes it easier to understand (plus the fact that Richard Kelly himself has said the film is open to one's own interpretation). In short, the most confusing film script since 2001: A Space Odyssey is the only way I can really describe Donnie Darko.Beyond the script lies a film masterpiece. The film is beautifully photographed from start to finish, starting with the sweeping opening shot of Donnie and ending with the waving between characters at the end of the film. The music score for the film is an interesting combination of well-chosen pop songs (including the opening song 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS and the hypnotic 'Mad World') and a well done score by Michael Andrews to create a hypnotic soundtrack to an hypnotic film. Add to this some weird special effects to Donnie's visions and it is a journey into¬Öwell something (as I said this is one of those 'you figure out what it means' films).Overall, Donnie Darko is a masterpiece of modern film-making. With an exceptional performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, fine performances from the rest of the cast, an intricately layered script, beautiful photographed, well scored, and being truly hypnotic, Donnie Darko is a must see for anyone who wants to take a though-provoking two plus hours and go into the unknown. See this as soon as possible. You won't regret it.",10,15,26,10 January 2007
Valkyrie," 'We Must Show The World That Not All Of Us Are Like Him.'
","It was the plot that could have changed the course of the Second World War. On July 20th, 1944 a group of Germans opposed to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and led by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg detonated a bomb at Hitler's eastern front headquarters before they launched a coup. Bryan Singer's 2008 film Valkyrie is the Hollywood film that dramatizes that plot. Now for the big questions: is it a good history lesson and is it a good film? Leading the film's cast is Hollywood actor Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. In a way Cruise was a perfect choice for the role as he bares a striking resemblance to the real life Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Other then that, Cruise seems to have been miscast in the role. Cruise has never been one of the world's greatest actors and in Valkyrie that fact is apparent. Though Cruise wisely underplays through much of the film but there are moments when he just seems to be overacting if not melodramatic at times such as when he screams 'Heil Hitler!' at General Fromm or his overacted nervousness when setting the bomb. It doesn't help that Cruise is cast alongside some of the best character actors in the world which makes those very things all the more obvious. Cruise's performance then can all only be called mixed then.The rest of the cast is superb. There's the performance of the actors portraying Stauffenberg's various fellow conspirators including Bill Nighy as General Olbricht, Christian Berkel as Colonel von Quirnheim, Terence Stamp as General Beck, Eddie Izzard as Fellgiebel, Jamie Parker as Stauffenberg's adjutant and a short but memorable turn from Kenneth Branagh as General von Tresckow. Those imposing them include Tom Wilinson as the fence sitting General Fromm, Tom Hollander as the ever suspicious Colonel Brandt, Kenneth Cranham as Field Marshal Keitel and of course David Bamber as Hitler himself. There are also some good supporting performances from Carice van Houten as Stauffenberg's wife Nina and the various children who add a personal dimension to this historical event. The result is a well-acted film from most of its cast.A historical film relies heavily on its production values to set the era and mood in which it is set. Both the production design and the costumes go a long way to establishing the reality of the film though of course there are moments (such as the church seen early in the film) when things are changed just a bit for dramatic effect. The cinematography of Newton Thomas Sigel, while not evocative of the era specifically, nevertheless does a fine job of giving the film a strong sense of atmosphere and mood, especially in the build up the plot's executions. The success of the film as a historical thriller is helped out immensely by one of the best scores to date from composer John Ottman who also does a good job editing the film as well. The production values are superb in their recreation of Second World War Germany and setting the mood of the film as a thriller.Valkyrie is, first and foremost, a thriller albeit one with a historical setting. The script from Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander sets that out and director Bryan Singer uses it to the film's advantage. Once the film first ten minutes or so that shows us both Stauffenberg's questioning of Hitler and his injury in North Africa, the film becomes a constantly tense piece of work as first one plot fails, then planning begins on another plot and onwards the film goes. It's a film well-suited to Singer and even better is that, as a film, it is a well written thriller as well.The question remains though: is it a good history lesson? For the most part it is just that and it's a serious one at that. It gets across what the plot was, what it set out to do and who the men were behind it all. It shows the moments of moral uncertainty, indecision and at times downright misfortune that threatened the plot and its plotters. Being a film it of course condenses more then a year's worth of events into two hours and this means that certain events (such as Stauffenberg drawing inspiration for the plot from listening to Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries which the real Stauffenberg disliked) are created for dramatic purposes. For the most part though the film accurately portrays events as they happened albeit in condensed form.So does Valkyrie succeed as both a film and as a history lesson then? For the most part the answer is yes to both questions. Yet the miscasting of Tom Cruise in the all important role of Colonel von Stauffenberg is something that hurts the film quite a bit. As a result the film is a good one but one wonders if it couldn't have been better somehow. But as a historical thriller, there's no doubt that Valkyrie is a success.",8,0,0,4 July 2011
The Martian," Faithful To The Novel & A Fantastic Film
","Hollywood seems to have a strong affinity for adaptations, some good and some not so much. It was with some interest then that I came to The Martian then. Adapted from the novel by Andy Weir, featuring an all-star cast and directed by Alien and Blade Runner director Ridley Scott, it certainly promised to be interesting and potentially good as well. Did it live up to those expectations? Oh yes it did. Part of the film's success lies in its casting. Matt Damon was well cast as astronaut Mark Watney, the botanist on NASA's Ares Three mission who, thought dead by his crew members when a dust storm forces them to abort their mission, finds himself in a struggle to survive with minimal supplies and little chance for rescue. Damon perfectly captures Watney: determined, ingenious and good humored, but not a perfect human being by any means. It's something that's endearing as we see him become frustrated, angry at himself for his mistakes while also being aware that he has little time (or anything else for that matter) to waste if he's going to survive. The humor leads to some of the film's best moments while also getting across in some of the film's quieter moments the sometimes sheer loneliness of being the only human on an entire planet. It's an effective performance and one that anchors the film.Backing Damon up is a strong supporting cast. Highlights includes the ever excellent Jessica Chastain as Ares Three's mission commander Lewis, Jeff Daniels as the NASA administrator, Sean Bean as mission control flight director and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor who is overseeing the Ares missions. Even smaller roles are well cast including Kristen Wigg as NASA spokeswoman Annie Montrose as well as Benedict Wong and Donald Glover as scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Together they bring the Earth-based and non-Mars space sections of the film to life and do so rather nicely which helps the film immensely.It also helps that there are some stunning production values on display as well. The highlight of the film visually is one of the best cinematic renderings of Mars yet produced through a combination of filming in one of the most Mars like locations here on Earth (Wadi Rum in Jordan) as well as a combination of special effects. The special effects in general are a highlight of the film including striking visuals of Mars from space as well as some impressive looking space hardware including the Hermes which transports the crew to Mars and back again. The production design and costume work extrapolates on current NASA plans and technology and comes with realistic takes on what might actually be used in a mission like the one portrayed in the film. All of this falls under the direction of Ridley Scott who presents, like he did with Blade Runner, a fascinating vision of the near-future though one that is perhaps more likely to come to pass. Together, they bring the film to life.The icing on the cake though may well be the script which, as I hoped, stayed pretty faithful to Andy Weir's novel. The tone, humor and the overwhelming majority of major events from the novel are all reproduced here though in some cases incidents are simplified due to screen-time, often I suspect due to the lack of time for the some technical exposition that Weir used in the novel. In other places, the script enhances the drama of events, especially in its final sequences, all of which is forgivable as they do add to the drama as well as changing things up just a little bit for those who've read the novel. Rarely has a film captured its source material as well as this film does, especially its aforementioned climax which reproduced all of the tension and excitement of its prose counterpart.What's important though is that it captures the heart of Weir's novel. At its heart, The Martian is the tale of one human being on a desolate world in a struggle to survive. This is a tale of how we are capable of surmounting the seemingly impossible with a little know how and MacGyver like ingenuity and creativity. Yet, and perhaps just as importantly, this is also a story of human fallibility as often Watney's decisions and actions lead to unexpected consequences that he has to deal with. The result of all this is that, as cinematic adaptations go, it's one of the most successful efforts in recent memory.The Martian then is a success by almost every measurement. It features a strong performance from its lead actor backed up by a strong supporting cast, features equally strong production values that bring near-future space exploration to life wonderfully while also remaining largely faithful to the events and soul of its source material. As both an adaptation and as a film on its own, it stands up very well indeed. What more can you ask of it?",9,3,6,17 October 2015
