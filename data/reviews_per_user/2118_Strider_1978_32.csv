Skyfall," Yes you should,
","Doing this primarily to balance the negative reviews. This one requires patience and the will to follow *it* without making assumptions. There are rewards for patient, and it will not satisfy those who wish to sit wide eyed while one hand stuffs the face with popcorn. Daniel Craig brings *his* Bond forward with a firm grasp on the reins, and while he isn't Sean Connery he *is* James Bond. Go and see this in IMAX for full effect, but be prepared to sit and follow without fireworks every five seconds, and keep an open mind. The cast are very strong, those who aren't don't matter. This film is for the discerning Bond fan and not someone satisfied with lesser flick, as we got in previous installments. I'm still thinking about it 24 hours after watching it, and I for one want more.",10,9,21,10 November 2012
Training Day," Good cop Bad Leutenant
","This is a good movie, but not perhaps for the same reasons as a lot of people will give merit for. Denzel Washington is on form, won't deny that. The film is well shot, a look at the darker side of LA.I think watching this again, that it does look a little silly and stereotypical sometimes. Blacks and Hispanics and college kids. Also, some of the events or shots or scripting does seem a little 'theatrical' and 'staged', rather than flowing in such a way that we can 'buy' the story. That being said, it does deliver the goods. Training day is one of these films that is not really escapism, it is just a fictional story. The real world of law enforcement can be and is (within reason) a dirty and corrupt empire. It's easier to have a Black or Hispanic scapegoat, or somebody to pull over just for kicks or for another notch in the Detective post.It's an enjoyable watch. I'm not sure how I would feel about it if the two leads were not who they were. Washington rules the roost, and the camera. Hawke plays the honest, determined and somewhat under confident rookie very effectively. I like films like this, and No Country for Old men, and Traffic simply because they help remind me that I do not live in a a perfumed world, and sometimes it is merely sugar coated.",7,0,1,17 April 2008
Se7en," A dark, mature port, nothing to dilute this one.
","This picture takes some considerable constitution to watch, to endure.Se7en is not a nice film.The sets and locations are dark, gritty, grimy, nasty and bleak. There are no bright hues, nothing flashy or rosy to welcome the viewer.What grabs us first(perhaps) are the very real homes of Det. Mills and Det. Sommerset. There are sound effects of the police sirens passing by. There are the muffled sounds of neighbours through the walls. There is the ticking of various clocks.This looks a lot like 'real' life.It's quite hard for me to put a lot of this into words. The investigation, after the subsequent finding of the first victim takes Mills and Sommerset, and the film viewer into a dark, seedy world where the crimes performed by the 'killer' are inspired by the seven deadly sins. It's important, I feel to view se7en from time to time, simply to make us feel better about our own life. The score and the sound effects fit the dirty, nasty unforgiving feel of the film. You arn't sure if it's John Doe that is the enemy or the world outside. I'm sure as I type in the safety of my own home somebody somewhere is committing an unspeakable crime. Maybe they will be caught. Maybe they won't.The acting very good from the main characters, and solid from the lessors. The interesting part of me is looking at how Mills and Sommerset work as a team, being of an entirely different nature. Sommerset is calm, collected, intellectual, elloquent, subtle and wise. Sommerset is like a sniffer dog released from the pound after a long and tedious stay. Grumpy, intolerant, verbally unrefined, impatient, yet with a good heart.All of the crimes shown strike cords within us. Some more horrific than others; all thought provoking and psychologically challenging. Just how *do* you continue to eat, completely full and unable to swallow another mouthfull . .only there is a gun to your head and the trigger will end your life it you stop .. It's hard to recommend this one to anyone. Film fans i.e those who appreciate a well made movie will be on the edge or their seat come the building chase. Others will look on in partial disgust, partial intrigue as the camera shows the horrific detail of John Doe's methodical skills.What un-nerves me, is to think that out there there is a John Doe out here. He's not count Dracula, he's not Jack the ripper. He is a normal man, perhaps enjoying a simple life. We might see him in the food market or the pharmacy. We might see him and acknowledge him, or we might not. That individual has a darker plan in his mind that you or I or any *good* people could conceive of, and we won't know until something happens. There are no apologies and no compromises. This is a brilliant, bleak, horrific and psychologically damaging look at the darker side of human nature. Highly recommended for those of a mature mindset.",10,3,4,23 November 2006
Star Trek," Interstellar gets a true inter-generation treatment.
","I want to give it a ten, I truly do. I'll keep this short, or as short as I can keep it Jim.It's a truly mesmerizing, accomplished piece of cinema. There are just a couple of things that mean it doesn't strike the bullseye this time around. No doubt this will be revised, but here is version 1.From start to finish ST entertains. In the 'downtime' the visuals and homages make it impossible to tear our eyes from the screen let alone take a bathroom break. We went to the IMAX, and it is there that good heavens, I've almost flown in space.I'm not a 'Trekkie' or 'Trekker', I'm merely a geek who likes and appreciates the show but did not grow up on it. This does not matter. For once, somehow they manage to make a film that has something for everyone .. for everyone without being distasteful with the usual obligatory adult humour. They bring ST into the millenia without any real compromise to the spirit. It's like they took the series and gave it a completely new gloss without changing or barbarising the characters. There is evident care and attention to detail, it's plain to see. All the actors are strong. The only really niggle, if I had to have one would be that Zachary Quinto. If you don't know his name you soon will, it will be a fluent household name soon- is 98 percent on par with 'Spock'. He has the character, he's put work in, there is just a very narrow margin between theatrical acting and the complete embodiment of 'Spock'. I'm not asking for Spock Spock, it's just that he appears to be swimming in the waters of the character without being completely confident to surf the waves seamlessly. This will come in time, it's not an easy role to take on. The favourites, it would appear besides J Tiberius himself (and Spock) are Dr. McCoy and Nimoy himself. Karl Urban has never sounded so good. What an actor, Eomer then Bourne 2 assassin and now a character I feel he was almost born to play. Scotty doesn't appear until a good two thirds into the film, but his is an instantly applauded crowd pleaser. They could not have selected a better actor. Simon Pegg is to films and sci-fi what Gordon Ramsey is to food. The rest of the cast are very enjoyable, strength where there is room for weakness and gaping potholes just waiting for the wrong kind of laughter. It's 11:30 at night and I need to wrap this up. One last minor gripe that robs it of the ten (at least on my first viewing) is some of the camera work. On two occasions where there is fighting, it becomes hard to tell what is happening. It's not quite Bourne shaky, but it is sufficient for the viewer to lose sight of who is kicking who's butt. Those technicalities asside- IMAX ladies and gentlemen. Some of the most incredible special effects. Space panoramas and ship battles you are likely to behold for a long long time. This is a thrill ride that will leave the viewing thinking for some time. The plot, ah yes I almost forgot, as far as I am concerned is irrelevant and something that serves purely to stick the characters together. People don't really care about the plot, they just sit back and set phasers to WOW!What's next, blu ray baby.9 and a half out of ten.",9,1,8,7 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A mildly amusing mish mash.
","OK . .they are making pirates 2 .. great . .same director . .it is going to be hard to make a mess of this one ..I wonder where to begin. I'm not going to talk about the plot? story? series of not so wonderfully edited film footage.It would not be so unfortunate if this were just another computer game adaptation, or a mindless teen flick. But this is the second part of a gem of a film.On viewing the first five minutes I was getting warning signs. I think it was when Jack Sparrow gave the map of the key to his chief mate that I suddenly had very real doubts.The humour .. It was not just me, because I thought it might be. But the audience around me remained quite quiet during most of the film. There was the occasional titter, but nothing that would amount to full blown laughter. Why? Perhaps the writer might be able to justify this? Now I look at it, the whole film seems to be chopped up footage that does not really give us anything important save that Davey Jones is coming after Jack and there is a Kracken that can destroy ships and . .ok I am struggling here. Oh yes, they need to find the key that opens the chest containing Davey Jones's heart.OK, now we have identified with that let's sit back and watch a mostly un amusing romp with a script that seems to give the characters less dignity.The special effects and the makeup effects are some of the best I have seen to date. But something is terribly wrong . .because by the time I see the Kracken tearing the ship apart and looking with some considerable approval at the head mask of Davey Jones I have lost interest in anything else that I was not sure I was following correctly anyway. Fundimentally I can say that this film seems to have no heart. No special touch of it's predecessor that hooked you warmly and with good family humour.This film was not written very well nor was it directed with any great innovation. It's a real shame because this was one of the few films I cared about this year.Giving it a five is generous because I am a faithful fan, Bill Nighty as Davey Jones stealing the show and stopping it from becoming a real abominable mess. The third installment really needs to be better to simply stop this trilogy from falling into unredeemable mediocrity.",5,4,7,22 July 2006
Spider-Man 3," Good and terrible
","I'm at this strange confliction. I'll keep it relatively short and sweet.This is perhaps the most emotionally charged of the three, yet it is the most silly. There are times when the chords of our hearts are pulled on, and times where things are so ridiculous that I just shake my head.Spidey v Harry v sandman v girlfriend.I didn't feel so much that the film was overloaded. I *did* feel like certain things did not fit very well. I'll let the viewers decide. I'm still sitting here in this weird limbo because of how I am conflicted. The special effects, OK they *are* much improved over the first two, sandman being the obvious drool factor, only there are only so many times you can see the camera spinning and two people flying around each other in mid air. At least this time I was not aware of the screen issue like I very much was in sp 2.In a way it's better than the first and second fx wise, but sillier than both put together. Emotionally I was genuinely moved, and feeling any kind of sympathy for a bad guy is a powerful moment in film.I guess we will wait for the next installment. I really didn't care one way or the other if I saw this movie, though at least now I have I can formulate an opinion.6 out of ten for fx and emotional impact without the cheese, oh and Bruce Cambell.",6,0,0,26 June 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," A very entertaining, if ambiguous film.
","Well, I just returned from an employee screening. Part of me was a little skeptical due to certain dislikes in the second Bourne movie by the same director.For the first, I'd say twenty minutes of the film I wondered if I was again going to be completely put off by the shaky, home made film approach. But as the film progressed and I began to figure the style, I began to get more and more entertained.This one, quite literally from start to finish has you. I don't remember how long the film was but let me tell you, never a dull moment. They kept it 'real'. The acting was strong throughout and my senses were perked. I don't really have anything to complain about, bar the usual cell phone in the audience routing that happens every single time we watch a movie. It's not a ten, it's a very strong nine. I think I would have liked to know more, but then again, even the strongest answers often lead to further questions .. and more $ to be gained from another film, if they choose to make it.Go see it, you won't be disappointed.",9,0,6,2 August 2007
Burn After Reading," Erm . . .
","I'm still asking myself the question. . *did* I enjoy this film? I'm really not sure. What was the film about again? A leaked CIA disk is used as blackmail and a string of characters are strung together .. getting involved with each other and some of them wind up dying. . and it wasn't a pointless movie because I laughed as several parts of the film .. but the other parts? I am a big fan of No Country. I like the Coens humour. But I can't help feeling that I wasted an hour and a half of my time trying to decide if I was enjoying it. I was not 'entertained' as such. I like how the Coens bring the characters out, but this was obviously not filmed at any great expense. No special photography. No really engaging acting, save that the different characters were amusing.I'm not going to give this film any stars because I truly have no idea if I care enough :) Not that it's a bad film. I would only recommend Coens fans watch this, other people may find themselves staring blankly at the screen as a scene ends leaving the theater in silence.I think they relied heavily on the swearing to raise laughter, which to be fair it did but on more than one occasion I found it to be unnecessary. I also found one key sequence in the film a little overly violent. I don't need to see somebody getting brutally axe murdered in the street.Overall, I am not left with a great deal . . only to wonder what I was watching, but maybe that is the point. Who gives a rats rear end about the plot because it was character driven idiocy.",Null,1,4,27 September 2008
Watchmen," Complex and political but certainly worth a 'Watch'
","It is hard for me to review this film. I am not a fan of the graphic novel and as such I have nothing by which to compare. All I can do here is sit and type thoughts based upon my viewing as a non affiliate.I'm not going to bother with the story because it's already been explained and to be quite frank, politics aside I am still not entirely sure of the purpose or motivations of the group of Watchmen for which this film is so named.What I do have to emphasise is that contrary to what the trailer might suggest, non affiliates can be forgiven for assuming that this is another super hero flick. The fact of the matter is that Dr. Manhatten aside, this is a group of costumed masked 'vigilantes' that exist to perhaps crime fight, perhaps fulfill their own political motives.The interesting concept here is that Zack Snyder has given these individual enhanced 'Batman' esq abilities. They all seem to frequent the gym, each sporting respective black belts from which speedy and bone shattering skills emerge. Actually I'm lying, the most interesting concept is that none of these 'good guys?' are good. All seem to possess jaded and or selfish character traits. I might say that by far the most prominent character and scene stealer Rorshach is the exemption to this rule, but even him I would not care to meet in a dark alley.In the first five minutes and opening credits we can see just what we are getting ourselves into. There is comic book brutality and adult, political themes that border on the satirical. This is a good thing, because this is the 'Q' for all the children in the theater who's parents assumed were sitting through an exciting super hero flick- to leave.So now we know, or have an idea of things. Now, moving on to the next point I'd like to make. This film is not for the politically sensitive. There are images that might have open mouths and balled fists jabbing at the darkness. A graphic Kennedy assassination is one of these scenes that might serve up upset.The film opens with the death of 'The Comedian' and then picks up with the resulting investigation and events that lead up to the eventual re-grouping of The Watchmen. Now I understand as a non affiliate how an intricate and complex graphic novel has been 'modulated' to the big screen here. Surely pages and character portrayals have been trimmed down and altered to fit a motion picture running time. That's OK, because though I found the plot to be heavy, I could discern sufficient within the given context presented how the world of The Watchmen was over and the political eighties climate was heated and somewhat revolutionary.I believe where the film shines and perhaps entertains where lack of action or 'easy reading' keeps the popcorn munching is the art and cinematography. Sometimes we have to sit back and understand that much of it is theatrical satire and the somewhat 'forced' acting is in that very context. Nonethless I am happy that in place of a 'no brainer' we have a somewhat original dark sometimes noir adult film with strong characters that will intrigue if not 'entertain'. Not everything has to be understood completely. Here the characters and plot are defined enough that we can follow if we choose to. Somewhere along the lines Blade Runner meets 300 meets American Psycho with smatterings of something else that I can't put my finger on. To get to the point, I felt like I was viewing a movie in it's era without it being too theatrically obvious. I was able to suspend dis belief and live in that world for the duration of the film, and that is very important. The adult nature is ever present, but I personally feel like it has been overly hyped as is always the case. Messaging boards were alive with 'blue penis' and pregnant lady getting shot. Well yes, it's all there but it's not as if it is all 'in your face'. The blue phallus is not an ever swinging 'horse' pendulum, it is present as part of the well sculptured statuesque Demi-God that is Dr. Manhattan. The pregnant woman is not executed with bloody violence. We see and hear the gunshot and we see her fall, but it's no Tarantino Kill Bill Bride. The 'porn' sequence is nothing more than what we see in '300', though perhaps a little out of place. It's two naked consenting adults, not an extreme close up of genitalia. Snyder is using these images to show us the weak and damaged and imperfect nature of the characters, specifically 'The Comedian'.Essentially, I'll tie this up in a bow. First time viewers will not necessarily understand but will and might certainly appreciate and perhaps enjoy. It is aimed at a mature audience that are able to think, and not demand the blatant entertainment. Do yourself and others a favour, leave the kids at home.",9,1,7,28 March 2009
Over the Hedge," Food!
","How wonderfully original is it, that somebody made an animated film with a plot revolving around food. Great comedy, great voice acting skills, ingredients for the whole family without getting ott. I saw the trailer for this film whilst in the auditorium for Narnia. I knew instantly that this film was something for me to watch. My favorite character is Hammy, probably because he reminds me of me in many cases, and it is great, in that respect to be able to laugh at oneself. This is a film I would recommend to anyone, the whole family will love it. I will be honoured to own it on DVD when it comes out. The only flaw that I could see, was the racoon (CJ?) voiced by Bruce Willis sleeping in the daytime. Racoons are naturally nocturnal animals, so this is just a minor flaw. Otherwise, the film entertains in every way with something for everyone, even providing some educational insight in to nature.",10,3,6,22 May 2006
The Usual Suspects," The greatest trick the devil pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist
","I don't really care for bad language. But with this, it's all within a given context.I'm not going to spend a long time on this review, because sometimes excellence does not need many words.A assembly of five guys, very convenient, perhaps too convenient.This movie, you do need to see a few more times, perhaps repeatedly for the fans or geeks. The reason, I dare to suggest, is due to the utterly incredulous expressions most of us wore come the twist first time round.The editing in this film is superb. I won't go into technicality here, I will just smile and nod my head, words not needed. I say the editing, because it is partly due to this that we follow the story the way we do; scenes following scenes seamlessly, and every one of them poignant.It's hard to talk about this film without giving too much away, and the viewer should go into this experience un-affiliated.It's one of the greatest crime thrillers of all time, it deserves it's merits and then some.If you don't mind profanity, much like the idea of se7en; this is a must must see.",10,1,3,16 March 2007
No Country for Old Men," The Tyranny of Evil men.
","The title may be a slight cliché .. I was tempted to use another, but I will mention the other within this review.Firstly, this film will not appeal to anyone who likes the younger generation of 'actors' and celebrities. This film may not appeal to those who like to munch popcorn whilst they view the screen with wide eyes. I do not recommend this film to anyone who was wildly entertained by films like Transformers or Spiderman 3.Why do I say this? I will try to keep this as short as I may. To be as succinct as I may, I'll say that this piece of cinema, for those of the right mindset will walk away from this one thinking about what they have seen . .perhaps even unable to think of anything else for a while.The plot is very simple, most of the film is spent watching the films bad guy pursuing the leading protagonist. Yet this is no ordinary bad guy. No, this character is perhaps the most authentic embodiment of true, realised evil. This character quite rightly, as I believe other reviewers have stated (though not using the same words) makes Hannibal Lecter look like a care bear. To use the word psychopath would dilute what this person perpetuates.There is no music, or certainly little music in this film, but that is just fine; less is more. I spent a good deal of viewing time listening to my own heartbeat in what could be best described as one of the most terrifying movie experiences of my entire life.Looking at this man, this creation, is with real sincerity, not the same as looking into the face of a serial killer or angry gun wielding maniac. There is no real emotion or theatrical anger etched on his face as he takes the lives of others. To look at him, his palid face, his dark soulless eyes is to look at a manifestation of an angel of death. Not a simple case of the tyranny of evil men, this is, as the original title might have been 'two hours with the arch angel'. To view conversations with the character that completely steals the show is to look at a demon in a dark shirt. A demon that looks upon mere mortals with contempt and distain as they try to barter with him for things that he has absolutely no use for. There is no conscience, no emotion, no sense of any form of moral. Even such baddies as Darth Vader were eventually un veiled as having some concentration of good in them. . no such luck with this. . and I'm glad it is this way.The whole cast give solid performances, even the bit and minor parts have gravity, such a refreshing rarety in modern cinema. Kelly MacDonald sheds her kilt and sporan for the Texan trailer girl. Bronin is great, and Tommy Lee plays the perfect old town sheriff. I won't say much more, words can't really describe it, it just has to be seen. My advice to you.. understand that you are not going into a happy movie experience, there is no hero in the sunset. This is a thought provoking film that will and should stay with us, making us think and consider, and question.It would be an injustice if this piece of cinema did not make it to Oscar nominations next year.",10,0,5,10 December 2007
District 9," Wow
","OK.Assembling thoughts here.This is very much an adult film. This is very much an intelligent film. This is very much an original film.At first I smiled, then I laughed, then my eyes opened to the intelligence presented and my thoughts were duly provoked. Then I was amazed, then I was enthralled. I smiled, shook my head at how once in a while somebody pulls a gem out of the dust, much like the alien craft as it rises from the dust in the South African slum.They get down and dirty here. They don't pull any punches, though it isn't disgusting, and we don't have time to wonder how disgusting it is because we are far too enthralled.30 million budget? I laugh. . laugh heartily when I consider what gets coughed out at thrice that sum.I'm not going to say anything about the plot, just go and watch it. Go and watch this on the big screen.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," All that money on special effects. . no way????
","So anyway. .I heard this vicious rumour that most of the budget for this film had been spent on special effects. Nah, Hollywood wouldn't to that to us these days, not after Spiderman 3.Actually I had a hard time watching this film because the cheese kept getting in my eyes, the cheese that was dripping down the screen from start to finish.I can't give it a five because it didn't interest me enough to warrant enough exploration of who was who and what was happening. If you are a teenager and you like the Olsen twins this might be the film for you. I went to see it with my wife because my wife wanted to see it.I'm not saying it's diabolical, it does have some mildly fun parts. The ending made me laugh, they could not have been more hokey if they had tried. I'm glad I've seen it, this way I can move on to better films.Ah well, at least they tried. .or did they? Worth seeing for the surfer, forget everything else.",4,0,1,12 July 2007
Transformers," They fooled me again with the trailer.
","Ah, so clever they are at throwing all the best bits of the film into one trailer.I was close to giving it a 2 . .but no, I'm sorry, they really don't deserve it :) For the first ten to twenty minutes of this film I had relatively good vibes. But then something happened, and quite rightly as another user has stated, it starts a down hill spiral.It's quite obvious why this one was released for independence day. It has all the elements. .ludicrous plot, abominable script, lots of things blowing up with sparks and fireworks. Those, and the usual actors thrown in to do nothing more than show a comedic face while performing some antic in the film purely to raise the laughter bar.I know that this was an adaptation, I know that it was not meant to be taken seriously; unfortunately the film makers are asking me to deal with two different kinds of movie here. The first, a semi serious military campaign going badly wrong with Robot invasion. The second, little Johnny and potential love interest counterpart have to save the world from evil robot dominance; they do this after the robots suss out who they are courtesy of ebay and with a succession of ridiculous and badly staged situational hazards.I'm sorry, but no amount of special effects or large robots rolling around in the air and into each other can save something that was conceived on Stifflers homework paper.I lost respect for this film the moment it turned into something that pubescent teens would find wildly entertaining.'Bros not Ho's man!' Titters the youth three rows down the isle in the auditorium.The product placement was ingenious I have to say, the pepto(a)bysmol on the table after the black guy has finished his plate of ten to fifteen donuts, I'm so glad they don't stereo type.I didn't intend to rip this film apart for all it's cute moments of Robotic wisdom, but well, I guess like Modern day Hollywood, I just got carried away.",1,32,53,14 August 2007
Paranormal Activity," Ever wondered what goes bump in the night?
","Paranormal.–adjective of or pertaining to the claimed occurrence of an event or perception without scientific explanation, as psychokinesis, extrasensory perception, or other purportedly supernatural phenomena. Activity.–noun, plural -ties. A use of energy or force; an active movement or operation.Fear. -noun. A distressing emotion aroused by impending danger, evil, pain, etc., whether the threat is real or imagined; the feeling or condition of being afraid. Concern or anxiety; solicitude: a fear for someone's safety. Paranormal Activity (PA) is a low budget 'indie' film following the trend of The Blair Wtich Project. It rose to fame on public demand and word of mouth, some of that word of mouth disparagingly referred to as hype. With a shoe string budget, a handful of unknown actors and a reputation of being the next best thing since The Exorcist, it blew Saw IV or VI out of the water. Those expecting a flash, entertaining flick with great cinematography and bells and whistles will be bitterly disappointed. Those understanding and accepting of films like TBWP, seeking the film for what it is, and not what it isn't, will be affected by what it presents. PA is a reality show with a box of tricks. These tricks are not necessarily intended to precipitate mass screaming, but to create the effect of an authentic haunting. The characters are very natural and believable, and thus it becomes easier to suspend disbelief when nightly occurrences, increasing in tension and emotional impact affect the lives of Kate and Micah. PA plays on and exploits the fear that exists in the safe haven of our own home. 'That' creaky floorboard, 'that' thump on the stairs or in the attic. This film is for anyone who has ever thrown a blanket over themselves in the darkness because the blanket protects and shields from the eyes of the unknown entity. PA breaks that rule.The plot is simply the haunting of two characters, Kate and Micah, in their home in California. There is a division of night and day. Day time gives us the characters and their exploration into what is occurring in the house. Night time gives us what the camera shows during the period of slumber - or not. The occurrences start simply and build gradually toward the inevitable. Most of the time the audience can believe what is happening. What we see looks authentic and is well done, simplicity over blatant theatricality. Once or twice I found it hard to breath. Not because I could not breathe, but my breath in the dead silence of the theater was magnified in my ears which were straining for the slightest sound as my eyes scanned the darkness. Where PA suffers is the with the occasional spell of overacting. The tension builds slowly throughout until most of the viewers are pinned to the screen. Then overacting disintegrates the effect. These spells are few and far between, but significant enough that my wife laughed on more than one occasion where the viewer was intended to stare in horror. The real power of PA is actually felt, at least in my case, after leaving the theater. Since we believe the characters, we feel and empathise with what is affecting them. It hurts us to see them sleep-deprived, with a dividing line between them due to tensions arising from the invasion of the entity into their personal lives. There is something that gets under the skin. Evil in this world does not have to be the crimes that are reported in the media. Evil exists on a very basic and fundamental level and does not always see the light of day in tabloid or camera. The ending is, well slightly typical of Hollwood. Apparently Spielberg had the ending changed which makes me shake my head. They could have, and more than likely should have, left it alone; but politics being politics, it did get a nationwide release.In a nutshell, perhaps one of 'the' most authentic films of its genre. With the correct mindset and a little patience the discerning viewer is rewarded. B-",Null,0,3,3 November 2009
The Dark Knight," Take your pre-conceived concept of this movie, then multiply by several- and then some.
","I've had an evening to 'attempt' to put my thoughts in a semblance of 'order'. Don't pardon that pun, it is fully intended.The Dark Knight transcends the concept of a 'Super hero movie'. It stands alongside carbon deposits as an iron mountain. Without being bombastic, delivers an experience of such incredible magnitude that other titles claiming to be such are entirely translucent in comparison.Gotham City is no longer obvious sets and sound stages and blatant special effects and models in the midst of real time suburbia. Gotham City is living and breathing, from its skyscrapers to the liquor bottles in bars to the cops on patrol, of which there are many. It's not Tim Burton dark, but that's just fine. It's far more realistic, and as such far more believable, and therefore far more powerful when the stakes in the film become all too obvious.Batman is no longer a upcoming crusader, he is ready and confident in his ways, and feared by the criminal underworld. Indeed, such is his effect on the crime networks of the city that the big scary dog has withered to the scared and desperate puppy that thinks twice before barking.Then all of a sudden 'Enter the Clown Prince'. Heath Ledgers performance as the deranged criminal mastermind cannot easily be put into words. To call it 'acting' would somehow be selling it short. Ledger becomes an embodiment of a new age Joker. It would be wrong to make any comparison to Jack Nicholsons Joker, a sublime Batman Comic book realisation. Ledger takes it to a new level. His maniacal laugh and his calculating anarchic, psychotic disposition are not only a match for are Dark Crusader, they raise the bar of morals and integrity and strike deep chords within his being.When everything you have ever known and loved, and worked for is in jeopardy .. what do you have left to bargain with? What use is brute force and intimidation against a laughing antagonist who has field, and plays it with no limitations.Performances all around are strong, and I was surprised by Eckhard, of whom I was the most uncertain. Bale and Caine and Freeman and Oldman as always carry the weight of the film. With effective supporting performances by Maggie(Dawes) Gylenhall and Eric (Maroni) Roberts. The real star of the show, well, I don't really need to continue with that one, now do I? :)The Dark Knight is an IMAX experience. The smaller screens will still entertain, but for the real scope of this feature, IMAX is the real McCoy.Forget what you thought you knew, forget anything that has tried and fallen flat and hard. Go an experience The Dark Knight. Popcorn is nice, but taking your eyes off the screen is not recommended.",10,3,7,20 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Simply put- Excellent.
","Kudos to a director for finally giving HP the adult feel it needed. Nothing wrong with previous films being colourfull and having a target audience of pre to mid teens. This book, however, is much darker, and is reflected so in the motion picture. There are people trashing this film, I don't know what they expect. You cannot have everything. David Yates however, has brought the story back to me (long time since I read it) with just enough of what I needed to know. What makes me smile even more is that there were little and no comedic moments, no audience laughter, bar a few titters. There is no reason, and was no reason to have comic relief. Instead we are allowed to wallow in darker waters with no scripting to try to pull us out of it. The acting throughout is excellent. All of the characters were fully believable, my personal favourite being Bellatrix. Bohnam Carter manages to pull of deadly insanity without looking theatrical, and this is very important considering the tender nature of her past escapades. I would agree that there are some characters, Lupin for instance who is given next to no speaking parts and spends the limited time he has on camera merely looking at the conversation. What they *do* manage to do, is look like they are *part* of the story and the group, and not just extras or stand ins smiling for the camera. Yates has a background in TV vs films. This is obvious with his command of character direction. The film contains nice visuals, but he's not playing the film to visuals, he is using characters as the driving force. The films special effects, though integral, are secondary. As a book fan it delivers all I really need to know, as a film fan it more than delivers considering the bulk of the written word it has to convey in a film just over two hours.I would recommend this film to both Potter fans, and non fans; The heart and soul is there, even if things have been chopped and changed slightly. A film that actually made me care, and has left me wanting more.",9,1,2,17 July 2007
Avatar," A living, breathing testimony to why we love cinema.
","Avatar gets a 10 because of its visuals and some of the natural soul satisfying themes therein. The rest of the film does not matter; I'll explain why.The plot is as standard and as conventional as they come. The whole film is a collective of clichés and things we have all seen before on screen. A Marine without the use of his legs becomes part of a program on Pandora. Selected individuals become the 'avatars' that have been specifically engineered for them and go out into the alien world of Pandora. The objective: to study the natives, indigenous 'beasts,' life forms and layout of terrain in the interests of military tactical advantage. The Marine is given the incentive of government-approved working legs if he is successful in completing the objective. Marine, assisted by ever so cheesy, clichéd, cartoonish two-dimensional characters enters world, meets girl, meets tribe, learns ways, gets accepted, falls in love, and ultimately decides in all predictability that Pandora is more valuable to him than the 'real' world. That's about ten or so films that we can all list covered so far. And so 'jarhead' ultimately becomes protagonist, protector and defender when the 'good' guys who are fighting the 'savages' decide it's time to eradicate and show them just who is boss. Don't you love the mentality :) So, back to the reason of sitting in the theater with 3-D glasses. It takes a little while, but the reason for every Effects house, department, and agency working on a 400-million dollar film becomes oh so very apparent. So I am a gamer, very much accustomed to playing pretty games on high-end tech. I am also a film geek, details, details, details. So, you will understand that when the lights go down a little and I'm looking at 'other worldly' vegetation full of sap or rain water, and I sit there shaking my head because my brain can't seem to compute that specially created/generated foliage defies that very concept. When the lights go down on Pandora I might as well be looking out of my own window. Indeed, I was also dubious when I heard a similar statement. Avatar, when you get past - but can't really get past - because you are looking at animation that looks so real that you can instantly (pretty much) tell who the actor is behind the 'mask' - the phenomenal visuals. You are allowed to smile, and perhaps to have your eyes well up a little, with Jake's first encounter as a 'Dragon' rider. Here perhaps is a nod to Anne McCaffrey's 'Pern.' The rider chooses the Dragon and the Dragon the rider. When the bond is made, they become one. I want to get back to the characters again. Remember when I said details, details, details: The skin, the eyes, the flakes of dust that land on the skin after an explosion, the ears that move and stretch. the physical motions and motor skills. What is the expression I am looking for.. 'more human than human'. OK, time to close. The weakest link, in my opinion, and I truly hate to say this out of my respect for one of the mothers of sci-fi, is Sigourney Weaver's character. Rather than playing a secure, natural maternal scientist we have a re-hashed Ripley after 23 years, only it only serves to weaken the experience. As soon as Sigourney opens her mouth, I want her to close it. It's not big, it's not clever; and I don't care if it's a military 'thing' in a PG-13 film. The mild swearing is out of place. Some of the audience cheered and clapped when Michelle (signature frown and growl) Rodriguez says: 'You're not the only one with a gun, bitch!' Why do women need to grow balls in these flicks.. You don't need to compete with the alpha male who is doing a fine job of cheapening the human race. It sounds great coming from Sigourney Weaver, in full control of a robot walker facing off against mother Alien, but it's not 'Aliens', it's Rodriguez with a pair who should stay in films that go straight to video shelf. I perceive that there is a reason behind the far too obviously staged overacting. It contrasts with the wonderful soothing, soul enriching acting from the Naa'ri. It also serves to exploit the human race for what they are: Takers, antagonists, butchers, and barbarians. Avatar is the current apotheosis of the reason we enjoy cinema. Anyone who is anyone can enjoy it, though preferably not younger children. Kids and adults alike who don't understand (or care about) the plot can get lost in the amazing world of Pandora.Highly recommended, not something that should be missed on the biggest, most technically capable theater you can find. Can't be described, needs to be seen to be believed.",10,11,20,2 January 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not the best Potter, but a reasonable adaptation
","Well, I heard it was butchered, and there is no hiding. . it is.It could have been lots better, but it could also have been worse. I know they had little time for everything, and as such, there are things we are never going to see on screen.High points: Moody, Barty Crouch Jr, Ralph Fiennes. . good to reasonable acting.Low points Barty Crouch Jrs hair colour, slightly scripted acting and obvious sets.Special effects do not make a movie, though in this type of movie they are a high percentage of it.In a nutshell, a lot missed out, but a fair to reasonable watch.",6,0,0,9 May 2006
There Will Be Blood," An acquired oil painting
","I doubt this film did well at the box office. I say this because this isn't the sort of film I would choose to watch on the big screen.I think it is important to express the following. In order to fully appreciate this motion picture you must like art. It is imperative that you enjoy art. It is imperative that you enjoy acting. It is imperative that you do not look to explosions and special effects for entertainment. If you enjoyed No Country for old men and Ammadeus you may well very much enjoy this picture.This film does not 'entertain'. It is a long walk on a journey of the mind. It's hard to describe it and since others have no doubt done a better job I won't try.Daniel Fairview is an 'oil man' with a grande strategy for making his work come to fruition whilst reaping large financial benefits. That's about as much as you really need to know, that and throughout the film all you are really aware of is his greed, anger, hatred and quiet benign of everything and everyone in the world around him. That's about as much as you really need to know, the rest follows swiftly behind.It's very hard to grade this film because as much as I enjoyed it and come close to giving it a 9 or a ten, it's very difficult because I don't think I would watch it again.*spoiler* It is worth the entire duration of the film to view the final act. Then it hits you like the finale of a stage play. I won't give it away, it needs to be seen. I recommend getting it from the library for free, that's what we did.",Null,2,3,16 March 2009
Hancock," Is it a bird, is it a plane, no it's another bad representation
","This is not a *good* film review, it's my thoughts and it won't get me a job at Empire magazine.There are not too many Black super hero icons out there, unless of course you count Blade.The warning lights came on (as they do with what I consider to be bad films) in the first scene with Will Smith and a boy. Now, I'm not knocking Will Smiths performance, he does a great job in every role he portrays. It's the situation and subsequent events made me shake my head.Hancock is a black man who has super powers. He is a bum with a drinking problem and the first thing we see him do is take off into the air and fly around the city with an open liquor bottle from which he is partaking whilst flying (don't try this at home kids) neat liquor.. The 'special effects' look like- I'm not sure what they look like, only I knew this was surely the point of no return. This is before (oh yes let's not forget the rap music) he catches some bad guys in a vehicle and then picks up their vehicle and throws them around a few city blocks whilst damaging public and private property.So OK, we have a bum black man with an attitude and a habit of keeping city construction workers in business, but it gets better. The script is abominable and this film is not far short of an R with it's in frequent but explicit language.Now I'm insulted in a way, not because I was offended by this. I was bitterly amused for at least half of the movie. I am offended that they had to make a film that would appeal to a given demographic because of its portrayal of how certain classes of people act, and apparently there is comedy in this.'Well you should sue McDonalds because they (cuss word) you up.' I wonder which demographic actually laughed at this? There is a plot in Hancock and in fact a significance. People *can* change it would seem. Hancock saves the life of a public figure who decides to change his image and do give him better appeal where the public (who think he is an asshole) are concerned. Yes of course, we shall use the word asshole because it's perfectly acceptable for kids to use it, as indeed they do. It's OK honey they will hear worse at school. Oh don't give me that look, I'm on this soap box for a reason.Well Hancock agrees to go to jail to clean up his act and turn himself around. During this time he flies out of the compound to grab a basketball and then after some hesitation flies back in. Oh boy do they have him locked up good and proper.I didn't start laughing at this until Nancy Grace appeared on TV. It was only then that I could no longer hold my composure.In truth Hancock does have some redeeming qualities, the credits are fun to watch. Oh seriously? Oh OK. There is a genuine story arc whereby we are introduced to Charleze Theron who is another of 'his' kind. They have some kind of relationship but I wanted the film to be over so I didn't really pay a great deal off attention. OK cynicism aside we do see a very human side to Hancock and an effort to reform. His character is both reprehensible and endearing and he does clean up his heroic act. It's just not strong enough when we consider the full equation. All of this is at the expense of certain factions of people who are trying very hard to prove that they are more than how much of society perceives them.Well, at least now they have a super hero flick to show the world it's simply not true.",1,2,9,4 April 2009
Inception," Everything you want in a movie, and more
","It doesn't go any higher than a 10, or I would have gone higher.I'm not going to go into this because other people who have already presented views will probably say it better. I cannot say that I really 'understood' the story or sub story or spiderweb, but that did not really matter. What we have is a fantastic piece of art/entertainment but together by a master. This is a film for those that desire more than popcorn in a film. It is a film for those who want to watch a 'good' film.. no an 'excellent' film and have their intellect stroked. It is a technical eye popper, and most likely an academy award winner in several aspects. If I have to pick and flaws, I have say that DiCaprio needs to stop elevating his voice because it takes away from his performance. There is a difference between showing emotion and shouting. I saw this on IMAX, and I can tell you it is absolutely worth the admission with several scenes.It would be an injustice not to go and see it, so what are you waiting for? :)",10,1,4,30 July 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Just about enjoyable
","Once the ref flags appear, it's hard for them to stop. There are several things happening in 'Rises', and to be perfectly honest I lost track of them, and most of the characters. Starting with Banes insane Sean Connery in a Darth Vader intro and a mid air hostile takeover. I can only assume that this was Nolans attempt to wow the audience after the utterly magnificent bank heist intro of TDK. If I understood what was happening and the reasons behind it, and I didn't think the aircraft was torn apart like a chocolate bar wrapper I might have been more impressed. There is Selina Kyles impeccable introduction, the opportunity to showcase her deft spot on hit the nail on the head acting prowess with this role. Anyone familiar with Batman 'The long Halloween' will drink in the homage with a smile. There is Waynes tracking down of this jewel thief and a ballroom dance which gave the film huge potential. Then there is the side plot of John Blake, a rookie cop who subsequently after poking his nose ahead of police protocol takes a swift rise to Detective. There is Batmans initial battle with Bane which pins the cinema audience to the screen. And then there is the slow spiral to Batmans downfall and potential destruction. After Wayne is thrown in Banes prison we are forced to deal with three plot lines. Banes continued anarchistic plans for Gotham, Selina Kyle's personal agenda to be freed from the clutches of the authorities by gaining a new slate and finally Blakes personal battle for justice. Add to that several scenes involving actors, seemingly to give the actors themselves screen time, almost like people wanted to appear in it and were given pointless roles. It is almost possible to hear Nolan cry 'action'- Q wall street motorbike chase and oh there goes the obvious stunt woman. Q Police vehicles, those extras over there and those prisoners waving guns and attempting to look angry. Oh, there is a nuclear device.. That can't possibly mean the possible end of Gotham as we know it if it gets into the wrong hands... Where is 007? I write with intended sarcasm because most of the film is completely lacking in the things we have grown to love about Nolans work. His films have never been shallow, always had depth and layered complexity. Here it seems like the whole thing was put together simply to tell a messy, unconvincing story without a regard for the intelligence of the viewer because we are all expected to understand that Batman escaped within 5 seconds from a nuclear device unscathed and that Gotham endured no subsequent fallout etc etc. There are saving graces. Anne Hathaway, I could watch the film again just for her. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are fabulous as always. Gordon Levitt is *ok*. I feel his scenes suffered because of the rushed production and the lack of time taken to put things together. Bale is fine, but there is little strength of Batman here, it's simple like he steps out of his cave to take a beating, saves the day to leave us again. I got no sense of inner fulfillment from an ending I won't spoil. Hans Zimmers score saves this from getting a much lower score, his music defines these pictures, as it does Inception. Recommended at this time, until another viewing simply for the pleasure of out dear Cat burglar. The Dark Knight Rises, but fails to make a real impression.",7,1,3,24 July 2012
Iron Man," Not really a *solid* movie as far as I'm concerned.
","I might be the wrong audience for this film and I don't want to pull it down without fairly good reasoning.I can suspend disbelief to a degree. Spiderman gets bitten by a super spider, Batman decides to take on the criminal empire of Gotham city as the caped crusader. .Superman is the son of Jorrel.It's not so much how Iron man becomes Iron man, I think it's the ludicrous way this story is presented. In the Torra Borra, or Afghanistan Stark makes this robot suit and storms his way out of captivity. He then returns home blah blah *q* several 1 and 2 dimensional characters later and a bit of genius engineering and he has *the* suit. I just. . got bored. I tried to take my brain out, but it was as if they actually wanted me to take Mr. Jr seriously.Gweneth Palthrow. . heavens above what a waste of her talents. The African American actor, I forget his name, really is one of the better actors in this.I won't draw this out, but I'm getting tired of these FX movies with flimsy stories and transparent characters.I look forward to The Dark Knight.",1,24,52,22 May 2008
Blade Runner," In every way, a magnificent beauty.
","It is not an easy task to write and critique a film that has become my favourite science fiction experience of all time. It is even harder to comment on the technical aspects in such a way that Philip K Dick might approve.So I shall instead try to write in laymens terms as succinctly as I may.Los Angeles 2019 .. From the beginning, we are given the opportunity to traverse a panorama of majestic beauty. The beauty of a dark, rain infested city set in the future. As we take this tour the atmosphere is punctuated by fireballs thrust up by dark towers and spires; much like torches burning on a great red carpet that leads us into greater visual treats.It seems that Los Angeles is under considerable Japanese influence, with not much room given to its former Hispanic dominance. From the giant advertisements hugging the tall buildings to the food outlets to the citizens on cycles, we realise that the superior advancements of the Asian east have finally bled into the west to the extent that it has its feet are fimly under the table. This actually adds to the experience, in my opinion. The basic premise is that Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned and assigned to investigate the hijacking of an aircraft, or airship by a small number of 'skin jobs', or Replicants. It seems that there is no other choice to accept, and so with a reluctance, but eventual determination Decker sets the wheels in motion. Visually, the film is exemplary; and rather than the visuals, though indeed being special effects, are not blatant to the eye. Not like the recent Star Wars movies where the blue screen green screen is so obvious that although the fans, and non fans can enjoy the film, the suspension of disbelief is not entirely possible.The acting is flawless throughout. Harrison Ford, James Olmos, and others of a high caliber lose themselves in their characters. Perhaps the award should go to Rutger Hauer; who's character goes from bad guy, to seemingly not so bad character, once his motives and pathology are realised. After all, what, we can ask ourselves, would we ourselves do in such a predicament?The ending sequence, which I will not give away can perhaps only be described as a thing of beauty and marvel. Hauers monologue and final demise is quite incredible.Without forgetting what could be considered to be the crowning spice of the film, step forward the score.Vangellis delivers an operatic masterpiece. A flavour to not only compliment the experience, but transport the senses where even perhaps the visuals may fail. The score, and motifs within help keep this dish in the flavour that it has retained, and will keep retaining even after decades of release. This film does require an audience of some appreciative mind frame. Those with short attention spans that bring phones into theatres, though I stereotype will more than likely not enjoy this experience. It takes an appreciative eye to savour this for what it is, and that is quite simply . .An exemplary slice of science fiction.",10,3,6,17 March 2007
Casino Royale," Yesh mish money penny, yesssh.
","Firstly ..I had to spend the first hour or so of this film working out a few things: The time period, the colour schemes, the directors camera work etc.When M spoke to Bond about events after 9/11 I knew I could relax with the time period, and they were setting this Bond in our time as if none of the rest of them had happened. This partially forgave the annoying but expected sponsorship from the mostly Sony brand mobile/cell phones.It is important to understand from the get go that this is not the suave and highly styalised Bond most of us have grown up to know and love. This is a gritty and in places hard hitting tale of the boy soldier becoming a 00.Craig owns this film. Whilst the acting never falters from cast line up, it moves in and around his world with a steely eyed, yet not in human take on the darker side of the British secret service.Indeed, it is possible to have some mild concern at some of the action sequences. Fighting on scaffolding high in the air is not un realistic; But dropping a good distance and landing without many broken bones is perhaps asking too much of an audience seeking Bond,and not the Bourne identity.This film however, does turn from the steely eyed SAS type soldier to the first echoes of sophistication on the train with Bonds female counterpart. Here, the motion picture starts to have the elements we know and recognise bleed into it.I won't give too much of the film away. This is certainly a must see, it's Bonds beginnings. It's certainly a far cry from the other Bond films, but this is not a bad thing.Baby he's not the best just yet, but getting there fast.7.5 out of ten",7,0,2,18 November 2006
Beowulf," Silly popcorn flick.
","When a enjoy a movie, I say so, when I really enjoy a movie, I rave about it (No country for old men).When I have other thoughts about a movie, I trash it- so here goes.I thought it was cool for the first five to ten minutes. I thought it might be worth watching. . and then Beowolf turned up.I'm sure other reviewers have mentioned most of this, so I'll just break it down:The good- the first five to ten minutes.The bad:Bad voice acting, unnecessary adult graphics and dialog. Terrible voice acting from Ray Winstone Silly plot etc . . It's yet another example, among the many, how you cannot, simply cannot use flashy visuals to make a movie. It just becomes silly and hollow. It's just embarrassing to hear macho, bravado detailing how Beowolf killed nine sea monsters and then Grendel's mother. It *is* amusing how they manage to block the view of Beowolf's genitals with cunning shot after cunning shot. I might add that it was fun to look upon a naked and fake, but voluptuous looking (and fake) Angelina Jolie.Anyway, back to the thread. I found this movie to be extremely mediocre. It actually makes it worse that they used some fun and very pretty animation with such an atrocious script.Ah well, perhaps they might use this technology, refine it and make better flicks.",2,3,6,17 December 2007
300," Arguably Sparta at it's best and finest.
","I'm not going to give it ten. I'll give it nine going on ten, but not quite full marks. It's not a decision I make lightly. Even now as I type I mentally scrutinize the content. A ten, to me is earned by films like the whole lotr trilogy, It's a wonderful life, A Clockwork Orange etc. A 10 me is not just classified as Excellent, but absolutely outstanding, and provokes emotional and/or phsycological feelings. I have, I admit given ten in the past to films of a personal favourite to me like The Goonies and Over the Hedge. .I admit that those scores are given with bias because they make me smile and laugh so much on a personal level.Not that this film is not one of the best pictures in the last five years.Au Contrare . .Epic, fantastic, brilliant. .those are some of the choice words I could use. The wow factor in particular, and some whoops and applause from me during some of the battle sequences. Indeed, it seems that despite the special effects, we are given very authentic looking battles. At times I am reminded of Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings with spears and shield close ups, and perhaps even the matrix with the slow/rapid turning camera motions. The comic book blood is very effective, and I am glad they chose to utilise that method.300 is indeed a landmark experience, with solid performances from beginning to end from a cast of fairly well knowns to not so well knowns. Indeed, Gerard Butler puts in a striking performance as a non A list actor, which should tell is a few things about the Hollywood system. His screen wife, stands just as strong, and plays no second fiddle to a film with so much body (no pun intended) that you can thrive on the testosterone alone.This film has much historical and mythological value. Especially when King Leonidas (forgive any incorrect spelling) informs the deformed hunchback of his unsuitability to join with the 300 due to the way that the unit operates as one. The monsters, the creatures of this ancient world, whilst indeed a work of dark fantasy become as much a part of the film as the history it represents. And as such, it is quite possible to lose yourself in the authentic looking wardrobe and cgi sets and believe for a while that the dark ages of beasts and chaos did exist. Not since the Harry Hausen films, and Excalibur, and even Caligula have I been this drawn into a world of dark woven and quite frankly sinister shrouds of ancient mythos.If it has to fall short, it would, I would have to say lose marks on the story content. I think most of us, a greater majority go to watch this film because of the action. Everything holds up strong on its own two feet in this film, perhaps bar what you might call emotional engagement.300 is a very 'tough' film; quite frankly merciless in terms of how *weak* the people of Sparta are not allowed to be, or pervade in any way. From the beginning we are shown the cruel but necessary trials and engagements that the very young are made to endure, to eventually become Spartan warriors. And as such, I do not think we,as an audience have any pity to fall back on, since violence and death is a cottage industry. When we look at the story, there is in fact, not a great deal. It's quite a straight forward concept of not bowing down to an advancing empire; and as such sending a meager but iron tough contingent of Spartans against the millions of the dark Persian horde. Of course, we do get glimpses of the politically corrupt and certain things that seemingly must be done in order to preserve the empire; these however, are small potatoes and sidelines. That it lacks such emotional pull, is perhaps the reason it does not merit its ten. I could also have done without Wehnams pep talk at the end, but then again, they had to close the film out somehow.That being said, it's not Gladiator, it's not lord of the rings. It 'is' rich, testosterone pumping Spartan grit and blood and battle, and I certainly will not ask for more in that respect.A must see, a must own, as simple must.9 and then some out of ten.I would highly recommend this film.",9,1,5,14 March 2007
The Cabin in the Woods," You MUST see this......
","I can't say anything. I can't give anything away. Go and watch this film knowing as little as possible. I'm in love. I have not seen a film of this caliber for the genre in I don't know how long. It has restored my faith in cinema, that a creative and technical team can pull this off because there are so many pitfalls and mines where a film can go wrong. Joss Whedon is a genius, if this film is as good as it is the mind boggles with The Avengers. Films like this don't come round very often. I'm not sure what else I can possible say. I highly endorse this movie. Ten stars are not enough. It's hard to write ten lines of text and say absolutely nothing about this film, because anything I talk about would potentially spoil the experience. That is all :)",10,2,13,19 April 2012
The Social Network," The Brilliant Bastards- with flaws
","Final edit- sorry IMDb.For those interested in the plot, SN follows the birth of 'Facebook', it's pathway to what millions knows and use, and the lies, deceit, betrayal and exploitation which may fall into the category of 'business'.There are three key drivers with SN. The director, none other than David Fincher 'Se7en'. Aaron Sorkin, writer 'The West Wing', and musician/artist Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Put these three together and what we have is one of the best looking - and sounding- pieces of cinema to date. From the first line of script we are pulled into an intellectual crossfire in the perfect ambiance of a nameless Harvard Club. A scene, which in fact sets the ball in motion for future events. Everything is in near perfect proportion, and this is the trend for most of the duration of the film. There are issues and weaknesses. Though enveloped in glorious, delicious cinematography that radiates class, even in the 'party scene' in Ivy League Harvard, the seams begin to burst about an hour into the film. The script carries the weight and compensates for the acting only so long. Fire three rapid lines at the camera and the ear, more so than the eye is acutely focused. The script diminishes as the plot thins out and despite how good certain actors look, they cannot be saved from sub-standard performances. Fincher, perhaps due to budget and or time constraints has not gained the most from his choice of actors, *or* maybe it is simply a younger target audience. Jesse Eisenberg is spot on, despite certain consistency issues. Andrew Garfield who seems to have received critical acclaim for his role as Edwardo Saverin comes across as a soft, yet loyal 'friend' with as much screen presence as a wet rag. 'I'll take you for everything!' He exclaims.. only I don't quite believe him. Timberlake as Sean Parker makes his mark, but does nothing to inspire a raised brow. The overlooked star of this film, though perhaps not so is Rooney Mara, Eisenbergs scorned love interest. Mara delivers with emotional precision. In her brief screen time the steals her scenes. The rest serve their purpose, none are 'glowing'. The Social Network has a constant up-beat vibe, and this helps dig the short-comings out of the trench when actors with insufficient gravity fail to uphold some of the more awkward scenes. The film suffers from self-indulgence and a tendency to be over zealous, something that rears it's head towards the second and latter part. We know that 'Facebook' is becoming popular, perhaps a social phenomenon. Rather than sink to cheap gimmicks like a 'Facebook' sign on a drinks machine and Zuckerbergs personal 'Facebook' cup, the audience might have been best served with a newspaper or periodical covering the 'business' and its prosperity. Less is far more. Bruce Wayne is Gothams Millionaire playboy. Atop the skyscraper we see the family slogan- that is it.. that is all. All that said, Social Network is a delicious piece of cinema. Relatively solid, that carries with it an important message, not so much of friendship and betrayal, but how modern day society and social status can be and is paramount in the lives of many. 350 friends.. dude that's nothing. Nothing eh, well let's consider how many of those 'friends' want you as friends, or merely as a means to an end.It can't go to the Oscars for me, it has the ingredients, but it is an entertaining speed ball romp and missing that essential inspired quality to qualify. It *does* stay with you, and as I type, I know that I will never see 'Facebook' the same way again. One connection connects us to many.Worth watching, perhaps owning.

","OK, I'm not going to spend a long time on this film, mainly because I'm about to watch it again and I wanted to slip in a quick review.This film, basically follows the 'business' of a New York Mafia. The 'goodfellas'. The rise and fall of Henry Hill, whose story is told visually and in a narration by actor Ray Liotta throughout the film.It's one of these motion visuals and scripts that has gone down in history because of how good it is. People, to this day quote from it after sixteen years, and it will continue to have longevity.The cast, is superb, with De Niro and Pesci co starring along side Liotta, the films main focus. With Lorraine Braco and a host of other stellar actors to keep us not just interested, but entertained.It's a very violent and profane mob movie. I am the kind of movie viewer that does not honestly care for too much language and violence. I can live with it if it is within the context of the story. I am a Taranino fan because of the sheer style more than what is depicted of the adult nature.I would go as far as to say that most of the most renowned scenes in movie history are in restaurants: Casablanca, Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction, When Harry met Sally, Heat etc etc. This film is certainly no exception.'What do you mean I'm funny, funny how? Like I'm some kind of clown, I'm here to amuse you??' (bringing some of the lines together without the language).I honestly could do without the F word as frequently as it appears, but I understand that it was a part of mob everyday life in it's frequency so I accept it. The violence is nasty, but there is no cotton wool padding in mob hits.All in all, this film is a must watch, and a must own for the movie fan with broad tastes. It is worth owning as part of a collection just to see what is arguably Pesci's best scripted performance.'The other day a group of kids from my neighborhood helped my mother home with the groceries. Know why? It was out of respect.'",9,0,0,26 December 2006
