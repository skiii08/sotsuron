Captain Phillips," Edge of my seat!
","This film is a must see! The whole film is gripping and a fantastic edge of your seat drama. To start with the film is set up nicely and each side established but what I especially liked is that you're not made to feel particularly empathetic towards either group, you just hope that all will go well for the good guys although you're led to believe by the trailer it won't. There's enough going on with each scene to keep you interested and if you don't know the true story it will certainly come as a surprise what happens during the whole ordeal. Although the characters lives aren't delved into this doesn't spoil the film and you don't feel like you needed to know more in order to enjoy or understand motives, what is given is enough and it keeps the film moving at a good pace. In terms of Tom Hanks portrayal of Captain Phillips - without spoiling anything I have to say his final scenes are the most moving and well acted scenes I've seen in a long time. I was actually quite emotional and had to remind myself he's just an actor despite the fact that what I watched felt very real! All in all a great film that I would recommend to all.",8,0,1,20 February 2014
