The Ring," The Best Movie of All Time *SPOILERS*
","~MAJOR SPOILERS~ON MY OPINION OF THE MOVIE: There are no words to describe this movie. It is beautifully written, not very scary (which is good to me), yet will freak you out. The horror of 'what ifs' is what this movie is made of. YOu fear you will die the same way Katie or Noah did. You no longer look at wells, or like TV. This movie is bound to have psychological effects on you, which makes it entertaining. ON ACTING: The acting is truly the best. Everyone must have studied hard to get their character down. Daveigh Chase (Samara MOrgan) is so well transformed into a villain/pity, that you can't even tell who she is. Her voice, look, hair, is all different. Naomi Watts (Rachel Keller) hides her accent, and becomes a very motherly figure. The rest of the cast was awesome, but I have nothing to say about them. ON EFFECTS: Samara crawling out of the TV is so scary and well done, I had nightmares for 7 days..The horse scene is a bit sad and sick, but it was well done on special effects. The make-up is so amazing, I have no idea what to say. Let me just say that Katie's face was close to no special effects. I think that deserves a medal on its own. ON LOCATION: The movie seems a bit green, but it is fine to me because I love the color green. The places were all dark and gloomy adding to the fear. MY FAVORITE MOVIE!! 11 out of 10",10,0,1,15 June 2004
The Village," 2nd Worst Movie I Have EVER seen!
","The Village- No spoilers because I fell asleep it was so boring.The Village....I was expecting it to be a good, scary movie. So based on the director, and commercials, even though I had NO idea what it was about, I saw it. Big mistake. It started out fairly good, and I was excited to be frightened. Waiting...waiting...waiting...uhhhhhh...*yawn* I didn't even get a jump from this movie. The 'them' where stupid looking. All it really is is talking, and when the ending came, I wondered why this was 1 at the box office, and why I spend $8.00 to see this waste of 2 hours.The acting is alright, but they must have felt really embarrassed to make such a terrible film. * out of *****",Null,0,0,1 August 2004
