Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Good Start
","The first Indiana Jones Movies is good; but not too good. There is excellent music, a good plot, fair action, but overall the movie goes a bit too slow for my taste. (Unlike the Temple of Doom) The ending really sucks though!",Null,0,1,28 August 1999
12 Monkeys," Gilliam's a 'friggin'' GENIUS!
","My English teacher (teaching us media themes) assigned us a project to analyze directors. Since my partner and I didn't bother to sign up for a director, we were left with Terry Gilliam. THANK GOD this happened. It was my first introduction to a genius who I had never heard of before. I saw 'Twelve Monkeys' and was thoroughly impressed, entertained, surprised that I had never heard of this masterpiece before. Bruce Willis' role was genius along with Brad Pitt. The beginning was the most shocking (SPOILERS AHEAD...) with Willis exploring abandoned Philadelphia. The music was phenomenal and the directing techniques were brilliant! Twelve Monkeys is a MUST-SEE movie.",10,1,2,31 July 2002
Batman Returns," Starting to Screw Up
","Even though the first one was excellent, the second Batman movie isn't all that great. You're suddenly thrown into the movie without many of the surviving characters from the first like Vicki Vale or the previous mayor. Instead, you're given a new cast and two new villains. The Penguin is probably the thing that saves the movie from total destruction. His part in the movie is the best we'll see out of the cast and what's with Catwoman's nine lives? Please . . .",Null,3,8,23 August 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Perfect Movie
","Late in 2001, I was constantly hearing about something called 'The Lord of the Rings'. Almost everybody kept talking about how good it was and how they couldn't wait for the sequel.I was completely baffled by what they were talking. I had to have been the only person who hadn't seen the movie in theaters. Finally, in mid-2002, after the DVD had come out, I rented the movie. I was thoroughly blown away by the story. I didn't think movies like these could be made! The massive amount of special effects coupled with the great scenery and fantastic plot, made this movie my top favorite. I too can't wait for the sequel coming out in a few weeks. The music, acting, character complexity all make LOTR the best fantasy movie I've ever seen. Good stuff!",Null,0,0,15 November 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," It's Okay, I Guess
","This isn't what I was expecting. The Lost World doesn't quite follow the novel version since they made it while Crichton was writing it. Even so, it really isn't worth a second look. The movie is full of action scenes which get long and boring to look at soon afterwards. This is definately no Jurassic Park with average actors and and barely passable plot.",Null,0,1,23 August 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," They Don't Make 'em Much Better Than This!!!
","[POSSIBLE SPOILERS...]The Two Towers was a fantastic film! Darker than FOTR, TTT continues the story of the Fellowship. The gathering is now broken and Frodo and Sam are marching toward Mordor while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli search for the captured Merry and Pippin.The Two Towers really emphasizes the power of evil and the strength of friendship. Gimli, the dwarf, eases the audience with his hilarious misfortunes and dialogue. The audience is also introduced in-depth to the divided character of Gollum and his desperate desire for the ring.The Two Towers transports the audience around Middle-Earth, and introduces us to new places like Rohan and Faragorn Forest. Although the movie isn't as mystical as FOTR, the awe at the power of Isengard comes through. The movie starts out a bit slow, but makes it all up in the end, with the great battle of Helm's Deep and the Final March of the Ents at Isengard.Is the movie better than FOTR? It certainly isn't worse. TTT has more in the way of large-scale battles and military movement while the FOTR has a smaller, more person-to-person atmosphere. All in all, TTT is an excellent continuation of FOTR and I can't wait for Return of the King, next winter!!!",10,0,0,18 December 2002
The Fly," It's Okay, I Guess
","I've been dying to see The Fly for two months but finally, when Sci-Fi showed it, I realized that it's not all that. There's far too much sex and too little action or suspense. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",Null,2,6,28 August 1999
The Lion King," Sheesh, Who Cares?
",It seems I'm the only one who doesn't believe this movie is the greatest Disney film of all time. I personally dislike this movie because there's not enough action AND because there's too much of those idiots: Timon and Pummba. I'm embarrassed to watch this movie in front of anyone!,Null,0,0,28 August 1999
Speed," A Whole New Kind of Movie
",I've seen this movie enough times that the whole acting and plot turned into a comedy. There are hundreds of places where someone can focus and find funny if they look hard enough. Usually most of what Jack says is reason to laugh. This whole movie is a joke!,Null,0,1,23 August 1999
Tarzan," Incredible
",It really wasn't what I was expecting. I'm not a Disney fan and recently their movies have really been bad. But this one was probably the best one ever made! The graphics are very well done and the acting . . . the bast I've seen in ages! The movie is a real must-see for anyone. There is a little too much talking and drama between Tarzan and the gorrilas but it is equally balanced with the action of this Disney Masterpiece!,Null,0,0,23 August 1999
Tarzan," Calm Down
","Okay, this movie is really a good one, if not the best one created by Disney but I don't see why people have to lose sleep over how incredible and realistic the movie is. Personally, I don't think the movie is that good, but seeing the other Disney movies I have to say that this is one of the best. However, I sure don't intend to lose sleep over a movie.",Null,0,2,28 August 1999
Apollo 13," Another Good One
","This movie, despite its flaws is really a great one. The acting is fair but what really supports this one is the visual effects. They are the greatest. The music also provides a nice, suspenseful atmosphere. This movie is truly one of the best in the world.",Null,0,0,23 August 1999
Pocahontas," The Music Keeps it Alive
","Pocahontas itself would have been a complete and total flop if it hadn't been for the music. The music truly kept me interested even though the plot, art, and effects really screwed it up! My favorite is the 'Gold' song even though I like the 'Savages' song as well.",Null,0,1,28 August 1999
Jurassic Park," The Best One of Them All!!!!!!!
","I have seen this movie over one hundred times and each time I have checked closer and viewed all the errors made through information. This movie is the greatest movie created. Ever since I saw it the first time on video I was astonished. It is full of action, suspense, mystery, and enjoyment. Truly it is the best movie ever created.",Null,0,0,23 August 1999
