Walk the Line," Keep your feathers numbered.
","Sound:Nice use of orchestral theme with guitar for dramatic emphasis, typical use of environmental music for this type of film, I liked the use of 'Dark Was The Night' first on the radio then as soundtrack for plot develpoment, most dialog was mixed too low in comparison to the music. 
80/100 Narrative: Circular narrative structure, time flow edited and used well, but nothing really new here. 
100/100 Character: well portrayed by leads and supporting cast, we are compassionate for the characters, the roles were challenging and the lead characters progressed and had an excellent arc. 
100/100 Technical: some crop reframing to match the final frame format, well lit, shot composition is text book, proper costuming and set design. 
95/100 Did I enjoy it: Yes, I actually like Johnny and June's music much more than I did. The funniest line is 'fortunately I keep my feathers numbered for just such an emergency' even though the scene is tragic and serious. 
100/100 Artistic merit: Well produced, high quality acting but we have seen this story before.

Inglourious Basterds," You just say bingo.
","Sound: Excellent mix of music styles for the soundtrack; classical contemporary pop, even silence. I also found an homage to Kurosawa of using inappropriate modern music for comedic affect. Well mixed with excellent sound effects. 
100/100 Technical: Well shot with great framing and excellent camera movement. Great costumes and settings. Hopefully the large amount of French, German, and Italian with subtitles will stimulate interest in foreign films. 
100/100 Narrative: Broken into five chapters and shown from various story lines that unite in the last chapter. The plot twists are forced by the characters. 
90/100 Character/Acting: Excellent memorable characters and portrayal of historical figures. Great dialog. 
85/100 Did I like it: Yes, a combination of quality and fun keeps interest and the twists give satisfaction. 
90/100 Artistic merit: Interesting use of alternative history, nontraditional narrative structure, quality production, excellent use of cinematic language, and homage's.

Iron Man 2," Heavy boots of lead.
","Sound: Well mixed, sound effects well done. Great use of pop tunes in sound track as orchestral and environmental music. 
90/100 Technical: Excellent special effects and well shot. 
100/100 Narrative: A little light on the action for this genre. It does not move as fast as it should and does not arc as much as it should. 
70/100 Character/Acting: Acting mostly middle of the road. The characters are not as strong this time. The villains not menacing or treacherous. 
60/100 Did I like it: Yes, a fun film and very enjoyable. 
70/100 Artistic merit: A well crafted film but lacks the notoriety, upper crust performances, or narrative to be considered seriously here. There are better examples of super hero movies to fill that role (The Dark Knight).

Battleship Potemkin," Save my baby.
","Sound: The orchestral score written for this film synchs well and helps drive the tension and energy of the film. There even is am homage to Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture by using Le Marsellaise in the score. 
90/100 Technical: Poor use of the ship model. Eisenstein breaks the 180 degree plane a couple of times. The montage editing drives the pace and tension of the film. Excellent use of framing and camera angles. 
95/100 Narrative: Episodic in 5 parts but it flows together. Weak ending if the film was not for propaganda use. 
100/100 Acting/Character: Excellent acting for the era. Eisenstein is not afraid of using close ups of the supporting cast; great faces too. Superb use of the different ranks and groups to signify the proletariat, bourgeoisie, and the elite classes; for the propaganda use. 
95/100 Did I like it: Yes, but if the ending were true to the real actions of the Soviet Union the ending would have had more bloodshed. 
90/100 Artistic merit: Excellent use of montage, controversial subject matter, and a film with a history of being banned or edited. This film's influence on setting standards for future films weighs heavy here. It also shows the power of a 'silent' film.

Lawrence of Arabia," He likes your lemonade.
","Sound: Excellent orchestral score. 
100/100 Narrative: Circular narrative, with heavy fictionalization of Auda abu Tiye and some of the battles; especially the battle of Aqaba. The story is still told well though. 
80/100 Technical: Exquisitely shot, framed, and edited. Excellent use of montage and landscapes. 
100/100 Acting/Character: All parts well done. O'Toole brings out Lawrence's eccentric behavior well. Alec Guinness' King Faisal gives us a dyed in the wool politician playing against experienced Machiavelli's 
100/100 Did I like it: Yes, viewing this film on the big screen I felt like I could step out from my seat and into the scene. 
100/100 Artistic merit: Historical films need more factual accuracy to draw their weight; but the overall craftsmanship keeps the films power.

The Longest Day," He used safety pins.
","Sound: Great sound effects editing. I did not like the way the theme song got used in the score, very weak, not developed enough. 
70/100 Technical: Well done but with some minor problems, like bad background extra acting and some of the takes with the German actors were tinged with some bilingual confusion. 
70/100 Narrative: Standard narrative of the first 24 hours of D-Day from many points of view; military, civilian, ally, enemy, fighting men, and support units. 
90/100 Acting/Character: Excellent use of an ensemble cast. We feel for the soldiers and their comrades. 
90/100 Did I like it: Yes, all of the merging story lines mixed with the humor and anti-war tone made it very enjoyable. 
100/100 Artistic merit: I compare this film to Saving Private Ryan in subject and scale. Very few war films portray the different points of view in a battle.

Patton," Like crap through a goose.
","Sound: Excellent environmental sound. Great use of the fanfare orchestral theme. 
85/100 Technical: Very good use of montage editing emphasizing character. Excellent reenactment of the war. High quality cinematography. 
90/100 Narrative: Great use of the opening monologue to set up our protagonist. Presented the historical facts well, the inaccuracies seemed minor. I have read 'A Soldiers Story' by Omar Bradley and found the film made the tension between Patton and Bradley not as strong as is really was but is still was there in the film. The story arcs well; we see Patton rise, fall, rise again and retire. Good use of companion story from the German perspective also. 
90/100 Acting/Character: High quality portrayal of Patton and Bradley. We see some of the tension between Patton and Bradley but more is placed between Patton and Montgomery. 
95/100 Did I enjoy it: Yes, a great deal. I was kept attentive with what Patton was going to say or do next. 
100/100 Artistic merit: The opening monologue is the most iconic piece of this film; added to a well crafted film give it it's power 
85/100 Total score 90.8/100",9,3,3,28 February 2018
Avatar," Smurfs in space.
","Sound: Excellent orchestral score. Good sound effects. Nice use of Navi religious music. 
90/100 Technical: Excellent seamless CGI. Top notch camera usage, shot selection, and great color palette. 
95/100 Narrative: Just enough exposition to set the story up. Good dramatic curve. Utilizes Avatar disconnection too much to keep story from peaking to early. 
80/100 Character/Acting: Competent acting, but the CGI takes away from it. Some good character arcs. Run of the mill villain; he has no real motivation. 
70/100 Did I enjoy it: Yes, very much so. The themes of our environment and criticism of the current state of America everyone says is overt in this film; I saw too. But, I also saw use of St. Sir Thomas Moore's Utopia as an ideological basis; 'unobtanium' indeed. I also saw Leni Riefenstahl's work with the Masai also as an influence; maybe a National Socialist agenda in mind since racial purity was a point of order for the Navi. Artistic merit: A well constructed film showing the possibilities of CGI.

Rocky," Yo.
","Sound: The musical score is excellent. The fanfare brings the tone of the film to life; reminds me of Copeland's Fanfare for the Common Man. The the incidental music is also excellent ranging from newer street doo wop and some eerie early techno. There are a few poorly done adr lines though 
95/100 Narrative: The story flows well and does not have a conventional ending. 
100/100 Characters: Well acted and memorable characters. Some background extras acting poorly though. 
95/100 Technical: Well edited, shot composition excellent, artistic use of lighting. Poor use of some mismatched film stock and some camera shake in a stationary shot. I also noticed some lens flair that did not lend to the mise en scene. 
85/100 Artistic Merit: An excellent example of film. It's grittiness believable in the sets and costumes. The characters are moving and hold your compassion. The tension and climax of the conflict hold your attention. 
100/100 Did I enjoy it: Yes, very much so. 
100/100 Overall score of a 95.8.",9,2,2,28 February 2018
The Departed," Lace curtan.
","Sound: Dramatic use of pop music and orchestral score. Sound effects were good. The sound was well mixed. 
80/100 Technical: Well shot, nice framing, excellent sets and costumes. 
90/100 Narrative: Prologue sets up the protagonist and the antagonist. Excellent flow, constantly progressing, peaking, and climbing. We know everything but the ending that gives us the twists. We view this film from both the antagonists' and protagonists' view. 
100/100 Acting/Character: Good villain in Costello. You hate Sullivan for the slime ball he is. You feel for the hero. Great supporting cast too. Excellent acting and dialog. 
100/100 Did I like it: Yes, well paced and lots of emotion for the characters. I enjoyed Matt Damon getting his ass beat by Wahlberg. 
90/100 Artistic merit: the tension and the plot structure are the keys here. Along with the very credible acting; nothing is out of place. 
95/100 Total score 92.5/100",9,1,2,28 February 2018
The Deer Hunter," Di di mau.
","Sound: Well mixed, nice score. Excellent use of Russian orthodox sacred music. 
70/100 Technical: Unnecessary use of stock footage. Some edits not synched well. A lot of excellent cinematography 
70/100 Narrative: Excellent use of montage to establish character exposition. A tragedy that flows from happiness to sorrow, alienation, and hope. It moves slow, but has to. We need to see the bonds of friendship and camaraderie before the effects of the war. 
60/100 Character/Acting: Top notch acting here, all characters have arcs. Very believable and realistic people. The extras are very good, they add to the illusion of the story 
90/100 Did I like it: Yes, I know people like these; very truthful about how war affects people, even the ones who do not go and fight. 
75/100 Artistic merit: This film touches the sensitive and difficult issue of the aftermath of war on veterans, their friends, family, and communities. This is the first film to do it since 'The Way We Were'. Though Cimino's films tend to be a little too long for some people and move a little slow (this has hurt his reputation). 
72/100 Total score 72.8/100",7,1,2,28 February 2018
The Thin Red Line," Poetic.
","Sound: Excellent use of sound effects, well done musical score. I enjoyed the use of the Micronesian hymns too. 
95/100 Technical: First class cinematography and a poetic editing style with the cutaways. Excellent recreation of Guadalcanal. 
100/100 Narrative: The real narrative here is the poetic editing and the inner monologues. On the surface we get the story of a battle on Guadalcanal but the inner monologues give us what the soldiers are really thinking and feeling. 
60/100 Character/Acting: The acting is fair all around, but the sum of the whole is greater than all of the parts here. 
Did I enjoy it: Yes, the beauty of the islands hiding horrific war, the sensitivity of the soldiers, and the irony of their actions. 
80/100 Artistic merit: A well crafted film addressing war without pomp and patriotism.
