The Ring," A horror movie that delivers
","I love horror movies.  Unfortunately, they almost always seem to fall apart and never make it to the end as well as they start out.  This one is an exception.  The symbolism, forshadowing, sense of mystery and doom never let up.  The movie is excellently casted, directed and acted.  This horror movie has few equals in the genre.  A must see.",10,0,0,4 November 2002
Star Trek Into Darkness," It'll do.
","I went to this with great expectations and for the most part I wasn't let down, but as I think about the next day there are some flaws here, that's for sure, and I can't get them off of my mind. The opening scene was pretty random with Kirk having stolen something for some reason. It was an excuse to take Kirk's command away and give it back to him in twenty minutes or so. All of that was too rushed. I also wonder if they can ever make another Star Trek without the Enterprise being reduced to scaffolding by the end of the movie. The darn thing used to not be able to go in the atmosphere, too. I hate the new look of beaming people. T.V.'s simple special effects were better for this one thing.First, the 3D filming was flat out bad during close ups. The scene of Kirk and Pike in the bar had every shot with huge, gray, fuzzy blobs taking up 1/3 of the screen. I didn't like the look of the 3D at all. If often distracted me from the movie. Star Trek, even as a reboot, does not need as much action as it has, in can forgo a little for some story telling. In the original series Kirk always would outwit the villain , not beat his brains out and this change just makes him seem awfully stupid in comparison with the Kirk in the original time line. Spock hopping around with Kahn on flying cars is also way to over the top.The scene with Kirk dying and Spock outside the 'radiation chamber' that mirror images the original scene from 'Wrath of Kahn' was too much. I was crying, literally, but only because I was remembering the original. The reboot has not done enough character development yet for me to believe that Kirk and Spock are best friends on a deep spiritual level as in the original when we had three years worth of television to base it on (and some great initial character development in the movie). The way they were going to bring Kirk back to life was too easy and obvious. My kids were saying, 'tribble juice!'All in all this went for too many explosions and fist fights and not enough character development and story telling. I wasn't going to try to weigh this against 'Wrath of Kahn,' but frankly they made me (especially by having the Leonard Nimoy cameo). I decided I was a bad father for taking my kids to this without having them see the original Botany Bay episode and the 'Wrath of Kahn' movie. I did enjoy the romp, but it really didn't feel much like Star Trek to me. More like a Vin Diesel movie. I suppose that this is what the world wants from the series in this day and age, but I always felt like Roddenberry's vision of the future as a place where violence was a last resort was a good one. One last thing, where the hell were the Klingons? I can't believe they just let these humans come in and kill a bunch of them and then a space battle with two wounded ships and they didn't do something.One last, last thing. How do they get from Chronos to Earth in seconds. Even at warp speeds that should take a long damn time. That's why it's a FIVE YEAR mission and it takes Voyager so long to get home.Six photon torpedoes out of ten.",6,0,4,19 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It is a great movie after all.
","I must admit that I am a fan of Star Wars.  While I don't consider myself a freak about the series (I managed to wait three weeks before catching 'Attack of the Clones.') I do consider Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back as the greatest movies ever made.I read most of the reviews and was going into the movie expecting a lame love story (and it was) and a great action scene at the end (and it was).  I was not prepared for the rest of it and I'm really not sure how I would rate this movie outside of the Star Wars universe.  I guess as a movie in it's own right, if you knew nothing about Star Wars it wouldn't hold up very well, but it's not meant to be seen that way.  It is meant to be seen as the fifth installment of a series of movies with a grand scope.  In that case the movie worked.It never bored me, I was hanging on every word.  There was plenty of action throughout and lots of good references to what was going to happen in later (earlier?) movies.  I found myself moved several times, but the emotions were when I was considering the sweep of all the movies.I left very satisfied.  While the movie didn't leave me as excited as Star Wars did or as transfixed as Empire did, I was very happy with it as it just seemed to fit the arc of the whole series perfectly.I think my review comes accross a little more lukewarm than I intend it.  I really do think the movie deserves a 10 out of 10 as I'm sure I'll want to see it several more times in  my life.",10,0,0,1 June 2002
Edward Scissorhands," An intriquing disaster
","When I watch this film I can feel it failing in so many different ways. Edward's not funny, he's not particularly sad.  He's like a three year old and watching a three year old fail in love is not only appropriate, it is necessary.  There is no way this guy could get Winona (and who doesn't love her in that red wig--oh my).  I don't know what we're supposed to be feeling, who we're supposed to identify with, or whether it is a happy or sad ending.Still, while I know they failed to obtain what they wanted in this movie, the cinematography is grand.  The characters are eye candy.  It's one that you can't stop watching, but for all the wrong reasons.  I'll give it a 6.",8,0,0,12 May 2003
Twilight," Wow! Was this slow and boring!
","I bought this book on a whim this summer for my daughter and for my wife. They loved it. My daughter says it's the best book she ever read. So, being pleased that I actually purchased something for the ladies that they liked I decided I'd keep being a hero and surprise them with tickets to this on the opening weekend. 'I'm not their hero anymore.I got to the theater early as we all wanted to sit together and we were expecting crowds (not as big as we thought), but my son (age 9) and I got seats while my wife and daughter (age 11) got popcorn. I was a little uncomfortable as we sat in the theater before the movie started with the noisiest bunch of women this side of a Beatles' concert. I was excited, but I was also realistic. This didn't need to be 'Casablanca' to make me happy. Just give me a 7 star flick. At some point I started hoping their would be a scene with enough light in it for me to check my watch. At another point my son whispered to me, 'Dad, this is a HORRIBLE movie.' I never knew the fellow to not like anything (other than church). First of all the two glaringly bad things. The make-up made 'The Munsters' look subtle. The special effects looked like they were done by a middle school video club. The plot was very slow and their was no conflict for the first 90 minutes. We got Bella sitting around talking to this unrealistically nice friends (One boy didn't realize he was gay, but maybe that comes up in a later book). Her worst problem seems to be that she has two great parents and every boy in the town wants to take her to the prom. We do have a 4-second action scene. Bella discovers almost nothing for herself. She does go to the book store and check out a book, but then hardly uses it and instead goes on the Internet and finds out that Edward is a vampire. Still, after that he just tells her everything about being an umpire (uhhhh, no that's a different scene)...vampire. The Vampires, I understand, are supposed to be incredibly good looking, but they're not up to speed in those regards (except for about four of them). There is an incredibly stupid baseball scene where they actually wear baseball uniforms which just comes across as absurd (and why, if they want to protect Bella so much, would they take her out during a thunderstorm?).After waiting forever for some conflict to happen, it finally does, and is over in about 5 minutes. It also seemed that Edward was attracted to Bella because he wanted to eat her worse than other humans. Huh? I mean I really wanted to eat my candy in the theater but I wasn't really attracted to it in that way. The ending of the movie seemed to just be tacked on. I was fascinated by the other Vampires (both good and bad), but learned nothing about them, except that one of the 'good' vampires was grumpy about Edward dating Bella. I was also fascinated with the 'Native Americans,' but we only got a couple of none-to-subtle hints about what they were. The thing is, I felt like this movie made the mistake of telling me what was happening instead of showing me what was happening. No matter how good a book is, a movie has to be a movie, and this was mostly just a lot of talking.My daughter was depressed the rest of the day as she had been so excited to see this. My wife said, she could have taken it being slow, but that the make-up ruined it for her. My son was just ready for some buffalo wings and refused to talk about the movie at all. Still, the scenery was beautiful when they got in the woods, and this only increased my appetite for a thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail. All in all, I'll take almost any episode of 'Buffy, The Vampire Slayer' over this.",4,28,57,22 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Best Movie Ever?
","Just so you know where I'm coming from, I'm not one of those people who has read the Lord of the Rings 85 times.  I don't think I ever finished the trilogy when I attempted to read it in high schoo.  I didn't give fellowship 10 stars (only 9), but this movie is far superior to any other movie in so many ways.  Cinematography, acting.  For three hours I thought I was in middle earth.  This is probably the best I've seen ever.  Great piece of movie making.",10,0,0,29 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A great tour of an old castle
","Somehow I felt like I was being shown this castle by a real estate agent. The story was a little light, but man was it beautifully filmed.  The three kids in the lead roles are marvelous actors and I was excited just to get to see them light up the screen. Charisma!  Still, I just felt that the movie was lacking something.  I needed a deeper story to hold the scenes together (most of the scenes individually were great, but they just didn't get).  It seemed like Harry never really figured anything out, he just had the answers given to him.I give the movie an 8, but eagerly await the next installment which was probably my favorite of the books.How long will part 4 be? 6 hours?",9,0,0,9 December 2002
