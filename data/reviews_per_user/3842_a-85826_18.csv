Fight Club," BLACK JOKE
","Brad Pitt said that this is a movie that people will not understand a hundred years later, but will anyone really remember this movie a hundred years later? Just like the ending of the movie, in Fighting Club, tall buildings full of doctrines were built, and they saw the buildings collapse ... Then what? Has a new world been established? Who will remember what they did? The destruction of a few buildings and a few people is just a remodeling of the world. Soon the tall buildings will remain meaningless. Personal insanity does not change the world, like a joke.The world is meaningless. What really needs to be changed is people's re-examination of self. Director David Vinci used his wild imagination and creativity to express the propaganda of ideology and the cynicism of ideology, making this film undoubtedly the pinnacle of his personal work, satisfying the director's personal expression of desire And the meaning of 'Brawler Club' may be like the protagonists of the movie, see",7,0,0,19 March 2020
Zootopia," excellent work
","Sheet! excellent work! I want to write such a story! 'Like the movie, all I can do is to rely on the memory as soon as possible after watching it (because I ca n't find the online version because of the global simultaneous release, I can only rely on the memory in the cinema) to make this movie all available. Analyze the place of analysis and study to improve your ability to grasp the story. I also hope to move closer to such a good story.",8,0,0,29 March 2020
The Notebook," Growing up in love
","The plots of the notebook notebook are twists and turns, and the emotions expressed are sincerely touching. Most importantly, it tells us such a principle, even if we go roundabout, we can finally return to our favorite person. This gives many nostalgic people some opportunities. Some people always say that the past should not be remembered, and let it stay in the memories. Then the banner of this miss, sentimental everywhere. This movie makes up for our regrets in love to some extent, telling us this truth: When we work hard to love each other and fulfill our promises, why can't we be together? Dear Ellie, I had trouble sleeping last night because I knew it was over between us and I no longer suffer because I knew that there was true love between us. If the future is somewhere far away and we meet again, I will smile at you and remember that we spent some summer together in the shade, learning from each other and growing up in love.",8,1,1,19 March 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," revenge
","In many people's hearts, revenge is a dualistic relationship: one positive and one evil, one good and one evil, and revenge is a battle between light and darkness. The film uses a period of establishment and dissolution of hate relations to disintegrate this dualistic concept of opposition, simple and easy personal relief relations, revealing the nature of humanity.",8,0,0,21 March 2020
Forrest Gump," i just want to run
","A feather fluttered in the sky, flew across the treetops, and flew towards the blue. At the foot of Forrest Gam, A-Gump sandwiched it into his favorite book. He was sitting in Savannah On a bench in the state, the passersby who were waiting for the bus in the same seat kept telling the story of their life. After reading this story over and over again, I always felt the same shocking after reading it, just like A-Gump said 'I want to run, I just want to run.'",9,1,1,15 March 2020
LÃ©on: The Professional," Lovely story
","Leon is the quietest killer I have ever seen.He is not scary but distressing. I could feel Matilda holding his finger before going to bed to say good night when the ice inside his stiff body melted. Leon was extremely lonely, and habitually lonely.More and more modern people feel the same way. Loneliness has become a normal state after our self-consciousness awakens. Can't resist. So, everyone goes in love, travels, and socializes, to a large extent just to meet someone who can love each other.The reason I like this film is actually not as grand as the above. I like this film because it is quiet.Silently make trouble, walk quietly, kill quietly, and produce love quietly.I think this story is full of myself. The real myself, and the imaginary myself.",9,0,0,15 March 2020
Good Will Hunting," JUST GO FOR DREAM
","I think Will was lucky after all, not because of his talented brain, but because he met a doctor like Shane, who made Will take a step forward in facing life bravely. Compared with movies, in reality, many people actually calculate life like Will, especially love, and use those factors without theoretical basis to calculate the end of brave love, and then discourage. We have created all kinds of perfection, but we don't stop there. Everyone in life is imperfect, especially in a close relationship, they will always see each other's deficiencies. Love needs these blemishes to adjust. A perfect love does not mean that two people are perfect personality, but that two people can get along happily even if they have flaws. So, no matter what kind of weakness, please accept it frankly, don't use perfection to pretend to be inferior. Face life bravely, love courageously, only then can life have no regrets",8,0,0,18 March 2020
Call Me by Your Name," YOU ARE MINE
","In the original novel, Elio spends his life with this love and memories, without falling in love with others and not getting married.I used to think that paying a lifetime for a short love is a tragedy of life. After watching this movie, my views have changed. Such love is simple, beautiful and holy, separated at the most beautiful time, without any impurities, how many people can be so lucky to have such love.Such love is not a tragedy, they all have a wonderful life.",8,2,4,18 March 2020
La La Land," LOVE AND DREAM
","The film uses spring, summer, autumn, and winter to narrate in chapters. Not only are the clues clear, but the emotions are more appropriate. The emotional changes experienced by the heroes and heroines, like the four seasons, are adorable, enthusiastic, withering, and cold. Relatively speaking, the story of 'The City of Philharmonic' is very simple. Two young men and women with dreams, because the dreams come together, are separated because of their respective dreams.",8,5,5,18 March 2020
Pulp Fiction," Quentin Style
","Modernist films are normal and linear, while the plot in postmodernist films can only be present. When people watch movies, it is difficult to think about, or unable to think about the logic of the story.
Quentin deconstructed the film, and he knew the essence of postmodernism. What is postmodernism? Let us briefly talk about it. We must also understand that fuzzy standards, vulgar and elegant standards coexist vaguely, time is lost, and morals are broken.",8,0,1,17 March 2020
Titanic," LOVE STORY
","Inspired by the wreckage of the Titanic, James Cameron evolved a sailing legend into a breathtaking love story. Cameron said: 'In our collective imagination, the tragedy of the Titanic has almost become a myth. With the passage of time, the humanity and vitality contained in it have disappeared. I hope that the love between Rose and Jack can be Become a beacon of emotion, let the audience devote their whole heart and witness the reappearance of history. '",9,0,0,17 March 2020
The Shape of Water," the shape of Strange love
","Someone said: Everyone is an incomplete individual who is split into two halves. During his life, he is looking for the other half, but he may not find it because there are too many people split.There are a large number of disadvantaged groups in the movie. Eliza has been unable to speak since she was born. The fisherman has been treated as a monster. Giles, a gay roommate, has been discriminated against by restaurant staff. Zelda, a black colleague, and restaurant guests have not equal treatment......They are incomplete in the eyes of security staff Strickland",6,1,2,23 March 2020
A Beautiful Mind," beauty flow
","The film is just a film, it is the sublimation of reality, let the beauty flow in the film, and let people in the reality be full of fantasy about beauty. So beautiful and divorced, although the old man was still together after making this film, but. . . . . . I do n't know how to make me dream about Alicia 's beauty, such a beautiful face, such a beautiful heart, so meticulous and indomitable, everything, I just want to blame my stinky hand for searching, why not Leave yourself a little bit of fantasy? In fact, sometimes it 's not bad to stay a little bit fantasizing, realistically, can you be more realistic.",8,0,0,20 March 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," NOT JUST'Money, sex, and drugs'
","'Money, sex, and drugs' feels the main thread throughout the film, and is also the selling point of the film, especially the bold description of sex and drugs, which is not found in any previous film describing Wall Street. Many people may feel exaggerated, but I think It's true.
These three words are indeed the most common occurrence of Wall Street amateur gossip, and they are indeed the excitement of people. Needless to say, this is the driving force of Wall Street and the most important ruler of this materialistic financial center, which we will discuss later. Let 's talk about eye-catching first. After watching this movie, will everyone be curious about drugs and drugs, and do Wall Street elites really need these two things to fill the void? My answer is 'yes, and no'.",7,0,0,20 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," FOR FREE
","The feathers of some birds are too bright and should not have been kept in cages.Perhaps the point of the story is not that Andy was finally freed from prison. Instead, he repaired the roof on the balcony and liked to watch everyone enjoy cold beer. Perhaps he would rather be detained and listen to a classical music. When people are the least free and when their personality is most disrespected, they do not abandon their firm belief that they are 'human.' This is the most precious thing.",9,0,0,16 March 2020
AmÃ©lie," a poem of beauty
","If one word is used to define the whole story, I think it is more appropriate to use the word 'change'. Let's talk about what changed.Throughout the movie, the stories are full of romance and whimsy.The movie shows a lonely, introverted person who loves beautiful, innocuous, cute little habit, some ingenious careful thinking and design, these habit and design are very loving, so that people who watch can get a smile when they get .In my opinion, this movie is a poem dedicated to lonely introverts, a poem that is as smooth and beautiful as the accordion in the movie.",8,0,0,23 March 2020
The Great Gatsby," Unreal love
","The dead knots of Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Mitt and Wilson witnessed by Nick, let us see the deep shadows behind the bright and beautiful. This is life! The brighter the place, the darker it must be. But people often see the light easily, and ignore the shadows from the light. Such shadows are like an illusion, but they may be fatal.",7,0,0,24 March 2020
