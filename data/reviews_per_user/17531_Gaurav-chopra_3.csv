Iron Man 3," Iron Man grows up.........
","I must confess that I entered the cinema hall with a very different set of expectations ,the exact same expectations which have been progressively built through both the sequels and the super successful Avengers.and that is the probable reason ,why, many people have not welcomed this one . This movie answers the legendary question that , weather ' Man makes the suit or Suit makes the man' And the answer has been brilliantly been given by Mr.Shane Black, with the help from our beloved 'Tony Stark' and his associates - Pepper,Rhodes and Happy. I personally think that Robert Downey Jr. Is an enigma ......give him a dead role and still he will light it up like fire , in fact in both the earlier installments ,he has underplayed his potential but In this one Mr.Black has allowed him to perform beyond the suit . I guess , what Nolan tried with Batman trilogy and what Sam Mendes did with Skyfall this one is on the same path , showing that Heroes also bleed ,they cry ,they fail and they are as vulnerable. As for the villains ,weather , it's the Mandarin or Aldrich Killian - Mr . Black wants to put forward a completely new point altogether - Like the Good , even the Bad is just a symbol ......it's just a projection of evil or negative .....the characters don't matter - And I am reasonably sure that , this aspect of his will draw a certain amount of flak.But if one truly understands his point then One will welcome this 'one' with Wide Open Arms. Iron-Man 3 by all means is a leap .......a leap not only from its prequels but from all the other super hero features,especially the ones in Marvel universe.",9,4,8,4 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Director J.J Abrams on path of Spielberg
","The first Star Trek installment was a marvel.........a reminiscent of what Nolan did to Batman franchise .Down the generations, it will be remembered as a great piece of work by J.J Abrams.. And so I entered the theater with great expectations ........but ladies and gentlemen ,I must proudly state that this sequel is a perfect extension to the predecessor . On second thoughts a truly better extension . The entire cast (almost entire except of Alice eve ) is the one that will be remembered as The Star Trek crew .Chris pine and Zachary Quinto make the perfect on screen pair.......what rdj is to iron man series .....these two are now to Star Trek .thankfully Mr.Bad in this one (played by Benedict ) is real good at what he does .......all in all a great ensemble cast ..........sown beautifully by Mr.Abrams with a great plot and spectacular VFX.As a general observation , whenever the VFX and SCI FI finesse takes over the story ......somehow performances take a back seat but this one promises a powerhouse act from all the young guns and as I always suggest that whenever a sci fi is able to achieve (even)a fraction of emotional traction with the audience ..........the success is guaranteed and this one for sure makes u love Spock & kirk duo. I certainly can't imagine the next one without the same star cast and more importantly without Mr.Abrams ......who is the soul to this entire journey . I bet you will love this one.",10,6,28,11 May 2013
Oblivion," Don't judge the book just by the title........
","I am not a fan of sic fi, I usually avoid all sorts of alien fare with creepy looking animals and those futuristic interstellar wars .........but because of Mr.cruise I still decided to sit in the theatre against my wishes ......... although some parts of this movie reminded me of 'The Matrix'.....and Stanley Kubrick's's classic (2001 a space Odyssey).........but that's just a part of the story line......I guess like a routine romantic.....the body of a routine sci fi also remains the same. The movie opens with with an all white ensemble of props and cast.....seeming as if designed by someone from the Apple inc. But as the movie slowly gains momentum,one seems to develop likability towards Tom cruise .........the two girls (olga and Andrea ) have justified their roles and then there is Morgan freeman with not a lengthy but a mentionable character ........ but the Center is the Plot with a great twist ,which not only surprises the audience but ends by moving the emotional strings at some level ........and so I must say .......whenever a sci fi has been able to achieve even a fraction of emotional traction with the audience ..........the success is guaranteed . just sit till the end and you will certainly like this one .......",8,2,4,5 May 2013
