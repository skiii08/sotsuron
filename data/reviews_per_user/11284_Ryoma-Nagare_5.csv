The Avengers," First True SuperHero Movie!
","OK, I know 10/10 scores are thrown in too lightly n ow a days, but hear me out, this movie is truly astonishing. Following the storyline directly from Thor 2011, this movie starts strong with Loki trying to conquer earth, from there its just a wild ride, it grips on you and you won't be able to catch your breath until way after the credits.The thing that I appreciate the most, is that its a true SuperHero movie, often in comics adaptations, the directors try to ground the actions and powers, worried they can not match the scope of the comic book medium. Well, not here, The action is unbelievable, the feats of strength breathtaking Ironman shoots its repulsor beams, Thor uses his lightning strike.Lastly it wouldn't have worked without the humor, Wheedon, has perfect chops, each time his punchlines will take you off guard, and trust me laugh you will.I watched this in a really packed theater, the function was sold out one week before, a record in my country. Everyone was cheering, laughing, clapping and wowing. a truly special spectacle.Really F***ING Amazing.",10,6,13,26 April 2012
Pacific Rim," A love Letter to to the mecha and Kaiju Genre
","Great Movie: Go watch it.Guillermo del Toro just conned 190M usd, and created the ultimate macha-kaiju movie.As such the ride is amazing, the movie is full of references, winks and nods to all the tropes present in the genre.If you long were a child of the 80s, and grew with the likes of tranzor Z, Voltron, or robotech, you should watch this movie, unlike Bayformers this is truly an enjoyable experience, while bay does not get and despises the source material, Guillermo del Toro embraces his inner child and delivers Giant Mechas Rocket Punching Loevcraftian Horrors without a flinch.If you've watched any mecha anime or manga, or have watched kaiju before you should watch this.",10,5,15,12 July 2013
Oblivion," Pretty but dumb... go watch moon
","OK, i went to watch this movie when it premiered in Chile on April's 11th 2013, was quite psyched about watching this movie before it premiered in the US, although no reviews meant I had to go in blind, just trusting the trailer.Lets be clear about something, the movie looks stunning, almost every scene uses extensive VFX, lots of CG but still manages to engage, specially the futuristic vehicles, that look right out of Sir Jonathan Ive's office. The problem lies exclusively in the acting and writing of this movie, the pacing wasn't even that bad, but the twist about who the villain is, and what the master plan is, makes no sense. The first part of the movie makes for interesting world-building, then everything is thrown out of the board.the ending is particularly bad, overall if you want to watch the good version of the main plot of this movie go watch MOON.",4,7,14,16 April 2013
Man of Steel," Best Superman Movie, one of the best superhero movies
","I'm a huge superman fan, all my life have been, while I loved the 1978 Superman movie, one has to concede by any standard its not a good movie, even if Christopher Reeve and John Williams were beyond perfect, the production problems and compromises are notorious.I love the 1986 John Byrne's version, a more streamlined version of the character that back then removed most of the silver age baggage from a character.No that thats clear, I can say I loved this movie, sure its an origin movie and as such the pacing is a little relentless leaving little space for character development.Having said that, including Superman's Origin with an updated Krypton, that will hopefully erase the bland crystal version forever.Adding not only a match for superman prowess that can trade blows with him, but Zod the embodiment of what Kal-El would be if not for his humanity.The way Earth had to deal with the notion of alien life, before even meeting Superman was incredible, and sets the stage for a decent portrayal of Luthor in a Future movie.Having happened what happens in this movie, Luthor's motives as an Earthist are understandable.Instead in most comics his gated for superman comes as petty envy, in this universe fear is the appropriate reaction, to what happened.Lois will meet Clark before the superman persona, adding intimacy to their relationship.And Superman will have to deal with Zod the same way he did in the comics, which is just an important part of his character as uncle ben's death is to spiderman. the only time superman's had to do it marked and poisoned him.and the movie manages that perfectly.The visuals are stunning. I was left with my mouth open at the battle scenes which are relentless.Overall as an old-school fan, I liked whats new and whats old, how they keep some modern takes and some silverage stuff This one is in the top 3 origin superhero movie, maybe behind captain America and spiderman 1 but overall better than iron man, thor.I liked it better than Ironman 3 and Batman Begins.dark Knight Rises was a mess of a movie.Finally the tone is perfect not to dark not to camp. some critics are complaining that this movie is too Nolanverse which is silly, Nolan made everything plain and realistic Magic or sci-fi had nothing to do with Nolan's Batman. this movie on the other hand starts with spaceships fighting dragons, And just keeps going from there.",9,0,1,15 June 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," 100 monkeys typing...
","watched it on 1st of June 2014. It's an amazing movie. I'm still shocked that this whitewashed blockbuster, made by committee, worked at all. But it does it works all day long, it even takes some work home, and the next day comes with lattes for the whole office. Don't know who was responsible for making this as fun as it turned to be, probably editors, or screenwriters, I'm pretty sure based on their track record, it wasn't the producers or the director. Maybe its just a case of 100 Monkeys typing Shakespeare. The fact is I was at the edge of my seat the whole movie, just terrified that they would drop the ball and make a stupid twist that would make the whole thing fall apart (*ehem* oblivion). As it is, It's the best Space Marines I've ever seen on any movie ever, and one of my top 10 sci-fi movies.",10,4,9,2 June 2014
