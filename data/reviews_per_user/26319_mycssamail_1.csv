The New World," would it end sometime?
","This movie is just awful, perhaps the worst I've ever seen during the past 5 years. It would NEVER end. After 90 minutes I felt it would end, it wouldn't. OK let's go ahead with it and see what's going to happen next. Yes, the rest of the movie is exactly as what I expected - girl meeting her old lover (because he surprisingly survived) - and finally came to an end. During its playing I saw some people walking out of the theater and the rest, including me just shifting in the seats, waiting for an end. Its jumping scenes would quickly kill the image that you built from the previous scenes, leaving you NO story. you barely feel anything from the movie that flows into your mind - but you do have a hope while watching it: ending.DO NOT waste your time and money on it.",1,2,7,29 January 2006
