Minority Report," It's worth the ride
","Like Time Magazine has said, this movie is no artificial intelligence, just smart fun.  There are a lot of action scenes and special effects sequences that make this film worth the 'ride' in the cinema. I justdon't get it why Spielberg manages to drag the film to a slow climax after we know what the WHOLE film is about.  It starts out with fast, furious, hard-hitting action and when it ends, you'll ask 'Have I just seen the same film?'  It's great, but I guess most people just have to stick to Raiders of the Lost Ark.",Null,0,0,10 October 2002
The Bourne Identity," Great Action
","This film is one of the better action films in recent years. Matt Damon is fairly good in his acting, and you'll find that he rocks in some of the martial arts scenes.  The film has really cool car chase, and you'll laugh when you'll see Bourne surfing on a man's back. Chris Cooper was great as Conklin, so was Brian Cox in his character.  Julia Stiles is always great, but she should have picked a better role than this one. Better yet, they should have given a struggling actress the job. (She takes calls, that's it!) Franka Potente plays a woman who chooses to stay with Bourne while he's being chased, but you can easily tell that Bourne wants to be with her mainly because of her body. There's a nice twist in the end, where the reason of Bourne's mission failure is revealed. Anyways, great action. Go see it.",Null,0,1,29 September 2002
Signs," Cool horror flick!
","M. Night Shyamalan's most exciting film! Sure, it has no surprise ending, and the script sure as hell won't get nominated for an oscar next year, but hey? It was fun!  If you go see it in the cinema for the first time, youll find yourself holding your breath. This is what makes Night's latest film good. The most crucial element of creating suspense it the anticipation of action. Sure there are frights, but don't worry they won't kill you. When I saw the teaser for this a couple months back, I thought it was about Mel trying being fooled by scam artists, but it's not. You'll know earlier that the film is about aliens. It starts when the family parks the car in front of the house, and they hear the alien's voices from Morgan (Rory Culkin's) walky talkie. But the film had something else to it. Graham's dilemma whether he should start believing in miracles or 'signs', Graham questioning his faith. It gets resolved in the very last scene. It's worth the money. Go see it!",Null,0,1,26 September 2002
