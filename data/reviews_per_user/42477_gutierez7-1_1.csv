Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Materpiece
","No doubt about it - Vol II is even better than Vol I. Where the first one gets a bit absurd, the second stays impressively real. Where the first one leaves you hanging, the second one gives an inspiring and completely fulfilling ending. This is Tarantino at his best.There is no real way to summarize this movie. But essentially it picks up where Vol. I left off. 'The Bride' is continuing on her revenge rampage, getting closer to Bill himself. We find out a lot more about Bill and the events surrounding his relationship to 'The Bride.' This makes the movie more effective and the characters more real. The action, the acting, the drama, the humor, the moral, the everything of this movie is better than the first, which was very good in itself. This is a must-see!I would recommend seeing Vol I first. The second will just simply not mean as much.Wow. Great movie.",10,2,4,22 March 2005
