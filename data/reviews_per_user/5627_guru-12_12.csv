Raiders of the Lost Ark," The standard by which action figures should be judged
","I mean, really.  This is the film with breakneck action, a great script, fun, wonderful characters, and great effects.  If you're not on the edge of your seat, what's the matter with you?  And if you're intellectualizing this film...you're missing the point.  It has been the starting point for every action movie since.  Hoorah!",10,0,0,20 October 1999
North by Northwest," Maybe the best display of Hitch's wonderful sense of humor
","Hitchcock was always celebrated for his beautifully articulated sense of humor.  In this movie, that mixes so fantastically well with Cary Grant's natural sense of comedy that we come away having seen both a tight, suspenseful thriller and perhaps Hitchcock's most amusing work.  All in all, such an entertaining film that even those who find Hitchcock overrated (and there aren't a whole lot of them) will love it.  This is a fine picture and perhaps my favorite Hitch film ever.",10,1,1,24 October 1999
The Usual Suspects," The greatest ending in cinematic history
","Only Doctor Strangelove comes close.  That's all I can say.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant, the screenplay is astonishing, and the ending, as I said, is the best ever.",10,0,1,22 May 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," What most people here don't know, that can change your opinion of the film
","Are you ready for this?THIS FILM IS NOT, NOT, NOT!!! BASED ON THE NOVEL!!!!!!As a matter of fact, the novel is based on the film!The screenplay for 2001 was co-written by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke.  Their first draft of it was considered for a long time by both and ultimately, rejected by both...however, Clarke decided afterwards to return to the rejected script and rework it as a novel.  So for those of you who laud the book and say that the movie was a pale imitation: WRONG!  The fact of the matter is, the movie was released before the novel was actually published!  Don't that beat all Hell? The fact of the matter is, no matter how you slice it, this film is a masterpiece.  The parts of the whole are not explained here, for the simple reason that the viewer is asked to interpret it for himself!!!!  Like a piece of classical music, as Kubrick himself said.  When you listen to instrumental music, with no lyrics to explain it, you are put in a position wherein you must draw your own conclusions about its meaning.  The same with 2001!  I strongly recommend that naysayers go back and watch the movie again, with this in mind!",10,0,2,12 May 1999
Titanic," No. That's all. Just... No.
","Titanic wins many awards in my book.  Worst Script of 1997, for starters. Then there's Worst Overacting (Billy Zane), Worst Underacting (Leonardo DiCaprio), Worst Song ('My Heart Will Go On'--if only Celine Dion had gone down with the ship) and probably more.  That's just scratching the surface on how disgusted I was with this movie.  Particularly the script.  Why can't Jim Cameron just stick with the technical stuff he's so brilliant at?  Who told that clown he could write?  Moreover, who told him he could write dialogue?  I hope and pray, for the sake of the legacy we bring our descendants, that this movie never makes any important Top 100 List.  People tend to take those things so seriously.  And this movie has nothing that should be taken seriously.",5,2,3,10 November 1999
A Hard Day's Night," Never a better film made about rock music.
","It's silly, zany, funny, cheeky, witty, and a dozen other adjectives that all describe the Beatles.  The photography is beautiful, the film showcases their personalities ingeniously.  If you don't like this film, you can't like the Beatles.  And if you don't like the Beatles...what on earth is the matter with you?",Null,3,3,20 October 1999
Army of Darkness," Clearing up a myth
","There are common misconceptions abounding that say that this is the best of the Evil Dead trilogies.  I'm sorry, but this information is false.  Army of Darkness is genius, to be sure.  It is the funniest, most slapstick of all the movies, and perhaps the most brazen.  But hang it all, it's just too high-budget, high-quality, and self-deprecating to be as good as Evil Dead II, which tempered all of these.  Especially the first two... Much as I love Army of Darkness, and believe me I adore it, it will never be the timeless masterpiece of its immediate predecessor.  Thank you.",10,1,1,22 September 1999
Jaws," Guess what, folks? I wasn't impressed!
","Yes.  The special effects, acting, and script were all well done.  But perhaps the key to any great suspense film is the pacing.  And this particular 'great' suspense film, was slow to a crawl.  It should have picked up, but it didn't.  In fact it got SLOWER after they got onto the boat!  I was waiting for a lot of action scenes with the shark.  Instead I got Robert Shaw musing on his experiences as a hunter.  It wasn't a thriller so much as a meditation on the potential danger of a shark, and of trying to catch one.  Having started my Spielberg experiences with ET, I was used to a standard for his films that this one didn't meet.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to take a more pre-Star Wars perspective. But I couldn't.  Sorry all.",6,7,17,27 October 1999
The Truman Show," Not the Great Movie I was expecting.
","Someone suggested to me that this movie might have been far, far more successful if it had been differently structured: imagine if, like Truman, the audience hadn't known until the end that Truman was in a TV show.  It might have given the movie a certain sense of pathos and let the audience identify a lot more with Truman.  As it was, I think that too much was given away too soon...knowing that it was a TV show in advance, made it harder to identify with Truman's dilemma.  It made all the show's action seem stilted, the reintroduction of his father obvious, and subplot with the mysterious redhead, unconvincing.  Even the social satire came off as overwrought.  As such, The Truman Show was not the great movie I was hoping for when I went to it.  It had great potential, and squandered it. So consider this, my could-have-been-better pitch.",7,0,0,27 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," For my generation, impossible to overrate
","I was born in 1979, into a world already saturated with pop culture.  A post-Star Wars world.  What World War II did to define the world that the Baby Boomers were born into, oddly enough, Star Wars did for mine.  This generation has been entirely molded by popular culture, and as such, Star Wars is of a significance that cannot be overrated.  Because it changed everything in pop, and it created so many icons....Darth Vader...Han Solo...the Jedi Knights...Obi-Wan Kenobi...the Evil, Galactic Empire...Princess Leia...the Death Star...'I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you!'  These elements formed a mythos whose impact cannot be described to anyone older than 21...but there is no one, but no one, born after 1977 who doesn't get tensed up, and feel a shiver in their spine of anticipation for the huge horn crescendo that comes next at the mere mention of the phrase 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...'",10,1,1,8 October 1999
Evil Dead II," A treasure chest!!!!!!
","Where would America be without Ashley J. 'Ash' Williams, the folk legend of the 20th Century????  This is really the story of Ash's coming-of-age, although the possession story works too... But oh, what to talk about first? I suppose I should say that Bruce Campbell (who I just discovered went to high school with my mother) was shafted out of the Academy Awards for this movie.  And since he is the heart of this movie, plus the Coolest Human Being On The Planet, I feel that that says it all.  Evil Dead II doesn't have a bad moment...and Ash is at his finest when he deduces without assistance that a horrible sound is 'maybe something...trying to break into our universe....'",10,0,0,12 August 1999
The Godfather," Oh my.
","A very learned friend of mine once said that this was the closest film would ever come to the great operas of European legacy.  I'm not inclined to disagree.  This was the finest piece of celluloid I've ever encountered, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It was tense, beautifully shot, unbelievably acted (Brando is a genius.  That's it.), and had everything else going for it that could possibly be good about a film.  Oh my.",10,1,2,18 September 1999
