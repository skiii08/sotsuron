First Man," First Review, Snoozefest Film
","Like other users have said, it felt genuine. Unfortunately it left the viewer with a forgettable film. Awfully boring, lack of action, and the family dynamic doesn't make me apathetic to their plights. In fact, I wish I fast forwarded through all the useless household scenes.Definitely do not recommend, I gave it 3 stars because of the excellent talented acting cast, but disappointed they couldn't deliver a better movie.",3,3,5,19 February 2019
Passengers," Excellent movie exploring ethics, romance, and action!
","The movie was fantastic, a great job by both leading actors letting audiences truly feel immersed with them and their sticky situation. Exploring Chris Pratt's ethical (or unethical decision) to wake fellow passenger Aurora up, to avoid suicide. Then watching a beautiful and steamy romance emerge bringing warmth to this otherwise cold and dire situation they found themselves in. Along with the action to keep the audience on edge. This is a movie I didn't want to end. I would look forward to an alternate ending on a blue ray copy, but overall I believe It's been unfairly negatively criticized. I highly recommend to watch.",10,20,37,27 December 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Too long, and honestly, not that great.
","They fit their SJW bs in it, covered all angles especially feminism. Gave a predictable storyline, with some necessary endings for good measure. Could've easily cut off over an hour of useless scenes.It really wasn't anything special, at all.",6,0,0,1 May 2019
