Casablanca," They don't make movies like this anymore!
","As a member of the younger generation of movie fanatics, Casablanca epitomizes great filmmaking audiences of past generations have grown to cherish. Bogart and Bergman light up the screen on a small 32' TV the same way they did on the big screen decades ago. It is impossible to not appreciate such a well done movie.",10,1,1,23 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," Utterly painful to watch...
","Watching this film in the theatres is almost as painful as thinking about the eight dollars I spent on admission. The special effects were nice on the eyes however they were immensely overused. The acting was horrible. Brendon Frasier may be a face guy but he could never pull off what Harrison Ford did for the Indiana Jones saga. Not worth watching, buying, renting or...or receiving as a present. That bad.",1,1,2,23 May 2001
