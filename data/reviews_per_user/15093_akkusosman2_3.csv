Blade Runner 2049," Weird, Dark, No Energy and Dragged for an hour too long
","Quick Plot:Bones of a replicate is found that indicate that it may have given birth. The whole 3 hours is spent searching for that child. At one point, the main character 'k' thinks that he is the child, and we the audience also thinks so too, only to find out that we have been tricked!!I was waiting for Harrison ford to show up maybe like 30 minutes into the movie but he showed up at the last 30 minutes. I waited many years for this movie it just didn't fulfill my needs.It's an hour too long,it has a very weak story-line, so weak that it is almost non-existent and the Important question from the original movie doesn't get answered. I wanted to actually find out the origins of Deckard(Harrison Ford) to see weather he was a human or a replicant. That is not shown but we do find out the he had a child. That was the only good thing about the movie.The movie was very dark and I cannot imagine what the people watching it in 3D must have felt.(must have been very dark)Blade Runner 2049 could have been a lot more but instead it wasn't. All the hype is translated from the success of the first movie.I expected a lot more when i saw the score for this movie, but instead got a mediocre movie.I enjoyed this movie but not as much as i wanted to... I recommend you watch it to see it for your selves.",7,8,19,7 October 2017
Ready Player One," This movie made me want to start playing video games again
","This movie uses pop culture references raging from the past and present. These references were used in a way that not only made me feel nostalgic, but also emotional.This movie has a deep message about living in the present and not getting lost in virtual households. Towards the end of the film, Parzival beats the game and gets to speak to the REAL Halliday and not his avatar. He asks him, 'why did you do all this?' to which he responds by saying that he had a hard time socializing and communicating in the real world so he made this game. Though he says that he did have a good and fun time, he also says that you need to take off the googles once in a while to eat, sleep and use the bathroom. He says 'reality is tough, but its the only real thing we have' meaning that we should appreciate it.And once Parzival asks another question, he just says ' Thanks for playing my game Parzival' and exits a door that ends the game. This was really touching as the journey made me realize the tough life that Halliday.Ready Player One did a great job in managing its time among scenes because they spent more time on the things that people wanted to see!! (references and such)
This is a great movie and it is trully worth the watch. It will not be a waste of your time and you will have an amazing experience.GO SEE IT!!",10,10,20,1 April 2018
Mother!," This movie will make you say 'What the F***'
","I don't get this film and I don't think there is a normal message in this movie. Its pointless and scary. If anything, this movie freaked me out! An example is when Jennifer Lawrence gets pregnant, and basically a war starts happening at their house. Hundreds of people rush to get in the house to praise Jennifer Lawrence's husband who just published a piece of writing.The people call it revolutionary and basically start praying to him... It gets worse as they start breaking the house apart, trying to keep something from the extraordinary poet. Everyone gets violent. Riot police comes in along with seal team six that try to protect Jennifer Lawrence but end up dying. When the husband and Jennifer Lawrence find a quiet place in the house that is a war zone, she gives birth. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS CREEPYThe husband wants to give the baby to the crazy people outside but Jennifer refuses but after some time she falls a sleep and the baby is gone.She sees her husband give the baby to the crowd and they start passing the baby around VIOLENTLY. As the baby is passed around, ITS NECK BREAKS and it starts crying.When Jennifer rushed to the baby's aid, she sees that the baby has been EATEN by the crowd. She looks and sees the people eating parts of the baby.She freaks out and goes to the basement to burn the whole house down. She does this and everyone dies but her husband who remains untouched. The husband then recovers the burnt body of Jennifer Lawrence and teaks basically rips her chest to take her heart. He squeezes the heart and it turns in to a diamond. And the whole story starts again...I didn't see a point to this movie and it was creepy as hell. There is just no explanation to this movie. Its just a bunch of weird things happening that doesn't have a resolution. There is no end. It basically just stops in the middle of the story. I didn't like it and I wouldn't recommend spending 2 hours watching all these things. Its just not worth it.",6,1,5,19 September 2017
