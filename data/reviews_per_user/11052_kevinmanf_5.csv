Casablanca," It embodies the magic of classic cinema - one of the most watchable of all films
","Casablanca is a fine example of the truism that the great classics never lose there power. With a plot that is apparently simple yet delves into universal themes that are still true today, a series of wonderful characters, some joyous and witty dialogue, a nostalgic score and a great melancholic setting, Casablanca is rightly regarded as one of the treasures of this art. Watch this film as much as you can and you will realise that it achieves what is only in the reach of great movies: it improves with time, uplifting you, purging you, and giving you a taste of what people call, the 'magic of cinema.' The film uses World War II as a device to set two lovers' personal tragedy against the greater larger tragedy that was the war. We have Rick (Humphrey Bogart), a charismatic, cold, hard hearted bar owner who sticks his neck out for nobody and who is going by his duties until one night, his wounds are re-opened with the arrival of Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). In a series of flashbacks that have always seemed poignant to me, we learn that Rick and Ilsa were once lovers in Paris. Well, that was what Rick thought until the entrance of the Nazi regime in Paris when he was suddenly abandoned by her without any precise explanation. Seeing her in Casablanca accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) after all those years since Paris brings back those memories he tried so hard to avoid confronting. Why Casablanca, why 'of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine?' Being hunted by this question is what avoids Rick handing Ilsa and her husband the letters of transit - letters Victor needs to flee the grasp of the Nazi in Casablanca so that he can carry on his fight against this evil.Rick's cafe is, metaphorically speaking, the other great character in the film. It's exotic in look and evokes a feeling of fascination. I've always thought that the contrast between the nazi terror the outside world is embroiled in with the mostly joyful and the adventurous atmosphere of Rick's Cafe provides an element of hope and security the film needs. It also provides the setting for which a series of fascinating characters and adventures are displayed. In it, we have Major Strasser, the German officer who will do all it takes to make sure Victor never leaves Casablanca (that would be too dangerous for the Nazis), Ugarte (Peter Lorre) the strange thief who stole the letters of transit and gave them to Rick arguing that 'I (he) have many a friend in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me, you are the only one I trust.' But of all the characters (including Sam the piano player whose song 'As Time Goes By' remains immortal and Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, the man who can get you anything), none is more fascinating nor brings me the most pause than Captain Renault (Claude Rains) in a landmark performance. He is a corrupt officer, but likable, funny and because he attempts to understand the persona of Rick, he provides the ultimate link between the audience and the movie's hero. Humphrey Bogart gives what is perhaps his most recognised performance; there is a certain charm in the way he talks, smokes, sidesteps adversities and pretends he is a tough guy whilst we can sense a hidden wound inside him. And Ingrid Bergman just shines the screen: she is the innocent beauty the film needs to emphasize Rick's initial cruelty towards her and in the end, his courage and kindness.Casablanca is above all, about self sacrifice; sacrificing personal interests for a better universe, for the defeat of the Nazi regime, for a better society in a world filled with evil. The famous final sequence is so direct in its manifestation of this that it works more like a parable than a sequence in a movie. In times of despair when there is little hope, Casablanca is one of the film's I turn to for hope and redemption. There are countless of great sequences each with something exciting happening. To me the greatest and most meaningful is when some Nazi soldiers gather round the piano and sing an ominous song to the 'Fatherland'. It makes everyone in the Rick's cafe very uncomfortable. That's when Paul Heinried instructs the orchestra to play the French national anthem, the'Marseilles'. Everyone starts to sing. The Nazis are silenced. The music takes over. I found my eyes on the verge of tears.This is an undisputed masterpiece, a treasure that remains fresh with each viewing.",10,1,3,5 March 2006
Training Day," A character driven
","Training Day sees Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke at full supremacy, both so brilliantly in command of there roles that they compensate for this action thriller's decorous screenplay and lack of ideas. If this film is about corruption, greed, narcotics and violence, by the end it becomes a one on one show between Washington and Hawke's character. What we care for, what entertains us through out the film is not its conventional themes expressed without conviction, but the squabbles between the two morally distinct characters as they visit the most corrupt places with the most corrupt people on the streets.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Hoyt (in a performance equally as brilliant as Denzel's), a man whose dream is to belong to the elite Narc squad. For him, it is an opportunity to fight true crime, the one that matters, to save the world of drugs. But before he can even dream of belonging to the Narc squad, he's got to pass a test and this film is precisely about that Training Day where Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) will be his instructor, a day in which Hoyt will see that nothing in the city of Los Angeles is as it seems, and we realise the unsettling boundaries of corruption.Alonzo Harris, in an inspired and over the top performance by Denzel, is a charismatic individual convinced by his own methods. He believes that giving out street justice is what justice is all about, that the enemy is in the streets, outside the law and he has got to be hunted like a wolf hunting another wolf. Alonzo is clearly corrupt and does not go by the law, he is a liar and may be worse than the criminals themselves since he has power and they don't. The contrast between Hoyt, a man who goes by the law but has little experience in enforcing it and a man who doesn't go by the law but has a lot of experience in enforcing it is the movie's key appeal.The film does a good job of reflecting Hoyt's initial and later feeling about Alonzo's actions on us. Firstly we feel that this guy may actually just be a cop trying to fight crime in his own way but there comes a point when we grow to dislike him.The final moments of the film are the weakest point of the film. You see, what happens at Alozno seems collected out of a container since the only clue we are given for the possibility is shown a little past half way in the film. It feels like the director didn't know how to end the film and found a far fetched way during shooting. Having said that, I like the way the director handles the very last scene: it doesn't force any unnecessary action but ends as it should. This is a film worth watching only to see the character conflict.",6,0,12,9 November 2005
Lost in Translation," A masterpiece about the mood and states of the characters
","It is not easy to talk about 'Lost in Translation'. Sofia Coppola's second film as a director is in part about things we never talk about. While its two protagonists try to find mutual solace in each other, their silence is as expressive as their words. This is a film that believes that an individual can have a valuable relationship with someone else without becoming part of that person's life. At 19 years of age, I am not married but I can understand pretty well that it is easier for a stranger with whom you share a moment in the bar or corridor to understand your problems better than your husband or wife. Here is an extract from Roger Ebert's great review of the film: 'We all need to talk about metaphysics, but those who know us well want details and specifics; strangers allow us to operate more vaguely on a cosmic scale. When the talk occurs between two people who could plausibly have sex together, it gathers a special charge: you can only say 'I feel like I've known you for years' to someone you have not known for years.' In this marvellous story, the two lonely individuals that merge the illusions of what they have and what they could have are two Americans. The emotional refuge, Tokyo. We have Bob Harris (Bill Murray), and actor in his fifties who was once a star, and is now supplementing his incomes with the recording of a whisky commercial. On the other side of the telephone, a frightening reality: his wife, his sons, and the mission of choosing the right material for heaven knows what part of the house. When we consider Bob's situation, we realise that Lost in Translation is also a meditation on the misery of fame. Certainly fame has great (perhaps greater than disadvantages) advantages but then there are the obligations, the expectations...We also have Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a woman in her twenties who is accompanying her husband, a photographer addicted to work, on a business trip. But it could said it is as if she is alone anyway. Her world, just like Bob's, is reduced to strange days in the bedroom, the corridors, the hotel's swimming pool, and the bar, the perfect destination for victims of sleeplessness and wounded soul. The bar is the place Bob and Charlotte meet for the first time. They talk, little, but just enough. Once their dislike for parts of their lives are established, they begin sharing times that feel dead to be able to feel alive.Bob and Charlotte are souls in transition for whom, surrounded and confused by exotic rituals, and a different language, allows them a moment to lose their identities. Both characters provoke similar feelings form different experiences. There are no kisses or crazy nights between them, but only a shared intimacy in which a night out, a walk in the streets, a session of karaoke becomes a powerful expression of their affection an complicity. The relationship we all await only happens in our minds and the protagonists, whom we are not allowed to know everything they say and desire. Tokyo metaphorically speaking is the third character in the film. The bright colours, the noise of the city...just everything evokes the various spiritual awakenings of the characters. It ends on a perfect note leaving the relationship of the characters undecided. A rare gem in modern day cinema.",10,239,310,5 March 2006
Mystic River," A disturbing and suspenseful emotional journey - amongst Eastwood's best
","Some people lock their bad memories deeply inside their minds so that they don't come across them again. They have erased truths to live without worries. They have closed the doors of their traumas and thrown them to the bottom of a river. But it is useless because sooner or later, something, no matter how small it may seem, will bring them to the surface and re-open those memories.In 'Mystic River' based on the novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted by Brian Helgeland (LA Confidential), Clint Eastwood establishes the camera as the key to those secrets and the characters as the victims of its unlocking. The characters are three childhood friends. Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) whose relationship broke after the brief kidnapping of one of them - Dave. But now, 25 years later, their lives cross again after another horrible incident: the murder of Jimmy's daughter.Brendan (Thomas Guiry), a boy Jimmy does not approve of and wanted to run away with his daughter is a suspect. But so is Dave who came home the night of the murder covered in blood and was somewhat hysterical in the presence of his wife (Marcia Gay Harden). Sean, alongside Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) are assigned to the case. We remember that the three were once childhood friends shaken by that tragic event that lead to the decline of their friendship and now a similar things threatens to to so once again. Sean, returning to his childhood place, must face situations he never knew and emotions he pretends never existed.Jimmy vows to kill his daughter's assassin hiring some neighbourhood criminals to help him in the investigation. Then there is Whitey who thinks that Daqve is obviously guilty after all, everything seems to point in that direction. But Sean is unwilling to suspect a childhood friend.At the centre of 'Mystic River' is the idea that many things that occur in the past do not always vanish with the passage of time. Every act has a big price that can pursue you for good. If the innocence and dreams from childhood are violently shaken the affected individuals may never be cured because traumas can be hidden inside victims even though they ignore it. But does everything count if it serves as a base to hide all the wounds? Every friend has to show his support and hope because in an atmosphere united with the similar sad objective, there is no room for doubts. But if one member (or friend) questions the honesty or truth of the others, probably the group of friends will be wounded to death (not literally).But 'Mystic River' is not only a thriller about men dominated by their past or shaking their heads in disbelief due to their destinies. No, that is to simplistic. This is a character study of the highest order. A brutal analysis in the dissection of tragedy. A film about the importance of the devotion of wives. An emotional puzzle that goes along with the plot only to later throw away all the pieces. A study of innocence, guilt, revenge, paranoia and forgiveness. A film engulfed in incredible tension and sadness. In terms of its moral lesson, 'Mystic River' is more cautious than 'Unforgiven' and in terms of drama on par (or even above) with 'The Bridges of Madison County.' I'm not sure where I would rank 'Mystic River' amongst Eastwood's other masterpieces but I no for certain he has never united a better cast nor produced more powerful performances. Sean Penn is so intimately violent, angered yet undeniably touching. Tim Robbins transmits all the hopelessness and pain of Dave ad Kevin Bacon, in the best performance I can remember from him, attains the balance and coldness Sean needs to become the judge between his two friends (Dave and Sean). The female performances are also wonderful.The title 'Mystic River' says it all. Although Mystic is a river that passes through Boston, the title is a metaphor of the film's emotional journey. Even though we arrive at a conclusion, the film is about the emotional journey we experience with the deeply fractured characters. With the simple yet commonly ignored idea that films should use real human emotions and take time to reveal the characters, Eastwood has created an elegant but disturbing notion of human nature that is fiercely ironic, filled with frustrations and regrets. When you leave the theatre feeling pain somewhere without knowing why and where don't worry, that is exactly the state you are meant to be in; a bit like the characters.",Null,1,2,2 March 2006
Psycho," A disturbing masterwork
","In most films we participate as passive voyeurs. Not in Psycho which is a brilliant study of suspense, horror, paranoia, mood and evil hidden under a mask of innocence. From its very beginning to its shocking and ironic ending, we have Alfred Hitchcock directing the audience and in his own words, playing the audience 'like a piano'  leading us exactly where he wants. To call this a chilling masterpiece is a cliché but it is no further from the truth.The film is filled with unforgettable sequences. From Marion's (Janet Leigh) escape always with the company of the police that seems to be following her  a great way of sinking us into Marion's paranoia to her arrival at Bate's Motel where we the audience believe are safe from all danger; the conversation Marion maintains with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) about his hobbie as a taxidermist; and of course, the shocking shower sequence. The horror of this scene comes from the fact that it takes part at a moment of extreme intimacy and vulnerability and also due to Hitchcock's craftsmanship: the screeching violin and the camera which does not focus on the wounds the stabbing causes but rather, leaves it to our imagination which is much more effective than any graphical representation. But even before we arrive at the famous Bate's Motel, where the key events take place, Psycho already feels disturbing perhaps because we fear for Crane's plight, perhaps because of the chilling score, perhaps because we fear the police's intentions, perhaps because Hitchcock gives us minimal vistas except those of suspicion therefore we feel trapped in Crane's guilt and paranoia. Whatever the reason, Psycho has already established itself as a film that is more than anything else about our paranoia and uneasy feelings.Another key element is Hitchcock's character control. We never expect the death of Marion (the film's main character) so early on. But what could have been a dangerous move is handled brilliantly as Hitchcock shifts our sympathy from Crane to Bates so that when he attempts to sink he care, we fear for him (we know that if the car does not sink we will be jabbed by fear and we also feel that Bates is too innocent a character, to suspicious a person that he would inevitably be accused of the crime if the car is discovered), just as much as we feared for Crane. The performances are worthy of mentioning especially Anthony Perkins who embodies innocence but at the same time, a disturbing presence. The ending, a close-up of Crane's assassin is chilling, highlighting this character's evil.The genius of this film is that it is always in full control of the audience, always feels visceral and chilling. We are lead to feel disturbed and uneasy even when there is nothing visible on screen to disturb us.",10,1,3,13 March 2006
