Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's all in the editing
","This is one of those flicks I wish I could get my hands on. I see a thousand small changes that would turn this into a completely watchable classic film. How cool would it have been if those battle droids didn't talk at all, but communicated with gestures 'a la the skeleton soldiers in 'Jason and the Argonauts' Why are there poop jokes? Why is there hi-fiving and and stupid touchdown dances? The removal of just a few stupid lines of dialogue would have made a world of >difference What could have been a fine film was killed by bad editing and a complete lack of subtlety.",4,0,1,4 August 2001
