The Blair Witch Project," Boring Witch Project, The
","I saw this film. It was very boring. My friend told me that this movie was the scariest movie you would ever see. I listened to her and watched it. It didn't scare me at all. The blair witch project was kind of stupid. All it is about is three people wandering off in the woods and getting lost and swearing. The only scary thing about this movie that it will you dissapionted. I think the sequil of this movie is scarier then this movie. Book of shaddows, Blair Whitch 2 rocks a lot more then this movie.",Null,0,1,30 January 2003
The Ring," What if you only had seven days to live?
","This movie was really cool, and yet scary too. This movie takes place in Seattle, washington. I live near Seattle, I hope this movie is not based on a true story.Any way, I thought this movie did better than 'the sixth sense'. It was full of thrills and chills. Although I felt sorry for the girl, Samora. Her father didn't like her and she was evil. But 'the ring' really made me wonder. What if I had only seven days to live? What would I do a whole week? My advice is, never watch a mysterious blank tape. You would probably get a phone call telling you that you will die in seven days.I give this movie ****",Null,0,1,10 August 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," This one of my favorite movies
","Usually I don't like movies that sing and dance through out the whole movie. But 'South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut' is not like all the other musicals. I think it was real creative for Matt Stone and Trey Parker to think of Sidam Husane having a love affair with Satin. That was kind of stange though to make all the Canadians look like a paper doll instead of like all the other Characters in the movie. It was also weird to have an angry mob of people hate Canada because of a canadian movie Staring Tarence and Phillip in 'Asses of fire' with some bad language instead of violence.
I love this movie because it literally blew me out of my chair and onto the gound laughing. This movie made me laugh and it made me cry. My favorite part in the movie was Kenny's good-bye. I like Kenny because he's cool and because he can say whatever he wants without getting bleeped out.I give this movie ****",Null,0,0,10 August 2003
Resident Evil," Simular to the movie '28 days later'
","This is a good SCIFI movie. But I watched the Movie '28 days later' before I've seen this movie. As I saw both 'Resident Evil' and '28 days later' the plot seemed so a like. Unlike the movie '28 days later', 'Resident Evil' took place with a bad virus spreading in a building (and not all England) making people that is infected with the virus want to eat other people to stay alive. As one bite reaches one person, they will soon become infected. My favorite part in this movie was that when that blond lady runs into the crazed dogs and Kicks major ass. That was cool, I wish they showed an instant replay of her kicking those dogs butts. Especailly when she kicks one of them one room through the other room, breaking the glass. I know there is a game based on this movie. I never played the game, but the movie looks better. I hope there is a sequil to this movie. I rate this movie ***",Null,0,0,10 August 2003
28 Days Later...," Scary yet boring
","I really wanted to see this movie so bad. It looked scary in the previews. As the movie came out in theaters me and my friend went to see it. The begining of the movie seemed to start off scary. But the rest of the movie was boring. My friend was so bored from half the movie, that she left the theater ripped off. But I stayed and watch the whole movie hoping that soon some scary scene would show up and scare the hell out of me like it did to the people that seen the sneak previews to this movie. Nothing really happened in the movie. Sure there were people getting infected by a virus that is deadly and highly contagous. I really didn't get the title to this movie. But it was sad though to see that little girl's father catch the virus and dies. But it was very mysterious to know that that guy survived in the hospital while the doctors and everybody else in the hospital that he was at got infected exept him. Why didn't he get infected with them?The only thing that was cool about this movie was wondering, What if we were alone in a big city with no people. Would you take over it... or leave it? My favorite part in this boring movie was when the guy, the lady, and the father and daughter went into a empty super market and took every thing they needed or wanted. And the father leaves his credit card on the empty cash-register and hits the road.I give this movie **",Null,0,0,10 August 2003
