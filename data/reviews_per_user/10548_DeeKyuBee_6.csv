Source Code," A well made thriller will an unsatisfying, plot hole of an ending
","What happens when you end up in a train and get involved in a crime where you have to save the people in it from a bomber while also being caught in a time loop? Sounds confusing I know and I hate describing plots in movies so lets just leave it at that.Source Code is very entertaining. Well shot and well directed for the most part. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an exceptional performance as well, as his reactions to the situations seem very natural in an otherwise unnatural situation.Before going in to this film let me tell you that its the mystery plot that keeps you invested. You are continuously curious about the situations Gyllenhaal is put in. About the time loop that keeps happening. Its the kind of story that relies on plot to keep you in rather than characters, since aside from Gyllenhaal, no other characters really pull you in.The main issue I have with the film is the ending, which I won't spoil. Its one of those endings that right before the last 5-10 minutes wraps up in a nice bow and everything seems to make sense. Then right at the last couple minutes it takes a complete turn and now everything you thought you knew turned out to not be true at all. Your left questioning things. Its like in a horror movie when the main characters finally kill the monster but then it turns out its still alive right at the last shot of the movie. whats worse is its not nearly as smart where it could leave clues to figure out what the ending really means.It just doesn't work in this kind of movie. Overall though it was fun. There's also a romance plot in the movie that was sweet and aside from the flaws its still an above average movie.Score: 6/10",6,0,0,4 August 2016
American Beauty," A complex film with a multitude of themes
","American Beauty is not overrated. It seems as though every time a movie gets so much praise at the Oscars makes it automatically bad. That's pretty idiotic. I don't get the negative backlash. The themes and characters are still timeless,and still resonates with us. Also, the bullshit about pedophilia gets me wondering why any human being would believe such trolls. I guess you could interpret that however.The movie is about Lester Burnham who is going through a mid-life crisis. He has a controlling wife who always nags at Lester, a rebellious angst driven teenage daughter, a horrible corrupt job, and he falls in love with his daughters friend. As you could probably tell, his life just goes downhill from here.This is one compelling and engaging movie. From the opening scene you are instantly thrown into Lester's life, right down to the explosive finale at the end. I don't think people get how much depth there is in this movie, or maybe they forgot. The movie was highly acclaimed by critics and was nominated for a lot of awards, yet for some reason people started hating on it years after. The movie has a multitude of themes however, from lust, marriage, purpose, motivation, insecurities, being ordinary, and homosexuality. Those are heavy topics, but the film actually has some dark acid wit to it. It's not a particularly depressing film, the characters are very interesting as they go through their own problems.The movie is a masterpiece, it has such a beautiful yet haunting score and the dream sequences were Lester fantasizes about his daughters friend gives symbolism and meaning behind his character. The plastic bag scene I have mixed feelings about, I could understand why they wanted to show it, gives meaning to one of the characters traits, but I thought the delivery was cheesy. The pace is suitably slow, I love the atmosphere of the film and how the film takes its time to flesh out the characters and themes. Sam Mendes does an excellent job at directing making each and every scene stand out.The flaws I have are some questionable scenes. Like when Lester is eavesdropping on his daughter and her friend and they hear something outside, Lester thinks they hear him and loudly runs down stairs. First of all, how did they not hear Lester? They hear one tap on the window but not the loud running just outside their door? Also, like the bag scene there are a lot of heavy handed moments in the movie in terms of acting and throwing symbolism's and metaphor's.Overall, the movie left an impact on me. Lester's mundane routine gets me worried if that stuff will happen to me in the future. Well, it probably will, since I already feel as though I have mid-life existential crisis's. Oh gosh. Anyways watch American Beauty, it holds up and its on Netflix.Score: 9/10",9,2,4,27 April 2016
Edward Scissorhands," Tim Burton's masterpiece
",There came a time in my life when I changed different hobbies; from watching TV shows; mainly cartoons; to movies; to video games. I never really knew what piece of entertainment I was really into. When I watched Edward Scissorhands however; I just knew what I really loved. Edward Scissorhands is about a man created by a scientist in a castle. The scientist dies and the man; named Edward; is isolated and all alone in the castle. A woman named Peg; played by Dianne Wiest; stumbles upon Edward and welcomes him to his home. The movie then is about Edward trying to fit in with society; the town; and even finds love on the way.Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite movies of all time; its story's and characters resonated with me so much. your with Edward every step of the way. The theme of the movie is about being different; trying to fit in; and the way people can use you for good and bad reasons.A romance blossoms between Edward and Pegs daughter; Kim; played by the wonderful Winona Ryder; and oh gosh; its like a modern fairy tale.Its incredibly sweet and full of charm. Its as if Edward was a reflection of Burton himself. Being eccentric and misunderstood at the same time. The film gives a good point about how just because you may look like a monster ( Edwards Scissorhands) but on the inside is much more kinder than any of the supposedly 'normal' townspeople who accuse Edward of being a monster. Not just that; the fact that the teens in the movie allegedly led Edward to his ultimate demise. Its a sad and poignant movie. The scene when Edward creates statues using ice while also making the scenery snow all at the same time; is both emotional; complex; and poignant; all at the same time and is sure to get everyone teary eyed as well.Score: 10/10,10,1,1,21 February 2016
Before Sunset," Their older, bolder, better
","Before Sunrise follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) who is now a bestselling author and reconnects with Celine (Julie Delpy) in Paris as Jesse is having a book tour as he's become a bestselling author. It follows similar territory as the first film but in my opinion, it is better and might be my favorite film out of the three films.
You can just feel the vibe of Paris and the characters wonderment even just watching their back 
 The biggest improvement that this sequel does than its predecessor is the pacing. It is about 20 minutes shorter than the first film giving it a brisk 80 minute run time. Another reason why this film works better is how mature the main characters are. In the first film, Jesse and Celine, although way more mature and intelligent than anybody typically is their age, they were still young and didn't have as much life experience to have even more thought-provoking conversations about life itself.The film is all dialogue and what I loved and admired about this film so much is how much this film depended on the two main leads. There isn't any action sequences or even supporting cast that can steal the show. It is focused squarely on these two performances and its just AMAZING and yes I had to capitalize that because that's how much praise they deserve. They achive what other actors strive to achieve, when watching the film, you don't notice the actor but instead feel as though you are watching real characters and eavesdropping on their daily life.The camera work is impressive as well as there are many long takes usually through a whole conversation of the two leads walking through Paris. Speaking of Paris, it is absolutely gorgeous and with the camerawork you can see the beauty of Paris as you are walking with Jesse and Celine.The problem is I can't really talk about what specific conversations these two share in the film without spoiling the experience for you. You find out where they've been during the past nine years, why they never met again, where they've been, what they are doing, in the past and maybe even in the future. Although I can't talk about the many philosophical conversations the film has here's a little taste of it!- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwEo1B2ypkBefore Sunset isn't just my favorite film in the franchise but one of my favorite films of all time. Its a film about how something so small such as conversing can turn into something bigger, more thought provoking, and ultimately life changing. The ending is one of the most perfect endings to a film that I have seen. Its so simple yet hit me so deeply, and I could not recommend this film enough it is a true masterpiece that I hope you love too. :) Well that went deep. Score 10/10",10,0,0,3 January 2018
Before Sunrise," A beautiful film about complex people in love
","When we think of 'epic' trilogies what comes to mind? We think of fantasy; action epics like The Lord of the Rings or Sci-Fi classics like the original Star Wars films (we do not speak of the other three films shh!) and gangster mafia films like The Godfather. All of those seem to be action films however, ones that have been financially successful and well known. In my opinion however, one of the best trilogy of films of all time, are the Before movies. You all might be thinking what kind of movies these films are. The three films are Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight. These films are some of the most romantic movies ever made with quite possibly two of the most interesting lead couple. Actually you know what? How about I talk in depth of all three of these movies. Sounds nerdy as hell, but its about time someone talked about these masterpieces. 
 
The first film in this trilogy is Before Sunrise. Here in this story we have two seemingly ordinary people, Jesse and Celine, as they meet in train going to Vienna. Their very first conversation starts when a German couple are arguing in the train. Little did they know that the moment they spoke they'd be in for some of the most in depth discussions. Hands down the best aspects of this movie is the characters and the dialogue. The conversations that Jesse and Celine (the main characters) are probably the most complex and interesting pieces of dialogue that I have heard in a romance film. They don't just talk about how much they love each other or anything pointless, every conversation is a reflection of who they are as people. It is a reflection of how these two connect.The topics they discuss range from love, death, ambition, religion, to every idea that comes from these two. All with the beautiful backdrop of Vienna.The problems that I have with this film is the pace of the film as it goes on for a little too long and some of the conversations aren't as interesting as others or the dialogue just doesn't deliver. Only a few times however.The film is beautifully made not just in its setting but in its dialogue. There's a game that the two of them play in one scene when they are pretending to have a conversation with one of their friends talking about each other and it is one of these most romantic scenes in the movie. I know it might be a slight spoil of the movie but I just couldn't help talking about it! (*fan girls just a little*)Sorry guys but I think I am going to end this blog. Its getting way too long but I will post the other too movies too. Score: 8/10",8,0,0,3 January 2018
Cloud Atlas," The film that started my philosophical interest.
","If there was ever a film that I could say got me into analyzing and figuring out the deeper meanings behind a film, it would be Cloud Atlas. Welcome ladies and gentlemen and today I'm going to be writing my very first review which would be for Cloud Atlas if you haven't guessed already. I remember a year ago looking into this film on a top 10 list and it really intrigued me. Something about the style and look of the film caught my eye. I did some research about it and found out just how complex it was. The film is about 6 interconnected story's about different people in different locations and different time periods.The film even before watching the actual movie just hooked me. Its story was so complex, interesting, and thought provoking I wanted to figure how the story's are all connected. If I were to describe how the film is connected I would have to say the characters souls are connected. Your probably wondering what I mean by that, Cloud Atlas's main cast each play in the same stories. The difference between the actors characters is... pretty much everything except for the characters souls. For example, Tom Hanks in the first story (in chronological order of the time periods) plays a greedy doctor and is the villain in that story. In the sixth story however, Hanks plays the main protagonist and is the hero of that story. That example I just showed you tells you that the soul of Tom Hank's character is reincarnated. If there's anything to describe the interconnections its that the soul gets reincarnated into another body. Not all the characters change from bad to good however, some stay good throughout the whole movie some stay bad throughout the whole movie. The film has such amazing visuals and a great set of characters. The movie talks about slavery, good and evil, and how our choices and actions affect the future. It grips you right in the first 10 minutes or so when they show you one scene from each story in chronological order.If you want to know my obsession with Cloud Atlas I basically watched the trailer nearly 20 times, it was so engrossing. It took me a while to seek the film out and while I was doing that I looked at charts and graphs to see how all the characters were interconnected. The main reason this film spoke to me so much was the fact that it got me into complex, thought provoking films, it is the film that started my love for incredibly deep themes. I owe so much to Cloud Atlas, I bought it on Blu-ray and in total I saw it 3 times and I wish to see it more times. Its also a film that whenever I watch it I always love it and I always take something new out of it. I have no problem giving Cloud Alas my highest rating and I'm looking forward to making more reviews. Thank you for reading my first review. Thank you and Goodbye.",10,5,7,10 April 2015
