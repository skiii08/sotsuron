Ali," Some interesting casting but didn't justice to 'The Greatest'
","Will Smith was not up to it yet. Jon Voight was terrific as Cosell. Ron Silver was the perfect Dundee but they didn't let him speak till the final sequence on the 'Rumble in the Jungle'. And Levar Burton in a single silent frame as MLK, what was that?",6,0,0,25 December 2001
Memento," Most original film in years
",What a magnificent film.  This is what filmmaking is should be all about. The storyline is rather ordinary but the way in which the filmmaker weaves the story is so simple yet supremely original that it deserves seeing multiple times.,10,0,1,20 January 2002

",The special effects were great. The characters were wonderful especially Robbie Coltrane & actress who portrayed Hermione. Harry is his necessary understated self.,9,0,0,17 November 2001
