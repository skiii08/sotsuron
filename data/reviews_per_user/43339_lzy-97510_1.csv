10 Cloverfield Lane," Ambiguous fishbowl
","I enjoyed the moral ambiguity of John Goodman's character derived from the confusion about what exactly the situation is. Figuring out whether he's a good guy or a bad guy made me think about the lines and I couldn't help but think about societal structure as well. What's preventing him from murder if there are no longer laws? What are the rules in a post- apocalyptic society? There was no voting about the rules here, just an authority imposing his will on his captives. The movie makes you think about whether or not that's enough to make him evil.Filler filler filler.",8,3,4,27 July 2016
