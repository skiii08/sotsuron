Skyfall," Back to Old Times
","This is my first review. I watched Skyfall in yesterday and here I go:Bond has always been an amazing character for me and I like every movie since Tomorrow Never Dies. Thus, I can criticize Skyfall considering the movies starting from Tomorrow Never Dies.As a Turkish, I was excited about the opening sequence because it takes place in İstanbul, Adana and Fethiye which are among the most beautiful cities in Turkey. After the movie Taken 2 that was incredibly bad about reflecting İstanbul, Skyfall makes me feel good. If you watch the press conference that was held in İstanbul on IMDb, you can see that Sam Mendes understand the ambiance in İstanbul and he knows what to reflect and how to reflect.Javier Bardem's performance was outstanding. The whole movie changes after his first appearance. The only thing I should criticize is the prosthesis he uses. Actually, the visual effect that is used in the prosthesis scene. When you watch the close-up scene where Silva puts his prosthesis back you can see that the prosthesis disappears through his cheek. It could have done better.In this movie you see the battle between the old and the new practices. M and Bond present the old generation and Silva (Bardem) presents the new internet-age. When it is the case, Bond and M go back to basics and make this movie a masterpiece. I agree with the general opinion that states Skyfall is one of the best Bond movies and Daniel Craig is one of the best Bond actors. Finally, we will miss Judi Dench, however, Ralph Fiennes will rock you in the upcoming 007 movies.",10,5,21,3 November 2012
