Lucky Number Slevin," Hey don't rag too hard on Josh Hartnett
","I agree with the above sentiments about the movie in general. And I too, thought from the trailer previews that the least interesting character/actor was Josh Hartnett and I thought it was a bad casting move. But I went to see the film anyway, because it just looked like it might be cool and I was surprised by Josh. He had previously come off a little 'white bread' midwest uninteresting in his first coming out. But after laying low for awhile and getting a fresh start, I thought he did rather well, and I found him quite charming with some great chemistry with Lucy Liu who was sparkling. I loved them together. And he was believable in the later developments of the plot - I was impressed. Of course, the two best actors in the movie were the illustrious Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley, (who shone even with one hand behind their backs, so to speak - this wasn't Shakespeare) And their scene together was a nice piece of work to find in the midst of the slick and style of the rest of the film. It almost made me want to know more about THEM and their characters, I'll admit, but great actors do that.",8,0,2,22 September 2006
