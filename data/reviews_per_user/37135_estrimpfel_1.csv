The Avengers," One of the best superhero movies out there today
","If you're a fan of comic books or superhero movies, then The Avengers by Marvel will surely not disappoint. Watching the movie three times myself, I each time have liked the movie more and more. Compared to the blockbuster superhero movies that have come out in theaters in the summer of 2012, this movie seems to top Spider-Man and Batman simply because of the cast of superheroes that are present in this movie. This movie seems to put together the best of the best superheroes for a one big hit movie. With the names of The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, this movie compares to an all-star game of athletes in any given sport. In comparing the movie to other movies by Marvel, this movie stands out in a good way. This movie adds more action and more punch lines than a comic book nerd could ever dream of. In terms of putting the superheroes together, The Avengers does a marvelous job. The Avengers is essentially a sequel to Thor and Captain America, taking elements from each movie. After Loki gets exiled from his home planet of Asgard as seen in Thor after attempting to rule Asgard, he seeks out to rule again. After Captain America gets unfrozen, he is seen working out when Nick Fury stops by. Nick Fury is the man responsible for recruiting and putting together the Avengers. At first, things are shaky as the superheroes' egos clash rather than mesh together. This is easily done by Loki, shifting the attention away from him and onto personal attacks against one another by the Avengers. The constant bickering between the superheroes could have a negative impact on the audience , but it doesn't diminish the movie as a whole. In the movie, the characters don't seem to have changed from their own movies, although Iron Man learns the value of working with others. Joss Whedon is one of the best directors in the film industry and this movie proves to be one of his best big screen productions. This movie sets the bar for superhero movies as none in my experience of watching superhero movies has come close to matching it. Marvel and DC Comics will have a big challenge ahead of them when they come out with new movies because any that doesn't match The Avengers would be a disappointment.",10,2,5,19 November 2012
