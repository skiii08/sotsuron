Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the third best of the 4 films
","I really liked the movie, although it was not as good as A New Hope or Empire, I believe that it holds it's place well in the saga.  I am certainly looking forward to episode II, to see what is in store for the heroes. Those who disliked this movie missed something.  We already know the ending (Jedi episode VI) and I think that they expected the whole thing be explained in one film.  This movie is a great stand alone story and a perfect beginning of the saga.",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
