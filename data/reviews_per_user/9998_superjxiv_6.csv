The Ring," Scariest movie in a LONG time
","One day, I will try and explain the difference between movies that are scary, and movies where stuff jumps out at you while the girl screams and tries to run. I would give examples of movies that make you cower in your seat, knowing you can't stop the movie as it marches on, each frame more nerve-racking than the last. I will cite works like 'Poltergeist', 'Sixth Sense' and 'Blair Witch Project.' These movies are scary. 'Jason X' is cinema fodder. Having said that, let me go on to confirm that 'The Ring' is one scary mother of a movie. Don't expect any big money shots from this thriller, it goes for tense and it doesn't let go. The film starts with the premise of an urban legend. There's a freaky Nine Inch Nails-esque video cassette, and after watching it, the phone rings. Answer it or not, you now have seven days before you die. Rachel Keller, a workaholic journalist, overhears some kids discussing it at the wake of Rachel's niece, a supposed victim of the tape. The movie does a good job of hiding the true evil. Because its not the tape itself that's doing the killing. Its a power behind the tape, the force that created it that follows the victims. By watching the tape, whatever's on the other side watches right back. There's a bizarre connection between the source of that power and any electronic device, puddles of ominous water, and a number of dead horses. It was either a convention of the filmmakers or a truly odd coincidence, but everyone under age 20 seemed to be either a little bit psychic, a little bit precognitive, or both. Rachel's son, who I believe was in kindergarten, had the creepiest eyes and monotone voice. I wondered a few times if that wasn't just some amazing make-up applied to Christopher Walken, but no, the kid's really that good.
As far as the scarier elements go, its all about subtly here. When a conversation dies down, the phone will ring very, very loudly. TV's just turn on to static at full volume. In this movie, there's nothing scarier than what's waiting just around the corner. Using color, water, and almost miss able computer generated images, what's scary is the threat of what's coming. What I liked most about this movie was its unconventional ending. When you think the movie's getting done, it's just building its energy for a terrifying and memorable finale. I don't know what your preferences are as far as scary goes. I like nervously burying my face in my jacket. Some people like a guy with a knife jumping out of dark places with no explanation of how he got there. What I can tell you is that `The Ring' is scary. Enter at your own risk.",Null,0,0,21 October 2002
Minority Report," 9.5, true entertainment
","Few and fair between are films that indulge you with original visuals, a compelling storyline, strong preformances, and hardcore nudity. Minority Report lacks in that last criteria, but I'll let it go this time. It's an expertly crafted film. For those living under a rock (but a rock equipped with a modem, no less) Tom Cruise, aka Penelope's Man-Bitch, leads this epic as Pre-Cop John Anderton. To those rock-dwellers who've avoided the ads and trailers and countless other reviews posted on IMDb and need the up-to-date, in this movie they can see murders before they happen, and its John's job to prevent that. By 'they' I mean a trio of 'pre-cogs' who are so white they make Casper look like Richard Pryor. They lounge in a hot tub and are treated like kings. No, wait, no they're not. They're drugged into submission and live in a toliet (but a very nice toliet) and kept at just the right state of dreams to spew out these predictions. If there's a flaw in the system, is the treatment of the pre-cogs. One character says it verbatim: 'It helps if you don't think of them as human.' Um, hello Abolishment of Slavery, how's by you? 
And you read it right, there's only three of them in the entire world. After 70 years or so, the entire world will collapse into murdering hordes again. I'm breathless with anticipationBut I digress. When Anderton himself is seen in a prevision, he goes on the lamb. One stunt spectacle after another, he's jumping from car to car, he's jumping from Jetpack Guy to Jetpack Guy (Chill! What else am I supposed to call them?) He's even jumping from catwalk to catwalk in a car factory that someone has inexplicably stockpiled with white vats of water whose only purpose is to fall on the guys doing the chasing. I figure its safer not to ask why, just sit back and enjoy. I find the most clever of the films devises is a question pretty much left unasked. Some people may consider this a SPOILER, so stop reading and go enjoy the movie before you read further. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER, there, is that enough Mr. Alaska? He's probably not even reading. Anderton finds the man in the prevision because he runs, BECAUSE he saw the prevision. He never would have ended up in that room had he not seen it as future event. Isn't this a paradox? Or is it one of those infinity loops where everything always comes full circle? Or have I just gone crossed-eyed. . .But speaking logically, (which I know has no grounds in a Speilberg picture; leave it all to wonder and faith and ILM) why DO they lock up the would-be killers? Isn't preventing the murder enough? Of course, if they didn't threaten something horrific like life as vegetable, there'd be no reason for Anderton to do all that impressive jumping.Cheers, Jon",9,0,0,6 July 2002
Underworld," Needs an 8th less plot, a 4th more action
","Vampires are cool. They are beautiful, ageless creatures that are both immaculate and terrifying due to the threat they pose. No one can deny the distinct sexual tension when a vampire seduces and bites one of its victims, because nine times out of ten, the victim kinda wants it.
The vampires in `Underworld' don't do this however. They might as well exist in the Matrix, shooting at everything that moves in stylized poses with weapons that slide and click against each other all the time. Where `Underworld' lacks originality, it makes up for in noise, noise, noise. I guess that's supposed to be scary. Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire warrior always clad in tight leather. Her clan of vampires have been hunting down a clan of werewolves for the better part of a thousand years, and yet both clans have retained pretty sizable numbers. In the progress of the movie, she encounters Scott Speedman's doctor-type who's werewolf bite could result in some hirsute nights when the moon is out. They fall in love, kinda, but only to fulfill the Romeo and Juliet allegory/rip-off the producers were aiming for.
The special effects for the werewolves never really come full circle. When the beasties are realistic with digital effects, they look like cartoons. The practical effects just look like people wearing werewolf costumes. Neither creation seems to move in a realistic, animalistic way.
The vampires all look the part, but that's a little easy. Make'em look nice and pale, slap on some fake teeth and employ some wire effects. But these vampires certainly don't act the part. They're all very whiny people for immortals. There's a bizarre love quadrangle as the head of Selene's cult swoons after her while some other vampire chick swoons after him all the while Selene's making the sweetie eyes at the werewolf doctor. Honestly, who cares? Does a movie like this need so much plot? There are really only three scenes big enough to considered action scenes. The opener and the finale are so overlong and overdone, the audience gets bored. The third is so inconsequential, why waste the film stock? The rest of the film is all double and triple crosses, convoluted plot points and flashbacks of why the war started in the first place. Had this film had half the skilled visuals of `The Crow,' `Blade' or `The Matrix,' it might have been a standout. `Underworld' is more like a stand still.",Null,0,0,22 September 2003
Insomnia," Same old, same old
","Someone forgot to warn seasoned detective Al Pacino that the sun never sets in most parts of Alaska at that time of year, and as result, the poor guy doesn't sleep a wink during the entire movie. The poor audience has to endure director Christpher Nolan's hyper-style version of the effect sleeplessness has on the most attention sensitive of minds.That's right, Pacino is the cop of cops in this boring and a sadly typical cop movie. But its not the buddy-cop version, that would be too much just one month after 'Showtime!.' Instead of a mismatched partner, Pacino has one he genuinely likes as a person, which means he won't live that long, and he doesn't. Insomnia's twist is Pacino shoots him, and lies about it.See, the two of them are called from LA (where all good cops come from . . . or . . . wait . . . ) when a seventeen year old is brutally murdered and naturally, the local police are baffled because no one ever kills anyone in Alaska. While on a stakeout, Pacino runs after the killer (an effectively creepy and all too convincing Robin Williams) through fog that appears out of no where thats so thick poor Al can't see three feet, and the second he sees anything moving, BAM! Direct Hit! And wouldn't you know the luck? Robin Williams sees everything.And if you had just beaten a high school to death AND starred Bi-Centennial Man, you'd try to get away with it, too. So he blackmails Pacino, convincing him to help pin the murder on the girl's boyfriend; most of those silly Alaskan cops think he did it anyway. And Williams is incredibly effective as the soft-spoken and rational Walter Finch, who writes novels when he's not killing people or seducing jailbait. He's always calm, and he knows Pacino too well, probably because he writes about cliche detective work that Pacino is given to work with.But there are nice touches. The first few scenes show blood falling on a cuff, and someone vigorously trying to remove those tiny spots. Throughout the film we're treated to super-duper close-ups of that blood soaking into the fabic and staining it; as are those same stains on our characters and consciences when we've comprosmised morality. My gripe with 'Insomnia' is that here we have ANOTHER cop movie about cop morals (Los Angelas cop morals, to boot!) and the line between right and wrong.Don't other people in our great and diverse society question their morals who AREN'T cops and attorneys? Do you have to ride the line everyday to be interesting or what?",6,0,0,1 May 2002
Spirited Away," See it. Just go. 'Nuff said.
","If there's a reason Japanese animation is so popular in our American culture, I'd guess its something with the conventions. Anime doesn't have the same basic rules American animation has, and therefore it can show us things we've never dream of. For example: A witch with a head the size of a grocery cart that runs a day spa for demons and spirits.
Trying to describe the rest of Hayao Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' is like trying to describe a dream you can barely remember. There are key images you can't forget, specific emotions that felt too real, and for the life of you, you can never accurately explain how they all connected.
Now since this is an animated film from Japan, I feel I need to clarify one very specific thing. I am not a big fan of anime. There is only one anime movie on my shelf of movies, and its 'Princess Mononoke.' It's not a coincidence that this film was also directed by Miyazaki. He is the single best director of animated movies because his characters have depth, his stories tell about the most basic human emotions, and he draws or redraws a majority of the frames himself. 'Spirited' has been compared to Alice in Wonderland, and I can't think of a simpler way of explaining it. Chihiro, a wiry 10-year-old girl, is our Alice. The movie opens with her and her parents moving to a new town. A wrong turn brings them to an abandoned theme park. But when the sun sets, the exit disappears, and Chihiro finds her parents under a curse. She is alone in a world full of spirits, demons and really big headed old women.Chihiro's quest is not an easy one. She must save herself, she must save her parents, and she must find a way home. These quests are side-tracked as she meets employees and guests at the day spa. There's the boiler room operator, a man with six arms whose mood lightens when Chihiro visits. There's a river spirit that's so polluting no one can stand the smell of him, Chihiro stops at nothing to help him. She befriends the misunderstood No Face, a demon that won't stop eating anything, including the not-so-lucky day spa staff.
What I find most amazing about the animation is how little computers were used throughout the production. There are a few backgrounds that are sparsely rendered, but they look more like moving oil paintings and are used as a contrast. All the onscreen action, all the character's faces and emotions, all the minute details of this Wonderland have been perfectly realized by the world's best animators and the great Miyazaki.
Go see this movie. It is a feast of sensational visuals; it is an amazing story of meager people doing epic things, and as long as you're outside, go rent 'Princess Mononoke.' Films such as these can not disappoint.",10,2,3,25 September 2002
Pearl Harbor," I didn't like it either
","I realize that if you're reading this, you've either seen Pearl Harbor or plan on seeing it. And I can't really stop you, so I'm not going to try. I'm going to give you food for thought, maybe you'll ponder it over during the 3 hour tour-de-Bay/Bruckheimer epic, or while you're writing death threats to all of us that didn't like the film.Was this movie made with a PG-13 rating because A) with minimal gore and language, the makers could more accurately depict the horrific attack, or B) a lower rating means higher box office gross? Were the hospital scenes shot with soft-focus lenses A) for artistic purposes or B) because a hard focus would be too realistic, thus giving the film an R-rating, thus decreasing its box office gross?Was the historical tragedy used as a backdrop for a love triangle because A) thats the story director Michael Bay just had to tell at $145 million line of credit or B) Titanic did the same thing and made about a half billion.
I can't do much to slam on the films leads. At least not in the clever questionnaire style. I enjoyed Ben Affleck's character about as much as I did in Reindeer Games. Up until now, I thought Josh Hartnet had a promising career. And Kake who? Excuse me, wasn't there another British Kate forcing out an American accent in that other boat-sinking spectacle of a movie? Hm?The makers of this should have just dropped the other shoe and hired James Cameron as a screenwriter. At least his scripts have integrity.I know Randal Wallace, who DID write this script, had help developing the shotty dialogue, so I don't blame him for the 'I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you' and so on. I'm sure these slappy dappy lines SOUND good when you're in ninth grade, but they crash faster than shot down Japanese fighters when put on the screen.I do blame Wallace for the ludicrous situations he places his characters in. Air Force trainers and trainees do NOT play chicken right infront of their commanding officers. The two pilots that flew in the attack on Pearl Harbor were NOT in the Doolittle Raid.By the way, the raid had about a twenty minute build up and 30 second payoff, and even for slick summer action flicks, there's gotta be a bigger ending. I'm not saying it was a bad movie (although it was) I'm just pointing out that it's not a film based on real people or real situations. At the heart of this picture, there's only two very distinct sounds. The first is Bay and Bruckheimer high-fiving each other, which translates to KA-CHING to the Disney company. The second is that flushing sound you hear when you realize your $8 are really gone.",Null,0,0,1 June 2001
