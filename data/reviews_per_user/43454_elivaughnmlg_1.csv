It," More than a horror film
","This is my first review and I will keep it short and to the point. This film is not your average horror flick because it tells a story. The story it tells is from the perspective of a group of kids, some might even call them 'losers.' It is a narrative of courage, friendship, and good verses evil. Eddie was my favorite, but all the kids killed it. Pennywise was creepy, a brilliant performance by Bill Skarsgard. It was definitely worth my money.",10,6,15,10 September 2017
