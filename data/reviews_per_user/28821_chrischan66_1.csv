Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolutely brilliant
","You have to put aside any preconceptions before you see this movie. Yes it is offensive, but if you take the movie as such, it will be the funniest thing you see all year. From start to finish this parody of a Kazahkstani TV presenter named Borat is a barrel of laughs. I don't think I have ever laughed for such a long time. Between 30 of us, there weren't any dry eyes by the end of the film (yes it was that funny). In the same vein as the Borat shows on TV, Borat tours America and acts wholly inappropriately infront of the unwitting American population in order to see their reactions. It is these reactions which are often the funniest parts of the movie as you are left thinking 'did he/she really say that?!?!' This film has got to be recommended to film lovers everywhere!",10,4,17,4 November 2006
