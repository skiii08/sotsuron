Iron Man 3," Reminded Me of Episode VI: ROTJ
","The producers and writer and director of this movie left me feeling like the group who put together 'Return Of The Jedi'. What I mean is, it felt like they KNEW this movie was going to make $$$ so they just made whatever. Story? Plot? Much loved villains? Ehhhhh, who cares?! Its gonna make money.When I heard THE MANDARIN was going to be the villain, I read up on him and thought it would be a very cool story. But the writer and director decided to change THE MANDARIN cause, ehhhh who cares?! This movie is gonna make money.There is better writing and ideas on WALKING DEAD. The continuity in the story left me thinking, 'wait, that didn't make sense.' I gave it a 4 / 10 cause I am a RDJ fan, the effects were cool and uhhhh, hmmmm, maybe I should have gave it a 3 / 10.AGAIN, I REPEAT, the movie felt as though the producers, writers and director knew this movie was going to make $$$ so why worry about quality.",4,1,2,5 May 2013
