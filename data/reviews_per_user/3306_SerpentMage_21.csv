The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Actually OK...
","After reading the reviews you would think that this was the worst movie ever produced... Quite frankly I rather liked it. I was a glued as to what would happen next. Yes this movie is what I would call a filler. Matrix 2 was a filler movie. A filler movie is a movie that is there to tie one story line to another story line. Otherwise what happens is that the next instalment has to spend about 30 minutes tying up loose ends. Oh wait what is that story line? Well if you had waited until the end, moved through the credits (while listening to the song) you would know what the new storyline is... I am not going to say it, but I am going to let all of those reviewers who hated the movie figure that out on their own. In this movie many stage pieces were set, which I thought about and thought was quite interesting.I am looking forward to the last part. Did it move slow in parts? Sure did, but so did Harry Potter, Lords of the Rings, and Matrix... To put things in context, an argument could be made that the fighting scenes in each of these movies just dragged on and on... Guess what folks Twilight is not about fighting!!! That is a sideline..",8,0,5,31 March 2012
I'm Not There," Superb...
","I like to watch movies. There are times for action, romantic comedy, and these types of films. It is not an easy film to watch, but if you pay attention it is a good film. Actually very good film.Though what got me was that I felt like crying at the end of the film. That rarely happens, and I could not explain why. You felt pity and sorry for an individual that is both misunderstood and misguided. I suppose it is the story of an individual that is trying to figure out his role in life, the universe and his desire to escape.This film is 'artsy' and I only advise those people that like 'artsy' films to watch it. Otherwise you will be left wondering, 'ok so like what happened.'",10,1,2,24 September 2008
Unbreakable," Impressed...
","Some people may critique this film because of one problem or another.  But I have to be frank in that I was surprised how much I liked the film.  I watched it because two of my favourite actors are in it (Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson).  In a nutshell -I really liked it-.
In the beginning of the film you had no idea what was going on.  Then once things got rolling you kept thinking, ok now it is going to happen.  But of course it did not.  So suspense was built up even though it is not a mystery or thriller.  The plot kept going at a good pace without being melodramatic or boring.Some compare this movie to Sixth Sense.  But I think that is comparing apples to oranges.  Instead I think if any comparison can be drawn then it is to 'Twelve Monkeys' (another great Bruce Willis movie).",8,0,0,26 December 2001
Star Trek," I Dislike it...
","I will add that I am a star trek fan. Not a die hard one, but a star trek fan. I am also a hardcore fan of scifi...And here is where this movie hits in the wrong spot. It is an enjoyable movie. Had you called it, 'Let's Romp Through the Universe And Save It' I probably would have given this movie a pretty high mark.BUT it's Star Trek, and I expected more. I expected a pushing of the envelope. Look at the early Star Trek movies, and series and what you get are topics that push people. Whether it be a 'colored' person, a person that looks like Satan (Spock) or a robot that is intelligent (Data).Think about this one. We would not think twice about conversing with a robot and being friends with a robot. When STNG came out in 1987 we thought robots were things that you kept at arms length and to be wary of. Yet Star Trek changed that.What does this Star Trek movie do? NOT MUCH!!! Sure great movie, great effects, but that I can get from another movie. So I have to say that I dislike this movie...I wish this movie had pushed the envelope in a specific topic...",8,27,67,10 May 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Split Opinion...
","Let's remove the title of this movie and just call it Into Darkness. And let's say that there is a captain, first officer and they are in space. If you do that, this movie is a 10. However, it is a movie in the sign of the times like a Transformer movie. Don't get me wrong I enjoy a Transformer movie like the rest. However, the problem is that this movie is like Miami Vice of the 80's. Namely cool at the time, and looking back a bit douchy.This movie is not a Magnum PI type of movie. I have asked many people, even young people who never grew up on Magnum PI when it was released. And they all tell me, Magnum is pretty cool. What makes Magnum different, and some parts of Star Trek past, is its ability to be timeless.Here is a little bit of Trivia. When William Shatner took on the role of Star Trek captain how old was he? Don't read further! When Chris Pine took on the role of Star Trek captain how old was he? Answer Shatner was 34 and Pine was 28. YET even now Pine looks like a college boy, and not as a man as a captain should be. Most people when they do the math do not realize that Shatner was only 34 years old as people tend to believe he was in his 40's.Therein lies the entire difference of this Star Trek movie. The captain is a college boy and not a man. So therefore if you don't care about the Star Trek ideals then yeah this movie like Miami Vice is actually pretty cool. But if you want Magnum PI you are not going to get it, and therein lies my reason for this rating. I wanted Magnum, not Miami Vice. I can get Miami Vice from the Transformers.",5,3,7,27 May 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Very good movie where I could not guess the ending...
","I watch many movies, and for the most part movies are fairly predictable. I can usually see the ending coming a mile away. The fact that I can does not detract from enjoying the movie since some movies while being predictable are rather well made.This movie is different. It is made in the classical English style, even thinking this movie was made in the UK. Real UK movies are not North American movies as evidenced by say 4 Lions, or the series Utopia. Real UK acting tends to be slower and works the mind both in laughter and in seriousness. There is also less reliance on effects and props to tide the movie through.Having said all that Tinker Tailor Solider Spy was a good movie. I enjoyed it and was thinking, so who did it, and why. The twists and turns were very nice and made you think quite a bit about what would happen next.This movie is not a Bourne style movie (even though I thoroughly enjoyed those movies). It is closer to something like the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in revealing its plot. Overall I enjoyed the movie.",9,1,2,17 January 2013
Moana," Yet again a musical, but not indicated
","This is getting extremely tedious from Disney. Neither in the trailer, nor the description is it indicated that this movie is a musical! I detest musicals with a passion. I am not saying musicals are bad not enjoyable, by others, however I HATE, absolutely HATE them. Yet only Disney does not indicate clearly that their movies are musicals. The other one was Frozen.",1,24,59,13 April 2017
Interstellar," Finally is all I can say...
","Hollywood has become very sucky! Spiderman is rebooted for a third time. The Hobbit which was an extremely thin book is a three part movie. Let's now even begin with comic book overkill.But this movie stands heads over everything Hollywood has produced in the last few years. The movie is a long stretch at 3 hours, but it is an incredibly good 3 hours.What sets this movie apart is its originality, and classic SciFi basis. In the past SciFi has been altered to include Fantasy aspects, but not this movie. The acting was superb, and while I could go on and on, it boils down to one thing. If you like a good SciFi movie you will like this movie.",10,3,8,18 April 2015
Man of Steel," All I can say is AWESOME!!!
","I will watch almost any SciFi, Fantasy, or Action movie. It is a genre I like. In the past Superman has always been a sore spot for me as I am not crazy about the presentation. It seemed very kitsch, and too goody two shoes. This is the Superman movie that I have been waiting for me. It combines kitsch with grittiness to make an awesome movie. For the most part the movie stays true to the Superman image, but does so in a modern context with a human touch. It will move you emotionally even though it is just a Comicbook action movie. The script writing was great, but what was as incredible is the casting. The movie casted the right people for the right role. It gave the impression of authenticity, again for a Comic book Action movie that is impressive.Awesome is the way I would describe this movie...",10,2,7,26 October 2013
Being John Malkovich," Great story, bad movie...
","I was really looking forward to this movie because it seemed interesting. But there was a problem with this movie in that it did not transport me. Really good movies I find transport me into another world, but for some odd reason this movie simply did not.Hard to put the finger on it, but it seemed to be a whole slew of little things like the bad humoured Maxine, or the over-reactive wife.  It all seemed to be a bit too surreal and too far fetched.  It almost seemed to me that everybody was trying too hard at their character.I do not think the storyline was bad.  I was rather impressed with the story line.  With different actors or a different director probably would have been a real blockbuster.  All in all the movie simply did not turn out.",7,0,1,26 December 2001
Ocean's Eleven," A Great Watch for Relaxing
","This is the perfect movie to relax and watch.  The storyline is ok and made for some good entertainment.  Action and intrigue were pretty good without being excessive.  There were some classical elements regarding good guy bad guy that I have not seen in a long time.  That was refreshing to see in a movie.Not a life changing movie, but great movie to just sit back, kick up your feet and watch for entertainment value.",8,0,0,26 December 2001
Quantum of Solace," First Bond I Actually Liked
","I have not been a fan of Bond! I tried watching several of them, but the scene that is etched in my brain is Roger Moore surfing down a ski hill doing things that are really just beyond this world.I suppose what I completely disliked about Bond is that it was tacky showmanship from another bygone era of movie making.This Bond was different and yes lots of action, but you know I might even start to like Bond. Let's put it this way this was my first Bond DVD, and I know I will buy the next one.Is this similar to say Bourne? Yeah there are hints in this movie. But then again one could argue that Bourne is the modern Bond? So if this offends die-hard Bond fans? Yeah, and well that's life... Just like how I consider myself a die-hard Star Trek fan and was not amused by the latest Star Trek movie.Then again times change....",9,2,8,9 August 2009
Avengers: Infinity War," WOW soooo bad
","I have no idea how this movie managed to get an 8.6. The story writing is exceptionally bad, and cliches used are dimes a dozen. It seemed a very rushed story involving too many actors and super heros. I do like super hero movies and do enjoy a good fantasy, but this was not it.",2,6,12,12 November 2018
Frozen," False advertisement of Movie -> Musical
","I was looking forward to this movie and from the commercials it looked very good. However I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. The reason is because this movie is a musical! I completely dislike musicals. I am not saying that musicals are bad movies, I just don't like them and avoid them like the plague. What bothers me is that this movie is not rated as musical in IMDb. If you look up well known musicals they are rated as musicals. Again, I don't discredit the notion of a musical, just that I don't want to watch them, and don't want to buy the DVD. So if you want to watch a musical I am sure others will say this is a great movie. However if you dislike musicals then you need to stay away from this movie.",4,4,11,22 March 2014
Rules of Engagement," Interesting, Thought Provoking..
","I watched this movie because, well it was on TV. It had two of my favorite actors and thought, heck I could watch this and clean my home office. As the movie progressed I stopped cleaning and watched intensely.The movie was very thought-provoking in that what are the rules of engagement? There is a saying 'all's fair in love and war.' Is that true? When fired at do you just sit back and watch? I especially loved the twist on making the situation not black or white, but like reality gray! The Sargent was not completely innocent, or guilty and neither was the crowd.Though what I took as a bigger question mark is, 'If this a movie of what if, what really happens on the front lines?' I don't know the answers, but I certainly liked this movie.",9,3,8,25 August 2006
Invictus," Excellent Movie Even If Predictable
","So I read some comments about how this movie is too Hollywood, too predictable, and why would a leader even be concerned with this sporting event. All I can answer is that you have lived too much in Canada or the USA. In Canada and the USA sports are important, but not that important. In places like Europe, South America, Africa, or parts of Asia certain sports are VERY IMPORTANT!Consider the recent football (soccer for you North Americans) match between England and Germany. Cameron and Merkel sat in front of the TV watching the game and not doing any business whatsoever other than relaxing with a few 'brewskies.' Even though Europe was falling apart. Sports moves people in these countries like no other thing can. This movie is very good and I liked it. I found it very emotional. This movie though is similar to the German movie, 'Das Wunder von Bern' (The Miracle of Bern). It talks about the hardship and how the people came together to find a little happiness from the desperation of reality. Though the difference in the two movies is perspective.So how do you know if you will like this movie? Easy, how much are you attached to things like World Cup Football, or World Cup Rugby. If you are not attached emotionally to these types of things you will find this movie lackluster. If you are very attached and can get into the emotional spirit of the sporting event, then you will like this movie. It really is that simple, that black and white.",10,1,2,23 October 2012
The Last Samurai," An Emotional Roller-coaster Of A Movie
","Having the movie channel for the past five years I get to see all sorts of movies. Some good some bad. However, this one was very very good.As per other comments, this was a great movie and worth the watch. If there is any 'typical Hollywood', it is the last thirty seconds. But it's only a minor thing and does not really add or remove from the plot. What made this movie for me is that it put me on an incredible emotional roller-coaster.The characters were extremely well played and Tom Cruise was incredible. Personally I am fifty-fifty on Tom Cruise as some of his acting was very lack luster and shallow. Not this movie though. I especially like the fact that the individual characters were stereo-typical, but yet not. You never really knew what was going to happen, and you are glued to the movie.Great movie!!!",10,1,2,4 March 2005
The Fountain," A Very Good Film For Movie Buffs
","I happen to be an avid movie watcher and have an extensive DVD library. Thus I look for a movie to suit my mood. There are times for easy entertainment such as SpiderMan, Mr and Mrs Smith, and then there are times for a movie like this. If you read the comments you will hear plenty of people who complained and hated this film. I can see that, IF you are expecting easy entertainment.This movie has many similarities in style to What Dreams May Come, The Final Cut, or The Butterfly Effect. If you are in the mood for something deeper and out of the norm then this is a movie for you.A word of advice if you are going to watch this movie make sure you have a quiet moment with no distractions. It is intensive as Blood Diamonds and requires paying close attention.So in the end I liked this movie quite a bit.",9,3,6,6 October 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," This is an action move plain and simple
","I find it sad when people keep harping on how BAD this movie is. Me personally I was glued to it. I buy and watch many many movies. What I liked about this movie is that it makes no pretencions on what it is namely an action movie.What do people expect? Robot romance? Come on, its about a bunch of machines that can transform and there are two factions. There is not much depth to this movie and I don't expect there to be. I want some plot, and I want action, and I want to be entertained. This movie definitely gave me that.This is a movie that is be enjoyed on high def with surround sound and a bunch of people sitting on a sofa with popcorn, chips and pop! You will enjoy it!",10,2,7,12 November 2009
Lord of War," A Movie That Surprised Me...
","This movie is impressive because it shows what is, and not what can be. If you look at the description you can probably understand it is yet another movie trying to show the ills of the worlds and how you should change things.While it tries to do that it succeeds on a completely different plane. It succeeds by not looking at the macro picture, but the micro picture of a single gunrunner. It shows his world and how he likes his world.When 'Hollywood' gets these types of films it tries to show the evils and then has some ending that says, 'see this is how things should be.' But this movie does not do this. This movie says this is how it is. The fact that the gunrunner was so emotionless made it very hard to digest the film.If you think that he kills in cold blood like most movies make people to be then you are sadly mistaken. This is not classical 'Mob' and honor type movie. No, this about cold, emotionless, calculations and strategy. This is what makes this movie so scary and how come this movie just saps the energy out of you.I really enjoyed this film and if you are in the mood for something serious and dramatic then this movie is for you.",9,1,3,16 May 2009
Cloud Atlas," Awesome...
","As my ratings have shown I watch many many movies. Some of them good, and some of them bad. But this one is a definite 10.Recently a colleague of mine said that the future of Hollywood is not more action movies for they will become the Miami Vice of the current time. The future of Hollywood will be the writing. And in this case the movie and its writing is quite good. There is an actual plot, with a beginning and an end. This movie is long! It is nearly 3 hours and I advise that you make time for the entire movie. No interruptions, no dinners, no side conversations. This movie is very intense and is riddled with details. What makes this movie special is its ability to tell a story and keep you interested. There are good parts, and there are bad parts, happy parts, and sad parts. It is a roller-coaster and very enjoyable.Overall I thought this movie was refreshing and offers a contrast to the slew of actions movies. Action movies can be fun and enjoyable, but they are not mentally stimulating like this one.",10,1,3,23 May 2013
