Requiem for a Dream," Broke My Heart
","It is rare in the world of film that I see a movie that, after I've watched it, I can say, 'Christ that was a powerful movie!' I've seen my share of tear-jerker's, dramas, comedy's, action/adventure, et cetera and even though I cannot say that this movie is one of my all-time favorites I can say that it is a film that sticks with you long after you have finished it. I will also tell you that I honestly couldn't bring myself to watch this movie a second time; it just has such a raw intensity to it and the ending scenes hit you so hard that you're not sure whether to cry or cringe.It was the mother in this film, though, that really got me. You are introduced to her as a sad, lonely mother who has nothing but good intentions in what she does. And as her story concludes at the end you will want to do nothing but mourn at the unfairness of it all. Of course most of this applies to the rest of the main characters as well. One specific scene, though, when the mother (and you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it) is giving a speech to her son is really just what broke my heart and nearly brought me to tears.I give this movie a 10 because (1) it was just so damn powerful and (2) also because I have never seen another movie quite like it. And also all of the actors performed perfectly.Requiem for a Dream will get inside your head and stick there, oozing around (to be a little blatant). And (borrowing a line from 'Fight Club) It's like that scratch on the top of your mouth that would go away if only you could stop tonguing it...but you can't'",10,1,2,21 July 2005
