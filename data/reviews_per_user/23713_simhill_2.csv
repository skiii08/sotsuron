Hereditary," Hypnotic.
","Horror and comedy have one undeniable connection. They are the most subjective genrs. When you go into a horror film there is always going to be the chance that the scares won't get to you. But for a movie like this, it's worth the chance if not just to see some very creative cinematography and meaningful shot composition. A lot of thought has been woven into each frame in order to help you piece the puzzle together...or misdirect you.The plot is simple, and the characters are real enough but not very complex, but they don't have to be. Many horror writers have proven that a good way to throw the audience off is to abandon the three act structure and drive the story with an intriguing idea or theme, that the plot and characters simply frame. Hereditary is a great example of this. Pacing issues have been the most prevalent criticism, but I don't think it's too serious. It wouldn't hurt to cut a few minutes, especially in the middle, however I didn't think it was dragging. It's a movie worth being patient for.You really should see this spoiler free, which means there's only so much detail I can give, so I'll sum it up here. Great performances, hard to take your eyes away from once it gets going, quite scary at times and again, immaculately shot. Thumbs up.",7,1,2,2 July 2018
Avengers: Endgame," The cinematic universe model eats itself.
","I remember ten years ago when I was a comic book fan and the whispers that were coming out about a Thanos Avengers movie blew my mind. Infinity War satisfied that desire greatly, but Endgame is a mixed bag. I came out of the cinema feeling rather underwhelmed.To be sure, the action is superb. The last half hour of action made me grin from ear to ear and it gave me a similar feeling to watching Return of the King for the first time. However, it was a long road to get to that point.The film is too long. Far too long. It carries far too much baggage from the last movie and drags its heels, which in turn creates a jarring tonal discordance from quipping-Marvel fun to apocalyptic moping. Stop telling me how important things are. I know. Show me why they're important.Another problem I have is the story. It never felt like I was watching one. Infinity War was a hectic race against the clock, Endgame felt like I was watching a board meeting of writers and executives discussing how they're going to tie up loose ends. This is a movie that serves a cinematic universe owned by Disney, rather than serving to tell us a story.Without discussing spoilers, the plot is far too convoluted. The all-powerful Infinity Gems created enough plotholes you have to ignore, but adding time travel to the mix compounds this even further. It would be fine if the movie just dismissed these plotholes, but it keeps harping on the precise mechanics of how the time travel works in the MCU over and over, forcing me to think about how it makes no sense over and over. I don't like thinking about plotholes but Endgame just kept reminding me of them. Combined with the length this makes a large amount of the movie rather a chore to sit through.You must think I hate this movie after that, but I don't. The positives are the ones that come with the standard Marvel movie, funny writing, excellent music, effects, acting and likable characters. I'm certainly glad to have seen it, but unlike Infinity War, it wears out it's welcome after the first viewing.",6,22,52,25 April 2019
