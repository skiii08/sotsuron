Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," awful, unfunny, uninspired mess
","I chuckled exactly twice during this mess. I cannot believe it is rated as highly on IMDb as it is! The concept has promise, but the execution is just not at all funny. The concept that could work (and does... twice) is to see people's reactions to Sasha Cohen's outrageous ideation and behavior.The two funny scenes were both very short (no spoilers here, I will let you find them for yourself if you can stomach this movie). They each could have been expanded quite a bit. It's like the director's sense of humor is so crude that he couldn't see what was genuinely funny.Please save yourself some time and watch almost *anything* else. You won't be sorry.",1,35,69,3 June 2007
Sin City," awful... just awful
","The dialog was terrible, the acting stiff (at best), the plot totally predictable... way way way too much violence for no purpose. Really unwatchable. I would only recommend this to those who enjoy cringing a lot.Even for those who enjoy 'graphic novels' (comics), I can't imagine many enjoying this desperately terrible film.I really don't accept the argument that it is representative of the 'graphic novel' genre. I've read comics that have so much more real interest, where you actually empathize with the characters and understand the characters' motivations.Steer clear of this one, despite its bloated rating.",1,13,27,24 September 2005
