Black Swan," Might be the worst film ever
","Terrible movie. How did Natalie Portman (who is a good actress) win for this movie? She wore the same sad, forlorn expression through the entire film. And close ups of her face were all over the place. The story was boring. The overbearing mother who gave up her career for her daughter and then tries to run her life. Hmmmm, haven't we seen this, like, umpteen times? I agree with the other reviewer who said this character would never have been picked for this part as she lacked any confidence. And, if you're hoping to see some good dancing, forget it. There were very few moments of that on screen. Overall, this movie was dark, depressing and not worth the time.",1,18,32,30 March 2011
