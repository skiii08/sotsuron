It," IT 2017 review: Achieving buoyancy in the sewers
","I think it is safe to say that the original It TV miniseries (1990) has not aged well, that show suffered from a pretty decent first half before dropping greatly in quality in the second half. Tim Curry's take on Pennywise is fondly remembered and I can see why on one hand but there were moments of goofiness that plagued the entire miniseries. Not to mention the second half which somehow had adults giving worse performances then the child actors? When people heard about the remake I remember people being ill at ease. Many people feared a substandard remake that would tarnish or misunderstand the source material that inspired the miniseries. Let's find out shall we?October 1998 Georgie Denbrough disappears while playing in the rain, the following summer older brother Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) is still struggling to make sense of it. He still can't process it. He and 6 other children find themselves haunted by a terrifying clown calling itself Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård). The seven kids (Jaeden Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Grazer, Wyatt Oleff and Sophia Lillis) form the Loser's club to find a way of killing this clown. That is all I can say sadly about the plot, I do not want to run the risk of spoiling things unnecessary, the movie does not deserve it. I know it is based off a book and there is TV show that follows the same plot as this movie, the half anyway. Firstly the movie gets rid of a lot of the goofy moments that might have worked as a book might not work as well in a movie or miniseries, this was something the TV series did not understand and it suffered as a result. IT 2017 avoids this pitfall by making the manifestations the children experience more relatable. The movie works well with the theme of innocence corrupted with manifestations that make sense both on a adult and child level. IT somehow makes the phase 'You will float down here' seem actually scary and by some strange magic was able to make red balloons somewhat chilling! It also adds some new scares that turn things associated with childhood into nightmarish creations. I am saying that the film is actually frightening, unlike the TV show. Speaking of frightening Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise shines, he deserves to be placed next to Tim Curry. There might even be a debate that Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise is better then Tim Curry's Pennywise. He made my skin crawl whenever he was on screen; he is what a demonic clown should look like. There is not much more to say really, he is good, fantastic even; he deserves all the praise he gets. Another risk any film with a majority child cast has to deal with is the inherit problem that most child actors are inexperienced or lack the refined talent. Fortunately much like the miniseries the kids give great performances that feel not only convincing but real as well. The simple fact that most kids around ages of 11 will be swearing and getting into trouble makes the dialogue just that little bit more real. IT 2017 smartly starts out with the child part of the story; the second chapter I have no doubt will feature the adults. I would say that even if there was never another movie IT 2017 does not suffer in the slightest. It works on its own as well as a starting point. I look forward to chapter 2. Who knows it might defy treads and be just as good. We will see in time.",9,0,1,6 February 2018
The Death of Stalin," Death of Stalin: Fun times in Soviet Russia
","A black comedy is a hard thing to get right; you have to firstly find the fun in dark subject matter and then convince your viewer/player/reader that what they are seeing is funny and can be laughed at. In the worst case scenario you would be considered an edgy unfunny hack that does not understand anything about the subject matter being tackled. That is not the case with this movie fortunately. Death of Stalin starts in 1953 with Russian leader Joseph Stalin suffering a heart failure and dying, it is very sad (not really) and hilarity ensues with a power struggle between statesman Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) and leader of the NKVD Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell) all the while trying insure the other does not get too much power and trying to stay alive. Please do not think that Death of Stalin does not gloss over the atrocities of Stalin's rule any more than it does ignore the violence that occurred after Stalin dies. I would say that it respectively balances the humour with the horror; it is able to use some of the terror the NKVD used on Russian citizens for comedy but also knows when to behave seriously. It gets rid of that tonal problem that affects so many black comedies and horror comedies. Director Armando Iannucci and crew should be congratulated for it. The acting is extremely good, they look the part and are convincing in their roles, the little detail of letting the cast speak with British and American accents is a strange yet somewhat brilliant, and it builds a surreal feel to it that makes everything just a little bit funnier. But one standout presence in this film is Jason Isaacs's performance as Georgy Zhukov, the moment he enters you know you are in for a ride, he is easily brings the most laughs as well has the most memorable quotes in the movie, he is the best. The film has a loose relationship with historical accuracy, it does mostly follow the core events of the power struggle (if you know anything about Russian history after Stalin you know who is going to win) but it is still compelling enough for even someone like me, a student of history to enjoy and remain focused for it's entirety. The pacing is smooth and the jokes come in fast and well. The trouble with comedy movies is that there is a lot of spoilers in regards to jokes that I cannot talk about, it is all well and good to say that the writing is good or that it is a great comedy without going into any detail about how the jokes work or why this film is a satire on the inherent silliness of the communism and dictators. I hate that I cannot go into more depth with this movie. I would recommend that you watch it for yourself; it is well worth the price of admission.",8,1,2,14 March 2018
Get Out," Get Out: Come in, relax. Have a cup of tea... (Minor spoilers warning)
","I do not like to watch trailers before the movie itself. I find that either they misrepresent the product or just spoil the entire film within 2 minutes or less. This was the biggest reason why I never watched a trailer for Get out right up until I finished the movie. From what I heard, this was the type of film that could not afford to be spoiled. Oh god it does not deserve to be spoiled at all....Get out is the directorial and writing debut of Jordan Peele, it stars Daniel Kaluuya as Chris Washington who has been dating a white woman by the name of Rose Armitage (Allison Howell Williams) and the time has come to meet the family (Catherine Ann Keener, Bradley Whitford and Caleb Landry Jones as Missy Armitage, Dean Armitage and Jeremy Armitage respectfully) Chris is concerned that Rose's family would not approve of the interracial relationship. After a little assurance from Rose that the family is not racist at all He and rose drive to the family house deep in the woods. Once there Chris is welcomed warmly, a little too warmly. The family is so tolerant and so happy to see Chris that it is almost raciest. The two black servants Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and Walter (Marcus Henderson) are a little too happy to be working for the Armitage family, a little too robotic....As the weekend processes Chris begins to uncover an increasing sinister plan that certain members of the Armitage family want to involve Chris in...That is all I can say about the plot, but want I can say is that this film can easily go right next to Jennifer Kent's Babadook for one hell of a career start. The film has such a great atmosphere, visuals writing and editing. The film has such a deep sense that something is wrong; everything seems just ever so out of place. There is clear inspiration from films like the Stepford wives and Body Snatchers in the atmosphere along with drop of The Shining in for good measure. The film has great performances from everyone involved. The writing oozes laughs and scares along with racial commentary that is subtle enough to where the viewer's intelligence is respected but no so obtuse to the point very few, if any see the commentary. I really cannot see anything wrong with this movie; everything is just so well done. The comedy for once does not get in the way of the horror (vice versa) a common problem I have when horror movies try to add comedic elements which often creates a tonal disaster for the film. This is the first film I have seen that did not happen and I am happy for it.Get Out is one hell of a movie that deserves all the praise it gets. I really enjoyed watching this film and I will definitely see it again.",9,11,20,9 December 2017
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland drive: A dream about Hollywood (minor spoilers)
","David Lynch is one of the most interesting filmmakers in recent memory, His movies are often some of the most talked about and most intriguing films out there. They tend to be very dividing and often need multiple viewings in order to try understanding what they are about and what do they mean. Mulholland Drive is considered by many to be a classic and I would like to talk about it.Mulholland Drive(2001) is a murder (?) mystery drama about amnesic woman played Laura Elena Harring(later named Rita, later Camilla Rose), who after being involved in a car accident takes shelter in a house in a high end house in Hollywood. This coincides with Betty played by Naomi Watts (Later Dianne) a wide eyed young woman looking to become a famous actress in Hollywood after winning a jitterbug contest. The paths of these two women cross, resulting in them teaming up to uncover why the accident happened and who Rita is. While the main plot takes place there are a number of subplots that at first seem completely at odds with each other but all fall in on each in interesting ways towards the end of the film. After a certain point the film changes to a new set of characters played by the same actors (Dianne played by Naomi Watts and Camilla Rose by Laura Elena Harring) and the movie's plot changes into a tragic tale of betrayal and vengeance. I will not deny that when I first watched Mulholland Drive I disliked it, I suppose it was the sudden turn of plot and characters in a movie that is already dreamlike and demanding constant attention (please do not expect a David Lynch movie to be mindless or straightforward, you will only do yourself a disservice) just threw my interpretation out the window and left me cold. However recently with the rerelease of the film in cinemas I decided to give it another go, with this time approaching it with the idea that the first half is a dream of sorts and the second half was based on memory. After the second time I think it does improve immensely, I can't help wondering if this can be a flaw with Lynch's work if the first viewing could be such an off putting experience. I am not such if this is a flaw with the movie or me the reviewer. Naomi Watts shines in this movie, both as the near impossibly upbeat, naive and perfectly talented Betty and as the depressed mess of a human being we see her when she is Dianne. Her performance is real and perfect. Same goes Laura Elena Harring who starts off as the classic femme fatale of every 1940s thriller ever and turns into a woman who stole Dianne's career from under her. She turns from an idea blank slate for Betty to love into a betrayer of love and life. I love it.Now about that dreamlike atmosphere and techniques that is a staple of Lynch's work. He uses a lot of first person perspectives to bring a rather personal perspective and bringing across the implied fact that it is all a dream, the film cleverly uses blurred vision and different perspectives to show us the difference between memory and dream, the use of light and colour to tell the story and explain how characters are feeling and what they see. Perception of reality is not only a theme in this movie but also integral to the film as a whole.Mulholland Drive is an interesting movie that should be watched multiple times in order to understand it on some level. The first viewing may or may not turn you off it and I do not blame you. The movie is a daunting task if you are not prepared. However it is a pretty great movie and I will watch it again someday.",8,0,0,6 April 2018
La La Land," La La land: Singing in the Gosylingstone rain
","If you were into films around 2016 you would have heard of La La land, even if you were just a causal movie goer you would have at least heard the name. People were(still are ) in love with this film, so much so in fact that there was popular backlash to La La land during the time leading up and after the Oscars. Only now has this backlash appeared to have vanished. This was partly the reason why I, someone who loves musicals did not see La La Land sooner. I wanted to wait until things had cooled down. La La Land tells the tale of a struggling actress Mia (Emma Stone) and wannabe Jazz musician Sebastian(Ryan Gosling) crossing paths and falling in love in the back drop of Hollywood and trying to keep themselves together as professional ambition threatens to drive the two apart. I love musicals, always have done. One of my favorite movies is Singing in the Rain and La La Land is a clear inspiration/ spiritual successor to the 1952 classic. That if anything was one of the biggest selling points for La La Land and I think it does it very well. From the opening song and dance number to Sebastian and Mia tap dancing against a sun setting bathed hill breathes Singing in the rain that has just enough identity of its own so it does not rip off the inspiration but respect and honor it. There is not one musical number that feels out of place or does not add to the movie in some form which I do think is an improvement to Singing in the rain which did suffer from some dance numbers that felt like padding( Looking at you Broadway Melody). La La Land's plot might not be the most complex plot in the world but it is compelling and is well paced. The music numbers do not feel out of place and do not derail the plot in any way as well as being spaced out enough so both can exist without diminishing the other. Mia And Sebastian are interesting and likeable, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone give it their all in terms of performances, the romance not only feels believable but also goes to different places then Singing in the rain took it's romance in a ending that is bittersweet and poignant. The ending helps the movie stand apart from its inspiration and give it its own identity, I love it. Unfortunately as a true successor to Singing in the rain La La land falls short by one key factor. The dancing, the dance choreography is weak and stilted in comparison to other musicals especially to Singing in the rain which as most would know was well known for its ground breaking dance numbers. Another reason why most the dancing is weak would be because none of the main stars were professional dancers (Ryan Gosling did take dancing lessons for this movie, not sure about Emma Stone) so the dancing would be very simple and a little out of step with the music which is almost always upbeat and cheerful, the choreography could have been better if it was going to be a real successor to Singing in the rain. But without the comparison it is fine, not the best but works well enough. La La Land is a great musical, I would not say that it is one of the best movie musicals but it is one hell of an enjoyable watch. A must see for any musical fan.",8,0,0,27 December 2017
Don't Breathe," Don't Breathe: Walking on egg shells
","My, the period 2013-2017 has been great for horror movies! With this, the Conjuring 1&2, Babadook, It follows, Lights Out and Get Out among another have really stood out as well as raising the bar for horror writing and acting. I am so happy that this is the case. If this trend continues maybe more people will take horror more seriously as an art form. Who knows maybe one will get a best picture Oscar soon?Don't Breathe centres around three thieves. Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money ( Daniel Blanco) who for a number of different reasons want to get enough money to improve their lives. Rocky in particular wants to leave her abusive parents with her younger sister in the hopes of a better life. The answer to all of their prayers seems to come in the form of robbing a blind man's (Stephen Lang) house which supposedly has enough money to solve all their troubles. However once inside the house the blind man as it turns out is not as helpless as he looks.....Don't breathe takes full advantage of the claustrophobic set of a small, cramped decrepit house. You feel that every corner could result in death; the tiniest creek of a floor board might help the blind man hunt down the three. Director Fede Alvarez takes every opportunity to make the viewer feel on the edge of their seat, make you feel the stress the characters are experiencing knowing how the smallest sound might kill them. Because of this the film has a terrific atmosphere.The acting too is fantastic, everyone is not only believable in their roles but are able to show just how scared they are when they find themselves in over their head. Alex, Money and Rocky are stupid either and despite their chosen profession are likeable to an extent. Even the Blind man is sympathetic to an extent, even if his motives are questionable. The idea of not making noise to survive is really cleaver and further contributes to some incredibly intense moments, the film again does not waste any of the material the concept has. I would say that, without going into any spoilers the story suffers from unnecessarily complexity. If the film had just been about the three escaping the house but it adds story elements that at least I feel are not really needed and detracts from the pacing. However it is very personal and I doubt most would be bothered by this. As a horror movie Don't Breathe is a thrilling watch, as a piece of film making it is a very well made film. I would recommend it.",7,0,0,15 December 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Murder on the Orient express: Moustache magnificence
","Murder on the Orient Express is considered to be one of the greatest murder mystery stories out there. Agatha Christie's masterpiece has been adapted multiple times and it would only make sense that the king of making movies from classic works of literature Kenneth Branagh would take a roll at the material; this would be the only adaptation scene the 2001 Bollywood adaption and 43 years since the critically acclaimed adaptation in 1972 with Albert Finny. Who else should the reigns be given to then to Kenneth Branagh for such a great book?Murder on the Orient Express (2017) follows the famous inspector Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh with a ravishingly wonderful moustache) finishing up a case in Istanbul before taking a well deserved break on the one of a kind train the Orient Express, however while on the train shady business man Edward Ratchett gets brutally murdered and it is up to Poirot to solve what might be one of his greatest cases in his life. Because of spoilers I will not say more.When you take on a role that has been perfected according to some it can be a daunting task, it can be even an impossible on according to others but Kenneth Branagh takes the character and makes it his own. In this case Hercule Poirot is an obsessive compulsive who is able to detect what is wrong in the world and 'make it right...' He is also more proactive in this version with him defending himself at certain points him the film. A change that has had some of the hardcore Christie fans cry in anger is the introduction of a past love interest for Poirot, I think it fits the film and the character Kenneth Branagh is portraying as, it also fits into the themes of order vs. chaos and grief. I also believe that Branagh disappears into the role of Poirot, his accent is more believable then any of the previous versions of the character and I just do not seen an actor playing a role I see Hercule Poirot.The other members of the cast are well chosen for their roles, Johnny Depp is scummy enough to be Ratchett in regards to his performance and Michelle Pfeiffer is brilliant as the irrupting Ms Hubbard while insuring she never gets too annoying and remains sympathetic to the audience. There is also a rather interesting bit of casting with Dr Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr) that adds the commentary of race relations in the 1930s, while it does get dangerously close to peachiness at times it works all the same, I would say the film is decently written if some of the dialogue is a bit blunt. The film very well shot and looks exceedingly beautiful, lots of soft blues and whites paint very breathtaking views of the mountains, the CGI does look a touch cartoonish especially on the wide outdoor shots of the city and the train, this makes it very jarring when the very next shot has the practical effects in full view. I wonder if a few more days refining the CGI would have made it less jarring.Some might consider this movie to be a pointless remake; I think that would depend on what you consider to be pointless in regards to remakes. I do think Murder on the Orient Express is not a pointless remake because it tackles different angles and makes itself unique enough to stand out unlike the Nightmare on Elm Street remake or the Carrie remake. I really enjoyed this movie.",7,2,5,10 April 2018
The Queen," The Queen: A Royal conundrum
","Can you remember the weeks after the death of Princess Diana? For those who don't remember or were not there at the time, the Princess of Wales Diana Spencer died on 31st of August 1997 and the whole world went into morning. The British people in particular were very upset with her death with seemingly millions joining together in their grief, an unprecedented move that was never before seen or since. This is the backdrop for The Queen.The Queen begins with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) being elected Prime Minster and goes through the next few weeks until the public funeral on September the 5th. The main focus is on the royal family trying to comprehend the death and struggling to understand the reaction that occurred. The film does itself a favour by focusing on the Royal family and inability to understand the change of behavior on the British people. I like fact the movie does not vilify or deify the family, it treats them like humans. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth 2nd is so very believable as the queen, you do not even see her as Helen Mirren, for all intents and purposes is the Queen. She is a woman who does not understand what to do asides from what is to be expected of her and the film does not judge her on it, if anything it sympathies with her. Michael Sheen is uncanny as Tony Blair, his smile, his accent it is all so believable. Same goes with James Cromwell as Prince Philip I can't see anyone else portraying Prince Philip or anyone else doing it as well as James Cromwell. The film is flawless on a technical standpoint; I cannot see any flaws in terms of filmmaking. Overall a very well made movie. I think one of the best moments of editing in the moving is how the movie inter cuts old recordings of Diana with the first person perspective of the driver and the occasionally cut to the reporters chasing the car.The film is mostly accurate to the historical events, with some minor chances to simplify the events for narrative purposes. It does paint the press in a somewhat negative light and does gloss over the entire backlash against the journalists that resulted in Diana's death. It just has a missed opportunity that could have been explored if it had a longer running time. But it does not really hurt the movie overall. The Queen is a pretty good movie all things considered. I really cannot find much to talk about. So yeah...",7,0,0,30 March 2018
The Producers," The Producers: Tap dancing storm troopers, oh my!
","Mel Brooks is a curious person in the film industry, he started out big with such films like Blazing Saddles (1974) and The Producers (1967) then tumbled down until Dracula: Dead and loving it (1995) where he stopped making films all together. On one hand most people remember him to be a comedic marvel with razor sharp satire while on the other hand people remember his work to have some.....outdated comedy that hurts otherwise great movies. Let's find out!Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is a washed up playwright who is struggling to make ends meet, he has not had a profitable play for a long time and fears he might not last long. When a mousy accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) inadvertently mentions a way to scam people, Max enlists Leo to create an intentional flop to scam the investors. Thus Springtime for Hitler: A Gay romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden by mad ex Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars ) is made.Hilarity ensues. To not mention the famous Springtime for Hitler number would be wrong, it is amazing, and such a delightful middle finger to Hitler and Nazis in general, the music is catchy as well. I was humming it for a good few days with a big silly grin on my face. I love how that number takes Nazi propaganda and mocks the hell out of it and shows just how stupid it all is when you boil propaganda down to its most basic and honest level, I love it. The comedy is great all round for the most part and the performances for the most part are really good, the timing is on point and, again for the most part are characters and not one note clowns that exist only to make us laugh. There is a reoccurring problem with the Mel Brooks movies, at least with this and Blazing Saddles is that there is a period of time where all the comedy just dies. In this case it is with the gay characters, they are the only characters that not three dimensional people but just the camp gay stereotypes that are relying on being gay camp stereotypes. It is not funny. In any way whatever, I have seen more offensive variations on this stereotypes, it is just boring and annoying. It brings the entire movie down for a time.However the movie does recover from this and the stereotypes never come up again in any major way. The film benefits from this as that period has aged so badly and does the movie a massive disservice. The movie's real straight lies in the satire and the two main leads which Mel Brooks does well. The trouble with reviewing any good comedy is there is very little margin for spoilers, so much of what is good about it is can be considered a spoiler so I will end this review now.This is a very good comedy, not for everyone and some of it has not aged well at all but there is a wit and intelligence to this that makes it very watchable. I would recommend it.",7,0,1,27 November 2017
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta: Remembering the 5th of November
","V for Vendetta (2006) is a dystopian political thriller directed by James McTeigue and written by The Wachowskis. It stars Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and John Hurt and is an adaptation of the Alan Moore graphic novel of the same name.The Year is 2027, the world has been rocked by war and plague, the US is a shell of its former self in the middle of civil war and England is ruled by a Fascist party known as Norsefire. England is a police state and the one part government controls all aspects of the common people's lives. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) is on her way for to a date, it is past Government curfew and as a result she runs into the secret state police (Fingermen) and is about to be raped by them she is rescued by a masked vigilante called V. There she slowly gets involved in helping V overthrow the Norsefire party and free England from oppression. The world V for Vendetta is in has been brought to life extremely well; it is able to make the idea of England under dictatorship believable and a scary possible future. The film is dripping in visual story telling that is able to trust that the viewer is smart enough to not demand to get spoon fed but is not too obscure either. The main themes of Justice and freedom of expression are woven into the narrative with skill and subtly that helps make the film universal and timeless. I find the use of the Guy Fawkes mask e being used in protesting censorship an example of how well this film and the book have aged. It is very strange seeing John Hurt as the dictator after he played Winston in the 1984 film but it is a testament to his ability as an actor that he is able to shake that off, he commands the film whenever he is on, he is horrifying as High Chancellor Adam Sutler. We do not even see him that much asides from a screen that looms over the other members of the Norsefire party. I cannot see anyone else playing Sutler. Hugo Weaving takes a task that most actors even most studios would not risk. He never shows his face to any one for the entire film, not many actors are willing to do that and it would have been force in a scene with V taking off the mask and it would damage one of the themes of the film being that V is a symbol rather than a person that can die. That being said Hugo Weaving is great in this, he is not only a tragic figure forced to become terrorist in the hope of making the world a better place but is also a killer and a terrorist who destroys property. V is an interesting character study of when people are forced to commit terrible acts for the greater good of a country. Natalie Portman's English accent is fine, it does the job and I believe that she is English despite some slips in her voice. Her performance is also well done and she is a well written character. I cannot really think of anything wrong with this film. The sympathetic view of V might be problematic as it could be seen as sympathetic to terrorists but it is unlikely and is an analysis for another day.",8,4,6,13 December 2017
