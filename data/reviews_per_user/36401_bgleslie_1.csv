First Man," Ignore bad reviews (especially if you're an Apollo enthusiast)
","This is just my opinion as someone who is an avid fan of Apollo (and all spaceflight). Some of these bad reviews confuse me. Shaky camera? I have to assume they're referring to Armstrong's POV shots during flight of X-15, Gemini 8 and, of course, Apollo 11 because I didn't really notice any other 'shaking camera' scenes. If there were, it didn't register. So, that said, I'm wondering what the beef is because getting into Earth's orbit or leaving it in a rocket requires getting to speeds of 17,500 mph (orbit) and 25,020 mph (breaking orbit to go to the moon). Riding those rockets has been described as 'the shake of your life' So, the 'shakiness' is absolutely realistic and the movie staff spent hours with pilots, engineers, and astronauts researching what was needed to produce the effect of 'being there '. It seems silly to me that this is being hailed as bad directing. 
The movie is slow, but far from boring. It's not an exciting epic about a mission malfunction (Apollo 13) and is thus more nuanced. Neil Armstrong was known for having ice in his veins and the movie definitely captures this. 
The scene for Apollo 11's liftoff was fantastic and a great tribute to the power and majesty of the enormous Saturn 5. This monster registered on seismographs up in the Northeast, shaked buildings anywhere near the area, and even blew windows out (before they figured out how to suppress the sound waves sith water) when it launched, and this movie captures that awesome power. The scenes leading to the landing were very well done and accurately portrayed (from a scientific perspective). 
The only criticism I have is that it ended with Apollo 11 and didn't cover his life afterwards.",10,1,5,15 October 2018
