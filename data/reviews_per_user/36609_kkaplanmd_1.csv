Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Bore-at, perfect for 7th graders and 7th-graders at heart
","I watch lots and lots of movies, and in general, I have found the IMDb a credible source of information. This is the first time I have submitted a comment, but I feel obligated to say that Borat is perfectly suited to the middle-school-aged film-goer. The humor is juvenile; a lot of sex and potty-talk. My husband and I were interested in seeing it because of all the hype and because our 7th-grade son loved it. I guessed that a movie he loved would not be one that I would love, and I am correct. I know there is a 10 line minimum for IMDb, but is there anyone who can come up with 10 lines of commentary on Bore-at? Boring it was, and really stupid too.",3,2,5,18 March 2007
