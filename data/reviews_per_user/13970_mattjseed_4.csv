The Blair Witch Project," Good movie but with low spots during the middle
","When watching the Blair witch project I always seemed to be in one of two positions; on the edge of my seat or with my hand clasped on my mouth not in fear but with a sympathy for the inevitability of their demise and for this reason I would say this movie is a master at suspense not horror. Near the end we see mike facing the corner in what was essentially the last shot of the film. To me this represents not necessarily the control the supposed witch has in the film but him turning his back on Heather and resigning to his fate. A lot of people and media outlets claim this is one of if not the best horror movies of all time, I can't really say I agree with that statement as I am not as learned in horror movies as most but I can say the overwhelming hype for this movie is a little undeserved. While it is good at certain things like suspense the Blair witch project doesn't stand alone as a movie per say. This is mainly because the majority of the movie is focused on arguments and the characters going round in circles both in conversation and in physically accidentally retracing their steps. For this reason I would give it a 6.5/10. I think this especially when I consider the most interesting part of the movie is what happens after the cameras stop rolling around the end. I'm not usually one for tin foil hat thermos but I was curious, so I looked one up after the movie and ended up buying into one. Long story short he showed a variety of different evidence that pointed to the truth that Josh and Mike had planned the whole thing as an elaborate way of killing Heather. It's eerie how many subtle details you don't notice while watching the movie points to this theory being true so I believe that after the camera drops Heather is killed by the two boys.",7,0,0,31 October 2017
The Shining," One of the best
","If you watched the shinning not knowing of Stanley Kubrick, his style, his history in film you could watch the whole movie on a surface level and enjoy it. There is that base level 'Enter the dragon' way of watching where you suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the film for what it is. If you watch the shinning like that you will most likely enjoy yourself and not think much of it but when you start to unpack it, dig into the deeper meanings you find yourself watching an almost completely different movie. The biggest of these 'easter eggs' has to be the Native American themes throughout. The first hint is when Ullman, Jack's boss says the hotel is built on a Native American burial ground. From then on we see multiple subtle nods to the conflict with jack throwing a ball at a Native American sand painting and cans in the pantry adorned with chieftain heads behind certain characters meant to represent the culture. And that is just the most obvious theme. So I definitely think Kubrick incorporated hidden meanings into the shinning. The shinning is a very talked about movie especially with people like my brother who loves Stanley Kubrick so I am familiar with the talk surrounding it. I can see what the hype was about with some claiming it is the best movie ever although I don't agree with that statement it is an undeniably a classic in my eyes. From shot one you are on edge with the creepy music making the peaceful atmosphere of the mountains, an aesthetic I usually feel quite at ease with, eerie and unsettling. I think it's best to say now I went into this movie almost blind only really knowing it was horror movie and a few things like the term shine and the famous 'here's Johnny scene'. So this unease continues on throughout the movie until we realize jack has finally snapped. From then on it's an intense chase that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final almost unbelievable ending of the snow-cat driving away into the fog. We then see jack has frozen to death failing his mission and in complete contrast with other films in the genre making it a welcome change.",7,0,1,8 November 2017
Get Out," Tense and suspenseful fun
","I don't like horror movies. I choose to avoid them if at all possible, but that doesn't mean I haven't seen some of the best ones. The exorcist, Halloween, the Blair witch project, the shinning and the sixth sense are all movies I have seen. I respect them all A's movies and don't dislike them per say but the genre in general just isn't my cup of tea. Not that I am scared by any of them they just don't appeal to me for other reasons.
However get out broke down my defences and gave me one of the best movie experiences I had all year. I went into this movie blind except for the knowledge that this was a horror movie. 
Right out of the gate the suspense for this movie builds as soon as he gets to the house. The movie does a great job of making regular dialogue ominous and meaningful. The movie stays suspenseful up until the the finale. Throughout this suspense you are left to try and figure what it is that is exactly going on. You get small hints and clues throughout each leaving you a bit more on edge. 
Before I talk about the finale I think I need to address the race element that plays a massive role in the movie and likely is a deciding factor to whether you like it or not. I've seen some people feel attacked by this movie which I think is unfair. Whether you think the message is true or not you can't hate the artistic side of it for that. I personally think the whole 'so not racist it's racist' message is a good one and I think the movie makes an effort to show that this isn't all white people. Despite whether you hate this message or not you can't let it take away from the high level directing and writing exhibited in all the scenes. Especially the dialogue. 
Now on to the finale. This was pure cathartic tense action up until the last. Seeing the people who were using other humans as bodies being killed was somewhat relaxing in a sort kill bill sort of way. 
I saw both endings for this movie and I have to say I much prefer the ending where Rod comes to the rescue rather than the police. This ending makes everything that happened before it more satisfying. I am also a sucker for happy endings. Sure the police ending was more realistic but I don't watch these kinds of movies for realism. Besides the whole brain transplant completely shattered that illusion already.",9,14,26,10 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," The American dream
",The disaster artist is a movie that will make someone who hasn't seen or heard of the room laugh at a ridiculous story of two friends one normal and one eccentric who just want to make it in hollywood. But to those who know the room it will indulge every question they viewer has about Tommy Wiseau. It doesn't necessarily answer any of these questions but it certainly addresses them. The movie was made and is a testament to the american dream of moving to hollywood and making it back. Even with such a character as Tommy it still comes off as heartwarming and think that's why this movie is special not because of some hidden genius in the room. But because it is reflection of a passion and how the journey is more important than the destination. As for whether you need to watch the room first or not I don't think it is necessary but a little background knowledge would be good to have.,8,0,0,13 April 2018
