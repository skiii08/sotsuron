Lucky Number Slevin," Engaging and Entertaining
","This movie is undeniably very entertaining. The main reasons are the cast, their as always great acting (referring to Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingley), the gripping story line and the entertaining couple - Josh and Lucy Liu. In short cast was just perfect. I found Lucy Liu too cute in the movie and that also made those not so relevant scenes watchable. The plot was not all surprising - the climax I mean. I found it a little disappointing at first but with the Lucy Liu part embedded to it - it turned out fine. The Prologue gives the hint to what might have happened between Bruce Willis and Josh but nevertheless the story was definitely exciting. I liked Slevin a lot. The character was very entertaining and Josh seemed fit to play it. I didn't realize the time passing while watching it, which for me is a success. In the realm of suspense and thriller this is no masterpiece but it is worth a watch.",8,1,1,17 August 2016
The Big Short," Entertaining and Informative
","This movie felt like a blend of a film and documentary. It has a great narration by Ryan Gosling. Great acting too. The movie is made in such a way that the information reaches to all. All jargons explained and simplified in a very original way I must say - through 'real' celebrities in the movie - so that it is appealing to most of the viewers. It was very original in my opinion.Steve Carell is as always very good. And he is especially very good in his character. I loved his character and one could see him delivering the pain and emotions very sincerely towards the end of the movie. Christian Bale made me do a double take when his character came on screen. I mean, I know he has two fully functional eyes then how did he pull this off? How? It was incredible. This I think was an exceptional piece of acting. This is the definition of living the character in the movie. As far as direction is considered, it was very good. Not very unique because some elements I think is borrowed from Woody Allen where he makes the characters talk to us through the screen but the effect and timing is really nice. I have seen 'The Other Guys' by Adams and I found that entertaining too. More than the other I believe. And I found this movie thoroughly entertaining too.",9,1,1,9 July 2018
