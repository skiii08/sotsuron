Hereditary," Maybe the best psychological horror film
","People that trash this movie or make fun of it are the ones who are too scared to surrender to fear. It's a coping mechanism that protects them from the unpleasant feelings this movie generates, understandably. Well it's not for the faint hearted; those will find reasons to hate it. If you're comfortable with feeling uncomfortable then this movie will satisfy you, potentially terrify you but you will enjoy it. At least I did. Top-notch performances, disturbing music with a lurking distressing vibe that haunts you.",9,2,2,27 March 2020
The Favourite," Brilliant
","People who hate it are either shallow, are too brainwashed with s*loads of hollywood blockbuster movies, or are just biased in a way.",9,4,7,25 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Hollywood documentary
","There's not a real storyline or plot. Kind of entertaining to watch because of the amazing atmosphere and photography of Hollywood and the late 60s. The film delivers on that aspect and really immerses you in a different era. However the lack of suspense makes the movie pretty dull. Some dialogues are interesting but the narrative is not very convincing. Different references and stories stitched together with no apparent reason. Could be done in one hour less. I found it very tiring. Only for cinephiles, Tarantino fans, or 60s nostalgics.",6,2,3,17 August 2019
