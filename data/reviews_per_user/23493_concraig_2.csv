Casablanca," the bar is the star
","I've seen Casablanca about a dozen times and it is certainly up there in my top five. What I love most about it is Rick's Cafe.  Don't you wish you could go to a place like that? Full of beautiful, desperate people who will do anything to make some money, get a plane ticket or get some information about the Resistance. It's seething with spies, secret agents, Nazis and Free French. The staff are quirky and witty, the piano player is sublime and over it all there is Rick's brooding presence. I love the croupier, who looks so reproachfully at Rick when he allows the Bulgarian couple to make enough money for their plane ticket out.I don't think any film has matched Casablanca for romance, intrigue and suspense. Corny, but wonderful. And, as someone said of Hamlet, it's so full of quotes.",Null,0,0,5 December 1999
Casino Royale," Not particularly stirred ...
","I have a feeling I'm in a very small minority here ... but having seen Casino Royale at a preview last night, I was very disappointed with it, particularly given all the glowing reviews. Daniel Craig is fine, but the plot was a mess and the villain wasn't all that scary. The film seemed to lurch from one set piece to another, and the twists at the end were frankly baffling (can anyone explain to me what happened to the Algerian boyfriend? Is he alive or dead? When was he kidnapped?) Okay, I admit Daniel Craig looks great in his tight swim shorts, and Montenegro looks extremely pretty, but as a film it was pretty dull (and way too violent.)",6,4,14,16 November 2006
