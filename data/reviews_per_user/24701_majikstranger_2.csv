The New World," Utter brainwashing Crap
","Im sorry but this movie is awful to the extreme. It is slow, unenthusiastic and boring. I don't buy the characters in their role, a lot of the scenes make no sense and look as if it was added on a rock paper scissors game. I get what the director is trying to do, but fails miserably at it. He is trying to make us love the characters and be in love with the scenery but what we get is an insult to our intelligence. The only way i would see this movie as enjoyable is if your high as a bird. Other then that brace yourself for the slowest ride of your life unless you have a slow mentality and need things slowly explained, in that case you will love this film",1,4,14,18 July 2007
Oblivion," Piece of crap only worth watching if nothing else is going on in your life.
",I have no idea why this has such high reviews. Im starting to believe either people are getting dumber or the church of Scientology is up voting the hell out of this movie. This movie sucks. like 40 minutes into the movie i was bored out of my mind. Seriously nothing really happens till the last 30 minutes of the movie. You can literally tell this story 10 minutes long and it would have been way better than this waste of time. Everything is so clich√©' and and all the emotions expressed are just so dramatic for no reason. You don't even get the feel of oblivion in the entire movie. Watch this on a Saturday night if you have nothing better to do and lower your expectations and it will be an OK movie but expect a classic sci fi experience and you will be disappointed.,3,20,40,25 July 2013
