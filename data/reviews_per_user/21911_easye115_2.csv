United 93," As if you were there...
","This film is based on the actual events that took place on that harrowing day of September 11, 2001. The film begins in a hotel room, where the 4 proposed terrorists are ready for what would be their mission before God. This film works very fast, as if you were actually there, on the plane, just going about your business and ready to reach your destination. When the eventual moments of terror and agony begin, not only can you feel everyone's pain, suffering, fear and desperation, you feel the same. Paul Greengrass is one of today's best directors at all of this. The fact that the families of those who perished had a lot of input into the film really helped and made it as real as possible. Afterwards, you walk out with really nothing to say.",9,2,4,27 January 2012
500 Days of Summer," Unexpected Hit!
","500 days of Summer is one of those films you don't really know what to expect from. When you actually take the chance and watch it, you wonder, 'why can't I watch more movies like this?' This, after having to wake up at 6am, not having anything to do and coming across this on one of the lower end cable networks. Interesting, because this film actually is based on the idea that 'love' is all about your fate, about being at the right place at the right time. There may be moments where you do not believe that, but after watching the entire film, you really do believe it. Many kudos to Marc Webb for directing such a smart film, for Joseph Gordon-Levitt on continuing to be the wonderful actor he is.",10,1,2,30 January 2012
