Alien 3," My favourite Alien movie
","Not to take away from Ridley Scott's original movie, because it is incredible and I love it but, Alien 3 is an amazing movie. 
It's dark and gritty. It moves the story along on a slightly different path but with respect and nods to what I believe was Ridley's vision and ideals.",10,4,6,9 August 2018
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Just made 7 Stars
","I just finished watching The first three XMen movies and followed with Wolverine.There is a lot to like about this movie. They got Victor Creed so right. I much prefer this character portrayal than the one written for the original XMen movie. 
Hugh Jackman is also great in this - I don't think he's ever been bad as the character, he's just improved since the first movie. 
The story was great. Lots of great characters involved that we hadn't seen up to this point. What they got wrong was Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool). Ryan Reynolds did a great job, it's just the portrayal was written so wrong. 
But, with the events of XMen: Days Of Future Past, this version of Deadpool can still stand in the old/original timeline. Anyway, glad they did a better version of Wade/Deadpool later. 
Also some of the CGI in this is a little hard to swallow. Logan's claws are drawn on way too much - especially for close up shots. They look like cartoons over live action (like Roger Rabbit). So I liked the story and the movie as a whole but, it did seem to be edited strangely. Like a minute or 2 of some scenes were missing. If you're an XMen fan then you will like this but, also be disappointed by some of the places they dropped the ball a little. 
Otherwise it is still a decent action sci-fi movie. 
It's probably the weakest of the XMen movies but still worth the watch.",6,0,0,16 August 2018
X-Men," Rewatched after 16 years
","Decided to go back and start watching the XMen movies from the start. 
i will keep this short, i expected to not be impressed and to have found this to date poorly but, I still thought it was pretty good. 
I was never a reader of the comics but, I did watch the animated TV show as a young teen. 
I think they did great. Sabertooth would be the only character they wrote incorrectly - they wrote Sabertooth right in the XMen Origins: Wolverine but, this is a better movie. 
It's a solid movie in the franchise and I recommend it.",7,0,1,16 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Read the critic reviews, then saw the film
","I smiled through out almost the entire film.
I was hoping to not see what some of the critics saw, the ones who did not rate the movie well.
I enjoyed it emensley.
I know it skipped through some periods of Queen and Freddie's life rather quickly - but that was fine, it's a 20 year story in 134 minutes. Have to leave somethings short.
Great movie.
I was never bored or disappointed.",9,5,6,18 December 2018
The Dark Knight," Honestly incredible.
","This is the greatest hero movie i have seen. 
What they did with the characters of The Joker, Batman and especially Harvey Dent is just amazing. What a fantastic story. 
Dark in the perfect way. 
I'm not sure why they replaced Katie Holmes in this movie (from Batman Begins) but, Maggie Gyllenhaal did a stellar job. Perhaps better than Miss Holmes did, who did fine herself.
Now the first film, Batman Begins, was a great film, I loved it. Every moment. A great origin story for Batman. Yet, The Dark Knight still managed to knock it out of the park. Just a whole other level. 
I had to give this 10 Stars because I really enjoyed the whole ride, was in disbelief and once it was over, I couldn't pick it apart. 
I was going to give it 9 but, I couldn't think of a reason to Not give that last star. Was it a perfect movie? It sure as hell wasnt missing anything.",10,1,1,12 August 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Watch the ULTIMATE EDITION
","I decided to rewatch this after giving it a 6/10.
I watched the Ultimate Edition and I'm glad I did. Now it makes sense. It's long - but, it's so much better. 
Whoever edited it down should be held responsible for the bad ratings. 
This is a great movie. 
Please, watch the Ultimate Edition, which is what Zack Snyder intended you to see.",8,2,2,12 August 2018
Beowulf," Slow and Irritating
","It's very slow paced and that makes it some what boring. The CGI gets frustrating as the movie goes on. Yes, it's a marvel of its technology, but the CGI is so distracting from what the characters are actually doing or saying.
So irritated by the end of the movie.",4,1,2,15 October 2019
Minions," It's just great
","My kids love it. They've been watching this movie for a few years now and still love it. Laughing and rewinding parts. 
Every time it's on and I'm around I get sucked in and start watching too. 
The soundtrack is great and I honestly think it's hilarious.
The best in the Despicable Me franchise, besides the original.",7,0,0,7 September 2018
