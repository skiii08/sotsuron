Minority Report," Why, why, why....?
","To be fair, I do not like Tom Cruise as an actor.  Pretentious Hollywood trying to do another 'formula' movie is an insult to anyone with more than a couple of brain cells at their disposal; that being said, I was waiting for a homogenized AOL like - 'Here's your movie!' to jump out at me when I put the DVD in the player and sat down to watch Minority Report.As an aside, Spielberg has made some great movies.  That does not translate into 'Everything Spielberg touches is gold'; with Minority report he wound up with lead... and a big fat movie check.The premise of this film deals with a potential future without really explaining how and why we got there.  Crime in D.C.??  No kidding there's crime in D.C.! (In the ghetto and on Capitol Hill... what else is new..??) Are we to believe that some tweaked out vegetables lying in a hot tub mystically carving up croquet balls are the answer here?  Perhaps my bias is really showing through...Minority Report is a self indulgent formulated movie that is not entertaining.  It is far too long, and far too complicated; (even for the high brow folks...)",3,3,5,12 April 2003
Chinatown," Brilliant
","This movie runs on cable fairly frequently, and if you have never seen it, get some popcorn, a soda, and be prepared to take a trip back in time.Chinatown is a such a sexy movie on so many levels.  The complexity of the story, phenomenal characters, brilliantly shot, put Chinatown on the must see list.  Nicholson breathes such life into the J.J. Gittes detective character that you can almost taste the liquor in the glass he drinks. 
What I love most about Chinatown is that it took the time to tell the story properly, without cutting corners.  It IS long, but worth every frame.",10,1,3,12 April 2003
8 Mile," Were you expecting more....?
","Unless you are a huge fan of Eminem, or have some romantic notions about the hip hop sub-culture, and or Detroit, Michigan, this movie is a huge waste of time.  An endeavor of 'vanity' film making not seen since Purple Rain, this movie lacks any kind of character development, involvement, or basis in reality.  The film uses stereotypes as broad strokes, but winds up with watercolors in the rain; what's the point.  One can only wonder what Eminem's 'Graffiti Bridge' will be called.",1,6,20,11 April 2003
Signs," Got Human?
","Night has made another really good movie.  Without a recap of the plot, I had a hard time trying to categorize this movie, which is a good thing.  It isn't quite drama, science fiction, action, comedy, or suspense.  It takes elements of all of these and turns out a well thought out, entertaining movie.  Fans of Night's work, (Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense), will really like Signs. 
Mel Gibson, in my opinion really stretches as an actor, and is supported by a good cast.  And although you never really leave Mel's world, you get a sense of a larger world view with the story.  It is also the first movie to deal with Crop Circles, which is a very compelling subject.  Additionally, I truly admired the way 'faith' was tackled in this film.  Though provoking and entertaining.",8,0,1,12 April 2003
High Fidelity," Speak to me
","High Fidelity is one rare gem of a movie that speaks volumes to anyone who has loved and lost, or just loved at all.A story of that uncomfortable point in one's life where you question the wisdom of your friends, and have to make a decision about who you are and where you want to be.  In my opinion this is John Cusack's finest work.  See this movie, many, many times, and you just might learn something.Brilliant.",10,0,1,13 April 2003
