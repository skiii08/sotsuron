Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Relatively good
","After watching TLJ, all prequels seems pretty great. Jar jar and some trash plots aside, it still gave us the Star Wars vibe and some decent light saber fight, also Darth Maul.",9,4,5,1 June 2018
Aquaman," 10/10 visually, 7/10 narrative
","An entertaining movie with amazing visual effects, epic shots, and fight scenes. But the story is really fast paced, it pretty feels like what will happened if we combine all Hobbits movies into one.
It follows a compacted linear storyline with multiple character origins. I felt pushed through the movie rather than lead through the plot. Dialogue seems rushed just to get to another panorama or fight scenes. Basically 'travel- talk- boom!- fight- travel- talk- boom!- fight'. There are no space between scenes or conversations to take in what happened.
Plus the treasure hunting in the movie is a bit forced, They get to a place, spend minimal time searching, and instantly found the next clue, and repeat.
In comparison to other DCEU movies, fight sequences and visuals are on par or even better, but the writing is just not that good.",8,3,6,19 December 2018
