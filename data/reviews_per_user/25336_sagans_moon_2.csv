Deja Vu," Such a waste of an interesting idea.
","Had this film script landed on the desk of any other producer but Jerry Bruckheimer's, this could have been a great sci-fi action film. Twists, turns and interesting concepts abound. It could have been amazing.However, as it is, the movie is reduced to this: things go boom - a lot, women are there to be leered at in the shower by a room full of meatheads or to pray over bowls of soup (thus showing what 'good' girls they are), cars go fast, men do actiony things and talk tough, guns go off and then, just for a change, things explode.Honestly, Denzel Washington and Jim Caviezel are about as wasted in this boof-headed romp as two actors can be. Both are far better than this swill. I can only hope they were paid handsomely.",3,1,3,5 May 2012
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Brilliant Fun!
","Most people look at this film all wrong.Instead of trying to see it as High Art, accept it for what it is: High Camp.Gary Oldman chews up the scenery with magnificent aplomb - He's such value for money in every scene. Winona is lovely to look at and manages to not bump into the furniture (bless). Sadie Frost tries to ham it up while being overshadowed by the most hideous bridal gown know to creation. Anthony Hopkins, Richard E Grant and Tom Waite seem to be simultaneously confused, embarrassed and over-stimulated by what they're doing. And then, of course, there's Keanu: beautiful to look at and understated as ever. You know, I love this guy. Sure, people say his accent was a bit dodgy and he was miscast, but who cares? He's no worse than Winona (bless) and infinitely more fun.One to be enjoyed in the spirit it was intended.",10,1,7,17 January 2010
