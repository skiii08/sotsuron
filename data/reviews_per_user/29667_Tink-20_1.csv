Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A menace
","I was totally disappointed with this movie, as I had heard so many good things about it. Even with two of my favourite actors (Neeson, McGregor) starring in it, I couldn't even finish watching the movie.  Sure the effects were dazzling, but the script and acting were pathetic.  There was no character building at all - it seemed that more emphasis was placed on the special effects. What a waste - this movie had so much potential, but it was all lost out to the big special effects.",1,1,2,4 April 2000
