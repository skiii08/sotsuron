Ford v Ferrari," For car lovers
","Top executed movie for car lovers having all the race scenes that Rush was missing. Make sure to watch it in top quality cinema - you won't regret it.
Also great acting - Matt Daemon and Christian Bale really is a good match of chemistry. Some great scenes from the guy playing Henry Ford II.
All in all perfectly executed movie.",8,1,10,13 November 2019
Quantum of Solace," Even less charm and shaky cam, sigh......
","I am one of the few, who didn't like Casino Royal overly much. The action sequences were great and Daniel Craig surprised me positively, but in my opinion it lacked the charm that I usually expect and love in a James Bond movie. That being said Quantum of Solace went to the worse. Even more action compared to Casino Royale, which left almost no space for Bond charm, and with a great sigh I can say that the shaky cam now has entered the bond-movies as well :-/ The first two action scenes in the movie, which could have been cool, where more or less destroyed by a ridiculous overdone shaky cam that at times made it impossible to see, who was chasing who. It reminded me all to much of the second Bourne film that in my opinion also was destroyed on the same grounds. So my recommendation would be: see the movie, when it is released on DVD and make sure to comment on the shaky cam, so that next time at least we will have a great action movie - even if it doesn't have that much to do with the Bond-movies we used to know.",5,40,78,4 November 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," What a waste of a great film....
","This could have been one of the best follow-ups in action-thriller genre, I have seen in a long time. Great story, great scenes, and then a f.... up camera! :-(Paul Greengrass must have been inspired by the danish dogme-directors or something, since almost every shot was made by a guy running along Daemon with a hand-held camera. The result being brilliant action scenes, where you spent most of the time trying to get a bearing instead of enjoying the filming.I would wish for two version DVD-edition of this movies: one with the dogme-camera and one without. But this being an unrealistic wish, I will just hope for this being the last great movie ruined by a f.... up camera!6/10 instead of 8/10",7,0,1,24 August 2004
