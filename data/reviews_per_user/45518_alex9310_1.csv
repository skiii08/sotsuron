Sucker Punch," After The Spartans And The Superheroes Come The Strippers
","I would like to start my review emphasizing on the main idea of the film. There isn't the hackneyed impact between good and evil. It is about the material and spiritual world, which finds place in more and more movies. The storyline can't be compared with the Christopher Noan's 'Inception', but the mind-blowing special Fx and the attractive actresses are assuring that many people would go to the cinema to watch 'Sucker Punch'. I don't really like movies which main purpose is only money-making. But don't worry because behind that mask with pretty girls and gunshots lies the profound sense of the movie which direct its questions straight to the viewer.You can see the typical cinematography that Zack Snyder uses with variations when Babydoll and the other girls are fighting with the huge samurais or the merciless monster hordes. Referring to the 'levels' in Babydoll's fantasy I choose the one with the three samurais as the best one. The mysterious temple and the over-sized warriors are bringing back my memories when i used to play video games. The costumes in the reality and in the imaginary world are also magnificent. The acting isn't the best part of the movie. Carla Gugino makes very impressive performance playing Dr. Gorski and the viewers will definitely remember her speaking.Comparing with '300' and 'Watchmen' 'Sucker punch' is more commercially orientated. If you don't like the plot the fascinating characters and the spectacular battles will certainly erase the disappointment from the story. I like this movie and i recommend it to everybody who wants to break up with the reality and feel the sucker punch.",7,9,17,30 March 2011
