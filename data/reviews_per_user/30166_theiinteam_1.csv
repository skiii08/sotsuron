Marie Antoinette," Did exactly what it set out to do and worked marvellously.!!
","This film like all Sofia Coppola films so far has inspired a lot of debate, even in groups of friends that go to see it together. All well made films should I feel, in the same way that art, music, and literature should do.Anyhow without going into too much details. Everything that people are saying is brilliant about the film is there, and everything that people are saying is bad about the film is there too. Mostly because they are the same thing. Its not a film about history. It is a study of a young girl/woman lost and sucked into a culture that is both creative and destructive.As with all Sofia Copploa films you will either love or hate this film. There is not much more to say really.",9,2,5,25 October 2006
