Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat was such a funny movie......NOT!
","All I hear is people talking about Borat and telling me to see it, it's so funny. So I finally watched it. The beginning was a bit slow. However, this whole movie in a nutshell is a man from Kazakhstan named Borat going to America to film a documentary - and this movie is his documentary. Borat does some very awkward things like kissing men on the cheeks when greeting, talking about how he had sex with his mother-in-law, etc. This movie starts to kick off while Borat is in his hotel room he watches an episode of Baywatch and wants to marry Pamela Anderson so he goes on a journey to California to meet her. I chuckled at a few things throughout the movie but there was nothing spectacular. Best part of the movie was the ending when Borat tries to capture Pamela Anderson in his custom bag. I must mention the scene where Borat and his obese friend is naked, wrestling in their hotel room is beyond disgusting and I would not want to watch this film because of this scene, I do not want to see 2 men wrestle with some fat guys balls in another man's face. I just can't see myself watching the film again. I give it a 3 because there were a few things that made me chuckle, but nothing memorable.",3,2,5,25 May 2007
Deja Vu," decent movie, but time travel is what makes the movie illogical
","The first hour of the movie was extremely slow, but everything starts to come in place after that. The only thing I disliked about this movie is that it relies on Time Travel. There are many time paradoxes in the film that will make people very confused. The whole movie is basically about a terrorist blowing a ship up. One of the detectives tries to find out who does it and discovers that one of the dead bodies was killed and planted on the ship to make it seem like she was blown up. There is a big machine in which they can 'see 4 days in the past' a live streaming video. Doug finds all the clues by looking into the past then decides to get sent to the past to save the woman, so he gets sent to the past and saves her but he dies himself although he still appears at the end of the movie because he was alive in the first place. Confused? I thought so. My head hurts just thinking of all the plot-holes and time paradoxes this movie has but it's just a movie after all... it's not real, so I am not going to ponder all the flaws in the movie.",5,1,3,26 May 2007
The Notebook," A little bit short of Amazing.
","This movie kind of reminds me of Romeo & Juliet. It pretty much has the same plot. The typical couple where Allie is on summer vacation and meets her love, Noah. Allie's parents don't approve of her love because he's poor and whatnot. It seems as if Noah and Allie have an unconditional love for one another. Until one night Noah and Allie get into a fight because she didn't tell him that she was moving to New York for College. They say they want to break up but they know that it's just another fight and they will reconcile until both find out that Allie is moving back home the very next day. Noah writes her every day for a year, but Allie never gets the letters due to her mother keeping it from her. Allie goes onto become a Nurse where Noah goes into the army, when Noah comes back he finds that his father sold the house and got him a loan so he can purchase his dream house which he promised Allie that he would re-build. Allie meets a wounded soldier who asks her out on a date, they fall in love and he ends up asking her to marry him. One day Allie sees in the newspaper that Noah and Her 'dream house' has been re-built and she decides to visit him. Both Noah and Allie reconcile and now Allie has to decide who she wants to be with. The thing that I didn't like about this movie was this whole movie was a story being told my Old Noah to Old Allie at a retirement home. Near the end we want to know who Allie chose, Noah or Lon and this is when the viewer (us) finds out that the old man telling the story all along was Noah and the old lady was Allie. This was HORRIBLE in my opinion because it shows no footage of WHAT Allie did and HOW she ended up making her decision. It just showed her saying she loves her soon to be husband and next thing we know she shows up at Noah's house with her suitcase. Then the last 10 minutes of the movie is Old Noah and Old Allie dancing and Old Allie who now has some mental disorders ends up having some panic attack, it was just a mess of an ending. Anyway the way it ends is Old Noah and Old Allie die in the bed together, credits roll. This movie was a 10 the whole way until the awful ending, which in conclusion I give an 8. Would've been an AWESOME movie if it didn't end in a result of a story being told and just played out as a movie.",8,0,1,19 May 2007
The Illusionist," I liked it for what it was.
","This was a decent movie a romance film with a great suspense. I found out about this movie after being recommended to it after enjoying 'The Prestige'. I can't say that one is better than the other since both have it's good and bad parts. This film however is more of a romance film whereas Prestige is more of a rivalry. I love the twist at the end of this flick and no matter how hard I kept thinking trying to solve it, it still fooled me at the end. This movie can get a bit slow at times, the whole thing is basically the Illusionist performing miracle illusions and making him seem like a person who can contact the paranormal. I think what made this movie great for me was the suspense and trying to guess what happened. Also I am a huge fan of movie with twists.",10,0,1,21 May 2007
1408," It was good.
","This movie has my approval for a PG-13 Thriller/Horror. Very creep indeed. A man stays into a room with many deaths starting from 1912. When things start getting fishy, he tries to escape but realizes that he is trapped in there. He goes through numerous obstacles the room plays on him, which seems to be all his imagination. It kind of takes him into an alternate reality. We then find out that no one enters this room and leaves alive. The phone operator tells him if he's ready to check out, he would need to hang himself. But if he's going down, he's taking the entire room with him. I definitely will be getting this one on DVD and would make a great thriller film to watch at night with friends.",8,1,2,12 July 2007
