Blade Runner 2049," Futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars.
","To be honest with the reader of this review, I had never seen the first Blade Runner however it had been near the top of my 'must- watch' science fiction movie list in my head for a very long while now and I decided to watch this movie expecting an exciting sci-fi blockbuster with action-packed car chases rolling in all over the place. Surprisingly this film was not the 'good action-packed popcorn fun for the whole family' that I was expecting and the film actually takes the slower, more patient and realistic approach with it's storytelling rather than a lot of car chases and rushed editing. This is a very similar film to the likes of A Fistful Of Dollars because the main character, Ryan Gosling, resembles the personality of Clint Eastwood's character in A Fistful Of Dollars, the musical score carries away the movie like A Fistful Of Dollars, the pacing remains slow however manages successfully to keep our interest like A Fistful Of Dollars and the film carries an incredibly dark, bleak tone much like A Fistful Of Dollars. I'm glad I saw this movie earlier than most people because then I can write a good review for this movie so that more people can consider watching it before the negative remarks start coming in. Before those come in, let me remind you that this movie is pure, bleak, raw and dark science-fiction to the core that goes with the dedication to telling a story rather than the dedication to kill as much people as possible. It goes with the more slow approach which some people may find a bad thing but others like me will find a good thing. But I think something all viewers will respect here in this movie is the intense cinematography that is common in a lot of other Denis Villeneuve movies and the fascinating special effects as well as the subtle performances by Ryan Gosling who understands the character he is playing and doesn't overdo it. Ryan Gosling's character is an interesting one because although he is emotionless and straight- forward we, as the viewers, can detect that there is more to this character and throughout the movie we slowly start to see a bit more of his own self. Blade Runner 2049 focuses mostly on the main character and if you are going to see this movie expecting Harrison Ford to have a lot of screen time that is similar to the length of Ryan Gosling's screen time, you're very wrong because Harrison Ford only plays a minor role in this movie which is, although important, not the main focus of the movie. Even if someone can view this movie as a science-fiction movie, someone can also view this movie as a character piece instead depending on their preference because of how much dedicated focus is on the main character.When the movie was finished and all was done, despite the reasonably long runtime I still felt that the movie should of been even longer. Because I don't like to be sentimental I gave myself thirty seconds and then I got up from my chair and walked out as the credits rolled despite me still being in a very deep emotional zone however I want you to know that the emotional zone was almost impossible to get out of. As I was walking out I still saw a person watching the credits in his chair and I understood that he was also in a very deep emotional state and people usually do that so that they look cool to their friends, but the person I saw really was in an emotional zone - I could tell. I could also tell that I wasn't the only one that enjoyed this movie in the room and I was relieved because I was a bit afraid that people wouldn't like it because of it's more slower approach than other science-fiction movies. I was incredibly glad that someone else understood the style of the movie.I'm not going to spoil any more of the movie but I will leave a last note to say that Blade Runner 2049 is an incredibly dark and intense movie that is probably one of the best science-fiction movies I've seen that has been made in the last five years so it very much is a masterpiece. If a futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars sounds bloody good to you, then you'd be killing yourself if you didn't pay this movie a visit at your nearest cinema. In my personal opinion, the film was most definitely a masterpiece and it has me even more excited for seeing the original starring Harrison Ford in the main role.",10,110,258,4 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Excellent film making that blends nostalgia and originality in one huge mix
","Okay, I will admit it, the first hour of of this movie had bad pacing. We kept cutting to this character, then that character, and such and such...but after the first hour of this, this movie became a near masterpiece. Every time you see Darth Vader on the screen, your mouth will be gaping open, gasping for breath. Even if he barely has any screen time, he makes up for it, and brings us some of the best Darth Vader scenes to date. Not only that, but the special effects and cinematography are absolutely stunning. The visual effects blew me away, without making it look like it had too much CGI.The last ten minutes, however, was the best part in the film. Visually stunning and emotionally felt, the last ten minutes is what really made me give it a 10/10. The last ten minutes was pure masterful filmmaking, I can guarantee you that. Go see it. You will not regret it.9.7/10.",10,3,9,23 December 2016
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Not good enough.
","Sure, the special effects are pretty good, but you expect that, considering the massive budget. But, most of the rest of the film is not. The tone of this movie completely ruins the style of the book, and instead uses the tone of an average blockbuster action movie. One big problem that changes the tone is the soundtrack. We get an unmemorable soundtrack that is over the top, clichéd, loud, blaring and simply annoying. They also overuse the soundtrack. There is basically an unmemorable, over the top, clichéd, loud blaring, annoying song every two minutes. It also affects the flow of the movie.Another thing that this movie fails at is character development. This film has close to none, and you don't really care for the characters because of that. In fact, I wanted Peter, Edmund and Lucy to get killed off by the White Witch, just to finish the tortuous movie.This movie also tries too hard to be dark and scary, but fails miserably. You do not understand the pain and suffering of Narnia in this film, because the filmmakers do not care to put in enough depth and character development for us to care. So, the director says, 'Don't worry, we'll get great reviews! We'll just add a bit of awesome special effects here and there!'But...I thought the White Witch in this film was quite good. The acting from her was decent, and the makeup and costume was up to standard. I didn't mind most of the casting, but I didn't like the casting of Lucy, as I thought her acting skills were a bit off. But it wasn't too bad. Overall, if you don't mind a badly paced, clichéd, loud action packed movie, you may like this. But if you're looking for a good film, I suggest you stay away. The metascore is a joke, however. 4.3/10.",4,0,0,5 February 2017
The Notebook," Make it stop, make it stooooop!
","This overly dramatic, soppy, STUPID film is driving me mad with rage! This film should have a warning at the start, saying WARNING! THIS OVERLY SOPPY FILM WILL MAKE YOU KILL YOURSELF! Jesus Christ, this movie was HORRIBLE!Okay, now that I've gone and had a mental breakdown because of how badly overrated this film is, I've had a talk with my psychiatrist. She said that I am experiencing a thing called 'not following the crowd,' and that I'm going a little 'mad with rage' over how bad the film was. She has spoken to me, and we have finally decided to put a stop to the wrong crowd of people from viewing this.I would of rated this film a one if it didn't have a sort of crowd that some people like. It's a soppy romantic drama like The Vow, Dear John and those other crappy films, and those crappy soppy films have a crowd that I just can't understand. The movie (if it can even be entitled as one) is a film with over-the-top emotional music, over-the-top sadness, over-the-top...everything.I think that this film has one of the worst romance plots I've ever seen in film. Yeah, these two are in love! Yippity yay, how sad, BOOOOORING!Overall, if you like romantic dramas, you will enjoy this, but if you don't, STAY AWAY! STEER BLOODY CLEAR! My personal opinion is 0/10, but for the wide range of audience, I give it a 6.1/10.",Null,3,5,1 April 2017
Wanted," Entertaining action-packed extravaganza.
","I enjoyed this film and I almost got as far as calling this the perfect action film as I was typing the summary of my review because of how the movie includes everything that an action film fan hungers on. When action fans watch basic action movies they are commonly left unsatisfied with the movie because of how it is exactly the same as the last action film they watched and how those are usually missing the ingredients that they want in their steak and instead just rely on grease. Action films want bones in their steak, and what this film fully succeeds in is giving us the brutality of bones in our steak instead of overdosing on the cheesiness of grease. The film still has a bit of grease but it is enjoyable grease: the brutality of the violence is created intentionally over the top and is used as an advantage for some dark humoured laughs. This means that although we still have the cheesiness of a normal action movie it serves as a proper ingredient that mixes well with the brutality in it, and instead of just relying on cheap, recycled and cliché explosions it relies on bringing us some hilarious scenes of brutal, bloody, gory torture, and the mean- spirited cheesiness of this is what every action film fan lusts for. If you are one of those die- hard action film fans then this better get on your watchlist or you will be surely missing out.",10,1,4,26 August 2017
Monsters vs. Aliens," Worse than expected
","*SPOILERS*I'm so, so sorry, but I think my expectations went a bit too high for this film. Reese Witherspoon, that unfunny actress that acted in Legally Blonde and Legally Blonde 2 comes and acts in Monsters VS Aliens, a movie that sounds like it will be tons of fun and will have heaps of laughs and (family) action scenes. Boy, was I wrong. Only a couple of scenes of action were in this movie. But that was not the bad part. The reason that this film is so utterly bad is because the 'jokes' aren't even jokes! I think I just found out how to give people cancer, and that's to watch this movie! The film makers did an awful job with the jokes and quotes, and the storyline was terrible, plus it didn't even have enough action to entertain us through this horrible animated family comedy. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of family comedies. I also like a lot of family actions. Although this had more action then most family animated films, it had less laughs than most family animated films! Let me start off with how the movie starts.The movie starts off with a woman (Reese Witherspoon) in a relationship with a man, and she gets struck with a meteorite that turns her into a giant. Reese Witherspoon is then stuck into a top secret government facility with MONSTERS...that have terrible quote lines. Hip hip, hooray. So, meanwhile, in deep space, Gallaxhar the purple alien sends ...let's say something to find an energy source on earth. But of course, it has to land in America, doesn't it? It wouldn't be an action film then! So, the fictional president makes contact with the something, and the something goes and has a party at San Francisco. Yes, I know. Terrifying.The top secret facility lets out the monsters that tell horrible jokes out of the prison of unfunny monsters so they can destroy the something. So, they kill the something. Then an alien comes and so on...I won't tell the rest of the story, just in case you do watch it. However, I recommend you don't watch this movie unless you are going to watch it with your kids. Your kids will love it, however, you probably won't. 4.4/10!",4,1,3,27 March 2016
Frozen," This is almost as bad as Foodfight.
","They haven't made much animated musicals in the 21st century, so Disney said, 'Hey, let's do one!' I'm sure one curious little boy would say, 'But, but, even with music, will it still be good?' Walt Disney (now as a skeleton), will then say 'Of course it will be! There hasn't been much Disney musicals since I died!' The little boy would then say 'But what if the story isn't any good?!' Walt Disney would then say, 'Screw off, kid, it's a musical! It'll get great reviews!'Walt Disney was right.The other thing that could of happened is that Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee visited Walt Disney's grave, and they asked him, 'Hey can we make a musical with no good story?' Walt Disney, tossing and turning in his grave, would then say, 'Not unless the story is good!' Chris and Jennifer, exchanging glances, then say, 'But it's a musical! It'll get GREAT reviews!'Chris and Jennifer were right.Is there anything special about this film, apart from it's musical numbers? And, in fact, to be honest, the musical numbers were bloody annoying. I've heard enough of these stupid Frozen songs playing in our malls, and it's all thanks to this film. If you like to cuddle Olaf in the shopping mall, or if you like singing Let It Go, you'll like this crap film. If you have any slight taste in film, I'm sure you'll hate this. 0.9/10, should be in the IMDb Bottom 100.",1,6,14,1 April 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An emotional, dream-like movie that never feels excessively soppy with an incredibly subtle performance by Jim Carrey.
","When people ask other people what Jim Carrey's best acting performance is, people usually light up and say, 'The Truman Show!' Although I would say that he gave a good performance in The Truman Show, in my opinion I think that he gives a much better performance in this movie, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Although this opinion definitely isn't everyone's, I think that this is Jim Carrey's best performance because he goes out of his daily routine as an actor that works in comedy and stand-up and usually he acts in his films with the same personality which is undeniably a humorous one. But with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Jim Carrey goes out of his routine and gives us a subtle, grief-causing performance that is entirely the opposite of his usual personality and yet it still feels natural as if it were his usual personality. In this film I saw a lot of serious acting talent shine through him that I had never seen him show before and if you're like me and enjoy seeing actors be in a different, unusual personality that they usually aren't in I think you'll enjoy this too.Another reason why you may enjoy this movie is because of it's dream-like surrealism. There are so many psychological tricks in this film that make the film feel like an incoherent dream such as the disjointed editing, the unnatural situations and the emotionally dreamy soundtrack. Also, you know how when you dream you can be doing something in one room and the next minute be in a completely different building? I thought I was the only one, but here Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind captures this fully in a movie and letting us transform into frankly a hallucinatory drug trip. If you're like me and enjoy the weirdness of dreaming I think you'll enjoy this too.What are you waiting for? An emotional, devastating, honest movie that feels like a dream with wonderful performances from the entire cast and interesting, realistic characters as a sidedish. If this sounds good to you, then please, do give this a watch!",10,1,1,23 September 2017
The World's Fastest Indian," Subtle and honest.
","This is not just another sports film. The World's Fastest Indian, starred by Anthony Hopkins, contains subtle emotion from the main character, Burt Munro, with honest and hidden emotion that never pretends to be something it isn't. That's what makes this movie so good; most films tend to breakdown into faked hysterics, but this gem actually knows real emotion to carry audiences with them. The film contains some extremely tense moments as well as a subtle yet realistic performance by Anthony Hopkins who remains completely convincing throughout the film and who remains never falling out of the character he is playing. The film also contains some good cinematography, good editing to subtly transition the scenes together and a direction cleverly controlled by the right hands, Roger Donaldson's. I suggest you give this a watch!",10,1,2,24 July 2017
The Untouchables," Honourable flashback to the classic film-noirs from the 30's to the 60's.
","If you are like me and like a good film-noir or two then I recommend you watch this film which plays out exactly like a film-noir, with camera work, angles, lighting and editing all perfectly suiting the polished and straight-forward style of the genre. The Untouchables is a movie that contains clichés from the genre but uses them to it's own intentional advantage and if this film were in black-and- white I would of believed that it truly was a movie brilliantly created around the 40's. Some do not like style over substance and that's okay, but in order to warn some viewers I will state that this is more of a visual feat in terms of experience, but myself I don't necessarily consider style over substance a bad thing and I have actually created a strong respect for films simply having good cinematography and editing. The editing flows the film all together in the traditional film-noir manner, comprehending the film into an understandable experience and never losing grip of it's tone because of the good editing. Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Robert De Niro star as the main characters and all deliver performances worthy of the film, both expressing their characters realistically and in a style fully according to the film-noir genre. If this all sounds good to you, then why not give it a watch?",10,7,10,13 August 2017
Love Actually," Love is Actually quite good!
","Great movie, and well deserving of the 7.7/10 rating on IMDb. There is no main character in this, but every story still feels like it is in one big combined story. I actually was hoping I would agree with the critics on Rotten Tomatoes, because I don't like to be accused of liking bad films. But, I really enjoyed this film, besides the flaws. Maybe I am too dumb to understand, but I felt the critics were overreacting. This movie, was a really good movie, that blends romance, British humour and (some) Christmas spirit. Well, okay, maybe not much, but it spreads cheer for sure. There are some jokes that may offend sensitive viewers in this movie, but if you can put up with them, you will find a really good movie. Love Actually, SHOULD be all around us, on every single television screen at Christmas time. Great movie. Overall, the IMDb rating is best suited. Go watch it, you will not regret it. Plus, the last ten minutes...that was pure delightful movie making. I think I fell in love with Love Actually.",8,0,1,23 December 2016
American Gangster," Okay.
","Denzel Washington delivers a strong performance in this otherwise underwhelming movie that fails expectations due to bad cinematography, hyperactive pacing and rushed editing. The scenes feel disjointed and just feel like they have been clustered together, while the cinematography continues shaking the screen as you become dizzy while to attempt to pay attention to the film. Now that we got that out of the way the acting and dialogue remain strong in their form as they shadow the cons of the film and stand tall, as well as the script and interesting true story the film's based on. Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington both share their perspectives of the scenario happening and the film delivers the audience a two-sided coin that is tossed in the air on the occasions. This film could of been good because of these pros, but I just thought that those cons somehow pushed into the viewing experience, therefore ruining it, which is why I give this a 6.3/10. It was sad, really; I really wanted to like this. Oh well.",6,1,4,27 June 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Great special effects with no decent story makes Kong; Skull Island a dull movie.
","Spoiler free!Let me start off first by saying that I didn't actually like the look of this film in the first place. It looked like cheap garbage, even if the action scenes looked good. It looked as if it was going to be something like the Clash Of The Titans remake. I scrolled down to the comments of the trailer on YouTube, and I was actually surprised to see the positive feedback for the film. I said, 'Oh, alright,' because I could semi-understand that there was a particular taste toward the type of film they were going for in the trailer. I didn't think it looked that great, because it wasn't my cup of tea. I thought that a loud movie with loud guns was not good enough for my standard of a good film. I think the big point of why that was such a strong opinion for me though is because the 1933 King Kong movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. Same goes to the 2005 one, which was a loud film with loud guns and in a different style with the original, but the director still knew how to keep it as a stable good film, letting it flow well with great pacing and good acting, along with memorable scenes that weren't in the 1933 one. Kong: Skull Island, however, felt that it would be rushed and rather cliché, and not really my idea of a good film.I watched the film, and I have to say, it just wasn't my taste. It seemed too loud and unoriginal, with forced humor that didn't get even a snicker out of me. The audience I was in the cinema with, however, found the film to be very pleasing, and laughed along with the forced humor, so maybe I just wasn't getting the film? It had no memorable scenes, no good direction for where it was going, and ended up as another cliché blockbuster action movie in my opinion. Of course, as I can clearly see, most people like that sort of film, so I can clearly classify myself as no sheep, and admit that even if it isn't my taste, it's plenty of other people's taste.So, I found it to be a dull movie with nothing new. If you, like me, only like loud movies with loud guns if they have a substance to it, then I'd say you'd dislike this film. If you are the normal person who loves movies with big, epic action scenes with tons of CGI and loud blockbuster music, then this should be right up your alley. Overall, I rate this a 5.4/10 for the average rating, however, if it were my personal opinion to rate, I'd rate the film a 3.9/10. If you loved the look of the trailer, though, you'll get exactly what you expect, and probably have a good time.",5,3,7,11 March 2017
Ray," Taylor Hackford's stylish depiction on the life of Ray Charles with a dedicated performance by Jamie Foxx.
","The movie Ray was an incredibly big critical hit in 2004 and earned a spot in film history as the first African-American biopic to be nominated for 6 Academy Awards and in my opinion rightfully the movie truly earned those Academy Award nominations simply for the stunning editing techniques. This film is a biographical film that is based on the real-life blind musician Ray Charles and his successes and downfalls that also revolves around the wicked, self- indulgent effect that fame can have and how it causes his social life to quietly fall down a hole. The fact that the film deals with the cause of fame means that it is very honest, realistic and confronting in my opinion because of how some people are naive to the consequences of being famous. The message of this is also carried along in a very well made flow throughout the development of the film as we get to know Ray Charles and his past and we get to know some of Ray Charles's inner demons that show us that even the most perfect people can have flaws. The film itself is very well made purely because of the even pacing, exciting editing and ear- pleasing music, and with all that a dedicated performance by Jamie Foxx is given to execute it. This will probably be one of the more exciting biopics you will see in your life, so why not give this a watch?",10,1,4,19 August 2017
The Blind Side," A 'feel good,' TV-ish, cliché sports film with Sandra Bullock.
","It's a cliché sports film, with Sandra Bullock.In case you didn't hear me right, this is a cliché sports film, with Sandra Bullock.Those words can let you decide whether or not you want to see this film or not. It's not a bad film because it's got Sandra Bullock in it, it's just a bad film because it's a cliché sports film with Sandra Bullock.Yep, you heard me right. A 'feel good,' TV-ish, cliché sports film with Sandra Bullock.In case you didn't hear me right, I will repeat what I said again.

Wonder Woman," Emotional and well-directed, this visual feast shows us the true horrors of war.
","Wonder Woman is truly a wonder with real emotion, fantastic action sequences and stable structure, altogether satisfying in one big, great bundle. The film shows Wonder Woman, an Amazon who wants to stop the Great War between mankind, and on the way she witnesses the true mankind, along with the sheer horror of war. The first twenty minutes are a bit uneven as they introduce Wonder Woman and the island she was born on, and as they witness mankind approach them, but after all that the film is completely steady and knows when to pull the heart- strings, and the emotion is never forced or sentimental, but pure truthful. That's what makes this film so good, is that we see the war and we see Wonder Woman's heart-ache as she watches people die right before her, and we feel her heart-ache as well while Wonder Woman wonders, 'Why don't we do more?' I don't think this film deserves 10/10 because the film's first twenty minutes was uneven, like I said before, and that there was a bit too much CGI in the action sequences. Despite that, this film succeeds in style and substance as we watch her in slow-motion defeating the opponents like the warrior she is. You can definitely tell that this film was directed by Patty Jenkins, as this film is subtly talented behind all those action sequences we watch. The action sequences are a bit extreme, yes. But if you look beyond those action sequences, you see a good film, one that will be remembered for the years to come. In the future, you'll talk about how you saw this film, and how it was like to witness it at the cinema. It's really that good.But, of course, the film has it's cons, which I stated before. The reason why I'm stating this again is because the cons may get in the way of your viewing experience and disrupt the good. I don't want that to happen. If you can look away from those cons that stick out like a sore thumb, you'll absolutely love it, but those cons may just be a sharp stab in the back for the less tolerable. If you are completely difficult to satisfy when it comes to film, then I recommend not watching this. Otherwise, I'm sure you'll have a blast and a thought-provoking experience at the same time as we watch moral and the true meaning of human. 8.2/10.",8,7,16,6 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A great film that should of been called Batman And Superman: Dawn Of Justice
","First off, I just want to let people know that most people usually complained about usually such little things in the film that could of been easily ignored in their reviews, and it was a bit sad, because those little things were being used so the critics could rip the movie to shreds. However, if you ignore all the small flaws, you find that you will probably enjoy this movie a LOT. The action scenes are great, the plot was quite good too and the actors were a good choice (in my opinion). A lot of people will not agree with my opinion, but that doesn't mean that this review wasn't helpful to you, so please don't click that just because you disagree with this review. So, let's have a little talk about what other critics have been thinking about the film, and the negativity that I agree with, and the negativity that I (mostly) disagree with. Let's get started.A few people thought that Wonder Woman was in the film for too long and that she didn't need to be in it that long. Myself, I completely disagree with that. She was barely in the film for 15 minutes (I think), and it wasn't really something to complain about. Wonder Woman may of not of been a necessary character, but she was pretty bad ass, and I actually kinda wanted her to be in it more. But, lots disagree with that. So, it's absolutely fine if you disagree. But anyway, Wonder Woman was a very good character in the film, and in my opinion I think she should of been in the movie for a bit longer. Another silly thing that people complained about was that the movie was too dark. This is, in no way, a small flaw. It was also called 'humorless' and 'way too serious.' Myself, I really like dark movies, and I really enjoyed this film because it was dark. No, it's not all bright and happy like most superhero movies, but it's at least as good as some. In my opinion, this is one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen, and most flaws could be easily ignored. However, a lot will disagree. But really, the film being too dark? That isn't a good enough reason to hate a movie, that's just a good enough reason to know how much of a wuss you are. You need to watch darker movies if you find this movie dark, because this is barely dark at all. Even if it is dark for a superhero movie, it's as dark as the trailers are. So, if you don't like the look of the trailers, don't go and watch this expecting a masterpiece. If you like dark movies, or if you can handle them, you'll then enjoy this movie. Still not sure? Keep reading.Now here's one thing that people were complaining about in the film that should of been complained about: Batman didn't have a good enough reason to hate Superman. That is true, and it really did bug me in the film. Batman pretty much wanted to kill innocent people and then kill Superman just because he was saving the city and doing his job. Although I prefer Batman than Superman usually, I kind of rooted for Superman in this film, because Zack Snyder did a brilliant job of making us support Superman in the film. I mean, a great job. I think we were supposed to think of Superman as the good guy, because that's probably why Batman didn't have a good reason to be angry at Superman, and that would make us root for Superman. The film definitely made me root for Superman, and even if it wasn't a good enough reason to hate Superman, it was a great way to make us root for who Zack Snyder probably wanted us to root for.Another thing that people complained about was because the film wasn't really a Batman VS Superman film. Yes, that is definitely correct. However, even if it isn't a Batman VS Superman film, it's a great Batman And Superman film, and it's a great prequel to the two Justice League films coming out soon. Also, if I haven't told you yet, this is a sequel to the film Man Of Steel, which was also a great film. The only flaw in the film Man Of Steel was that it could be a bit slower, but otherwise, I'd rate Man of Steel 8.1/10! But I am right now talking about this film, aren't I? Mhm, but do make sure you go watch Man Of Steel first before you go watch this movie, because this is basically a sequel. And I imagine the Justice League films will basically be sequels to this movie too. So, I guess what I am trying to say is that this film is criticized for stupid reasons. No, this isn't Batman VS Superman, but it is a great prequel to the upcoming Justice League films, and also a great sequel to Man Of Steel. I recommend you go watch Man Of Steel before you watch this film though, as it will explain a bit of the start of the film.Overall, I think this film is very underrated review wise. Lots of reviews criticize this film for weird reasons, even though those reasons can be easily ignored. So far, the only flaws in my opinion in this film was that it could be a bit slower paced, and Batman could have a better reason to hate Superman. But that's pretty much the only things I dislike about this film. Overall, I rate this a 7.8/10!",8,3,9,23 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," If you liked the prequels, you'll find this movie decent
","As I enjoyed the prequels to the Star Wars movies, I didn't hesitate on going to see this in the cinema, despite some others saying it was too colorful and plain Disney, should we say. Well, to be perfectly honest, yes, this was very colorful, bright, and not dark in the slightest. It's got humour and a lot of moments that may stick in your mind, and the movie went well with popcorn. Does that sound good? Well, it depends. This movie is unrealistically happy and obviously made by Disney, which I really didn't like about the film. However, I walked out of the cinema, enjoying it anyway. Is it better than the prequels? No, it isn't. Is it better than the original trilogy? Of course not. However, if you don't consider this a Star Wars movie, you'll be pleasantly surprised. You'll like this even more if you enjoyed the prequel trilogy. However, if you hated the prequels with a passion, you'll think this movie is the worst movie ever made. So, yes, I did enjoy the movie. That's only because I LOVED all first 6 movies, though. Please, if you go to see this movie, don't expect a nostalgic throwback to Empire Strikes Back. Expect The Phantom Menace sort of story with good special effects and a whiny teenage villain. It may sound a bad movie, but it isn't if you aren't too fussy about your movies. Of course, though, if this is a Star Wars movie, you probably will be a bit picky on it. So, don't go to see this movie if you're expecting a masterpiece. Just pop some popcorn and enjoy a kinda forgettable movie with some unforgettable moments in it. I hope this review was useful, and I do plan on making this review longer to explain a bit more on my review. Also, sorry for repeating a lot of things in my review, but it's so hard to write 10 lines in a review when you aren't exactly passionate about the movie, or if you have a passionate hate on it. I thought that this movie was good, however you need to know what you're going to watch first. It's basically the average 21st Century blockbuster with loads of clichés. I hope this review was useful to you.",10,1,16,4 July 2016
The Truman Show," Amusingly subtle comedy that parodies TV shows.
","The Truman Show is one of Jim Carrey's most successful comedy films along with Dumb And Dumber, The Mask, Ace Ventura and Liar Liar, however this movie is the most well received by the film critics and earning an 8.1/10 on IMDb and a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes (as well as a 90 on Metascore but nobody gives a damn about Metascore). So it's no wonder that some people are still thinking about watching the movie and reading reviews, and one of those people used to be me once, and I'm surprised you're reading my reviews out of all the ones. I'm glad you're reading this, and I'll try to give you the best effort for a review possible so you can see whether you'd like this movie or not.The Truman Show can be interpreted as a basic comedy movie to pass time by some but it can also be interpreted as a misunderstood masterpiece because of the specializing in cinematography, subtlety and wittiness in the subject of TV shows. In reality TV shows, people like Truman live in them for basically the entirety of their lives and the only difference is that they are fully aware that they have been living in one while Truman is completely unaware. However, Truman begins to gain suspicion after strange events happen and he begins to suspect things while we, as the viewer, are completely aware that the strange events are because of the fact that he is in a TV show. As usual, Jim Carrey brings his humorous characteristics as he reacts to these strange situations such as product placement, coincidental happenings and bad luck and we, as the viewer, are amused when we watch him in these situations because we know he is in a TV show. While these situations are funny they are actually very thought-provoking and they may question your life itself and how the process of Reality TV Shows work and whether or not the actors in Coronation Street are like Truman - except that they are self-aware of it being a TV Show. We then watch these TV Shows with heaps of effort and we enjoy them, however are we really to care of the impact of TV Shows? After an episode we just flick it onto another channel until dinner is ready.Still not sure whether you will like this or not? Well, if you are a big fan of Jim Carrey's outrageous but intelligent humour then I think you will enjoy this movie. While this is a lot more subtle and thought-provoking in terms of humour than Jim Carrey's previous comedies, it still sticks to the humour we know and love from Jim Carrey however on a lower volume than it is usually played. If you are a fan of thought-provoking, cynical satires then I think you will enjoy this film as well. If you are a fan of good cinematography techniques then I think you'll enjoy analyzing this film. If you simply want to watch a good film then watch this. If you are not a fan of Jim Carrey, satire, cinematography or good films then this film is not for you. Simply put, this film is a comedic masterpiece that may be to some tastes and below others depending on the type of films you usually take interest in, but for me it was a delightful treat that just whizzed past my expectations.",10,1,1,6 September 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement prove to us that New Zealand makes great movies
","New Zealand makes a great movie...again. So far, I've only found 2 bad New Zealand movies. I think it's time we start making bad movies, New Zealand! But then again, we've made some terrible TV shows, so I guess that makes up for it...but anyway! This is a great mockumentary film that provides and guarantees great laugh-out-loud moments that will probably make you burst out on your couch laughing. This film is so good, it can be accepted as a Hollywood film set in New Zealand. This movie is great, and it is very hard not to like it. I'll keep this review short, however I will still describe a bit about how great this gem of a movie is, but I will also discuss about the flaws in the film. Let's get started on my review now, shall we?Taika Waiti has made some great movies provided, especially ones more for New Zealand viewers. However, he right now delivers a vampire comedy/mockumentary...that's set in New Zealand. It sounds bad, but believe me, it's not. This film is about three vampires called Viago, Deacon and Vladislav who are all hundreds of years old, trying to cope in real life as a normal figure. Unfortunately, that doesn't work when they're bloodsucking vampires with a thirst of blood! A documentary film crew makes a documentary about their life and how they live and adapt as vampires in the outside world and learn to cope with humans, werewolves, a wannabe vampire and paying their rent! That sounds like a great movie, doesn't it? Because, well, if it doesn't sound good, then I recommend you don't go watch it, because this is a more love-it-or-you-hate-it movie. Here's why.Although this is a great film, and I really, REALLY like it, werewolf fans may be a bit offended, because sometimes the werewolves are teased and made fun of in parts of the movie. That can be easily ignored, but still, it may offend sensitive viewers that are fans of werewolf movies. I, myself, do prefer werewolves than vampires, but the jokes didn't really bug me that much, so I'm pretty sure you'd be able to cope with them if I could. Although this didn't do great at the box office, it did go great on the review side, which is probably why they are now making a What We Do In The Shadows 2. Let's hope they don't insult werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows 2, am I right, werewolf fans?Also, let's talk about the violence in this film. This film is quite gory for a comedy. Even if most of the gory violence is done in an over the top comical matter, it may disgust some people that are eating popcorn in the film. I have seen way gorier, but if you go watching this, planning a film with barely any gore (like most New Zealand films) then you will most likely be disappointed, because this film is quite gory. But do take in mind that the violence is hilarious, too! The bit when the vampires mess up and hit the jugular is hilariously bloody, and it's a good laugh, that even if it's the goriest part in the film, it's really, really funny. If you can cope with a ton of blood spraying everywhere, I think you'll be fine and will enjoy the movie as much as I did.Okay, so I guess the review wasn't as short as I was planning, but it's still good enough to be called a review (I hope). I hope you now know whether this is your kind of movie or not, because it's definitely my kind of movie. It's fine if it's not your type, but even if it isn't, you may enjoy it anyway if you can cope with a bit of blood. This proves that New Zealand makes great films, and I do have to say, I was surprised that the rating on IMDb was lower than 8/10. Overall, I'd rate this a 8.3/10, and it also definitely deserves to be in the IMDb Top 250! 8.3/10!",10,1,2,23 April 2016
Warcraft," Great movie if you like fantasy!
","This movie was surprisingly good. After seeing the trailer, I was half expecting this movie to be terrible, however a few people on this site said that it was actually quite good. And I gotta say, after watching this I have to agree that it's pretty damn good. I have not played the video game, and I found this entertaining anyway! The special effects were good, the story was good, the action was good...pretty much the whole movie was good! It had memorable scenes and one emotional death scene, which made the movie even better. So, if you like fantasy, go watch this at the cinema if you get a chance. If you do not, you may not enjoy this movie. So, if you like fantasy, get some popcorn and enjoy this great movie! Overall, I would rate this a 8.2/10!",8,2,4,11 July 2016
The Martian," Great film that unfortunately fails an ending
","QUICK REVIEW:I liked this movie. A lot. However, when the first 2 hours of the film is good, you kind of expect the last 24 minutes to be as good, or close enough to good. Unfortunately, the movie failed an ending. But, that still doesn't make the movie bad, as this film could still become a classic, or at least a cult one. Ridley Scott brings us a brilliant film that makes you want more in this stunning movie that will capture your attention and not bore you at any scenes. This movie doesn't deserve to get a thousand Academy Awards, but it does deserve good reviews, and I don't really get what people mean when they said that they expected more. The film was very good, and barely overrated. I would of probably preferred this movie if it was just Mark's perspective and not the government's, however all things are forgiven, and as I really enjoyed this movie, I don't think I need to bother complaining about the flaws in this film. The ending was bad, but that doesn't make the film horrible! Overall, a 7.7/10!",10,0,0,27 April 2016
