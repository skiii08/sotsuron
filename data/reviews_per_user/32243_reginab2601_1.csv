It," Very disappointed
","I don't like writing reviews in English, since it's not my native language but a review to this movie must be. First of all, I'm an admirer of the book and the 1990 movie, starring Tim Curry, especially the 1st part where they are children. But although I read a lot of bad reviews, I decided to give the new 'IT' a chance and went to the cinema yesterday. I was so disappointed!!!I won't write a lot, since I don't want to spoil, but it started at the beginning, when Georgie was crawling away with a missing arm...And: a Clown doesn't get scarier, with more and more pointy teeth.So: admirers of the book and the 1st movie, don't waste your time.But there's still one chance: since the 1990s 2nd part wasn't as good as the 1st, they could do a better job here - let's wait and see and read the reviews first, before wasting money in the cinema.Just my opinion.",2,0,4,12 October 2017
