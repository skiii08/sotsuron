Sucker Punch," Really really really really bad
","Too much trouble for nothing. Caught up on CGI that the director doesn't even care about how he builds the movie. There is no storytelling or character development and basically no acting. It is so empty that it is not even a 'fun to watch' movie. Yeah has some cool fight scenes but when you watch them you ask 'for what?' The complete lack of well... pretty much anything that could make it a movie doesn't allow you to enjoy the visuals. CGI were pretty poor at times. People keep comparing it to a video game. That is not right because even video games have a backbone, a story to tell. Snyder just wanted to fit everything boys like in one never ending movie. If you can call it one.0/10",1,9,17,3 December 2011
