Despicable Me 2," Interesting
","Compared with Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2 is boring and I could predict its story line. The same as the first movie, Gru was a good father and got along well with his children. Lucy is a new character and there is no doubt that she will be a great mother in the future. Agnes was a very lovely small girl that she knew Gru pretended to be a princess in her birthday party but did not tell other kids. She wanted a mother like normal children. As for Margo, she gradually grew to be a teenager and was rebellious. She played with her phone in bed and ignored Gru's warning. Margo fell in love with a boy, which enraged Gru. The two girls' personalities in this movie are clearer. Although the story is boring, some scenes in Despicable Me 2 are really funny. El Macho's head was triangular and he wore a red mask on his head. The idea about becoming a villain is profoundly ridiculous but it seems in the movie everyone thought that becoming a villain was a big thing, which they were proud of. And the technology in the movie was so advanced that many people owned strange vehicles that could drive, fly and sail, and the mutagen made creatures crazy. There are so many interesting things in Despicable Me 2.",7,0,0,12 May 2015
Big Hero 6," Interesting
","Hiro was a thirteen-year-old kid living in San Fransokyo and a genius in inventing robots. One evening, he had a bot fight with a gangster and won the money. The gangster wanted to give him a lesson but Hiro's brother, Tadashi, saved him with a scooter. Unfortunately, Hiro was caught by the police and his aunt Cass baled him out. His brother worried about him and decided to take him to his lab at San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Hiro found many interesting friends and inventions there and also wanted to be a part of it. His brother told him to invent anything cool and gave a hand to Hiro. Afterwards, they invented brain-controlled microbots. It was a fantastic invention that made a hit on SFIT Showcase. Professor Callaghan and a rich company guy Alistair Krei both wanted to own his robot, but Hiro refused to sell his technology to Alistair Krei. He received an offer from Professor Callaghan. Suddenly, a big fire broke out and his brother died for saving Professor Callaghan, who was believed to be dead in the fire.Hiro was down for a long time. One day when he hurt his left foot and cried, Beymax activated himself and asked Hiro whether he needed health- care. Hiro refused him and wanted to deactivate Beymax. When they were pushing, Hiro found the last microbot in his pocket and Beymax thought it wanted to go somewhere. Beymax went alone to find out where it wanted to go and Hiro followed him. They stopped at a warehouse. To their surprise, someone was producing a large number of microbots. Suddenly a guy in a mask appeared and wanted to kill them. Hiro and Beymax escaped from the warehouse. At night, Hiro realized the fire was started by the guy in the mask and he stole his microbots. So Hiro militarised Beymax into a fighting robot and decided to find out who was the guy in the mask. They went to the warehouse again but he was almost killed by the guy. Luckily, four friends of his brother, Fred, Go Go, Wasabi and Honey Lemon passed by and saved him. They went to Fred's house and made the decision that they would revenge for Tadashi and Professor Callaghan. Hiro made armors for six of them. Beymax found out that the guy in the mask was on an island. The six heroes went to the island and saw a video in a secret government facility, which was about a failure of a transportation experiment. A lady disappeared in the portal. Suddenly the guy in the mask attacked them again. After difficult fighting, the six heroes were surprised to find out that the guy in the mask was Professor Callaghan. Actually Professor Callaghan's daughter was the lady who disappeared in the experiment and the experiment was managed by Alistair Krei. He wanted to kill Alistair Krei and revenge for his daughter. However Professor Callaghan did not give up after he was exposed. When the six heroes arrived at Alistair Krei's company, he was caught by Professor Callaghan. At the moment Professor Callaghan would nearly be defeated by the six heroes, he opened the portal and everything was attracted into it. Hiro and Beymax got into the portal bravely to save the lady. Unfortunately, Beymax was hit by a rock and he sacrificed himself to save Hiro and the lady. Finally, the bad guy, Professor Callaghan was caught by the police and Hiro used the chip which Beymax left for Hiro in his hand to restore Beymax.Although the storyline is common and I could predict what would happen at the end, I still like this movie. It is really interesting and fun. Specifically, Beymax is a very successful cartoon character and nowadays is popular among the public. For his appearance, white is easy to remember. Beymax is so cute that he even looks a little bit stupid, but not in the bad way. When he and Hiro needed to escape at first, he did not know what happened and just, standing there, looked at 'the big monster'. Then he used adhesive tape to fix his body in the police station. There are so many funny actions leading me to laugh. Asking Hiro whether he needed health-care makes him more successful. When they were stuck in the portal, he sacrificed himself to save Hiro and he asked if Hiro was satisfied with the health-care again. It deeply moved me.",8,62,95,19 April 2015

It would be better if it was rescheduled that the plot begins with the trip to the Paradise Fall and come back to the story between Carl and Eille.",6,0,1,1 June 2015
Despicable Me," Lovely

Gru used his freezing gun to freeze Vector when he left.Gru flew to East Asia with two minions and stole the shrink ray successfully. But on the way back home, Vector came and stole the shrink ray from Gru bringing it back to his fortress. Gru surveyed many times outside Vector's fortress but failed to get inside. One day he found three girls who sold cookies to Vector could easily get inside. He thought it would be a good chance and decided to adopt the three girls from Miss Hattie's House of Girls. He pretended to be a dentist and said something in Spanish which Miss Hattie thought meant she was beautiful. Miss Hattie was happy and gave him the girls. The girls did not like him at first because he did not look a father and was ugly. He asked Dr. Nefario to invent cookie robots and the girls to deliver them to Vector. The girls insisted they had to go to the dance class first. In the dance class, Agness gave Gru a ticket to the dance performance they would be in. After the class, Gru sent the girls to Vector's house and stole the shrink ray successfully.

After being alone with the children for some time, he began to like them.
