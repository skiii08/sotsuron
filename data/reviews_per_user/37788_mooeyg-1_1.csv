The Devil's Advocate," Worth the cost of a DVD
","I recently added this film to my small DVD collection for:  the screenplay and the performances - almost all of them.  Reeves is a little weak, but maybe that serves the purpose in the film.  He's strong in the end.  The ending has, if you browse through some of the other comments, taken a beating as a letdown or cop out.  I thought the ending was perfect.  It demonstrated that Evil has great staying power.The Old Boy turns the passage of time into a rather elaborate hallucination when he loses in the end to Reeves's exercise of free will.  Well.  Like Scarlet O'Hara said, 'Tomorrow is another day.'  It demonstrates Evil's relentless pursuit of the soul.  There will always - always - be another temptation.  So the next time around, we can assume that his crisis of conscience will be twisted and turned against him.  I was always surprised that they (read 'Hollywood') did not try to turn that into a sequel...",Null,1,2,27 December 2003
