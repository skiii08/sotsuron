Ali," So Long, Yet So Wanting (Possible Spoilers)
","Wil Smith did an admirable job of portraying Ali, as Jon Voight did as Cosell, but the story was too unfocused, trying to touch on too many aspects of Ali's life.  It touches on his life as a boxer, a husband, a Muslim, and an African-American.  While each one of these topics, in regards to Ali's life, could qualify for a movie by itself the movie does paint a decent picture of the chaos surrounding Ali's life during the ten-year period of his life featured in the film.  The movie only covers his life from his defeat of Liston to his defeat of Foreman. It briefly touches on his relationship with Malcolm X and to a greater extent with the Nation of Islam, but their isn't a lot of depth and detail. You don't really get an in depth understanding of many of the political issues underlying the motives of the Nation of Islam or how they were really using Ali to their own ends.  I think that Ali being who he was, when he was, had a great impact on the person he became and could have made into good movie material.The movie doesn't cover any of Ali's development as a fighter.  It just provides some of the highlights from some of the biggest fights of his career; none of his first professional fights, nor his Olympic experience, nor anything about how he became involved with boxing in the first place. It leaves a lot to be desired if you want to know a lot about how Ali became such an amazing boxer and the true range of opponents he faced and vanquished.Next, it seems like in every other section of the movie Ali is finding a new flame, divorcing the old one, and marrying the new one shortly thereafter. There is no real study to his weakness for women and how it really affected him and his life.  Its just kind of put out there without any real examination of the women involved or the impact this had on any of the children he had.Lastly, it really doesn't go in depth to explain his relationships with his father, Cassius Clay, Sr., or Drew Brown or Angelo Dundee.  We know how he met his father, but not how he met the rest of these people and what his relationships were really like with them.  There was just so much that was glossed over.This movie was just one big gloss over of what probably were the ten most turbulent years of Ali's life.  All the potential to be a great film, but the delivery just didn't add up.  The characters and life events were there, but all were just under utilized.  The film isn't bad to watch, but it can make you want to change the channel or take a break at some points.",5,0,0,16 January 2004
Catch Me If You Can," An Amazing Story
","This movie is an adaptation of the book written by Frank Abagnale Jr., at one time one of the top con artists/forgers in history.  The film is a sharp intelligent chase between the FBI and Frank.  Surrounded by excellent locations, dialogue, and an excellent John Williams soundtrack, you are mesmerized by the sheer confidence and extent to which Frank was capable of eluding the law and forging checks.  At times, Frank seems more like an escape artist/magician than a criminal.One thing the film doesn't truly address is whether or not the immense losses suffered by the banks, truly affected any individuals or business in a long term manner.  What it does show is how one step in the wrong direction can create a snowball effect that doesn't allow one to escape even when they want out.  Frank, while living the life of luxury, somewhere along the line realizes that to live that life while being chased isn't going to work.Luckily, for him, he was very young when he made his mistakes, and being very intelligent he acquired and retained skill set invaluable to law enforcement agencies and security companies today.  Frank was able to turn his mistakes into a good thing in the end.  I would guess, and one would hope, that if he had to do it over again, he probably wouldn't have made the same choices.A very well done worthy of watching. Enjoy it!",8,0,1,25 December 2003
Monster," A Dark and Sad Portrait of Real Self-Destruction
","Charlize Theron does an intense, dark, and unbelievable transformation into Aileen Carol Wuornos, a highway prostitute turned serial killer.  It took me some time to acknowledge that Charlize Theron was the same person as the character that she was performing on the screen.  As Aileen, Theron turns in a performance that is quite possibly her best ever and will take considerable effort to surpass in the near future.  It's a role that explores the depths, physically and mentally, of her acting talents.  Her performance in this harrowing story is alone a reason to watch this movie.She plays a character that is so damaged, confused, and lost in her search for what I can only define as hope.  Her character has been scarred mentally and physically since childhood by parents, friends, and strangers.  This movie makes no excuses for what Wuornos, but does provides an account of her steps down the path the complete and utter ruin, from which she will not be able to return.  Theron's portrayal doesn't leave you thinking that this is a woman who didn't get what she deserved, but as a woman who could have been someone or something else if she had chosen differently.  The movie shows us that even in the worst of circumstances you may find hope.  Sadly, sometimes finding that hope may be too late.Christina Ricci is equally as compelling as Selby who is one of the catalysts for Wuornos transformation from highway hooker to highway killer. She is a simple person, filled with emotional and mental complexities that stem from a religious upbringing and dealing with the reality that she is a lesbian.  Two worlds that seemingly never seem to co-exist in harmony from what I can tell.  Selby isn't completely faultless either, but apparently is the weaker to the two women when it comes to have a spine, which we can only guess stems from the innuendo that her family life was one where women did what they were told, when they were told to do it.  The conclusion of the movie indicates that this may not be far from the truth.The movie is designed more to give insight to what happened to these two women in the brief period of time that their lives crossed.  It makes no attempt to vindicate either of the two women's actions.  The movie paints a painfully truthful picture of the darker side of this flawed world we live in, which many choose to ignore and deny even exists.",10,0,0,26 January 2004
Underworld," I really enjoyed this film (possible spoilers)
","This film was not what I expected.  I truly expected a knock down drag out end-to-end attempt by vampires and werewolves to annihilate each other with big explosions, unbelievable fight scenes and over the top special effects. Is that what everyone does these days?Instead, there actually was a decent surprisingly unpredictable story with good sub plots and a very gothic ambiance.  I think all of them might have been a little bit under developed, or maybe they were lopped off to bring the length of the movie down; I guess we will have to wait for a director's cut to find out.The story does have some surprising plot twists, which you may or may not be able, to figure out until they actually happen- thankfully, in my opinion, they were not telegraphed.  Another notable element is that vampires in this story don't turn into bats, fog or rats, they're just people afflicted with a virus as are the werewolves.  Which is one of the different strains (no pun intended) of the supernatural/horror genre that's from a more scientific than mystical influence.The technical special effects, thankfully, were not ridiculously overdone and made in such a way to blend very well into the film.  It seemed like a lot of detail went into doing the effects that were used, rather sparingly, which I felt lent more credible to the movie as a story than a wide screen goth-horror-action explosion.I think the characters were intriguing, although knowing a little more about them might have been interesting, especially Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) - we know in the end what his ties to both the vampires and the werewolves is, but we really don't know much about him other than that he was a resident at a hospital.  For Selene (Kate Beckingsdale) you don't need to know much because basically she's been doing what she's been doing for several hundred years and her character is basically unchanged - she's a warrior and a survivor who follows her instincts for better or worse.It would have been more interesting to find out how the deal that spared Kraven's (Shane Brolly) life actually occurred as that is on of the major catalysts to how the story unfolds.  The only other thing I would have really like to have found out about, was the hierarchical structure of the vampire world because it appeared very complex and sophisticated.  Whereas, it appears that the werewolves have little to no structure at all and that which they have is all through the mechanizations of Lucian (Michael Sheen).But if I say more, I may give too much away, if I haven't already.  I think this movie is worth seeing.  The sets are good, the weapon's tech is very cool and all in all it's a movie that has a slightly different beat than most of what we've seen this year.",7,1,1,23 September 2003
The Fifth Element," A Comic Science Fiction Fantasy
","This is a silly and comic science fiction tale of unlikely heroes, a diabolic villain, utterly brain dead mercenaries and monks touting an ancient prophecy set years in the future.  Gary Oldman (the diabolic villian), Ian Holm (the main prophecy touting monk) and Chris Tucker make an excellent supporting cast that sometimes overshadow Bruce Willis.  Chris Tucker at many moments steals the show as the RuPaul like, strutting and screaming, way over the top, intergalactic talk show host, Ruby Rhod who can't make you do anything but laugh as a parody of many of today's talk show hosts.  There is an excellent score behind this movie that is capped off by MaÃ¯wenn Le Besco beautiful performance as the Diva Plavalaguna.  I found the special effects good, the costumes excellent and the soundtrack great.",9,0,1,9 September 2001
Constantine," Worth Watching
","I enjoyed this movie immensely. I did not find myself looking at my watch or fidgeting in my seat waiting for the film to either move on or end.I have not read the comic book, so I can not comment how well it did or did not keep to the original story line. The movie uses the fairly traditional good versus evil plot, with the hero having to be one whether he likes it or not. It has been done before, but I found this movie to be somewhat refreshing in comparison to everything else out there.The supporting cast is colorful and likable. In general, they are used effectively to keep the movie going through their interactions with Reeve's character Constantine. I do think they should have used Shia LaBeouf's character Chas Chandler a little more, but for some reason he seems to vanish at certain points in the movie. Maybe these scenes were left on the cutting room floor to keep the movie condensed and at a reasonable length without killing it.I did feel some Matrix-like influences on this movie, in the tone, scene site selections, and some of the special effects. But have faith, this movie is not Constantine meets the Matrix. But if you liked the Matrix, regardless of whether you hated Revolutions and Reloaded, I think you will enjoy this movie. It doesn't have the overbearing symbolism or the deafening soundtrack.If you're a fan of Sci-Fi/Fantasy, Comic Books, the Matrix, or other items along that genre you will hate or love this film. For the casual fan, I think if you want to watch a movie that you will be entertained by I think this is a good choice versus a lot of the other garbage being released today.But, as always, in the end. Its up to each and every viewer to decide.",9,4,20,21 February 2005
Lost in Translation," People Looking For Direction (Possible Spoilers)
","People looking for direction are what I think this movie is about.  Murray and Johansson play two completely different people, both who appear to be insomniacs, who find themselves, lost within themselves and the Japanese culture that surrounds them.  Both on some level, I believe, feel like they have a spouse that may not even need them, or at least only when it's convenient.In the brief encounters with Johansson's character's husband, he behaves with what seems like an utter disregard for her and self-absorption.  At some level he probably is head over heels for her, but isn't very good at showing it, while he is very good at being downright rude at time, in my opinion.Murray's character is one that seems to be something of a washed up, aging movie star, who the Japanese people still love and adore.  His wife based upon the few phone conversations and faxes that we hear and see between the two of them would indicate that their relationship isn't in the best of shape; because so of the things she says depending upon how you interpret them could be almost downright cold and hurtful.  The only thing that they appear to be in agreement on is loving and raising their children, which Murray seems to be missing out on because his agent is sending him all over the place to do commercials and appearances on talk shows.I think through the interactions and discussions that these two characters have they find something in themselves that they like.  What exactly it is doesn't ever seem crystal clear, but its a cross between friendship, sexual attraction, and a kind of mutual nurturing of one by the other as they both appear to be hitting bottom at the same time, but in different ways.I feel that Murray and Johansson portray their characters very well giving them a depth and warmth that people can relate to when viewing this film.  I think one of the reasons there is so much talk about this film is because the acting required wasn't just dialogue delivery - there are a lot of dialogue free scenes, where the actors convey more with their body languages then some actors might do in a 20 minute dialogue sequence.It's not a movie that everyone is going to love.  Some of you will hate this movie and think it's a piece of trash, while others will feel it is a masterpiece to be appreciated.  I personally find myself wondering why a couple of the scenes in the movie were even there and what might have been left out that should have been in the movie instead.  Watch this movie, even if you don't like it, you will walk out of it thinking about life of the movie itself more than most of the movies getting released today.",8,0,0,29 December 2003
Armageddon," An Enjoyable Movie
","The characters are an entertaining and likeable bunch of misfit off shore oil drillers.  The plot is formula, with a decent amount of foreshadowing so you probably have it figured out by the end, not all the details but the major events you should be expecting.  The special effects are amazing.  The physical visualization of the crystal-like like structures found on the meteorite/comet heading towards the earth are very dark but pleasing.  The movie was a little long and over the top but still very entertaining for both the sci-fi fan and the non-sci fi fan.",6,0,1,9 September 2001
Pitch Black," A Hybrid Sci-Fi Flick (Possible Spoilers)
","The influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film.  The movies that come to mind immediately are Alien, Aliens, and Starship Troopers.  The story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original, hibernated traveling through space, crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a 'deserted' geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival, while the body count mounts.  This kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well.  I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physically prowess, high tolerance for pain, and conveniently can see in the dark.  You know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because it's hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things.Cole House plays the drug-addicted bounty hunter who's probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to Riddick, as his character reveals itself throughout the movie.  It is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and firepower are in his favor.  A very self-serving character that in the end gets what he deserves.Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed vessel, who is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor swarm or the tail end of a comment.  Finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of that's character's potentially fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, accountability, and being a leader.  Her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most, in that she actually grows some conviction, takes charge, and doesn't sit around waiting to be gobbled up by night stalking aliens.  She in some strange way connects with the ever-distant human side of Riddick, who in turn in the end, respects her for her choices and her sticking with them.The story in some cases plays out as you would expect it, but I think you'll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience. This movie is an entertaining train-wreck in progress to watch.  Go watch it!",8,0,0,31 December 2003
Cold Mountain," Too Much Hype Not Enough Substance (Spoilers)
","Typically I like movies like this, but at the end it felt just flat.  I had already guessed, as soon as Law's character is killed, that in the one night of sex Kidman and Law had that she would be pregnant and end up with a child.  I was just kind of surprised after having Law's character live that long that he would be killed off.  Law gets blown up, shot in the neck, trapped in a chain gang (of which every single one in the chain except him gets killed), and travels thousands of miles just to clean-up, shave, have sex, and get shot buy some nobody character?  That was a real downer.  He should have stayed in the cabin with Natalie Portman it was probably safer. The story was, in my humble opinion, flawed with much potential, but they went a little too far away from reality I think and the finale was kind of anti-climatic for the above-mentioned reasons.Thankfully, the scenery during the thousands of miles of walking was diverse and a visually stunning of sections of the country that haven't been on film in ages.  The civil war combat scenes were highly graphic and displayed the real horrors of war well.  The music to the movie wasn't the same old rehash that you hear in most movies today, so that was refreshing too.Renée Zellweger and the rest of the supporting cast is what helped me enjoy this movie and get through the whole movie.  Donald Sutherland, Jack White, Brendan Gleeson, Philip Hoffman, and Ethan Suplee, to name a few.  The characters are bright, colorful, and well garbed for the period to the best of my knowledge.  This is a film that you can watch on DVD.  I am sure some of the scenes are prettiest on the big screen, but a wide screen version on a 25' TV or better will probably work just as well.No one's going to fault you if you don't watch this movie, but you will run into a lot of people who have seen it.  Its your choice, to view or not to view.",7,0,0,6 January 2004
Million Dollar Baby," This movie was not a sports movie.
","I can't honestly say if there are true spoilers in here, but I thought it would make sense to flag it since I relate some of my comments to the plot which could give it away.This movie is not a sports movie. This movie is not the greatest boxing movie ever. This is a story about broken people reaching for the stars that just happens to involve boxing.I recall when the movie came out all I heard about was the 'big twist' and the way the movie changed halfway through to something bizarre and . I think that was because many people felt this was supposed to be a female version of Rocky, which it isn't. This isn't a feel good movie about a boxer who go lucky.This is a story about a bunch of people, who did go after all of their dreams and put their entire lives on the line for it and, in my opinion, despite their best efforts seemed to fall short either due to no lack of trying, but just rotten luck.Except for Maggie (Swank), In the beginning of this movie each character is flawed and broken, a mere shell of their former selves. This movie could have been done without the using of boxing at all, but I think it was an excellent choice of medium because boxing has been the source of many true bizarre tragic stories.The portrayal of each of these characters is tremendous and for that alone the movie deserves many kudos. The story is fairly complete. I didn't think there were any real loose ends except for the ones that were deliberately created for cinematic and story telling purposes, not for sequel generation (doesn't everything seem like a trilogy these days?). I believe the filming of the movie was done with in an appealing, yet simplistic fashion, through the clever use of lighting and angles to bring solid atmospheres and emotions to different scenes - in some ways, I feel, similar to what Clint Eastwood did in Unforgiven.While I feel this was an excellent movie, I don't think this is one I could watch over and over. I like movies like this except for that taste of dissatisfaction at the end, when you feel like nothing was every truly resolved despite the best efforts of the characters or the movie. Maybe I missed, something and there was more resolution that I though, but I don't feel like I did.And for the parents who might read this, I think high school and up is the age range for this movie. I think younger kids might find some of the material very uncomfortable and disturbing.",7,2,3,5 September 2005
Shrek 2," Delightful, Entertaining, and Witty
","While most sequels don't live up to the hype, this one does.  A very funny follow-up to the original Shrek with the return of many old and the introduction of many new characters.  There are tie-ins to several more fairy tale stories too, which you'll have fun spotting throughout the film.Additionally, this story pokes a lot more fun today's society that the previous movie.  In particular, the movie takes some very well aimed swipes at Starbucks, E!, and COPS.  I think there may have been a few more, but those were the ones that really stand out at the moment.I felt that the production, cast, music-wise, and comically was as strong as the previous movie.  But, I think the story was a little less cohesive and there were one or two minor holes in the story.  But, all in all, the movie was a lot of fun and great bang for the buck.  Good for the kids and the adults (which is such a rare treat these days).  See this movie! Show the movie industry if its made well, we will come!",8,0,0,21 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Hands Down the Best Film of 2003 - Try to Beat It. (Possible Spoilers)
","Once again Quentin Tarantino brings us a well thought out high imaginative masterpiece of cinematic art, violence, mayhem, gore, comedy and story.In a Pulp Fiction like fashion the movie seamlessly (and violently) moves from the past to the present and back to the past.  The movie uses cinematic techniques and elements from the classic (black and white) samurai movies, the spaghetti western and Japanese anime to tell a colorful story (not just because of all the blood and gore - but it would be remiss on my part not to mention that there's plenty of it - some comic - some not so comic) of a woman (Uma Thurman) betrayed by her associates and mentor who is out for revenge.  All of the characters are cold blooded killers with little or no remorse about what they do and how they do it, while applying a very warped sense of east Asian Samurai-like honor to it all.  In truth, we don't even know much about Uma Thurman's character and while she is portrayed as the heroine in this film, she may be for all we know the worst of the entire bunch (she does appear to be completely encased by her need/desire for vengeance and is following her path with a passion and cold logic that if you take a moment to think about should make this character that much more suspect as a true 'good' heroine).Could people that seem to be truly this evil really be considered honorable? In some strange way maybe they can, but these are not good people.  They may say there is no honor among thieves/criminals but maybe in some strange sort of way at least for this small group there does seem to be just that.We don't find out a whole lot about Bill except that he's the one that wanted to have Uma's character dead and buried, which if it had worked would have made this a very short movie.  Bill appears to be some kind of evil mastermind with students and protégées littered all over the globe who had been trained in the martial art of the samurai long ago by a sword master and maker.The movie is a very comfortable hour and a half (figure up to two hours depending upon how many previews your theatre runs) and doesn't leave you hanging as far as the story goes.  The ending is dark and very good and neat making the movie by itself a complete item - it doesn't leave you with the lack of wrap up one feels when watching the Matrix Reloaded or any of the new Lord of the Rings movies (they made me feel like - what? that's it? its over?) - and allows you to excitedly look forward to the coming sequel because you truly feel as though this 'Volume' is truly complete.",10,0,1,10 October 2003
Big Fish," Count on Tim Burton to Bring You Something Different, Mystical and Magical
","This is a movie that takes a little getting into, but by the end of the movie you'll realize how fabulous and special this movie is to view.  Using style all of his own Tim Burton assembles an all-star cast to tell the story of a son, Will Bloom (Bill Crudup), trying to get to know his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor), who is dying of cancer.  The ensemble also includes Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi, and Danny DeVito, among many other fine actors and actresses.Burton mixes fantasy with reality and spins tall tales, based in truth, as recollected by Will Bloom and re-told by Ed Bloom.  He uses color, symbolism, music, and pageantry throughout this amazing movie to paint the vivid pictures that only words can fall short in describing.  Even with all the unusual and bizarre images used the picture never crosses the line to become truly macabre.The movie also sends a deeper message.  Do not lose sight of what really makes people who they are by getting so caught up in the factual analysis of everything you've ever heard and seen.  You might just end up losing sight of what really matters until it's too late for words.  This is an original well-done movie everyone should go see.",9,0,0,28 January 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," So Much and So Little Too
","Too much time was spent dwelling on special effects and character portrayal versus the actually story line.  Don't get me wrong, the effects were outstanding, the sets amazing and the characters were truly brought to life in their fullest form.  Ninety-Nine percent of the scenes brought to life were incredibly accurate and wonderful.The movie, for what it told of the story of the Sorcerer's Stone was too long.  Two and half hours and one Quidditch match?  What about Malfoy meeting Harry in Diagon Alley, they just skipped that completely!  There were several other scenes either entirely ignored or modified, which I found disappointing.  There wasn't a whole lot of development for much of the supporting student case (Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, the rest of the Weasley's). Did they even say Hedwig's name once?  If they did I missed it.I was left with mixed feelings at the end of the movie.  I felt what was told was great, but what wasn't told was an injustice to a wonderful story. If you're a purist then I don't recommend this movie, if you enjoy movies go see it - its a great experience in cinema.",8,0,0,20 November 2001
The Departed," Entertaining but Nothing Spectacular
","For a movie over two hours long I felt like there was a lot missing. A lot of the story felt rushed while at other times it felt like it was dragging. The movie just seemed to fall flat despite all the talent assembled on the screen. I don't know if it was the dialog or all the plot holes (there are a lot of loose ends in my opinion).I just always felt like I had a lot of interesting characters but I kept asking myself as I watched this film - what the heck is going on? How much got lost on the cutting room floor? Maybe this film needed to be four hours.I would like to see an unedited unrated director's cut or read the original screenplay for this movie. It covers such a large span of time and seems to jump all over the place without neatly putting things together. And the end seems like a desperate attempt to close off as many open plot lines as possible.Entertaining, yet frustrating. I expected a lot more out of this film and I don't really feel like it delivered. I recommend waiting for DVD.",6,2,2,18 October 2006
Bruce Almighty," Harmless Humor With Messages
","In this movie we see a toned down version of Jim Carrey and some indication that he could actually have some true dramatic talent beyond his renowned comic antics.  In a nutshell, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) complains to the almighty until the almighty makes him the man in charge.  The movie depicts Nolan's (Carrey) ensuing reactions and behaviors for the next seven days after being put in charge.  The end results are chaotic and humorous.The movie also sends a strong messages that life is what you make it, look inside yourself for the answers to life's questions and all actions have consequences and you are the only one accountable for your decisions.  All which this reviewer believes are true and that I feel many people tend to lose site of in the hectic world we all live in.",6,0,1,28 January 2004
Identity," Finally something different, if not new! (Possible Spoilers)
","I highly recommend watching this movie.This move is a dark, eerie and stimulating roller coaster ride from start to finish, which continues to surprise until the final scene, two seconds before the credits roll.  What makes this movie different than any of the other movies of recent note, is that all the phenomenally acted characters in this movie only exist as the different personalities of a mass murderer - due to be executed in 24 hours.The portrayals of the different personalities and their extremely complimentary contrasts reinforce the amazing depth of the mass murder's multiple personality disorder.  The visualization of multiple personalities trying to co-exist within a single mind and body, indirectly, gives insight of how challenging it must be to treat such a disorder.  Moreover how a doctor can encounter any level of success when the personalities themselves all have independent wills to live and survive. At the same time this film, in a possibly unintended way, presents an interesting case for not executing a convicted criminal because he's mentally ill and makes an argument as to whether or not that is the right way to handle things in the very last scene of the movie.  If a discussion about the treatment of mentally ill criminals takes place, after watching this film, you might have to consider that as one possible motive behind this eerie movie.In a really long stretch, but a possible on, you can draw small similarities to Fight Club, but in this case there isn't just one alternate personality - there are several.  In addition the alternate personalities are more tangible, in terms of how you could see each of the different personalities existing in the real world.",8,0,0,30 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It was fun! Even if a bit redundant. (Spoilers Ahead)
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film even in it's most preposterous moments.I did see all six of the original movies in the theater and found this very nostalgic and refreshing at the same time.I am happy that they preserved the look and feel of the original movies instead of going CGI crazy (which could have been easily done). And while you could tell Lucas wasn't at the helm (I feel Lucas' pacing and transitions were much cleaner/smoother than JJ's) it still worked in it's own wonky way.I will rejudge this film when the sequels have played themselves out.In my opinion, the movie is a set up than anything. It introduced new characters and gave us old(er) folks a (final in some cases) nostalgic taste of the old ones. And it provided endless opportunities to create fresh and (re)freshed story lines.Likewise, I will always keep in mind that this isn't Pulp Fiction, Fully Metal Jacket, Chinatown, Easy Rider or some other classic film.But, I do agree with some of the masses - blowing up another large imperial weapon using X-Wing fighters with a side-order of sabotage because a droid ran away with mission critical data a bit of rehash. But, that shouldn't ruin the move or take away from the level of effort required to create the film, the costumes, the sets that are an order of magnitude more than any film today, CGI or not.And while I can see some disappointment coming from this I can't see the hate.It's Star Wars - it's almost all rehash.Even the first trilogy had two Death Stars. And all three movies included a lightsaber duel that generally was near or at the the end of the movie. And the second trilogy had lightsaber battles at the end or near the end of each movie, yet again. Almost every movie had a damsel in some level of distress.I think Rey's ability to fly the Millennium Falcon, use Jedi mind tricks and wield a lightsaber the way she did was way over the top, unless she's the strongest Jedi since Darth Vader (maybe another grandchild?), but it didn't change my overall opinion of the movie. It was fun! If these failings as a film truly make you dislike it, then don't buy tickets to the next one.But for what it is - I think it's great.This is a science fiction movie designed to be fun where people can root for the good guys or the bad guys.It's an upgraded version of the Sunday afternoon dubbed over martial arts flicks we all used to watch in the 70s and 80s.I will say, if I see another death star, starkiller or similar large round object with a massive gun, I might wait for video.As previously noted, I believe JJ needs to work on pacing (which shouldn't come as a shock to anyone). I couldn't take in all the subtleties because it was too fast.JJ please don't Jar Jar Binks this.I think that's enough for now.",9,1,13,21 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Absolutely Fantastic
","By far in my opinion the most accurate and true to the book movie of the three.  While Stephen Jackson seemed to take a lot more liberty with the set-up for the climax in the first two book to film adaptations, the third played out marvelously.  I was thrilled to see events unfold almost exactly how they played out in the book.  I am sure that if someone was to over examine the final book, they might not be so thrilled.  Either way, I loved this movie, more so than the first two. (I'm still saddened by the omission of Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wright scene.)I think when it comes to the look and feel of middle earth, its creatures, its peoples and landscape this film will be hard to ever approach if anyone in the next 100 years decided to do a re-make. A fantastic movie that everyone should go so, Lord of the Rings fan or not.",10,0,0,23 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the best
","Star Wars is a movie to be experienced over and over.  Without the computers of today, unique characters and creatures were created and brought to life throughout this revolutionary film - Jawas, Sandpeople, Stormtroopers, Jedi Knights, Wookies and a whole host of others.  It told a fairy tale of a damsel in distress (Princess Leia) being rescued from a dark castle (the Death Star) by knights in shining armor (Ben, Luke, Han) against innumerable hordes of darkness (the Empire) led by evil villains (Tarkin and Vader) - completed with a climatic battle of life and death between the forces of good and evil (the Death Star battle).",10,0,0,31 May 2000
Honey," Surprisingly Entertaining
","After everything I had heard about this movie and how horrible it was, I sat back and prepared myself to cringe as this movie played.  Surprisingly enough, I found myself enjoying what I was watching.  The music was lively, the dancing was entertaining, and the message was a good one.  The message, I felt, was be yourself, strive for what you want, and never give up your dreams.  All things I think are important in life.The characters were stereotypes yet appealing.  The story was feasible, idealistic, and very formula.  But, as bad as the critics crushed this movie, I don't see what was so wrong about it.  It's fun, musical, easy to follow, and not so dark and serious as so much of the movies we see today. Despite what you've heard, I think if you give this movie a chance you'll enjoy it.  I did!",6,1,4,6 February 2004
Sin City," A visually stunning masterpiece in black and white
","I walked out of this movie, wondering what I had just watched because there was so much in this movie. After reflecting back over the weekend I finally decided that I had to put some my thoughts out in the open. Hopefully you'll find them useful, or at least entertaining.Taking pages from Dick Tracy, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill (both volumes), with the influences of the ultra-violent Japanese pulp films (no pun intended), Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have re-constructed a graphic novel world that one will not soon forget. I intend to watch this film several more times to see how much I missed, because I believe this is a film that has so much going on just one viewing does not allow one to take in all the elements of the film.From the score, the costumes (some of which were barely that), the characters, the lighting (yes black and white movies do have lighting effects, the transfusion of colors to enhance the significance of a scene or to foreshadow the future of the movie, and the scene sequence and how each was filmed.Whether your interest is action movies, comic book based movies, or any other kind of movie - I think there is something in this movie for everyone (except the little kids). Some of the older people will remember the days of black and white serials, while others will remember the more recent movies like Hellboy and Kill Bill.This is a movie to view, review and really think about. I haven't even finished thinking about it, but these are my first impressions. There isn't enough space here for me to really break out all the little nuances of the film. Enjoy the movie!",9,0,4,4 April 2005
