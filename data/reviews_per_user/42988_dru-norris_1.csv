Iron Man 3," I Just Can't Even.
","Iron Man has always been one of my favorite Marvel heroes; He has a great character, his plots are always cool, and his suits always intrigued me. With that, I only have one question for Marvel. What happened with Iron Man 3? (Warning, ragey spoilers ahead.) Where to begin. Let's start with the villain. If the villain in Iron Man 3 were only to be AIM, that is completely fine. It'd be a cool science vs. science matchup where one works for evil and one works for good, that is totally fine. But why, oh why, would you bring in The Mandarin--an amazing super villain that would provide great battle scenes and CGI--in on it? It just doesn't make sense, and wasted a great opportunity. Secondly, if the point of Iron Man 3 was to humanize Tony Stark and make the suit less vital to the plot, that too is fine. But then WHY bring in 42 of them at the end? It just doesn't make sense! In the first two titles, each suit served a purpose to the storyline, and the viewer felt attached to it. Like the Mach 1 in the first title; it became the symbol of Tony Stark's escape. I had NO attachment to any of the suits, as he only was really around one, and it just was a comedic plot device, and done poorly. The only thing I really enjoyed of the movie were the one liners, which mostly had me laughing very hard; particularly the one of Tony and Harley on the street of Rose Hill. But one liners do not a movie make.",6,1,2,5 May 2013
