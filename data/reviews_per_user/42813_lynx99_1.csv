Ghost," This is one of the most touching love stories ever made.
","Ghost is one of my favorite films.  It is romantic and touching. Ghost shows the love that transcends even death. The chemistry between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze is incredible.  The way they look at one another is sexier than any of those very graphic 'love scenes'.  They make a real romantic connection just through their eyes.  Ghost not only has wonderful, likeable characters in Sam Wheat, Molly Jensen, and Oda Mae Brown, but it has an engrossing plot that moves right along.  Entwined in all this is a beautiful score.  The theme song 'Ghost', written by Maurice Jarre specifically for the movie, is enchanting, and, of course, an oldie, 'Unchained Melody', adds another magical touch to a magical film.",10,154,193,13 March 1999
