The Blair Witch Project," Not as scary as I'd hoped
","I am not the kind of person who likes to be scared, but I went to see The Blair Witch Project for a discussion group.  This is the story of three film students (Heather, Josh and Mike) who hike into the Maryland woods to do a documentary on the infamous Blair Witch who has supposedly haunted the woods for about a century.  The film started out well and I loved the three film-makers.  The interaction between the three of them and the change of emotions through the weekend of filming were wonderful.  However, considering the film was promoted as one of the scariest movies ever, I have to say that I was more than disappointed.  I have to be the easiest person in the world to scare and yet this film did nothing for me.  There are far more intensely scary films out there, and although this would be in the same genre, it is certainly not in my top ten (which is headed by The Exorcist). Having said that, it is worth a look just to appreciate something without all the Hollywood special effects.",6,0,0,10 August 1999
