Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," expect fun, not depth
","my favorite movie is dr. strangelove. i enjoy movies that have what critics call 'artistic value'. Of course, I do not look at movies as one dimensionally as some. I also enjoy science fiction. Critics have bashed the phantom menace for its lack of artistic value. If you are going to see star wars for it's artistic merit, don't bother. the characters are poorly developed, the dialogue sucks. Even the some computer generated characters are not rendered that well (particularly with close ups). that being said, i have to say WHO CARES. i did not go to see star wars with the same expectations i have from a stanley kubrick, woody allen, or krzyszlof kieslowski film. the phantom menace is an incredibly FUN movie to go watch. 2001 was definitely a better FILM, but the phantom menace was certainly more fun to go see, and if i had to choose one or the other to watch with some friends on a weekend, i would choose star wars every time. critics are stupid because they think movies can all be judged by the same standards, but there are categories of movies and they should not be judged the same. the phantom menace is in many ways a kid movie, but there is plenty to keep everyone interested. even jar jar binks is not as annoying as i thought he would be. i have plenty of problems with this movie, but all the greatest works are flawed. that is not to say that star wars is the best movie ever, but i had as much fun watching it as i did watching the originals when i was a kid. 9/10",9,0,0,21 May 1999
