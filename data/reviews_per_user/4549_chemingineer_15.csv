Captain Phillips," Edgy and Energetic Thriller
","Captain Philips, based on a true incident, narrates the story of the eponymous captain of the US merchant vessel Maersk Alabama that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. On a voyage from Salalah in Oman to Mombasa in Kenya, the ship finds itself inexplicably isolated off the Somali coast and thus becomes an easy picking for some amateurish pirates looking to make big ransom bucks. In a heart stopping sequence the four teenage pirates come in a flimsy skiff and board the gigantic cargo ship. But when US government responds by dispatching two warships, the youthful enthusiasm of the pirates turns to desperation as they realize that they are being out-gunned and outwitted. The demeanour of Captain Richard Philips (Tom Hanks) also morphs from bravado to fear as he is taken hostage in a claustrophobic lifeboat, that becomes the centre of much of the action in the latter half of the film. Our sympathies also tend to waver, which may not be the intention of the director though. Director Paul Greengrass extracts outstanding performances from Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips and débutant Barkhad Abdi as Muse, the leader of the pirates. The camera bobbing up and down on the ocean might induce seasickness in the weak of heart, but is primarily responsible for holding you on the edge of the seat for most of 134 minutes. In the final analysis, it is the very human and humane performances of both Hanks and Abdi that prevents the film from degenerating into the tired and familiar heroic American formula. Captain Phillips shies away from delving into the uncomfortable questions that could have transformed it into a greater film.",7,1,5,13 October 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Delivers Terror at Multiple Levels
","Michelle walks out of her boyfriend and gets involved in a horrific car accident. When she comes to senses, she finds herself chained to a bed in a room without a window. A big swarthy man, Howard, soon walks in and claims that he has saved her life. They are in a bunker below his farmhouse, he further explains. Apparently there has been a mysterious attack of some kind and the air outside is contaminated. Howard, ex-navy, has spent a lifetime planning and preparing for such an attack and proudly shows around the various facilities in the bunker, which among other things is fitted with a sophisticated air filter system. The bunker has every creature comfort for living luxuriously for a couple of years. There is also another man inside the bunker; the man who helped Howard put it all together. Then there is Megan, an intriguing girl who exists only in a photograph.While the trio get to know each other, an air of nervousness prevails inside the bunker, as there is no way the situation outside can be ascertained with any degree of certainty. To add to the confusion, they keep hearing some mysterious noises outside. It is edge of the seat stuff. When the air filter system malfunctions Michelle is sent through the narrow duct to fix it. She spots something startling that makes Howard's behaviour highly suspicious. The plot dramatically shifts gears, twice thereafter, leading to a totally unexpected climax. Even the end is very ambiguous and far from clarified.10 Cloverfield Lane is a brilliantly creative thriller delivering terror at multiple levels – psychological, physical and supernatural. A sequel looks very likely",9,0,3,2 May 2016
Airlift," A Film that makes Bollwood and India Proud
","In 1991 Iraq invaded Kuwait and nearly 175,000 Indians were left high and dry, before being brought to India, in what is regarded as the largest war-time evacuation of its kind. Airlift narrates the story of events leading up to this evacuation. It shows the Indian Government in rather poor light, which is probably exaggerated under cinematic license. Notwithstanding that it is a very credible story, crisply told and tautly executed. It is not easy to narrate events that go back 25 years, and that too featuring a foreign land; this is where the film scores very high. Top marks for the crowd sequences. The stoicism with which most Indians accept their situation is brought out exceedingly well. Another remarkable thing is the film's economy of script; a lot is conveyed through looks and gestures. Though there are many characters, the director does well to keep the limelight on Akshay Kumar, who is intense without being melodramatic. The urgency and emergency that he manages to deliver are very palpable. The film also makes us look at our countrymen laboring in the Gulf with more sympathy.Finally it is a feel-good film; a film that both Bollywood and the country can be proud of.",6,0,3,1 February 2016
Zootopia," A Parable on Manufactured Intolerance
","In the idyllic kingdom of Zootopia, with six different types of ecosystems to accommodate every taste and comfort, animals have shelved their differences and both predators and prey cohabit peacefully. There is one shortcoming though; the police force lacks a rabbit. This is soon plugged thanks to the policy of inclusiveness pursued by the mayor and Judy Hopps becomes the first rabbit officer, much against the wishes of her parents who want her to become a carrot farmer. But the police chief, a buffalo, isn't too impressed and assigns Judy, the lowly job of parking enforcement.Don't let this yarn make you yawn. Serious trouble begins to brew in this Utopian metropolis; 14 animals go missing and rest of the film is about how Judy, aided by a clever fox, gets to the bottom of the sordid mystery. Zootopia is a thinly disguised parable on intolerance, xenophobia, stereotyping, discrimination and such contemporary social malaise that we see all around us. The 3D animation is astonishingly beautiful; I wanted to stay forever in that enthralling world.Zootopia is not really a film for kids; I saw many of them getting restless. The content is too adult to be subjected on the innocent kids. But it is utterly delightful viewing for the adults, especially for those who need to be reminded on what is wrong with our world.",8,8,15,29 March 2016
Spotlight," Sincere and Sensitive
","Best thing about Spotlight is that at no point of time during its 120 odd minutes, does it give the impression that you are watching a movie. You just want to lean forward and try to take in what is unraveled thick and fast. You are sucked in and made part of the investigation quartet at Boston Globe. Spotlight, the intrepid inquiry team at Boston Globe, exposes the rampant pedophilia in Catholic Church. Spotlight, the movie, tells us how they pursue this project with single-minded doggedness.Spotlight is not a very visual film. It takes the plot forward through conversations – brainstorming discussions and one to one interviews, accompanied by quicksilver editing. So convincing and intense are these interviews that you absolutely empathize with the victims. It is also a sort of thriller, sans blood and bodies. The sinister machinations of the Church are chilling to the bone. Though the film limits its exposé to the archdiocese of Boston, it drops a bombshell that the system is rotten right up to the doors of the Pope.As good as the content of the film, are the performances; oozing with sensitivity and sincerity and utterly credible. It makes you fall in love with newspapers all over again; a huge achievement in this impatient age of social media.",9,0,0,10 March 2016
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The melancholiness of spying
","The pace is languorous, at times excruciatingly slow. The music is sombre and deep, interspersed with long pregnant pauses of complete silence. The lighting is low and casts long shadows. The colours are muted, often grey and blue, but at times amber and ochre. The mood is distinctly chilling and sinister. Welcome to the murky world of counterespionage during the heydays of the cold war.After a bloody prelude set in Budapest, George Smiley is pulled out of retirement to unearth a 'mole right at the top of the circus'. How the laconic Smiley goes about this assignment is never made amply clear and the viewers are expected to workout the jigsaw puzzle for themselves. There are gruesome corpses, but the killing is mostly off-screen, except for two, one of them stunningly sudden. The narration is elliptical with flashbacks that are short and often confusing. The Russian passages of conversation are deliberately not subtitled. The editing is quicksilver and anticipatory. I am still trying to figure out the Freudian symbols of railway tracks and points, or the fat bespectacled kid.The movements of Gary Oldman's Smiley are laboured and arthritic. The wry British humour manages to ooze out in a couple of scenes. Through extreme close-ups, director Tomas Alfredson manages to evoke the melancholic world of spies. It is anything but fun and glamour. The atmospherics are brilliant transporting us to a world of ticker tapes and shrill telephones. It was a time when cigarette smoking was uber-cool.The denouement is deeply disappointing; it comes as a big anti-climax. This is a literary film; unless you have read the books you will not know that Karla is Smiley's Russian archenemy. The film is a must-watch if you are a Le Carré fan; otherwise it will tax your grey cells.",7,0,0,1 January 2012
The Revenant," A Pompous Exercise in Film-making
","The Revenant is an intense but excruciatingly long film. It recounts the true story of the incredible return of Hugh Glass, an ace fur trapper, who was left behind as 'dead' by a treacherous accomplice after being badly mauled by a bear. Without subtitling, barely a sentence can be understood of the heavily accented drawl. Not that Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hugh Glass has much to say; most of the time he is grunting or grimacing. Other than that he also bites into live fish, eats raw bison liver and sleeps inside a dead horse. It is definitely not an Oscar winning performance.While the snowscape is exquisitely photographed, it can hurt your eyes. There are some stunning sequences, among them the bear attack. Despite the film being so long, not much footage has been devoted to Glass's miraculous recovery. It defies belief, even if based on a true incident. The director has tried to inject some doses of mysticism, but it comes across as a pompous exercise in film-making. What linger at the end are not the travails of Hugh Glass, but the sad eyes of the native Indian chief searching for his abducted daughter.",6,5,9,3 March 2016
North by Northwest," A Cinema Buff's Delight
","Cary Grant, kidnapped in the opening frames of the film due to a case of mistaken identity, is actually a red-herring in a cold war spying game.The game goes awfully wrong, and to set the matters right in comes the sultry blonde Eva Marie-Saint,an avatar of Mata Hari.After some cat and mouse games in a train , a crop-duster tries to mow down Grant in a widely acclaimed and much written about sequence.       But to my mind the auction sequence,in which our hero makes a perfect ass of himself inorder to get arrested and shake off his pursuers, takes the cake.It is top class hilarious stuff. This counterpoint between suspense and comedy is in fact  the tenor of the film.      The  tempo of suspense is heightened and maintained with the help of appropriate music and through shadows and sinister camera angles. The finale on Mount Rushmore is both literally and figuratively a cliff-hanger. Grant is poker faced and takes his series of misadventures stoically - a la 007. Eva Marie, though icily menacing on the outside , shows a vulnerability deep down which is alluring. As Grant aptly describes her 'she is a big girl, and in all the right places too '. The film is replete with such enjoyable one-liners. Cinema buffs would also love the editing wizardry - look out for the cut from Mount Rushmore to the upper berth in the train at the very end of the film. While not definitely the greatest of Alfred Hitchcock's oeuvre , is is nevertheless a cinema buff's delight. Rating - 8/10",Null,1,1,22 September 1999
Captain America: Civil War," The Unbearable Heaviness of Being A Superhero
","A long time ago, when many of us were sleeping under a rock, a bunch of exceptionally gifted men and women banded together and started calling themselves The Avengers. The prime responsibility that they had taken upon their specially endowed bodies was to fight terror and crime, cutting across state boundaries, but especially the bad guys that originate from the bad country of Sokovia. In fulfillment of this responsibility, they perform tasks, which defy the laws of physics, explained to us by wise men like Newton and Einstein. There is this lady Superhero, who can conjure up heat and light by manipulating her fingers, much like a puppeteer is wont to do. Another Superhero can achieve instant communication and teleportation by tapping a contraption worn on his wrist. But not all of them are tech-savvy; there is a Superhero still using bow and arrow. And another one uses a designer shield. To cut a long story short, they use exquisite weapons and toys while performing their extraordinary feats to protect lesser mortals like us.It is not that The Avengers are always perfect; they do commit some silly mistakes sometimes. And one such mistake happened during their mission in Nigeria, leading to the death of some innocent people. It also resulted in United Nations waking up from their stupor and calls for bringing The Avengers under their purview. Some Superheroes, feeling guilty and tired, agree to submit themselves to UN control; others are outraged at their independence being compromised. There is a vertical split among The Avengers. The boss at UN gives the good guys 36 hours to bring around the bad guys. And fortuitously, it is also time for Halloween or some such festival. So they all don their best costumes and have a spectacular fight at Leipzig airport, crushing few planes in the process. The Shock and Awe at Leipzig does not resolve the stalemate. Fortunately for us, The Avengers have a good sense of humour, of the self-deprecating kind. Particularly witty, is the Spiderboy, a new recruit. But he is advised by the seniors to talk less and fight more. Meanwhile the mummified soldier in Sokovia, who is revived by some mumbo-jumbo, spills some secrets about the parents of one of The Avengers. This reunites the two factions in their fight against the common enemy. The emotions tend to get a bit overwhelming and also confusing. But hopefully there will be a sequel soon to throw more light on these weighty matters.",5,6,12,16 May 2016
Room," A film in two unequal parts
","Joy has been held captive in a tiny garden shed for 7 long years and is raped every night by her kidnapper. Jack, her 5 year old son, born in captivity, has no concept of the real world outside. His only 'contacts' with the external world are a television with often blurred signals and a skylight. Jack is cheerful and finds new ways to amuse himself every day, playing with shadows or a rat that intrudes into their 'home'. Joy is biding her time, waiting for Jack to grow up so that he can be told the truth. The bond between mother and son in that claustrophobic Room is extraordinary. This is the better half of the film. In the second half, Jack and Joy gain freedom in a rather ingenuous and dramatic way. They have to now come to terms with the real harsh world. As they struggle to cope with their newfound lives, so does the film in keeping pace with their struggles. We can see Joy's pain, but cannot empathize with her. How does fortitude desert her so quickly? This is where the film tends to stumble a bit.Though Brie Larson's 'Ma' fetched her an Oscar, it is 10-year old Jacob Tremblay, who stuns you as the 5-year old Jack. It is a portrayal that will haunt long after you have returned to your rooms.",8,0,1,30 March 2016
The Artist," The Silence of Love
","On the surface 'The Artist' is a simple love story; a period love story set during the times of turbulent transition when cinema broke its silence and acquired a voice. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) the swashbuckling star of silent films is unable to make the transition to talking films and finds himself upstaged by his upstart costar, the effervescent Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). How Peppy's love for him, ably aided by a totally adorable canine, helps Valentin redeem himself is the essence of the film. The challenge before the director Michel Hazanavicius, who has also written the screenplay, is to get all the emotions - pride, anger, jealousy etc – typical of a love story, across to us in a silent film.Yes, 'The Artist' is a silent film in black and white. It is this painstakingly constructed retro format that gives a classic texture to the film. Unusually for a silent film, the inter-titles are very sparse and the director relies heavily on the music to convey the emotions of a scene. And the musical score of composer Ludovic Bource, ranging from sombre symphonies to lilting melodies majestically rises to the occasion. Since music is the only sound of the film, it leaves a lasting impression on the mind Sound does make a stunning entry, twice in fact, during the film and catches us totally by surprise. The first is a cleverly disguised dream sequence about 30 minutes into the film. Valentin dreams that he has lost his voice, and how better to convey this than introducing sound to the inanimate objects! The second appearance of sound is in the very last minute of the film, when the director shouts CUT! And you are left with a disconcerting feeling of having watched a film within a film within a film.'The Artist' is anything but a hackneyed love story and there are layers to be peeled away, if you like, to get under the skin of George Valentin. Why he does what he does is a mystery and more mysterious is the transformation wrought by the silent words of a cop, whose mouth is shown in an astonishing close-up. There are several uncomfortable questions to be asked and answered, without in anyway diminishing the enjoyment of the film.But, 'The Artist' ends sweetly and gives you a feel good factor of love having triumphed over everything. It is also about the magic of moving images, the magic so lovingly captured in the numerous shots of anxious faces glued to the screen. Hazanavicius pays tributes to hoary legends of cinema by making references to their works. I caught the reference to Citizen Kane, and if you get this, it will be an icing on a most delicious cake of cinema.",7,0,1,25 February 2012
Invictus," A Lesson in Leadership
","Allow me to lead you, says Morgan Freeman quietly but authoritatively to his band of party men who are voting for scrapping the Springbok label for South African Rugby team. It is a powerful and defining moment of the film. After taking over as the President of South Africa in 1994, Nelson Mandela sees a huge opportunity to project his country as a multiracial democracy to the world during the 1995 Rugby World Cup. The film, based on John Carlin's book 'Playing the Enemy', is a very poignant delineation of how he goes about this task. Much to the chagrin of his close aides, he invests not an inconsiderable amount of time to befriend the Rugby team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). In a very memorable sequence of the film, the President invites the Captain to his office for tea and the two exchange notes on leadership. Invictus offers totally credible lessons on leadership, without even a wee bit of pontification. Winning the World Cup becomes a metaphor for uniting a fractured nation.Invictus (Latin for invincible) is a short poem by William Ernest Henley that Nelson Mandela had with him when he was incarcerated for 27 years. He hands over this inspiring poem to Francois before the start of the World Cup.The game sequences, and there are plenty of them, are shot and edited with the right amount of tension and clutch your eyeballs completely.Morgan Freeman plays Nelson Mandela with great dignity and compassion. Matt Damon as the overawed captain is excellent. Director Clint Eastwood has extracted powerful, yet unobtrusive performances.Invictus is a little gem of a film. It is hard to stay unaffected during its two odd hours. You are not human if you are unmoved. If I had my way I would make Invictus mandatory viewing for all the politicians of the world.",10,2,4,1 March 2010
Moonrise Kingdom," Phantasmagoria of Melancholic Souls
","Moonrise Kingdom is a phantasmagoria populated by melancholic souls, yet Wes Anderson's film is anything but maudlin. He narrates a very original story with a great deal of panache that will keep a grin permanently plastered on your face for 90 odd minutes. The tone is verily set right in the opening sequence which introduces us to the members of the dysfunctional Bishop family. It is a shot embellished with such rich detail that we fail to notice the credits that are pushed out to the edges of the frame.Suzy Bishop, the troubled adolescent with binoculars permanently slung around her neck appears to be engrossed in a book, but is actually waiting to elope with her classmate Sam Shakusky, a cherubic boy-scout, and wise beyond his years in the worldly ways. Their love for each other is comic, almost ridiculous; yet totally believable. How the eloping lovers are hunted down, separated and reunited forms the meat of the film.The locale is an incredibly picturesque island photographed in luscious colours. The story is set in a period when smoking was fashionable and people communicated through telegram. The musical score poignantly evokes that era. The characters leap out at us like those 3D cut-outs from a children's storybook. There is a narrator who intrudes into the story with some prescient messages. The mirth is almost always delivered deadpan. It is a story that ends well, full of hope and you can go home with the cockles of your heart warmed adequately.To label Moonrise Kingdom as a comic fairytale would be too simplistic. The film is liberally strewn with symbols and reading it as a parable would be rewarding, though it might warrant a second viewing.",7,4,7,24 September 2012
Deadpool," Stopped me Dead
","Deadpool is an extremely violent film; picture an adult version of Tom and Jerry, if you will; only the characters are not a cat and a mouse. The film also dishes out a steady stream of obscene one-liners, many of which are over the top because it alludes to previous films of the director. But both these should not deter you from enjoying a well-constructed spoof of the superhero genre of films; unless you are queasy about intestine churning violence and/or prudish about offensive obscenities. The film makes its irreverent intention clear right in the beginning with a hilarious credit sequence that almost begs you not to take it seriously. Lest you begin to start taking the violence and vulgarity a bit too earnestly, the film breaks the fourth wall putting things in proper perspective for you. Amidst all this style, violence and vulgarity, the film also manages to tell a solid story; and it is nothing less than a love story. Just when our hero finally finds the love of his life, he is struck down with cancer. The torturously exotic cure that he seeks out leaves him horribly disfigured but endowed with superhero powers. Does he get back his girl? Does he get back at his tormentor? I am no fan of Superman, Spiderman, Batman or X-men, but I liked Deadpool. It stopped me dead for 100 odd minutes.",7,1,10,23 February 2016
The Birds," A Psychoanalytical Thriller
","Complex interpersonal relationships with their possessiveness, jealousies, insecurities and anxieties are played out against the backdrop of spine-chilling massed attacks by birds in a small picturesque town near San Francisco. Why the birds attack without any provocation is neither made clear nor is any hypothesis proffered. It is this open-ended quality that elevates the film from being a mere bloodcurdling thriller at the superficial level to a subtler plane with many possibilities of psychoanalytical interpretations. The sub-textual reading of the film offers many hours of pleasure to the armchair psychologist. All the four principal characters, though outwardly simple, seem weighed down by some not so pleasant pasts, which they are reluctantly suppressing. The birds perhaps symbolise the cathartic release of their bottled up emotions. The almost tranquil anti-climax of the film makes you wonder whether the birds were just demons of the mind that have been expurgated. The present of caged lovebirds, which seemingly trigger off the inexplicably bizarre chain of events, are also central to the sub-text, and can be infused with several layers of semantics. In a most poignant final sequence, the little girl Cathy, who has been traumatised by the recurrent bird attacks requests her family to take along the caged birds with them as they flee to safety. So does the cage stand for security rather than the oft-repeated cliché of bondage?  an interesting speculation!  In a strikingly refreshing departure from modern day films of animal terror, there is no attempt to avenge the attack, which further lends weight to the feeling that the birds are a chimera. 	Even if Freudian analysis is not your up of tea, this is a fine film to be enjoyed for its sheer craftsmanship. Notice that the film is totally devoid of background score, debunking the notion that music heightens suspense. The long silent pauses are actually deafening. The sequences of bird strikes are amazingly well done. The camerawork is graceful  particularly noteworthy is the sequence in which Melanie stealthily arrives by boat to deliver the caged birds. A film out of the top drawer of Hitchcock.",Null,0,0,19 December 2001
