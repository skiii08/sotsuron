Vertigo," Visual Stunner Stifled by an Old Fart Actor
",I have only one question--why is James Stewart still single at the obvious age of 50+ and why is tethered to an old college ex-girlfriend? Hitch used to say 'let the audience worry about how Stewart gets down from the roof' but we still worry as to why a very old (esp. in the 1950s) man is obsessed with a young woman who could almost be his granddaughter? And why is he contentedly living alone in San Fran. on the cusp of the gay revolution? His final fantasy is remaking Kim Novak over like his own Barbie just to be able to stomach looking at her in the end. I'd say this is a classic closeted gay man using an ex- girlfriend as a beard while he plays couturier to his doll (Recall Clifton Webb in 'Laura'?) and then bored with her tosses her off the roof (typical teenage boy stuff). It's sad that with a younger lead man and more sex appeal this could've been a great psychological drama!,8,4,10,25 February 2017
Requiem for a Dream," Welcome to Life or Afterbirth
","This is the story behind the story of all those stories you read in the news everyday. Here is an explanation for all those arrests of celebs and freak accidents on the highway and shootings in malls. Apparently, human beings cannot live without excess or addiction. As long as we let ourselves be defined by television, Madison Avenue, Ms. Spears, and Ms. Hilton, we'll always look for something that at least makes us feel better about ourselves for awhile. Depending on your experience, this movie is either a warning or biography. I give the producers and director all the credit in the world for going ahead with this film. It couldn't have been easy. The criminal world of Hip Hop alone and the Mafiosa record moguls could've done a lot to stop it. I'm surprised it got made. The actors are flawless. They all deserve the Academy's best, but unfortunately that industry is tainted as well and I'm sure the awards in 2000 went to popular causes or pc racial types. Oh well, out here in Nobodyville, life goes on with or without the dope fiends.",10,0,0,9 March 2009
Se7en," The Little Film Noir That Couldn't
","I had to give it 5 for the excellent performances given by everyone but Brad Pitt. At first, I gave Mr. Pitt benefit of the doubt that he was aware of some flaws that I was not privy to in the character he was playing. Then I realized he just wasn't giving it his all. The fact that so many other reviewers gave him kudos tells me that intellectually Americans have fallen way behind in what they look for in a film. We truly are just about 'action, action, action' as Marlene Dietrich once said. Maybe that is why foreign film is so much ahead of us. Too many Americans have been raised on 'TV Movie of the Week' and 'Murder She Wrote' as their mother's milk. They simply don't look for nuances in character and personality. Underplaying is much more difficult that overplaying. Mr. Pitt does a ham actor's job of it. This isn't the first time I've witnessed his gross inability to reel in his own personality. He keeps playing Brad Pitt, bad boy of film as if flip dialog and pouting and shouting can make him the next Brando. It's a shame, but the ending fails enormously and I think was predictable. Hitchcock has nothing to worry about even from the grave. Mr. Pitt would make a much better scandal rag subject or part-time male model.",5,1,5,12 January 2009
12 Monkeys," A Really Fine Sci-fi
","In spite of two of my least favorite actors (Brad Pitt and Demi's ex), this is a terrific film, probably 'DieHard'hero's best. I can almost forgive Mr. Pitt for his bad acting in films like 'Troy' and '7Seven'. He is absolutely terrific in this movie! He ought to do more crazy person roles, he's got it down like nobody else. I was mesmerized by his performance. Brilliant/Oscar worthy! The 90s decade didn't produce many great films, but I think this really might be one of them. I predict it grows in popularity over the years. Directors up and coming could learn a lot from this one. The special effects are still fine and the philosophical intricacies of the plot stun you.",9,0,1,26 February 2009
Deadpool 2," Cut, cut and cut again
","On a very base level this is an enjoyable comedy. One has to view it censoring all the cynicism, f-words, needless toilet humor kind of like watching 'MASH' of 1970. As usual in modern films it is almost impossible to locate a hero figure or idol. Everyone here lives in a gray zone between good and bad. It is to the film's detriment that they used a grossly obese teenager to try and garner empathy from the audience especially since Ryan Reynolds saps all the energy out of the film with his raw and sarcastic comic shtick which then makes the film a dark brooding piece of moral rubber. If he is the hero and we are supposed to believe he is really trying to be a kinder understanding person, why is he determined to undermine it at every turn or rather why are the writers trying to bring us closer to the mundane trailer trash mind while pushing an ending that is opposite and not believable? The fact is that almost nobody could like this child actor in the center of the film let alone the actors IN the film!? There is nothing to like about a spoiled brat sociopath who lives in comic bookland mentally. The writers seem to be saying that psychopaths are made not born when in fact psychopaths are born! Once again we live in a world in which pc people wish everyone to believe that we are all OK and good at heart even if we kill people for kicks like 'Dexter' did. The visits to limbo where he encounters his dead gf are idiotic. Firstly, Reynolds is so obviously gay and apparently has swallowed the current fad of acting 'bisexual' and 'metrosexual'. He's just this side of a flaming queen. He flirts with homosexual behavior constantly but then believes if his gf lived they'd be happy ever after. (I'm now going to vomit.) Typical Hollywood and America.",5,2,5,3 March 2019
Crash," There Is Nothing New Here
","Some of the acting is pretty good, but the intent of the film seems a bit loose. If the intent is to show we all have prejudice, it succeeds on some level. If the intent is to show we all are capable of good and bad, it doesn't quite make it. If the intent is to show that all races in megacultural societies try, it's not realistic. What it doesn't show is that people operate most comfortably in their own culture with like people. This is not necessarily racially motivated--more, financially/socially. This is a truth. The dialogue is a bit stereotypic;it is someone else's version of how we speak. Again, mostly it is socially/economically oriented. The wealthy people are afraid of being robbed; the poor people feel abused and used. As long as America and like countries follow fascistic and republican tracks, this will never change. It is basically a have/have not society where people rarely cross over social barriers except through notoriety or fame. The rest of us are slotted by birth, family, education, etc. The lie is that America works. It is just another version of pre-revolutionary France. In order to be president of anything, you must have the backing and it is financial. You must cooperate with industry. Industry and banks run the nation. Politicians, Hollywood, and Madison Ave. are advertising puppets. It is about conformity.The rest of us have to deal with the anger and disappointment in the streets. The rich take cabs and have doormen. You are not immune unless you have a house in Dubai. What else have we got but who we are and what else to do than blame each other for our problems? I have to live with crazies, hoods and sickos in a city trying to lure wealthy Euros while it lets its infrastructure fall apart. I take the subway with messed up teens and street people who want to push anyone around because it makes their impotence less real. How do you fix that? I wait in long lines for everything and pay more than suburbanites for it. How do you fix that? I tolerate as best I can foreigners who ignorantly think they can impose their culture on ours because those who come here have money. This, after all, is the America they've been told has to tolerate everything and protect everyone! This is impossible. America is impossible. The freedom of all means nobody is free and nobody is represented. It makes lobal warming appear to be a blessing.",7,0,6,11 March 2010
The Best Years of Our Lives," Best Movies of Our Lives
","What can one say about any Wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them, bugs them,haunts them. Billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition. He paints the good and the bad in all of us. He also paints with love. I can't imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a Wilder film on it. They will last because they are true. I first saw this movie on TV in the 60s when I was a kid and I had to leave the room because I felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed. Now I'm an old man and I still feel the tears welling but don't leave the room. I knew these people and loved them and grew up around them. Billy preserved them in this film and not in a 'greatest generation' way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.",10,1,3,22 July 2008
The Devil Wears Prada," Why I Hate Meryl Streep
","This movie has some fun moments but mostly involving the clothing and the transformation (totally unbelievable) of a blue stocking into a runway model (sorta). Like Hitchcock said, you must suspend disbelief here. How a young nerd with literary aspirations finds herself working for the new Diana Vreeland, knowing zip about the rag biz or fashion and making it is just airhead fantasy. Nobody, even with a high IQ, could learn so quickly and be promoted so fast only to discard it all in the end without a sigh. It's just not real. The people aren't real either which is accurate for NYC and Seventh Ave. Everyone is a shark and everyone is mean. Then we have the resident fag who helps our little girl in dis dress, I mean 'distress'. He's actually like Calvin Klein and Halston before they were famous. I worked in NYC in the 70s/80s for Cosmo magazine and the Hearst/Conde Nast empire. There were people like him around. They had all stayed too long at the fair. This character isn't as angry as they were. Anyway, Meryl plays the bitch of the east but no houses drop on her. She's her always impervious self. Just how many roles has she copped from other aging actresses just as capable now? Just because she has a wealthy husband in the business doesn't mean she should eat all the cake. I hate her. She can act, but she cannot share.",7,3,4,23 January 2014
Nightcrawler," Those Who Succeed
","This is a brilliant portrayal of the American success story and the drive to win which dominates American culture. I believe Jake is playing an Asperger's everyman. He's the Wall St. trader, founder of Apple, Facebook creator, thief, swindler and blackmailer all in one. He swings his IQ like a weapon concealed beneath this veneer of civility, politeness and concern. He's learned all the facial expressions but feels none of them. He loathes humanity. Look at every inspirational speaker, preacher, CEO, politician, car salesman, banker, insurer, and you'll find this personality. He's bored and brilliant which makes him dangerous. I would venture to say he exemplifies the last three generations of human beings striving in an overpopulated world to be noticed and awarded. Anything goes because life is worthless unless you stand out. If Norman Bates and Einstein had a child, he'd be this character. We are now living in a world filled with individuals like this. Life has never been more perilous.",9,2,2,12 June 2015
Jackie," Jackie, They Hardly Knew Ye
","This must be the umpteenth version of Jacks by now? I think they were full of bravado agreeing to do this yet again. For those of us who are old enough to have lived through it, nothing new here. I have to say that I have difficulty historically dealing with impersonators in general because I tend to become harsher than usual. I'm a stickler for small details. For instance, her hair is incorrect--Jackie had more of it and a lower hairline which gave her a distinctive look. Natalie's hair comes and goes throughout the film as though she either has extensions going on or a wig and then not a wig. Her hairline is so high that she almost looks like she's balding. Then there's the accent--at times it does evoke Jackie but mostly there's a distinctive annoying lisp that Jackie never had. Then there's the miscasting of almost everyone else in the film The only people who 'look' like they might be Kennedys are the actors for JFK and Teddy whom we barely see or hear. Bobby is played by one of those Swedish boys from that huge Scarsgaard family. He too has an unbearable lisp. Jackie was tall for a female of that time; Ms. Portman barely reaches anyone's shoulders. Jacks was famous for wearing low cut heels. Natalie is on stilts and even then she can't outgrow Tucky or Rose Kennedy (who was a shrimp). The clothing looks bought from a Catholic charities shop downtown--work,cheap and completely wrong. The children are pathetically incorrect, no comment (Some producers' kids no doubt?)! A fine Brit actor plays the priest but hardly has a line worth mentioning. Portman gives good grief but adds a snippy , cranky sarcastic edge to everything she says (very unlike ladies who were taught manners from Miss Porters). A 'rush to production' is obvious . It does perhaps show Jackie's complete experience of the time but hardly and unfairly all sides of the woman. Watch documentaries and skip this one.",4,5,8,23 January 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Much Too Much
","This would've been a fun action film if they hadn't done the obvious--pepper it with heterosexual love interests and family values which have NO place in a comic book or a good movie. You want Disney, watch Lady and The Tramp. Despite the fact that the majority of the world is straight, I still do not see why in this day and age we still have to watch men and women slather all over each other in public. What does this have to do with plot and adventure? This is why films like Lara Croft were so popular--we can relate to singles but rarely to couples. This odd belief that there are alien species that will/can procreate with humans or want to is absurd. It's akin to showing a mammal try to have sex with a plant. The writers must've been told by the producers and therefore the backers to make everything Catholic--push hetero sex and babies along with propaganda that it's wrong to get rid of half the universe population to make reality more equal and fair. The fact is that we could lose China and India tomorrow and still have too many people roaming around on the planet. Mankind in many ways is invasive like a virus. The villians in this film actually are the good guys. Fie on Hollywood. They are so owned banks and mafiosa.",5,0,5,28 December 2018
Mulholland Drive," 'In my beginning is my end..' TS Eliot
","Lynches films usually garner interest because of his beautiful leading ladies (most of talent) and photography but he is NOT a great director. His plots are all stolen mix-matched pieces of Hitchcock, TV shows etc. ground up into a bland chopped meat that ends up saying nothing. What makes them really amateur are his long corny vignettes everyone wants to embellish on and call deep and mysterious or ironic messages about society. A girl staring at a mechanical bird in a tree or a young aspiring actress mouthing lines from 40s/50s films like 'I'm going to be a famous actress!' then giggling like an idiot. People walk through his films reciting his lines like they are just doing a first reading (not even) and have never acted before. There's a high school play feeling about his films. They either reflect an immature, autistic mind or some imagery only he is aware of and cannot seem to communicate. He's not even amusing like John Waters. What a waste or talent and money!? In the end we can only appreciate them on the level of porn--mindlessly watching while masturbating.",5,0,2,12 July 2017
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The King Has No Clothes On
","On another level, this could be the story of America from 2000 on. Evil fascist government takes control in a coup. A major terror event is staged to shock the public and thereby push through all kinds of anti-terror policy which eventually degrades human rights and speech. Everyone is terrified all the time except the few wealthy persons in power. The good guys are made out to be the bad guys. We are primed everyday to fear so eventually nobody dares challenge any policies. Other national governments go right wing as well. Big brother is winning, or should I say big business because I'm sure it is they who holds the strings.",10,0,3,24 October 2008
The Reader," Emotional Withdrawal
","Nobody plays emotionally constipated men better than Ralph Fiennes. He has such a marvelous way of showing depth of emotion mixed with disgust for it. I think everyone shines in this film. If you are a wuss about human feelings and acts of cowardice then do NOT watch it. (The commenter who claimed she didn't get the ending needs therapy.) All you have to do is be related to a person who grew up in that era or be their offspring. These people were raised to be polite even if it meant at the expense of truth. It must have been a holdover from the Victorian Era but most of the people who were young during the war and some even after lived quietly with constant pain. Over and above all else one must only show a good face/appearance. Never have scenes in public. I can completely understand why Hanna and Michael could only constantly think of weakness as looking for the truth. I cannot however forgive Michael for not letting the court know Hanna was illiterate. But, that is human nature folks! Welcome to the real world where we all make horrid mistakes all the time and choose to do the easier thing and yes, allow ourselves to be motivated from lust. Love it or leave it.",10,1,2,2 June 2009
The Sixth Sense," The Spoiler is Willis!
","Megamiscasting! Hollywood bankers do it again--go for the then box office draw in spite of his/her ability (in this case none). Bruce Willis is on top of a list of people who bluffed themselves by some sheer quirk of luck into the cinema back in the glory days of bad films (80s/90s). If this film had been made in Britain or Europe with actors who can act, it would have been wonderful. Brucie is a 'deez' 'dem' 'doze' guy. He's always in an action film no matter what he does. He can barely read the script. The young boy in the story and his mother are great, but Willis' presence knocks them down every time. He turns what could be a nice scary thriller into comic book stuff. He's especially awful during his scenes where he has to show some emotion. One can only think of the line about early Hepburn, 'Let's go see Katharine Hepburn act the gamut from A to B.' Willis is more like 'A to A minus'. He's terrible when he talks. Imagine Stallone playing a psychiatrist and you get the picture.",4,3,5,20 August 2015
The Truman Show," The Little Engine That Couldn't
","Nice idea, bad delivery. Could be many things. Chock full of symbols. Is it the journey of the homosexual male trying to be like everyone else at his own expense? Is it about conformity? Is it about the weight of heterosexual mores and traditions that kill you in the end? About lost dreams, lost loves, lost selves? About naivete and trust? About lies? About living lies? Marrying who we hate and doing what we dislike to please others? About ancestry, adoption (Truman's real father isn't real), making up God in a godless society? Dreams of perfection? Parable about Hollywood and what they try to shove down the public's throat while brainwashing them with ads? Making people buy things? Latent lesbianism (all the women dislike men). Fake selves we present to the world? Masturbation (both mental and physical)? The emptiness that comes with getting what you think you want? American actors are too self aware--their egos always intrude. God is a repressed gay man throughout. Jim Carrey fails at drama. You pick the scenario you like.",4,1,5,10 May 2016
Fantastic Four," Comic Book World
","This movie probably would've worked well in 1966, but in this day and age, its themes and characters seem suited for the dim witted and fat of America. This movie is filled with fat. Each character embodies a stereotype embellished with corny dialogue. Actually, the special effects weren't bad--I'll give it that much. What bothered me was that if you removed their superpowers, they resembled all the worst examples of humanity we see constantly on reality TV and the 'I'll do anything to be famous' shows. They might've tweaked some of the personalities a bit to fit our era more. The schmaltzy and very hetero ending is right out of the 1950s. As I listened to the stupid script utterings, I wondered, does anyone really talk like this? Perhaps that is why comics work as comics--they don't pretend at real life. I am of the opinion that comics do not work so well on screen. I know I have many X fans screaming by now. Comics rely on exaggeration. The women are busty and bursting from clothes and the men have jaws like Hercules. In real life, this looks absurd. It is as if we peopled a movie with runway models. It becomes one dimensional and a bit boring.",5,1,2,6 April 2007
Donnie Darko," They Tapped My Dreams
","How did they do it? How did these Hollywood schmucks (because that is what I think of most of them) finally make a piece of art tapping into universal dream life and thought? Anyway, Donnie is whomever you wish him to be--your secret self, your tortured adolescence, your unknowable friend, life in general. He wanders alone, finds out whatever he can about life alone, and dies alone. It is the predicament of all humans. What in the end is the meaning of anything? Things happen, we're pulled into them and left to decipher things later. Everyone gives an opinion about what 'we' have gone through or felt. We go from wondering if it is a god's will or fate to the simple fact that it is. God is just another explanation (rather a childish one) of what is. If we are honest, nobody from the afterlife has visited us and no beings who aren't there speak to us. We imagine these things at times, particularly if we are schizophrenic. It is still fun to see images on the screen coming as close to an understanding of things than anything else. Unless Santa and the Tooth Fairy pop up on our doorsteps (That's a lot of doorsteps!)to reveal all the hidden facts about life, this will have to do.",10,2,5,27 April 2010
