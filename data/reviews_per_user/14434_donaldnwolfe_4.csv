Ford v Ferrari," Well-Acted, Engaging
","Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe thoroughly inhabit their characters - that's the best thing about this movie, I think. Each of them has multiple scenes in which they are alternately charming and sympathetic. I was a teen when the historical events depicted in the movie occurred, and I remember some of them, which made this especially interesting to me. Occasionally the film falters when it succumbs to cliche, for example when it depicts the relentless efforts of Henry Ford II's kissing, sniveling right-hand man to undermine our heroes. But when the focus is in the lead characters and the road racing, it's a strong pic. I recommend it, especially if you have any interest in international racing history.",8,7,15,20 November 2019
Captain Marvel," One of My Favorite MCU Movies
","This is not quite the cultural touchstone that Black Panther was, but it's a better movie. Like Panther, it succeeds in teeing up the next Avengers movie, but it does so in a more direct and powerful way. The story of Carol Danvers' self-discovery unfolds unconventionally, but ultimately its convoluted elements coalesce and the newly mature character who emerges in the finale is probably the most badass figure in the MCU. The movie packed in just the right mix of humor, action, nostalgia, humanity and fantasy - something for everyone. I plan to see it again soon.",9,1,3,10 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Happiness
","I was 24 when the first Star Wars movie came out - it blew my mind. I soon heard that George Lucas envisioned a 9-movie epic story, but after Empire Strikes Back, it seemed like the rest of the story would never be told. Now it's been told (although not exactly as Lucas dreamed it, which possibly is a good thing - no disrespect). I'm 67 now and very happy to have witnessed the entire cycle in real time. The character of Rey is the zenith of the franchise and Daisy Ridley perfects that character in this movie. It's an extravaganza. See it.",9,2,8,21 December 2019
Midway," Nail-biter!
","This movie is like Pearl Harbor (the Affleck/Hartnett one) but with a lot less corniness and glamor, and a tighter focus on the challenges faced by the armed forces in the Pacific in the aftermath of December 7. The battle scenes are more gripping than any I've ever seen in the big screen. A few times I found myself wringing my hands so hard that they hurt. This is a very straightforward war movie - one that illustrates the sacrifice of war veterans like few others.",8,8,13,11 November 2019
