Come and See," Sad, and beautiful
","Come and see has changed my view on WWII almost entirely. I had no idea the suffering the Russians endured compared to the other demographics. This movie says so much about the heart behind the people. By showing me the child curiously enjoying himself with the fascination behind 'patriotism' and war I was compelled instantly. How quickly the film becomes a downward spiral and cinematically an amazing one. The explosions gave me sorrow the sound, gave me chills, and the story left me shook. A moving film for sure, and a pleasure to watch. I emotionally am attached to this film at this point and can truly say it is one of my favorites.",9,1,1,27 July 2012
