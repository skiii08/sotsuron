Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Great Ride
",How did George Lucas come with this stuff??The man is truly a genius. This movie showed the fans where it all began. Truly the most anticipated movie of all time. The battle between Darth Maul and the two jedis is the best lightsaber fight in the whole saga of Star Wars.,Null,0,0,22 September 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Classic
","If Star Wars change the way we watch movies now, ET change the way we looked at aliens. Not only did it show us that there is probably a living force out there it also showed us how humanity is. This movie is truly a classic.",Null,0,0,22 September 1999
Titanic," One of the best love stories
","I admit I am not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan but what he did to this movie is fantastic. Titanic would not be this big without Leo, he totally outact himself. The story is truly one of the best love stories of all time. Right there on top with movies like Somewhere In Time and When Harry Met Sally!!",Null,1,2,22 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that started everything
",Truly a genius movie. I can watch this movie over and over and over. Star Wars is truly a classic on it's own. This is the movie that started everything. No movie had a bigger effect on people than Star Wars.,Null,0,0,22 September 1999
