Lucky Number Slevin," Entertaining
","With a lot of Bruce Willis's films, you can rely on his entertainment value. This movie is, happily, one of those times. The plot is a little predictable, but the tale is in the telling here. Good acting, good direction and great editing put what might have been a mediocre film into a category of 'definitely worth watching'.Lucy Liu is terrific as the hyper coroner, Josh Hartnett does an above average job as the visiting kid caught in the mob war, and Willis, well, he does his calm, cool, collected routine, but he does it well.Like I said, the movie entertains on a high level. Definitely worth watching.",8,2,9,10 April 2006
Stardust," Original story, lame presentation
","Movies must be difficult to make. I think this is true because, given an original story, a decent cast of likable characters, and a book to work from, this movie still fails in most regards. While the dialogue, even the humor and 'wit', was fairly weak and seemed like the writer was trying too hard, it was the actual shooting that hurt the film.Camera angles, lighting, timing of cuts, length of a scene, music, continuity...the film seemed like it was directed by an amateur film maker. The scenes were (mostly) the bare minimum to get the point across - very little dramatic work, and in a fairy tale type romance movie, you want something dramatic, epic.This film drew early comparisons to the Princess Bride. Stardust is a romantic fantasy with a crazy cast of characters, fencing, fighting, pirates, witches, true love. But the writing and the scene-crafting in the Princess Bride were works of art, and Stardust seems a little too raw -- overblown sarcasm when subtle wit was needed, or the camera focused too briefly on an amusing look by a ghost.Again, kudos for, finally, an original fantasy story hitting the theatres (instead of sequel upon sequel) and it was a good one. I can imagine the book was much better though.",6,7,13,17 August 2007
Paranormal Activity," Indeed a scary film
","So to gauge my review, consider the other movies that have kept me up at night: Poltergeist (that &#$! clown); The Sixth Sense (imagery and suspense); The Ring (the well...). And now Paranormal Activity. If you've got an over-active imagination coupled with at least a slight trepidation over things that go bump in the night, you'll be more than a little indecisive over whether to leave the bedroom light on after you watch this.During the film, the screams of the younger crowd at the BUMPs or the door slams definitely broke the tension. I wasn't cringing or covering my eyes -- I was usually eyeing that empty doorway to see if anything was out there in the dark of the stairwell. I think that's what the creators were going for -- making you afraid of the darkness. Or at least genuinely concerned about it. And while in the theater I wasn't terrified, it was when the sun set that I had problems.That night I avoided the openings of dark hallways, didn't really want to go into the garage to turn out the light, and did indeed sleep with the bedroom light on -- when I finally fell asleep from nervous exhaustion around 3 AM after going to bed at 11 AM. The movie served its purpose -- it made my ears pound with the sound of my pulse as I strained to hear the slightest noise in the house: the breathing of the sleeping dog, the breeze in the trees, the click as the door handle to my bedroom engaged.Not everyone, of course, is bothered the same way. But certain movie imagery gets me wondering if something is indeed merely waiting for me to disbelieve in it, so it can prove to me it's real. Congratulations, Orin Peli, on completely freaking me out. Kudos to the actors who did a great job distinguishing their personalities -- taunting Micah, and not-wanting-this-to-go-on-any-longer Katie. Well done.The last second of the film was a wee too Hollywood considering the rest of the film. But the only real flaw in a simple, very scary, movie.",10,5,12,20 October 2009
Avatar," Way beyond expectations
","The build up over the past year for this movie was enormous and, hearing the basic storyline and then the comments after some saw the movie about its lack of originality but stupendous imagery, I went in with mediocre expectations at best.It got me. The imagery was indeed amazing, the plot simple yet so effectively done there were times I was holding back tears and times I was outraged at what was happening on-screen. The characters are stereotypes for the most part, but in an epic film trying to make a statement, sometimes archetypes work best. It keeps your head from getting too cluttered with side-plots and nebulous developments. This movie's message is clear and well told.After all the hype and putting off being trapped in a seat for 3 hours, am I glad I finally saw it. No question: for me, it'll hit my top 10 movies of all time. It's that good. I actually still haven't seen Titanic (but you won't spoil the ending for me if you tell me the boat sinks), but James Cameron certainly managed an amazing film here in terms of world-building, message-bringing, and even getting some true emotion out of the watchers, which is really rare in mainstream films. Good stuff, Mr. Cameron.",10,4,9,11 January 2010
Happy Feet," Gets you dancing...
","After reading reviews of this movie on how funny it was and uplifting, I finally went to see it at a night showing (which I generally don't spend the money on -- I'm all about matinees). The movie definitely had some cute parts, some funny parts, and some moving parts, which is more than your typical film has. It dragged a little bit, sort of a rarity for an animated film, but for the most part you felt connected to the characters. I'm a sucker for films with messages and when the film finally arrived at its own, I felt it did a fine job with it.All that being said, it's a fun film...the music and dancing is not at all esoterically Fantasia-like. The songs are familiar and catchy, and the dancing really makes you ache to move your feet. I recommend it for a fun film with a good message.",8,0,2,27 November 2006
V for Vendetta," Relevant and Memorable
","It's a great film. It's not a masterpiece of cinema though. But it's a movie about ideas and it's a movie about people moved by them. It points a stern finger at the politicians of today, a reminder that their constituents are not sheep nor lemmings. What little action appears in the film is overshadowed by its premise: the idea of freedom, and how one man allows people to remember what freedom is.Scariest part of the film: the trucks driving the streets listening and recording conversations in homes. We already have illegal wiretapping, the government asking for access to emails and what should be private records, our personal information being shared by corporate entities for their own profit. Fear is instilled in the hearts of the populace as avian bird flu scares, terrorist attacks that were narrowly avoided, epidemic outbreaks where only the government has the vaccine appear in the government-controlled media.We need to be certain that, above all else, freedom of the press is assured. It's easy to control the masses when the press are telling you believable lies.When we finally wake up and decide to say, 'Enough is enough...you have taken too much!' it may be the day you're 'black-bagged' because a neighbor ratted you out. I'd love to say, 'Well, things aren't that bad yet...' but it'll be past time for saving if we don't put the brakes on the downhill train soon....",9,3,7,20 March 2006
