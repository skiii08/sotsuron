The Devil's Advocate," Not too horrible ...
","Watch Mia Farrow redecorate her huge new New York apartment while she begins to get a creepy feeling from her neighbors.  Watch her cut her hair, have baby-drama, dreams (maybe), crack up and run down the long narrow hallway in the apartment with a butcher knife.  Oh wait, it'c Charlize Theron ... oops.Still kind of fun.  Sort of a mirror-image Rosemary's Baby.  This time told from the husband's POV.",Null,0,1,20 February 2000
Unbreakable," Piece of C**p
",This movie is so bad it is unbelievable.  Bruce Willis goes for subtle - which means all he does in this film is whisper. Anyway - it proves that there are movies worse than the idiotic Sixth Sense.  I was fortunate enough to see it for free on a flight; don't waste any money on this turkey.,1,2,6,30 April 2001
Moulin Rouge!," For what it is ....great fun!
","All I could think of was the old movies I watched growing up and what would have happened to them if they were turned into music videos.  It's almost hard to describe without actually EXPERIENCING it.  Take a hit of acid and then switch channels back and forth between Camille and Cabaret.  Actually, that's not a bad thing!  I was never bored and really enjoyed the sentiment behind the whole thing.  There is a great sweetness disguised behind the lurid colors, camera work and oft told- cheesy love story.  McGregor is awesome and steals the film.  What a charmer he turns out to be.",9,0,1,28 December 2001
The Green Mile," Give me break!
","Dull, corny, sappy, predictable .... Where have you ever seen such lovely death row inmates before!  Don't kill him - he's just a mass murderer and he has a pet mouse!  Hah!  And what's with all the urine in this film ... some kind of weird fixation going on.",1,7,34,28 July 2000
