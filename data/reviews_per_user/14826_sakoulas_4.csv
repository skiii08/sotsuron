Requiem for a Dream," Got tricked...
","For starters, i would like to point out that i don't write comments for movies too often. A movie will have to make a certain impression on me - positive or negative - to make me write one. Secondly, when i see a movie that i like or dislike, i always read the exact opposite comments in IMDb, to see the point of view of the people that think otherwise than me. In this particular movie, the opposite comments would be the ones that i'd agree with 6 years ago.First time i saw Requiem For A Dream was back when it was released. I was blown away. Totally. I thought that this is what cinema MUST be. That was then...I saw it again three hours ago. When it ended i caught myself being cold. Not by emotions, by the lack of them. I started thinking that something must be wrong - me or the movie. Obviously it must have been me, because it was the same movie that blown me away back then. So i thought to myself that i had to figure out what has changed since. The very first thing that came to mind was that i found out i didn't care about the characters. There was no depth in them. I couldn't relate to any of them. They were like comic characters. Flat. The only emotion they had was anticipation for the next time they would get a dose.Was it possible that i had that kind of thoughts about the same movie i saw in 2001? No doubt about it. So, it must be me. I'm getting older and apparently the shock-after-shock theme in this movie isn't convincing for me anymore. And that's all there is to it about the plot. There isn't any. It's just that. Shock-after-shock. Mr. Aronofsky tried to shock his audience because he knew that. He made the film as much as depressing as he could, for the sole reason to bring tears to everyone, so nobody would pay attention to the non-existing script. It's true. THERE IS NO SCRIPT - NO PLOT. Nothing. He made a movie for junkies with nothing in it. Must find a dose and will do anything to get it? That is not a plot. That is absolute nothing. The side story of the mother is the reason for the 2 i'm giving it. Otherwise not even 1 would be enough.Acting(fantastic job), directing(quite good, i admit), editing, scoring(brilliant music), producing, developing, even promoting. Almost everything was almost perfect. Only one key element was missing. Plot. And that's the single most important part of a movie.",2,6,11,26 August 2007
Deja Vu," Can we really appreciate a movie?......
","OK, am i wrong, or is the comments area in IMDb there for commenting a movie? What can i say? Some of the people in here are not commenting the movie, they adapt it to our own reality and try to make sense out of it. I will not make the same mistake....The movie itself is a complex of thriller-drama-action-SciFi and i have to say that Tony Scott did a very good job (especially for his action scenes). Denzel and Val are very good but the applause goes for Jim and the new girl Paula Patton. She actually steals the first role from Denzel. And Jim who plays for about half-or-less an hour makes you think immediately that he is the bad guy. What more can you expect from an actor?The film has a fast pace that doesn't let you get bored and although it lasts about 2 hours, it's coming to the end quite quick. I have to admit that there are some errors (the-country-hurt-my-feelings explanation for the bad guy turned to a terrorist is at the least laughable, the time-travel theories cannot be minimized into a 2 minutes analysis such as portrayed here), but after all, when you see a film of this kind you do not expect everything to be clear as the stars in the night sky (without clouds of course).And that's the BIG question. Do you watch this kind of movies for entertaining reasons, just simply to pass your time relaxed, make your mind forget the things you worry about the rest of the day etc, OR you want every single movie you watch - even a SciFi-action-thriller like this one - to make you think about our cosmos and the universe and the societies and the world and whatever?Answer the question, what you REALLY want and expect for any given kind of movie and i promise that you will find yourself to be more amused after you watch any film from there on.....For myself speaking, this film deserves a brave 8. It was pretty amusing - and that's really the whole point, isn't it?",8,56,98,22 May 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," An excellent waste of a movie..............(minor spoilers)
","What a nice idea for a movie!!!! A brilliant idea.... Ruined by - who else - Hollywood.........A boring man, living a boring life, hears his story narrated by a voice. Excellent. What a thrilling experience would have been... Up about the last 10 minutes it was truly wonderful to watch. It had some mistakes as a whole, like the easy pairing of Ferrel and Gyllenhaal with just a song, the miscast of Latifah, the irritating coffee scenes with Hoffman (always with a coffee in his hand i mean), but it still delivered.And then came Hollywood. Was there a reason for such a graive Mistake (with a capitol M)? Why ruin the movie? Why the crappy ending? Who ever said that it would be better to not kill Ferrel? Who ever said that it would be better to stay with the girl? Don't they (and by 'they' i mean Hollywood) know by now that viewers are actually getting sick and bored and tired by those silly, idiotic, unreasonample, uncreative, ludicrous, laughable endings? Well, of course they know it. They just want to hit younger audiences. That's why they still use that endings. And by doing that they keep ruining very good films.What an excellent...........waste.",3,1,2,18 July 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," What would have happened if he failed?
","This film is inspired by a true story about a man going from economic nothingness to being rather wealthy and simultaneously trying to raise his little son. It's got some very heavy scenes, very well acting and good directing but for some reasons fails to deliver.Imagine yourself being in this man shoes with the same problems. What would you do? Go out and try to find a job in the stock market? Let's assume that you would. The most important question then would be: What would happen if you failed? What then? Exactly how would you bring food to the table? I don't know how accurate is the movie compared to the real story but it is quite simply not easily accepted. If he really did that, he is one of them examples not to be followed. Although he succeeded and made a good life for him and his son, his reasoning is questionable. His story is one of personal luck - great great luck, mind you - but in similar cases the first thing a parent should do is to ensure the well-fare of his or her children, not chase some dream for better life. If you succeed at the first, then and only then go after the second.The movie is not bad, it's actually quite good, but the aftertaste is the big problem. A movie of this kind must portray first of all responsibility towards your loved ones. This one is not. It's one thing to write a book, an autobiography specifically, but a movie is going to be heard and seen by a tremendously lot more people than the book. It seems nowadays that money are more important than your family in the minds of the film-makers.Sorry, but i will pass....",2,11,18,28 May 2007
