The Blair Witch Project," Quite possibly the most boring 90 minutes of my life!
","Welcome to the most overrated overhyped movie of the century. Not since i was forced to sit through that crapfest which was waterworld have i been this bored at a movie. scariest movie ever? HAHAHA!!! what a joke! 80 minutes of sitting around waiting for something scary to happen and finally the big final scare, and boy was i disappointed. they came close to almost being close to scary twice. the tent and the house but thats it. if i wanted to see a movie about people mentally breaking down i would go and rent 'The Shining' (which is a far better movie). So in conclusion if you read this don't let me discourage you. You may like. This is my opinion alone. A lot of people in the theater were genuinly scared (of course i'm sure they were people who would also compare 'Tommy Boy' to Citizen Kane') but i'm not bitter...",3,0,1,9 August 1999
