3:10 to Yuma," Could have been a great movie.
","This movie had the potential to be much better. As per most movies, they go over board. Just too many 'Ya right' moments for me. If a known killer is in my house,1st thing he's not eating dinner at my kitchen table with my wife and kids present. 2nd and more importantly, I'm not leaving him in there with my wife to chat while i'm outside. There are too many almost impossible to believe moments in this movie but here's a great one. In a fight scene a man picks up a rather sturdy looking shovel and swings it like Mark McGuire and smashes it across another mans face to disable him. In the very next shot, the man on the receiving end of the blow simply gets back to his feet and joins the mêlée. In reality he would have: been knocked clean out, laid on the ground spitting out most of teeth, had a huge gash on his face or had a broken neck from the force of the blow. Yep, he got up as if he had just gotten a mosquito bite!",6,0,1,25 September 2013
