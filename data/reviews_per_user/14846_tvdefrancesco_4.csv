Iron Man 3," Don't listen to the Nerds
","This movie is not as bad as everyone is making it seem. Especially if you've never read the comic series. I like the fact that the director had this twist in there because it is most likely what is happening in the real world. 'A Target' who is financed from the Underground. I thought it was pretty cool. Their powers were a little much, especially the breathing fire scene, but there powers were also pretty sick. Not to mention its a freaking comic book, there supposed to be over the top.. Tony's tinkering was awesome, some of the special effects were amazing. He's taken the suit to the next level, the dude shits gold. Some of the fight scenes were awesome, especially the one at the end. He's a complete dick to that kid, but he makes up for it at the end. I agree there are some holes in the story. But between the special effects, the innovation of Tony Stark and Marvel, this movie is worth seeing. It could have been better sure, but it is good none the less. In the Word's of Nick Swardson 'If people saw that movie 50 years ago they would have blown there head's off in the street.'",7,1,6,3 May 2013
The Hateful Eight," Did You Guys Watch The Same Movie?
","*Pretty much no spoilers. Go see it. It's worth it!Firstly, I've got to give credit to Samuel L here. I wasn't sure how he would mesh into a Western set 18 something Wyoming but he is the best character in the movie. The girl does a terrific job as the psycho chained to the Hangman. I liked that they didn't reveal much about her or anyone until later in the story. It was story telling at it's best and each character was very unique. There was a lot of dialogue in the movie, but the dialogue was tremendous. In typical Tarantino fashion, the story begins to unwind and we are given glimpses into the past. Anyone asking why is it called the Hateful 8 there were more characters? Please get a clue. 4 people in the first stage coach, 4 in the second, and boy each character would kill at the drop of a hat. Were any of the kills justified? Is any killing justified? That's for you to decide. There are a lot of racial slurs in the movie, but it's meant to show what it was actually like during the post Civil War Era. A black Yankee sitting with a Confederate General. Imagine what that would have actually been like? I loved how Samuel L spoke, and that scene was pretty funny. He was very intelligent and violent. Kurt Russell was great as the Hangman, Goggins was excellent as the Cracker Sheriff, and Tim Roth was also great as 'The Hangman.' I thought they could have used Michael Madsen better, which was surprising because he is usually the most violent character in QT's films. As always with Tarantino, it was a very gory movie, but that was to be expected. It was over the top and I found myself laughing about how the characters weren't bothered a bit when viciously murdering someone. I thought it was a great movie. I don't understand how there are so many 1's. You think this movie is on par with Open Water and Jack and Jill?! I don't think so.",8,5,14,29 January 2016
Midsommar," When Artsy, Edgy, and Cool Goes Wrong
","Why do so many movies and TV shows nowadays try to be edgy and leave things unexplained with abrupt endings?! Unfortunately this isn't even the worst thing about Midsommar. I was really excited to see this movie and it was absolutely horrible.
The main character is the worst character I have ever seen. It wasn't the actress's fault either. 80% of her lines are howling and crying. They make her seem terrible to be around and no one liked her, not even her boyfriend. Her whole family dies at the beginning, but that is never explained. I kept thinking they would tie it back but they didn't.
For the next 2 1/2 hours we slowly move up to nothing. They show a disabled person here and there, and 1 of them writes stuff, but never explain. They show 1 over and over but never incorporate it. More howling and tripping then burn alive. More stares no explanation then howling then over. Thankfully fin.",1,20,35,6 July 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," If You Want Dialogue, Character Development, and a Complex Story Go Watch The Notebook. Mad Max is Junk Food For The Brain.
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a film like no other. From the insane stunts, the manic pace, and the heavy metal backdrop, Mad Max makes for one hell of a ride. It jumps out to an insanely fast start and doesn't stop. I've never seen another movie filmed like this one. The camera work did an awesome job of showing how out of control the people were. Everything was desperate, fast, and desolate. There is little pre story and character development, but who cares? That's not what this movie is about. This is Fury Road. It says it in the title, and it's one hell of a ride. I love post-apocalyptic movies and this one doesn't disappoint. This movie does a great job portraying how insane the people are, and how dangerous blind faith/following is. The music is manic, the pace is manic, the speed is manic. This movie really made my heart beat fast. It's a thrill ride action movie. It knows what it is and it sticks to it. I was really impressed when I found out most of it was actual stunts and not CGI, although what is CGI is really good. The fighting choreography and chase scenes are awesome. This movie is Junk Food for the brain (Thanks RD Jr. -Natural Born Killers). It was intense, and didn't slow down for a second. It is action packed from start to finish. Constant battles and chase scenes for 2 hours. It has an identity and it stuck to it. This movie is obviously not one of the best movies ever, but it is in a class of it's own, because I've never seen anything like it. I had a blast watching this movie and I bet you will too. *I was really surprised to see so many negative reviews on here. I'd give it a 9 overall, but a solid 10 in the Action genre.",10,2,8,5 November 2015
