Conquest 1453," Revolution in Turkish cinema
","A lot of reviewers have mentioned that this movie is historically inaccurate and that is correct. However, for the entertainment of the viewers this is acceptable. Primary intention of a movie with the exception of documentary's is not to inform viewers of the facts but entertain. Movies such as Braveheart and Gladiator are both historically inaccurate but are both one of the greatest films to date. In my opinion this is an entertaining movie but it is flawed. The story moves along extremely slowly. There are unnecessary monologues and scenes that do not affect the story which makes the movie longer than necessary. Directing of the movie is exceptional in some scenes but very dull in others; lacks consistency. In terms of acting performances are really good. Devrim Evin, the actor who brings to life Sultan Mehmet II does a really good job to show the confidence and determination of the character. The reason I believe this will revolutionise Turkish cinema is mainly because there has not been a drama that has excelled as much as Fetih 1453. The fact that it has reached an international scale is a huge step forward for Turkish cinema. This is not an all time great but is certainly worth watching.",8,6,12,31 December 2012
In Time," Exciting, Enjoyable and Frustrating
","In Time, is a very exciting movie. A thriller that has you rooting for the main characters and hoping nothing bad happens to them. The acting in this movie is not very good. Justin Timberlake's performance was average but he may improve has he continues in his career in acting. Amanda Seyfried's performance was disappointing and really didn't feel like she was a correct cast choice for the role she played. However, the story of the movie is different and keeps you thinking about how the world they exist in works. This is where the frustrating part enters as you start to find plot holes in your mind and certain stupid decisions characters make. These may be easy to overlook by some viewers and may not be for others. I gave it 8 out of 10 although there were flaws within the movie because I really enjoyed watching it and it kept me on my seat wanting more.",8,1,3,22 January 2012
