Walk the Line," such a well done movie
","Johnny Cash would have been proud of the marvelous job Joaquin Phoenix did. He truly lived and acted the part of Johnny. His actions so reminded me of the way Johnny Cash acted. He used to throw the guitar over his shoulder and his facial expression were like many of what I remember. His singing was marvelous as I feel no one could have sounded any closer to Johnny than he did.Reese Witherspoon did a great job singing, also. The love story between the 2 was incredible. There was never a dull moment and you just wanted to watch to see what was going to happen next. Have watched the movie 4 times and now want to buy it. The movie showed many of the Johnny's life's struggles I remember growing up as a kid.",10,0,0,19 March 2006
