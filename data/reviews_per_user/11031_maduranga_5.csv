Angels & Demons," Has sucked the essence out of the book and has thrown in away!
","First of all, I give this movie 8/10 because it is a good movie, for someone who hasn't read the book.Having said that, I think Dan Brown should sue these people for destroying such a amazing original storyline. The script writer has virtually taken out all the essence of the story, thrown it away and has written the script! The original story was so amazing and exceptional, because it was a good thriller, with a great emotional story in the background. The real story is not told in the movie! This is disgraceful! how could they demolish such an amazing story like this! whoever wrote the script should be branded!",8,2,3,23 May 2009
The Dark Knight," Dark Knight riding on the hype.
","I'm not trying to take anything away from this movie. It is good movie. But I wouldn't say it is the best superhero movie or the best movie of 2008. Maybe I was let down by all the hype thats been going around. maybe I would have had a better impression if I didn't read the comments here before I went to see the movie.First of all, this movie is about the 'JOKER'. Not Batman. If it wasn't for the Joker this movie wouldn't have been half interesting. For me, this movie is all about the Joker. Heath gives an exceptional performance. I'd say that's one of the best performances I've seen. Other than that, this is another better than average superhero flick.I'll just break down a few points:Acting: Except for Joker (who is extraordinary), others give a good performance. Nothing special.Story: Good plot.Special effects: BELOW AVERAGE! This is where it really let me down. This is a superhero flick. Superheroes are ppl who do things normal ppl cannot do. They do things ppl don;t see in their everyday lives. For me, special effects are the main reason why I would go to see a superhero movie. And Dark Knight just don't have anything. It does. But if you compare to flicks like Spider-man, Dark Knight is miles away. Very very few action in this film. I wanted to see more of Batmobile. More explosions. More flying. This just don't have any.This is a good movie. But its just not that extraordinary as its fans want you to believe.",7,7,16,21 August 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Do not miss the chance to watch this on big screen
","This has to be one of the best action movies ever! I loved every minute of it. From start to finish it's all about robots and explosions! on the other hand, my wife who went along with me, found it boring. But she is a big fan Twilight! So let me tell you this. People who don't like this movie, are the kind of people who like lame movies like Twilight.Do not watch this movie in your TV. If there is one film that must be watched in big screen. this is it! The CG is absolutely amazing. Frankly I have no idea how they do it. It's just amazing. Do not miss the chance to watch this movie in theaters.",10,2,7,13 July 2009
Hancock," I need 20 stars for this because I gave 5 stars to 'The Dark Knight'
","Hancock is the real deal. I'm a fan of Spiderman but I gotta say Hancock pretty much beats it for me. First kudos to whoever came up with this story for going away from stereotype everybody-loves-the-superhero.Hancock has it all. Recently we have seen flicks like Spiderman-3 losing itself in everything else by going to make it big in special-effects. Although I will never ever understand how The Dark Knight got to be such a hit, it didn't have a plausible plot(although many claim that the story was the strongest aspect of the movie) or the big-budget special effects.But Hancock delivers it all. I cannot understand why it did not make it big like Spiderman or Dark Knight or Iron Man. Because this movie is right up there with the others, if not above.Hancock has everything in it. Nice story with good special effects and humor. And its Will Smith! He delivers all the time! This is a must-see movie! for everybody!",10,1,3,12 October 2008
The Ugly Truth," A cheap rip off of 'Hitch'
","This movie reminded me of Hitch in many ways... but it was a lame effort... I am a big fan of Butler in 300 but he simply sucks in this.. Butler is not cut out for this kind of cool, funny guy character... he is no Will Smith... He cannot deliver a Will Smith... I don't know if it's the fault of Butler or the director but Butler's character falls flat here... And Heigl is no exception either... But I did not expect anything more from her anyway...The story is pretty lame... the acting is way too cheesy.. it felt like a teenage movie only except there were grown up people acting like teenagers... pathetic effort... I hope Butler would not take up anymore of this kind of characters...",2,6,11,4 November 2009
