The Blair Witch Project," NOT scary & NOT original
","I registered with IMDb purposely just to trash this film. I have never felt a movie so undeserving of praise than this one. I see no point as to why it was made or why people like it. If you liked it, good for you, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I however did not.I take offense to the suggestion that people who don't like this movie are somehow less intelligent or imaginative than those who did. I guess it takes more to spark my imagination than a carefully-constructed hype campaign and the inability to make the audience suspend disbelief. I fully wanted and expected to be scared and be swept away into the story. Alas, there was nothing to be scared of, and no story: only 3 kids screaming obsenities at each other. At no time did these characters make me think they were real. To anyone who thought this was a real documentary for a microsecond, I truly feel sorry for you. Never have I believed more strongly than now that film critics are just a bunch of group-think cretins, who use their pony-tails as antennas for the brain police to download ideas into their empty heads. The critical response to this failure proves it.I was going to give this film points for originality, but these charlatans of the cinema, Sanchez and Myrick, ripped off the concept itself from 'The Last Broadcast.'

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars, what do you expect!?
","People expecting the Second Coming will be disappointed by Episode I. Even Lucas himself said so. But it's a great film! Look past all the frivolous complaints about the film and realize how thoughtful and well put-together it is. Look past your own preconceptions and what you THINK Star Wars should be about, and enjoy the history of this epic story that we already know.Yeah, it's got flaws! Like all Star Wars movies. People look at these films as if they are divine and flawless, but have you watched the original films lately!? I'll take Jar-Jar Binks' mutterings in Episode I over Luke's whining in Episode IV any day!How viewers can bash this rich and stunning work of art, and praise garbage like 'The Blair Witch Project' is beyond my powers of comprehension.",10,0,0,6 August 1999
