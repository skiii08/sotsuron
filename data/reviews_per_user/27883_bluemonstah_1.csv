The Ring," Very scary, but leaves you with lots of unanswered questions
","Without doubt, I can call this movie the scariest to hit the theaters this year. A must-watch if you're a fan of horror movies. Or even if you're a viewer like me that goes in to watch the movie not knowing the genre, and ends up watching the movie holding onto the person that came with you because you're freaked out.The direction is great, and unlike some other gory and scary movies *cough*Ghost Ship*cough*, there is actually a plausible story...one that should have ended 10 minutes before it actually did though. Those last ten minutes in the movie changed the rating I gave it from a 9 to a 7. Those last 10 minutes without which the movie would have a near great ending.Walking out of the movie with a heartbeat that slowly returns to almost-normal, you think back about the images that the movie left you with in your head that will haunt you for a couple more days, and all the unanswered questions that you hear everyone around you ask. Where did that videotape come from? Who shot it? Who is the little girl? How did the old man know about the tape? How does the little boy know everything? Why did they decide to call the movie 'the ring'? Why didn't they use pictures of David Hasselhoff to create some of the scary party in the movie? Why do the Germans love him so much?A strong 7.5/10. If you plan to go to dinner after the movie, forget it. If you ate dinner before the movie, carry a brown bag.",7,0,0,10 November 2002
