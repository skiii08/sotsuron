Kill Bill: Vol. 2," If Your Into Polar Ends of a Movie...
","This movie is not on par at all with the action of the first one, so if your in it for the gore and decapitated heads-- save yourself the money. However, if your interested in the actual feelings of the characters, this provides plenty more. Overall though, as a story on its own, I'd say this isn't anything remarkable, and I think if it is incredibly acclaimed it's because of Tarantino's acclaim. Ultimately though, if you buy both the DVDs, I think being able to watch polar ends of a movie from the absence of conscience to the desperation at motherhood-- it is a pleasant thing to watch. But once again, even in that way, I'd say this is a pretty good movie, just nothing awe-inspiring, like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. (Although some of the dialogue in this film was classic Quentin Tarantino, and only felt refreshing, not dulled.)",7,1,3,16 April 2004
