Ali," Well worth a look.
","I can't believe the amount of bad-mouthing this movie is getting from IMDb users. Do you not get the point of a Biopic? This is a fraction of the life of Ali, this is an insight into his life - it is not trying to give you an understanding of the man. Michael Mann is showing you what the guy did, and allowing you to make up your own mind whether you want to like him or not. why do you have to care about him? So he's a womaniser... so what? he's a boxer - the GREATEST boxer. the guy has flaws - like any other human being. thats what makes the movie so accessible, and so great - you see the man for who he is: his beliefs, his desires, his ambitions, his loves and his hates. Kudos to Will Smith for an Oscar-worthy performance, and for Mann who allows the film to show a man holding on to as many of his principals as he can - failing in some, succeeding in others. Yes, it may be too long, and it will alienate some of the audience, but the audience who DOES get that a film doesnt ALWAYS need a plot which starts at A and ends at B with closure and a happy resolution, will enjoy this film for a its quality direction, performances and stronghold on the material to produce a great film.",10,0,0,10 February 2002
Memento," intriguing, funny, and fascinating.
","Memento is a film which i will always remember for the feeling i got as i walked out the cinema where i saw it. it was one with a smile, but a feeling which i cannot describe. some films make you go 'wow!' with wonder, or satisfaction, or just blow you away. This film does all that, but adds incompleteness, and ambiguity to it. An 'ending' where the facts are unclear, and leaves the viewer in the same state of mind as the central character, might leave some members of the audience unsatisfied. However, i revelled in this and was delighted with the whole experience.
Guy Pearce made his character his own, and plays the part with great deal of innocence, charm, and humour. His comic timing is surprisingly good. His two co-stars, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Ann Moss, are both very good, and add to the mystery, which unfolds in an interesting structure.
The people out there who do not like original films, do not like to see films which don't adhere to hollywoods guidelines (i.e. a film starting at the start, ending at the end, with a happy note, and want things to be 'normal') then be warned: you're most likely not to enjoy this film, because it is different in many respects, and better off because of it.Christopher Nolan is a Britsh director, who with this film is a name to watch out for in the future. Word of mouth is out on this film, and is enjoying a good audience here in Britain. It didnt do too well in America but with Oscar nominations (God willing), should see it do well on video, and DVD. Memento is a film which i do like a great deal. Watch it, and you will be rewarded but a breathtaking experience.",10,0,0,23 November 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," top notch rom-com, but not quite as good as the book
","Bridget Jones' Diary is a magic book, and a darn good film.
Renee Zellweger is a VERY good Bridget, and manages (only just, mind) not to have the show stolen from her by Hugh Grant who is positively hilarious as the 'cad' who sleeps with Bridget. all the cast and crew have done a great job, but the most credit must go to the writing team who have adapted the book which must, at first, have posed some difficulty since it is in the form of a diary (funny, that).However, i have to mention the best fight scene in cinema's history - look out for it - you will not be disappointed. absolutely hilarious.grab your girl/boy-friend, see this movie, and you'll have a great 90mins.",9,0,0,22 April 2001
Good Will Hunting," super cinema
","Good Will Hunting is a really good story, which makes for perfect cinema. A good story, a great script, and a super cast, with a fine director in touch with the material. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have concocted a great script which is both endearing and funny, while involving for the audience. Damon was fortunate to get the part of Will Hunting, but Affleck does show great class in the small role he has as Will's best friend Chuckie. The acting, in fact is one of my favourite aspects of the film. Damon is a revelation in his role as the confused and bitter Will, who struggles to let anyone in his life, or get under his Boston skin. An Oscar nomination was justified. Williams achieves a career high with his portrayal of the shrink who helps Will find direction, while also allowing himself find direction too. Williams is perfect for the role, showing great vulnerability, and a soft underbelly. The bench scene where he has a two-minute take with Damon, telling him he's never experienced life outside of Boston, is a moving and enlightening scene made special by Williams. He deserves his Oscar. Minnie Driver was fortunate to get an oscar nomination, but she does show great feeling, and her part was well written to allow her space to make the part her own. She has an expressive face perfect for acting, and she does a good job.Gus van Sant takes rather a back seat here, visually, to concentrate on the material and acting. He lets the actors show off their talent, and does a remarkable job in bringing out the best in them. Danny Elfmans score is low-key and carries his trademark, if bearing a theme or two from braveheart from time to time.Good Will Hunting is a great film, full of emotion, and humour and carries a great story along, which everyone can learn from. The characters are original, and the acting is stupendous. This is a must see film, purely because of its sheer class in every department.",10,0,2,4 December 2000
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An experience to rival falling in love
","Seeing Eternal Sunshine created a drunken experience which I haven't had, when I've been sober, before. This film gave me a smile which lasted two hours. Winslet's Clementine powered the movie projector with her electricity, and Carrey's subdued Joel was an everyman that even Tom Hanks or Jimmy Stewart couldn't pull off. I love this movie, I'm so glad I saw it with my fiancée, even if she didn't love it as much as I did. This is what cinema should be doing. Escapism for the intellectually thirsty.",10,0,1,2 April 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," a film to treasure
","The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films which will stick with you for the rest of your life. You'll always remember it, think of it fondly, and smile when you think of the best parts of the film. Many films come and go in your memory (will you honestly look back at a film like Armageddon and think of it in the same light? I hope not), but this is one which has become great, and will become greater with time.Everyone knows the story, so I will save time relating that to you, but I will say that the story has many levels to it, which are not as obvious to some viewers. The multitude of characters which the story gives us all have meaning and consequences to the two central characters, Andy and Red. (Think about the references to/theme of birds). All the characters are a pleasure to watch, and come to life by the actors. However, the actors inhabit their roles so well, its hard to see them in different roles now.Tim Robbins was unfortunate not to be nominated for any other award than the screen actors guild award, because he brought such weight and balance to the film, where Morgan Freeman had the slightly more showy role, bringing dignity and honesty to it. I think any nomination or award for either of the actors should have been shared.Frank Darabont is a talented director who has a good eye for what looks good on screen, has a way with his actors to produce the best out of them, understands how to tell a good story, and is likely to produce fine pieces of work in the future.I have always loved this film, and the story is just one which warms the heart and blood just thinking about it.",10,0,0,10 November 2000
The Thin Red Line," the war film genre given a new landmark
","Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line has quickly become my favourite film of all time. I didnt feel this way after seeing it for the first time, but the thing with this film is that it works into you. a day after you've seen it, you're still thinking about it. it was the same with Saving Private Ryan, but in a different way.Where as with Ryan, you were more affected by its horror, The Thin Red Line makes you think differently about war, and its effects on the lives of the soldiers, and the crime war is against nature. or is it a crime against nature? is it just that war is part of our nature, and we can do nothing to stop it?These are the questions that The Thin Red Line asks, literally, and various characters have voice overs during the film, which keeps the audience thinking and mulling over.I really enjoyed the variety of characters which Malick has withdrawn from the novel by James Jones novel. all interesting in their own way, especially Private Witt (jim caviezel), and his fascination with death.To top off a fantastic film, the direction is visually stunning aided by superb cinematography from John toll, who won two Oscars in a row for Legends of the Fall, and Braveheart. He should have won again, but lost out to Saving Private Ryan. If you have to see one war film in your life... make it The Thin Red Line. This is the film which blows me away every time i watch it.",10,2,5,8 November 2000
Born on the Fourth of July," Cruise's finest hour.
","Born on the fourth of July is, to use a chiché, a Powerhouse film: a film full of weight, from Cruise's knockout performance, Stone's bold script and Direction, Richardson's classy photography to Williams pitch-perfect score.
Tom cruise portrays Ron Kovic with astonishing depth, showing the naive idealism from when he was 17 with eager enthusiasm, through to the bitter war veteran with political ambitions. Cruise delivers a fine performance, my favourite of his, because of the gritty emotion he shows through out. The disillusionment, the pain of going through hospital treatment, the depression, the anger in demonstrating, ALL that he suffers, we feel too because of the writing in cruise's character's script, because of Stone's direction, and because of Cruises acting. This is his finest hour.
Born on the fourth of July is not a happy trip, but by the end of the film you are not depressed, you are left wondering and bewildered at the experience of one man, Ron Kovic (who co-wrote the script), and the pain, suffering and re-building which his life had to endure.
a must see for any cruise fan (who doesnt mind him a bit uglified) and anyone who appreciates good acting and direction from a director in his prime (for which Stone was rewarded an Oscar).",10,1,1,30 November 2000
