Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The critics get it wrong yet again
","I went in expecting to be disappointed, after the trashing the majority of the critics gave this movie. I came out quite happy actually, and so will you, probably.While it's not on par with 'Curse' and not as humorous as the previous trilogy, it's still got more focus and less film-flam than the last two entries. At two hours it might seem a little long, but it's all full of story - a straightforward, focused story that maintains pace and direction throughout. The start is a little fuzzy, but by half way through the train is well on the right track.Nice.Most of the jokes fall to Depp who does a stirling job with Sparrow, whilst the tone of the rest is somewhat more adult, by which I mean 'grown-up' as opposed to anything else. Less silliness. That's not a bad thing - I found the more adult nature of the film to be quite satisfying. There is plenty of adventure to be had here.It also doesn't have Keira Knightley or Orlando Bloom in it. Another plus.Penelope Cruz is feisty and sexy and everything Knightley wasn't, though if anything Ian McShane could have been a lot more intimidating than he was. That said, he was adept at barking orders and being reasonably menacing, though his relationship with his ship could have been expanded a little. Geoffrey Rush made the most of his diminished role, and the way his story is resolved, despite it looking a little silly at the start, is quite neat.All in all this is a satisfying entry into the series and proof yet again of how the cynical critics are out of touch with the wider audience.",7,0,1,27 May 2011
The New World," Good, although laboured and ponderous
","You have to be really, really in a precise mood to watch this movie and get the most out of it. Malick's style is very prevalent and instantly recognisable to anyone who has watched The Thin Red Line (shots of nature, character narrations), which is a more fulfilling film in my view. The premise is a love story between the famous explorer John Smith and the impudent Pocahontas set against the backdrop of the beginnings of a new nation. The story takes its time and never feels forced, but is quite poorly paced and feels laboured and a bit overwrought. If you want to watch this movie, bear in mind what you're in for - a slow burning romantic drama which is beautifully filmed and masterfully crafted, though it does take a good bit of effort to sit through the whole thing.",6,0,3,16 October 2006
Alien 3," What happened?
","**POSSIBLE SPOILER**The link between this film and Aliens is really, really weak. An egg 'somehow' just manages to make it past everyone's attention and get Ripley (don't know if that's a spoiler or not). How in God's green Earth did the queen alien lay an egg there after Ripley blew the sod clean out of the egg sac in Aliens? Besides, I thought facehuggers died after they got their victims, rather than go get another one. This film makes Aliens seem like an awful, or should I say great big, waste of time, in that Hicks and Newt cop it at the start. Why? Another thing I've noticed in these films is that EVERY one has to have an alien exploding from something's chest, and EVERY one has to have an android in it. Not bad, necessarily, but unoriginal. Aside from these comments, I thought Alien 3 was a mediocre film. Easily comparable to the original, it's horror is darker and more 'Apocalyptic' than it's predecessors. The best thing about this film, I thought, was that it had the perfect ending for a trilogy, then those stupid people had to bring her back for Resurrection.",Null,1,2,4 July 2000
Mission: Impossible III," Hi-Octane, Action Packed, Roller-coaster Ride, name your clich√©...
","I had reasonably high expectations for this seeing as our man JJ Abrams was behind it, and I'm not disappointed. Viewers will be taken on a very thrilling and enjoyable ride through the world of fantasy international espionage. It's a bit like a mix of the previous instalments - smart enough with lots of good action. Some of the writing is particularly sparkling with freshness. Abrams creates moments of tension that are so involving that you can feel your butt-cheeks tightening up on your seat.Love him or hate him, Tom Cruise does his usual best as Ethan Hunt with good old reliable Ving Rhames as his ever-cool intel guy. Hoffman was understatedly excellent in his role as the villain, whilst Crudup and Fishburne did their thing, although there was some lack of character.Some influences from Lost are apparent, not least the music (which is neither surprising nor a bad thing). There is the traditional M:I twist involved which is a bit confusing, but if you think hard enough you should be able to get it. Special effects were excellent, especially with a certain item that occurs in each of the movies.The ending was...well it's JJ Abrams and co., and when you watch Lost there are more questions than answers. All in all definitely worth seeing regardless of what you think of Cruise and his recent antics, a good night-out movie full to the brim with action and suspense. 7/10.",7,0,0,14 May 2006
The 13th Warrior," Disappointing
","When the film started I got pretty high hopes for what I was about to see. Most of this was, regrettably, in vain. It was a forgettable adventure in my books,not entirely rubbish, but most of it, and the end where the big warrior guy was killed was a real anticlimax.Another thing I found really really really annoying about this fil was the fact that I could see next to nothing on the screen. All th action scenes were too dark, and the cinematography was all over the place. I only knew what was happening in those scenes because of the grunts and screams and roars and crunches coming along from the speakers. I JUST COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING!! The only bit that I could see that I remember was the decapitation of the guy when the cannibals attacked the first night.I understand that Crichton and McTiernan had a falling out on set. I wonder why.",Null,0,0,6 May 2000
Coffee and Cigarettes," Hit and Miss
","I went to the screening of this tonight in a university cinema (not my first time to this venue I might add) and was very wary of the fact that I would be surrounded by film students who, as with several previous occasions, would most likely find the slightest comical thing the funniest thing in the world. I know, I shouldn't go there if I despise it so much, but this was the only place showing the film.Anyways, I was interested to see Jarmusch's C&C trilogy put together into one lump. The film consists of pretty much the usual pointless conversations you would have with a friend or someone you had to meet for some reason in a coffee shop.Things I liked: Dialogue repeated by different actors in different stories, the link with the checkered coffee table in each story, the interesting paradox with Molina/Coogan discussing making a movie, 'Those Thingsll Kill Ya', 'Delerium', Steve Buscemi and Bill Murray. I also enjoyed this idea of letting us be a part of these conversations - to take us into the world we already know albeit through film.Things I didn't like: 'Renee' - a boring, unfunny and pointless waste of eye strain (maybe it wasn't supposed to be funny, but even so I couldn't bring myself to like it), the length of some of the stories (eg. 'Cousins?'), the general pointlessness of most of it and the irritating film students.Good to see all these famous actors in such a low-key film, and an interesting way to pass some time, but it was in the end a hit and miss affair in this reviewer's opinion.",Null,3,6,21 November 2004
Silent Hill," On par with Resident Evil, if not slightly better
","Saw this last night - my hopes were reasonably moderate given that I'd been looking forward to it since discovering Roger Avary and Christophe Gans were involved, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. That's not to say I thought it was fantastic - there was a fair bit of bad stuff in it, such as Radha Mitchell's unconvincing acting and some of the lines she was given, and the whole Sean Bean part which was tacked on at the studio's 'request'.That said, it was very enjoyable, freaky and disturbing enough with a cracking climax, although the end was slightly annoying. A lot of people said they were confused - it's not really that confusing as long as you take a moment to think about who's who and whats happening. Just think of parallel dimensions and manifestations of spirits etc. I have to say the climax (as opposed to the end) was definitely memorable. Also, Gans demonstrates his amazing eye for aesthetics, and the sound design is also excellent. I'd give it 6.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 7) - one of the better game adaptations yet.",7,1,3,24 April 2006
Alien," One of Ridley Scott's greatest achievements
","I liked many things about this film that make it unique from the others, and contribute to the tension in the atmosphere. Firstly, the miniscule cast. It consisted of nine people, including the alien and the cat (not really a person), whom we really get to know and relate to. The characters are well developed, the acting fine. Next, the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere. Everything that goes on is in the same ship, making for (almost) no escape, hence the claustrophobic effect. When some of the crew check out the alien ship, the atmosphere is very tense as we don't know what will happen next. Next, the way it didn't feel staged in any way. It felt REAL, which was the whole point. The conversations weren't just one person talking at a time, rather several at once. This contributes to the realistic ambience making it generally more terrifying. It has to be said, the alien has to be one of the most intimidating ever designed, with it's double mouth etc. I'd be scared out of my wits if I came into contact with something such as that! The excellent camerawork was a brilliant contribution to the chaotic feeling surrounding the events, it that it was very rough and raw, making us feel like we're there and that this is no simple studio production (it almost feels documentary-esque). One final thing would be to mention Jerry Goldsmith's amazing score for the film. It was a completely new genre of score, unorthodox in every sense, dark, haunting, chilling, you think of it it draws it out from you. Definitely not an action score. The imagination in this film is overwhelming, for example, the android, the alien (obviously), the conspiracy (is that a spoiler?), the ship, the hypersleep, EVERYTHING!!. That's what makes this film so great. It is the pioneer of its genre, and as such is is unparalleled by anything else. As a butter advert on the TV once said: 'Often copied, but never equalled'",9,1,2,5 July 2000
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Doesn't 'cut it' for me
","I'm not a big fan of musicals unless the music isn't typically that of a musical if you get me - for example The Blues Brothers, O Brother Where Art Thou and Chicago are amongst my favourites in the genre.What do I not like about this movie - I felt that it was poorly paced, spent too long on certain plot points that could have been covered more efficiently and the character setup was a bit slow. The music I found wasn't particularly memorable and conflicted with the dark tone of the story and characters too much to pull me into the universe. I did notice that some themes were reprised at different points to make an emotional and musical mark, which is good musical practice, but a day after having seen it I can't recite a single bar from it.What does it have going for it then? Well it looks fantastic, very grim and dirty. Performances from the leads - Bonham Carter, Depp, Spall, Rickman, Baron Cohen - were good and committed. It was also a good choice to have the actors do their own singing, to make it a bit more believable. The killing scenes were disturbing, which is a good thing as that is what you'd be looking for in this kind of deal, and sometimes they were dealt with a bit of black humour, also a good thing. I thought that the final frames, even though they were grisly, were beautiful and poignant.All in all a mixed bag for newbies. If you like musicals, worth a watch. If you're already a fan of the musical, worth a watch. If you're not fussed on musicals, there's probably still something in it to make it worth going to see.",6,0,2,26 January 2008
Ocean's Thirteen," Slick, cool, funny and fun - just what you ordered.
","I saw the first one, didn't see the second, then I saw this. It was a Sunday night out to the cinema, and I wanted something relaxed and entertaining. This film fitted the bill perfectly. It has Soderbergh's clear taste for style present with all his wonderful imagery and colour schemes everywhere, David Holmes' sassy soundtrack complimenting the cool subject matter and Eddie Izzard of all people!The setup is a little hard to follow with some quick-cut editing and fast talking in the planning stage, but after that the rest runs as smooth as silk. Perhaps a little too smooth - some things seemed a little convenient and nothing seemed to go wrong, i.e. there was no sense of threat or danger. The ensemble cast is fantastic to see but they all seemed a little too comfortable and devoid of character (even Pacino) but these are the only things that seem to detract from this great piece of entertainment.It's funny, both witty and slightly goofy, visually stimulating and downright cool and entertaining, just what the doctor ordered. I can't really compare this to the second one as I haven't seen it, but I really enjoyed this one.",7,0,2,10 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," My favourite film outing of all time
","It's 3.20 am on Thursday 16th May 2002, and I'm barely in the door from just seeing a the first official showing of AOTC in Northern Ireland, and my heart is pounding and my smile is fixed. I guess this means I got to see it before you guys in the US :)Two screens in the cinema are showing the film at the same time, and you can tell the fans booked theirs really early, as all the t-shirts, pony tails, guts and babbling conversations about a certain one on one between two masters of the Jedi art are in screen 1 - my screen. One guy dressed as Darth Vader walks in and out of the auditorium to the immense delight of the crowd, resulting in the unknown hero receiving a massive applause. As you may guess, the atmosphere is simply electric.The film starts, the music pounds our eardrums, and we are ecstatic to see the trademark yellow story card scroll into space before our very eyes. It's been three long years...we don't know what to expect after the last drab episode.At long last we have what we wanted - comedy, romance, mythology and lashings and lashings of cold, hard action (not to mention a great deal of irony). Shortly after two hours has passed something happens on screen that makes every single living soul in the audience shift in their seats....the legendary fight between Yoda and Dooku. I will not spoil it, but I will say that this alone was worth the price of admission.I left the cinema fulfilled and refreshed, kind of surprising for the time of day. I say my favourite film outing of all time not just because of the film (which, admittedly, has faults), but because of the great feeling of the unspoken union between all people there watching the magic on the silver screen.",Null,0,0,15 May 2002
U-571," Brilliant all the way
","This film is by far the best I've seen all year, barring maybe Gladiator. From beginning to end, it just refuses to hang about. And the excellent thing about it was that there was plot and character development through this speed, a feat some might find impossible, or at least very hard! Jonathan Mostow is really one to watch. His previous film, Breakdown, was good too.This film had a certain authenticity about it that separates it from all the other sub films (except Das Boot perhaps, haven't seen it though). I think my seat was beginning to buckle with my entire weight being on the edge of it through the whole film! Ultimate tension, ultimate unpredictability and ultimate in a constantly twisting and turning storyline. Great acting, great music, great atmosphere, this film is not one to be missed. The naval battles were also extremely well put together, you'd be forgiven for mistaking them for real wartime footage!",Null,0,1,5 September 2000
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Potter grows up
","So far, I think I have to say that this episode of the Harry Potter series is my favourite. Radcliffe has obviously gained more experience in acting and it shows on the screen. A lot of Rowling's imaginative material has been portrayed excellently on the screen, for the film is visually striking. This is a very tightly made film and everything makes sense, even at points where you think it might falter.Some of Cuaron's visual themes are maintained consistently throughout the film - innovative camera angles, imaginative shots, Looney-Tunes type fades between scenes - this all makes for a pleasant night's viewing. John Williams' music is as dependable as ever, the effects are excellent and the characters are well portrayed, although I have to say at certain times major plot points were rushed past us and I couldn't take them all in (2 points in particular) so I was a little befuddled with the specifics but I at least got the general idea. I suppose if I said that to someone who has read the book I would get a bit of ridicule...",Null,0,0,3 June 2004
Aliens," Great show, one minor thing though...
","** POSSIBLE SPOILER **... at the end of the film, where Ripley has to blow the place sky high, I couldn't help feeling that I'd seen this all before in the original Alien. Look at the similarities, having to go back in to find someone/thing (i.e. Jones the cat from the original, Newt from this one), blowing the place up in the end, and when everything seems fine, it turns out that the alien (THE alien in the original, the queen in this one) has followed them back to their ship (i.e shuttle in Alien, carrier in Aliens). That's about the only thing I found worth mentioning that was 'not good' (as opposed to bad). Otherwise the film was great, gripping from the beginning, and dovetails nicely with the original film, unlike this and Alien 3, the link between them being so weak it's stupid. I have to say I loved James Horner's score. Great, dramatic stuff. This film didn't, overall, have the same ambience about it as the original did, but the difference is not bad. There. I have made my peace.",Null,0,0,4 July 2000
Alien vs. Predator," Lo and behold!! It's actually OK!!
","I'll admit that this film is not perfect - it comes with plot holes, thin characters, some dire dialogue, but at the end of the day this film does pretty much what it's meant to do - ENTERTAIN you.Okay, so I went into the cinema expecting something rather naff, this being the result of watching Anderson's previous efforts and stupidly heeding fanboy reviews from the <sarcasm> oh-so-objective </sarcasm> 'comic book store guy-esque' majority of IMDb reviewers. At least I was smart enough to go in and have to ability to make up my own mind about it. Or to not download it like the cheapskate nerdboys (and girls) that feel so inferior that they have to get their opinions out there first so that they feel they're important and are so great because they've seen the film 'before everyone else'.Enough ranting - the bottom line, in this reviewer's opinion (at least I'm objective enough to know that it is, after all, my OPINION), is that this movie isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. There are moments of tension, suspense, comic relief, nods to the original movies, and some great action - enough to keep you entertained for the whole trip. As I said before, I didn't think it was perfect, there was some dire dialogue and the characters were almost non-existent, and I didn't find Colin Salmon that appealing (although I thought he was better than he was in Resident Evil). I found it entertaining enough to get past these Lucas-esque artifacts though.See it for yourself!",Null,0,0,24 October 2004
Batman Begins," I love this movie - Batman finally gets his proper treatment
","I am a big Christopher Nolan fan, so when I heard he was making this movie, I was excited. When I finally saw it tonight, I was definitely not disappointed. I was gripped from the opening shots. Witty, ironic humour mixed with drama and excellent action all made for a gripping tale for this soul. To me, Bale looked fantastic in the bat suit - so much so that it didn't look like Bale at all. I thought the rest of the cast were perfectly placed, particularly Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. As a fellow Ulsterman, I was very happy to see Liam Neeson doing his thing here. Cillian Murphy was very good as well, as far as I'm concerned - he was the source of some quite chilling moments. There are some nice twists along the way.I hope they make a sequel - the ending is quite ambiguous...",9,5,7,16 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Great tense stuff
","I love this film to bits. Spielberg, Williams and Kaminski strike again with this great WWII front line drama. All actors were excellent in their roles, and I think Hanks was stiffed at the Oscars. I especially liked the beginning of the D-Day landing scene, with Hanks and co. in the transporter. At that point you can really feel the tension building up, mainly because of the shots of the soldiers faces as they waited to hit the beach. The suspense of the situation really built up when you could hear the bullets clanging against the ramp on the front of the transporter, and it was just sheer terror when the ramp fell and the guys at the front were riddled with bullets. The point is, Spielberg makes the audience feel like they're one of the soldiers on the transporter, and I was no exception. I got the real feeling of not wanting to be one of the soldiers there. The length of the landing scene was quite long, getting you into the feel of the time scale. The blood and gore was necessary to depict how horrible this scene was. The thing is, that's what it was really like.Granted, it does get a bit slow when they start looking for Ryan, but not to the point where you're bored enough to want out of the cinema. The bonding between the soldiers in the squad is also highlighted in the film, Corporal Upham for example, being excluded by the others at the start, and by the end is joining in with the lingo (i.e., 'foobar'). The ending tugged on the heart strings plenty, and it shows that Hanks' character was no hero, but a normal human being, hesitating to put his life on the line for another (cf. 'earn this'). The overall effect of this film is pure anti-war.John Williams' score was excellent as usual, and the fact that there was no music in the battle scenes was a good move, so that the audience can concentrate on the action. Kaminski's shots were just genius, his freehand style instantly recognisable, giving a real feeling of terrifying action and movement at the start and end of the film. This film was stiffed at the Oscars. Mark my words.",10,2,4,3 February 2000
Saving Private Ryan," American writers these days
","I typed a comment about this before, and now I've had time to rethink it. There is only one major source for my distaste for this movie - Robert Rodat. He trashes almost every country he can when he can except America, which he tries to make out as brilliant and valiant and heroic etc. I mean, where were the other armies at the D-Day landings? It wasn't just the Yanks who landed there! And Monty overrated? Come on Robert! The fact that this guy wrote The Patriot only shows his ignorant Brit-dissing even more. Randall Wallace is another culprit of this super duper pro-American-anti-everyone-else sentiment. I mean in Braveheart the Brits are made out to be totally evil, which is just pure rubbish. Plus he scripted Pearl Harbor, which did its damnedest to make the Americans not look stupid over the attack - the only good movie about Pearl Harbor is Tora! Tora! Tora!, which got it's history correct down to the smallest detail.My major gripe said, this film is gripping from start to finish. The tension really builds up in the landing craft at the start, and the landings really do stun you. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork is a great defining feature of this movie and deservedly won an Oscar. John Williams' score wasn't very apparent, but when it was it was effective enough but rather repetitive. The characters and the moral question behind the story are also well put out to dry, as in why several soldiers for one? And Captain Miller's last words really do express how he felt about going to save Private Ryan.All in all by my reckoning, a half decent war movie that is needlessly pro-American and disses other countries. Mind you, this is probably the main reason it won any Oscars.",10,0,2,8 July 2001
Ghost Rider," Entertaining but lacks soul, ironically...
","I walked into a showing of Ghost Rider with the baggage of the bad reviews and other comments weighing on my subconscious, so I tried to leave my brain at the door and just enjoy it for what it was. I'm glad I did. There were plot holes, dodgy acting, lacks of character...but at the end of the day I was there for the action, the effects and the fun.Nic Cage for me didn't seem to really believe in his role - he sort of spoke his lines and...well that's about it, he spoke his lines. Eva Mendes was better, with more conviction, as well as a considerable cleavage which I wasn't going to complain about. Were the huge dollops of silly outweighed by the entertainment of the show? I'm not so sure.All in all I was entertained but not particularly stimulated by the movie. It's a Saturday night out (or in with a beer) kind of flick - unoffensive fun with great effects. Ultimately it just depends what you're looking for.",6,0,1,11 March 2007
Schindler's List," Unforgettable
","In a sentence, this film was excellence. Spielberg depicts the plight of the Jews in the WWII Holocaust era with a frightening amount of detail, and thus ensures that we don't easily forget what they were put through. I liked the way it was shot in B&W, as Spielberg knows that most people have only seen the war in B&W (on TV and the like), which a lot of people seem to fail to realise. Also, when he does add colour, it gives the audience a lasting impression.The cast was wonderful, the three main leads being excellent in their performances (Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes) and the supporting cast were just as good. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork was brilliant. John Williams score was incredibly moving, and deserved the Oscar. The music is easily related to Jewish styles of the period. On the whole, a brilliant film, unforgettable, and a lesson to all. It shows that even the most hardened people can change.",10,211,408,29 January 2000
Transformers," Tremendous fun
","I've been looking forward to this movie ever since they started thinking about it. I had such high hopes, then they announced that Michael Bay was going to do it. There was a collective 'Uh-Oh' from everyone at this announcement given the trail of bad movies he's given us over the years. Over the course of production, the scares kept coming - Megatron's design, no Frank Welker, no Soundwave, Optimus as a different style of truck etc. Hopes started to become dashed. Until the movie came out.I went to a special preview screening, found a good seat and sat down to enjoy the show, trying to forget all the negativity surrounding the movie and trying to clear my head to have an open mind. The film started. From the very opening moment when Optimus Prime started speaking, I was smiling from ear to ear. Optimus is back! So many memories and feelings flood back to me.Bay made a good decision in getting stuck straight into the action. When I saw the very first transformation I just went 'wow' in the cinema from the awe of watching it happen. The effects were amazing. All the transformations were amazing, for that matter.The film was also really funny - funnier than I expected. Shia LaBoeuf does a fantastic job as the awkward hormonal teenager Sam and puts in a really convincing and funny performance. Josh Duhamel is passable as the typical standard GI Joe movie marine, though thankfully keeping his shouts of 'move' and 'go go go!' etc. to a minimum. Jon Voight is...well...Jon Voight. He's not bad, but his character is one of those that won't exactly stick in your head. John Turturro was incredibly funny as the Sector 7 agent Simmons, very over the top, although perhaps a little miscast. Megan Fox is true to her name as the human eye candy in the movie with an interesting back story, though her acting impact is perhaps less potent than that of Shia's. There is a very funny scene with her in Sam's bedroom though. Bernie Mac is also a legend.Who cares about the humans though? We're here for the robots! The transformations were all amazing. The effects are really second to none. Megatron's design was interesting - I didn't think it was great but I'm sure it could have been a lot worse. Frenzy is funny as the angry little spy robot. Prime is brilliant and exudes leadership, but the lips thing...I'm sorry, but it just didn't wash. However, he speaks his lines like we all remember him, especially those lines that are little nods to the original series. Hugo Weaving does an alright job as the voice of Megatron, but I didn't feel it was particularly menacing - more like a standard bad guy voice.There are a few gripes I have with the movie - not enough Megatron, not enough Starscream, the lubricant thing, Prime's lips, calling Brawl Devastator instead, the lack of the original theme music in any form outside the credits, the obvious product placement (some parts look like pure car adverts), the thinness of the other human plots (the hacker group working on the sound was pure silly) and sometimes the screen was just a little too busy.Despite all this, the movie is clearly and easily Bay's best. Say what you want about him, he's given us some awful trash in the past, but occasionally he can put in some nice touches and exciting action, and this movie is tailor made for him. Do not expect the next Citizen Kane or Star Wars - just go in and have some fun. Well worth a watch.Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.",7,6,13,26 July 2007
Black Hawk Down," A 2 hour version of the start of Private Ryan
","I was very much alive in 1993, and yet the Mogadishu incident only comes to light in my mind now. That's the thing with these films - they highlight things that people may not be aware of or remember.My first impressions were of sheer awe (as usual) at Ridley Scott's visual control and pace, the battle scenes being among the best I've seen, easily comparable to the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan - only longer. The action was well handled, and the events accurately recreated. I have to say that the beginning was a bit timid, and felt like more of a chore to try and establish characters.The amount of work that went into recreating the battle as accurately as possible is perhaps this film's main downfall. At the beginning we are really only given faces to recognise rather than characters, and I for one couldn't remember any of the names of the guys we were watching. Eventually I just gave up and enjoyed the view. Also, had I not heard the general plot before seeing it, I might have forgotten why the marines went into the town in the first place. The dialogue was the usual, cliche ridden macho marine talk, you know, like 'Go go go!' etc., but the brotherly nature between the soldiers is very evident. There are other war movie cliches involved, the 'Tell my kids this that and the other thing' when a soldier's on his death bed, and the guy tending to him going 'No, you can tell them yourself, you're gonna be OK'. Of course, this scene has been done so many times with the same outcome you have to really wonder why they still do it. My final gripe is that the 'War is Hell' motif has been done to death.This is by no means a subtle film, and that can either be a strength or a weakness, depending on your point of view. I reckon that it's a strength in that it brings the reality to light of what happened in '93. I was amazed that they managed to cosily fit in some comic relief in this hellish battle. I reckon that things like that are a mark of a good director (or writer for that matter). To be able to make the audience laugh through such a serious film is quite an achievement.Overall, I would say that this is an excellent chronicle of what happened in Mogadishu, with the biting, gory reality well depicted, and shot by a master artist - Ridley Scott is a pure photographer. However, where this film succeeds as a chronicle is maybe where it fails as a movie.7 / 10",7,2,3,20 January 2002
The Mummy Returns," Fun but irritating
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS First I have to point out a major inconsistency between this and the first film. Does anyone here remember Imhotep being completely removed fro  the picture in the first movie? Yes? Then how come he somehow manages to be encased in this big lump of rock?Anyway, credit due to Sommers for his knack of putting together silly plots as an excuse to induce some really exciting action sequences. I think this film also rank up there with The Phantom Menace (and the next 2 Star Wars movies) as one of the most SFX reliant movies made so far (not including completely computer animated stuff). The same goes for the music, which I thought was excellent and really in your face - credit to Alan Silvestri, who replaces Jerry Goldsmith from the last movie.This movie is more comedy-orientated, and as a result lacks any of the feasibility of the first, which was better in my view. The plot is gets needlessly complicated along the way, loads of things cropping up like 'He has the Sceptre of thingymabob' and 'It's the magic box of watchamacallit'. They crop up so much that there isn't much point in seeing this one if you haven't seen the first, for you would have no idea what they're talking about otherwise.It also felt a tad too long, and the ending battle felt a bit dragged out, predictable, but the Scorpion King was interesting. And the movie was loud - VERY loud, the combination of the music and the shouting and the swords and whatnot making this volume possible.Exhilirating spectacle it is - comparable to it's predecessor it's not.",Null,0,0,23 May 2001
The Descent," Truly chilling
","Alright, let's get the bad stuff out of the way first - for me at least, the start of the movie was really boring and dire. It barely established the characters, but I think it was aimed more at bringing them all together to get a feeling of togetherness in the group. I also thought it was a bit too long.OK, now that stuff is gone, lets get to the good bits. I haven't really been this chilled by a British-helmed film since I first saw Alien, and there are definitely elements of that movie (not to mention Predator too) in this little gem. Almost the entire cast is female, which makes things even more chilling as things go on. After the boring ending things really start to kick off and send shivers up your spine - some of the caving scenes in particular were extremely claustrophobic, and Marshall really ratchets up the tension at times. Some of the characters really come into their own in the caves. The movie is also quite cruel with the viewer at times, particularly at the end, but this ending and other moments in the movie demonstrate Marshall's newfound cinematic flair to great effect. Oh, and the music is fantastic!Overall, this reviewer says: Dire start, bit too long, yet cinematic ally intelligent, cruel and scary as hell!",8,1,3,13 July 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Good but not great
","I saw this tonight with someone who had read the book (very quickly), and they enjoyed it more than I did I think. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it. The music was good, the composition was very good. Ron Howard has carved out a niche or trademark in the 'the solution appears to the protagonist using CGI and stuff' for himself. A lot of the actors were on autopilot though, namely Hanks and Reno. Bettany and McKellen put in good, solid performances.Some things were just a bit convenient to me, not to mention one or two plot holes but I really can't be bothered going into them here. I also don't understand the controversy here - did the Church whine regarding the first and third Indiana Jones movies?Anyway, there were one or two moments where it seemed like the end but it continued for just a little longer, and character development was somewhat thin but not completely amiss.All in all, not a waste of a night out, a definite critic-proof movie, although more of an OK thriller than a revelatory, iconic piece of work.",6,1,4,19 May 2006
Enemy at the Gates," A fine addition to a recent trend
","This is a really engaging film. It grips you from the start and doesn't let go - although sometimes the grip slackens. There were one or two quite shocking elements to it, such as (SPOILER) when the kid was hung by Konig, and when Tanya was hit by shrapnel.The first part of the film takes quite a lot from the pages of Saving Private Ryan, i.e. blood guts etc. and very Janusz Kamisnki style of camerawork. Thus, Annaud ensures that it is a memorable scene, so vivid and realistic that it is quite scary.Blistering performances eminate from the three main leads - Law, Weisz and Fiennes - and Ed Harris puts in an especially whole-hearted show, putting real character into the steely-eyed German sniper. Bob Hoskins was also very good, even if he was only in the film for a short spell. I have to say, however, that we could have done without the love triangle. It did slow the pace of things down a bit. And I think Ron Perlman's voice was dubbed.Otherwise, this is a fully gripping tale, wrought with tension and realism. The story of these two snipers, coming from completely contrasting backgrounds, is so attractive and well-executed that gets you rooting for the good guy. It's about time someone took a good look at an often overlooked time during WWII.As for the music, I think James Horner's score was fantastic. However, as some Horner fans may (or may not) have heard, the vast majority of the score is based on a theme was is an exact excerpt from his score from Apollo 13. That said, he uses and expands it very well.All in all, great stuff. Watch it.",Null,0,0,24 March 2001
War of the Worlds," Like an unsatisfying orgasm - all of the buildup with little climax
","I'm literally just back from seeing this at my local cinema. Personally, I thought it was a good bit of entertainment with lots of tension, impressive effects and nice action. Cruise is Cruise and Dakota pretty much does what you'd expect from a child prodigy. Some bits feel a bit slow though and there's a lack of character from the performers. I think Tim Robbins' character had the most personality amongst the others, although nobody really knows why he is the way he is...As far the much talked about ending, it's a fair bit unsatisfying. As I say in my title, it's like an unsatisfying orgasm - all of the exciting buildup with little climax. Good entertainment though. Worth a watch.",7,3,6,3 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," If you're too critical you'll miss the point
","Bad dialogue, yes. Cheesy romance, yes. Improvement over the last two, definitely.If you go in to watch this movie to be critical of it, do yourself a favour and turn around before you get to the box office. If you want to watch this movie to complete the circle, live in the Star Wars world for the last time and to have some good entertainment, then come right on in, because that's what you'll get.When I watched this the first time I enjoyed it a lot, regardless of it's faults, of which there are certainly a few. There are a lot of pluses though - the sumptuous visuals, the fantastic battles and lightsabre duels, the epic storytelling, the closing of the circle (at last) and the sheer drama at times, particularly Ian McDiarmid's performance. He really relished the chance to play the Emperor one last time.If you want a critical view, I'd say it felt a little rushed, the editing was a little annoying (e.g. just when a battle was getting under way it suddenly cut to something less exciting) and some of the acting and dialogue was wooden and clunky, but there were flashes of brilliance alongside these issues, exciting battles, great dark drama and some resolution to the last space opera. Lucas' ability to create a story is by no means in question, for he has come up with many stories for movies that have become cult classics of our time, but he himself is not necessarily the best person to tell these stories.Look past the problems. Look at the story. Enjoy what you can, and you'll be happy. Don't be a grouch!",8,3,5,26 May 2005
The Lion King," Praise
","I have never witnessed such a spellbinding spectacle of enchantment as this. The Lion King is truly one of Disney's most amazing stories, and the fact that it is original make it even more so. It brings out the better part of your emotions, making you cry, laugh, gasp or think. With a terrific cast and an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, this film will remain one of my personal favourites for as long as I live. Disney, my hat's off to you.",Null,0,0,10 September 1999
The Iron Giant," TISSUES!! I NEED TISSUES!!!
","I had heard, from viewing the page on the IMDb for this movie, that this was something special, but I never got round to actually seeing it. Thus, when I found it being shown on TV, I didn't hesitate and got settled in. Being 22 I thought this would be too kiddy-like for me, what with being a Western cel-animated film. On the contrary, I think that my age (22) let me appreciate this film more than what I would have when I was 17 when it came out.This film entertains on all levels, whether you're a grown up or a kid or a grown up kid. It's not dumbed down for anyone, it's quite smart and truly heartwarming and emotional. Not to mention cool, especially when......ahhh, no spoilers here, just go see it yourself.I think this film also has a moral message at it's core, that of trying to understand things that we don't, rather than taking drastic action from being afraid. The message is really only apparent towards the end, but I think it's definitely there.In short, see this movie. Make sure you are have tissues handy though!",Null,0,1,2 October 2004
Shrek," 90 minutes of pure fairytale magic
","I saw this movie half an hour ago and I'm still vibrating - the music, the characters, the animation, the story....wow! I'm definitely getting the score! And, as a first for me, the soundtrack with the songs on it! I don't usually buy any of that 'soundtrack' stuff and usually go for OSTs, but this movie integrated the songs so well that it should no way be missed! There are also some really cool camera angles, which I tend to watch for nowadays after seeing The Third ManRecent trend emerging - vastly superior computer-animated features. How do these people seem to round up the funniest writers in the business for this type of movie? Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Bug's Life, Antz (not forgetting the non-CGI Chicken Run)...these are all hilariously written and they're all CGI films! Even the upcoming Monsters Inc. (dying to see it) appears to be even more funny and imaginative! Mind you, they're all Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks produced My instinct is that it's a big competition between Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks to come up with the funniest ideas and revolutionary technology for these films - thats a good thing about competition like this, it propels people to new lengths. Ever since The Lion King new life has been breathed into the genre of animated features. With the exception of things like Pokemon in all fairness.The film itself is just so uplifting that the feeling and memories are bound to stay with you for days! Wise-crack, in jokes, identifiable characters...all great stuff. The dialogue between characters is so witty, funny and smart that you can identify with the characters extremely well and the relationships between them are sticking out like Boy George! It plays with great fun on the fairytale genre, with references to many different fairytales (and various other things, like The Matrix and Riverdance), using them to great effect, creating a magical atmosphere that is unsurpassed and greatly aided by the computer animation.The music, as I said before, is absolutely amazing. Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell do massive credit to themselves in the score for this movie, as they did before for the fab Chicken Run. You can definitely tell at times where Gregson-Williams' influence was most apparent, seeing as he is a student of Hans Zimmer! The songs, some of which most people should recognise, are integrated so well into the emotions of certain parts of the movie that they amplify these emotions, giving the viewer a real feel of the magic. Combined with the superb score (I can't say that enough) this truly is a feast for the senses, not least of hearing - it's a joy to both watch and hear.The one thing I would say on the negative side is that the ending is a bit predictable and there is a brief slump into sentimentality, but then again most fairytales go this way!Rating? 9 out of ten, without doubt!",9,0,0,7 July 2001
Beowulf," Enjoyable yet flawed
","While there are some conceptual things about this movie that I don't really agree with, such as modelling the faces of the actors in acute detail in CG instead of just using the actors themselves, I found that I enjoyed it a lot more than what I thought I would.The graphics themselves are very impressive and almost photorealistic (which isn't necessarily a good thing, see previous comment). The film was more hardcore horror than what I thought it was going to be, which made it all the more surprising and entertaining for myself. I am very glad to see that Zemeckis hasn't settled into a groove and is trying new things cinematically, some of which are very evident here.The voice acting was interesting - my guess is that as the Celts originated from Saxony it would make some sort of sense to have the actors put on different forms of Celtic accents, apart from Jolie's stereotypical Russian business and Winstone's broad London brogue. Given the pedigree of the writers it's not surprising that the script is very well written - not childish in the least, more engaging and adult than that. To be honest, I am very glad to see a major Western company putting in the effort to make a CG film that isn't aimed at children.At points the film slows down to a laboured chug as some characters are developed. These moments are somewhat forgettable when the next action sequence comes along and amazes you. Trust me, they are amazing. Some complain that the movie isn't true to the poem and the whole story, to which I say well Frank Miller's 300 is based on such a story, yet takes many liberties, and I would put this movie in the same vein as this. It doesn't set out to be a perfect rendition of the poem.Basically this is a very entertaining, adult movie with a bit of God of War about it, which is a very good thing. Definitely worth a watch.",7,1,3,10 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Good fun but not really a Die Hard movie
","This was a good movie. Good action, funny lines, lack of reliance on CG effects, evil eyed bad guy as well as Kevin Smith's most awesome cameo ever. I think I got my money's worth. I loved the way Marco Beltrami kept the good old themes of the now passed Michael Kamen in the show.However I think Bruce Willis let me down a bit. The John McClane I remember was crazy, funny and with plenty to say, but here Willis just cruises through with perhaps one or two purely McClane moments.The film also suffers from some really sucky ADR dubbing work. On many occasions you can plainly see someone's lips moving one way but what you hear is completely unrelated to what you see. I swear I saw one guy wiping his mouth with his sleeve and I could still hear him go through his sentence clearly. Where's the macho arguments that we saw in the first three movies? Where's the attitude that McClane had and was evident between him and Samuel L. Jackson in the third? All these things are missing. Also McClane's use of his trademark line in this movie is such a cop out it made me die a little inside. And now McClane can jump from a burning truck onto concrete and walk away minutes later. Silly can be good, but sometimes it went a bit too far here.Seems I'm the only one to see this.All in all it's good fun, quite tight and provides good escapism, but it's not without its problems.",7,3,7,7 July 2007
The Sixth Sense," If you liked The Usual Suspects...
","...you'll love this. I know it's a bit of an obscure comparison, but just wait till you see it. Without giving too much away, the ending is quite a shocker, and this is why I compared it to The Usual Suspects (i.e., there's something that happens at the end that has been running (nearly) throughout the film, and you need to keeps your wits about you). It was nice to see M Night in a small cameo too. No special effects, no star-studded line up, just plain old fashioned chiller thriller. Haley Joel stole the show, and Willis puts in a spirited performance as the child psychologist. The score and camera work are also commendable.",9,0,0,28 May 2000
Gladiator," Brutal, bloody, loud and great
","Saw this the day it came out over here. Had been waiting for it for a seriously long time. Lived up to my expectations.Loads of typical epic elements are present in this film. Death, glory, love, lust, blood and adventure. The overall plot isn't too different from Spartacus, but should be treated as a completely different film. I mean to say that there can't be just one film on Roman gladiators. There's no point in making a benchmark of a film. It just limits the possibilities.The actors were brilliant, and most of all Crowe, who just slips into every role he gets with the greatest amount of ease. We've now discovered a new generation of good actors, and definitely in the form of Crowe. Harris' short-lived role was well played, and the late Oliver Reed puts in a marvellous performance as Proximo (an honourary post-humous award of some description wouldn't go amiss!). Phoenix was relly menacing in his place, and made me hate his character's guts!The camerawork in some places was reminiscent of that of Janusz Kaminski in Saving Private Ryan. It's a good technique that gives the audience the feeling of chaos and atmosphere. Ridley Scott uses his usual flair to produce some excellent visuals, like the Collisseum (even though over half of it was CGI).Last but not least, Hans Zimmer's score was perfectly suited to the task of capturing action and intimate moments in the film. During the battle scenes the music often sounds like Gustav Holst's 'Mars, Bringer of War' from his Planets suite. Very good idea. Well suited to the scenes of combat and war.Overall, Gladiator is an amazing spectacle. And I'd like to finish by saying: RUSSELL CROWE RULES!! But I won't (lol)",10,0,0,12 May 2000
V for Vendetta," A very entertaining fusion of genres
","A lot of the bad criticism of this movie is based along the lines of 'it refuses to define itself' or 'is it an actioner or is it a social commentary or what'. I personally don't believe that these are valid criticisms. I had absolutely no issue whatsoever with the fact that this film assaults many themes at once. The action was great. The acting was very competent. The music was excellent. Some people point out plot holes, but at the end of the day we shouldn't really care.This is the sort of film you can take any way you want - an actioner, a love story, a political message. Basically it has followed the recent trend of fusion in art amongst many other things, and I think in this case that it works well.It does get a little confusing in places but if you pay enough attention then you should be able to get the general concept of what's happening. I heard Jonathan Ross really didn't care much for this movie - tough luck Wossie!",8,2,5,20 March 2006
The Island," Good beginning marred by dumb second part and relentless product placement
","We start out in a THX 1138 style facility. We ask what is going on, who are these people. Why are they here? The conversation is interesting, the acting is decent. Interesting questions about a moral issue come to our minds. We see this nice place yet we feel something is fundamentally wrong with the situation. As one of the individuals questions things going on around him, the horrible truth is revealed.After this, what we see degenerates into standard Hollywood/Michael Bay action fare with dire dialogue (consisting of the words 'go!', 'move out!' etc. etc.). The action is good, but lacks soul and appears as mere eye candy. Let's face it, the two leads were hardly stretching their acting abilities.The ending part of the experience revives a little of the intrigue of the first part, but it has taken so long to get here that we really don't care. Did we really expect it to end any other way? Throughout the movie we are constantly subjected to multiple product placement opportunities, some so glaringly obvious that you almost feel the need to scream. We paid to see a movie, not be advertised at. It is also very much oriented at males - action/women etc., and even if you were a lady I wouldn't even recommend this movie just for another chance of seeing McGregor in action. Cool music though. A lot of borrowing from other movies, such as The Matrix and Blade Runner too.Oh, what could have been!",6,0,0,19 August 2005
