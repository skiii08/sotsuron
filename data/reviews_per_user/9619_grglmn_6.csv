The Monuments Men," Disappointing
","Don't know exactly what I was expecting, but the story just didn't hold together or flow very well for me. There were a few interesting scenes, and of course you knew the premise or storyline because it is painfully laid out to you, but it just played out to me like a bunch or somewhat related scenes, not a cohesive compelling movie. And while they told us why they need to save the art was so compelling they failed to really show it, to me at least. It seems like a common problem with 'star ensemble' movies. You get a lot of people with a little face time, but not much story or character development. The stars did a good job of hyping the thing on the various talk shows, perhaps the build up added to the disappointment.",4,7,12,10 February 2014
A Star Is Born," No New Ground Covered Here
","This was not only a remake of a particular movie by the same name, it was a remake of a lot of movies telling similar stories. It wasn't quite unwatchable, but nothing about it was particularly moving or compelling. Lady GaGa has a great voice, Bradley Cooper is good looking. We knew all that going in. Even the inestimable Sam Elliott couldn't add much to this wooden, slow moving clunker.",4,4,6,11 March 2019
Suicide Squad," Raised up by low expectations
","I was curious about this movie, but not really excited to see it. Then it got generally bad reviews from critics and viewers alike. Caught on free streaming. Will Smith and Margot Robbie pretty much carry the movie, it is an entertaining romp, the plot makes as much sense as any superhero movie, bad guys were sufficiently creepy. If you were expecting great cinema or deep meaning from this, well, I just don't know what to say.",8,1,1,24 March 2019
The Lost City of Z," High Aspirations, Mediocre Execution
","I waited a long time to watch this movie (obviously) I was impressed with what they attempted, but not so much with what was achieved. Obviously was supposed to have big themes and deep meaning, but kind of a schizophrenic mix of film noir, nostalgia, gritty crime drama, golden age comic book flash gordon stuff.Although it may not seem all that significant the atmosphere seemed all WWII era film noir, yet the jarringly incongruous soundtrack had music from the 60s and seventies. Dr. Manhattan seems like gee whiz fifties atomic age comic book, but then they try to throw him into deep philosophical discussions. None of the superheroes really have any superpowers except Rorsarch has a freaky mask (never explained to my knowledge) and Dr. Manhattan (who is given some backstory).The old group, the Watchmen, never seemed to really care about each other much, past or present, and none of the characters are really likeable or relateable. Perhaps because the only one we really had any clue about regarding character and motivation was Rorsarch (well played by the way).The violence often seemed gratuitious and unnecessary to the story. The story, I got the general gist, but would have to watch it again (not likely) to get all the twists and nuances and flashbacks they threw in there. I slogged through it, but didn't really work for me, too long, needed either a lighter touch or more depth of character.",5,1,1,21 August 2018
Ant-Man," Watchable, Not Much More
","I did not have high expectations for this movie, I certainly wasn't to excited or I would have found a way to see it sooner than two years after it came out. Usually low expectations make it easier to like a movie, it is much easier to meet or exceed low expectations than high ones.I don't need non stop action a plot with huge implications, save the world, huge revenge motive, or whatever, to like a movie. In fact I often like what I call 'small movies' with fewer special effects or huge cultural significance or whatever, but just have a good story to tell and some interesting characters. Ant man was an interesting character in the comic books, but I am certainly not a fanboy who is going to criticize the movie for some minor detail differences from the source material, it just wasn't translated well to the big screen like Thor, The Hulk, or Iron Man. My problem with the movie is that it didn't really succeed as a comic book movie with bigger than life stories, villain and action, and it was pretty boring as a plot and character based movie as well. I don't even mind cliched and formulaic if well done, this one is cliched and formulaic, but it is not well done. The five stars I gave it are probably a little generous.",5,0,2,10 February 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Time Travel Does Not Work For Logic or Dramatic Purposes (spoilers)
","I love science fiction and fantasy, and I have no problem suspending disbelief for purposes of enjoying a good comic book movie, but Endgame just didn't work for me on a couple levels. First, they kill Thanos with little fanfare or drama at what is basically the start of the show. This gets to the whole drama thing, it is all based essentially on a do over, but they try to make it dramatic because they just have 'one chance to get it right' yet Cap and Tony screw up and just get a do over. So they are fighting to save the world (or half of it anyway) very dramatic, but if this doesn't work they will just do it over, not very dramatic, they beat Thanos at the beginning, again not very dramatic to fight him again.Then there is the time travel logic they use to build up the story that doesn't really work either, you can't change the past, you can just create alternative timelines, but the whole stone thing somehow sidesteps this critical rule 'as long as they put them back in time. And speaking of putting them back, getting them was a major deal involving the whole squad and a lot of risk. How is returning them so much easier? Black Widow 'has to stay dead' yet Gamora, who died under the exact same circumstances/edict comes back no problem. Fat Thor and smart Hulk didn't help matters. Missed Vision too, everybody else could come back, but not the Viz? Screw that, he is the most interesting character on the whole team.Sorry, don't get all the love, worst Avengers movie yet by far.",4,23,34,10 May 2019
