The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Cliches all over the place, poor acting, good music, boring, pointless, disappointing
","Not convincing at any point. Full of exaggerated scenes, like first day at high school which is nothing like it in reality. Acting is just terrible. Main character is good looking teenager with no friends?!? I mean, how? You pick Michael Cera for these roles, come on. And then 15 min into the movie after they told us that he is a prick, shy, introvert... - he is making out with Emma Watson... yeah right, it goes like that. List goes on. I hated it. I gave it 3 stars because music was ok",2,1,12,17 June 2019
Into the Wild," Amazing scenes of nature, great story based on true one, great acting, just beautiful and must watch movie for every generation
","The most interesting thing is that during the whole movie you have such confidence in the main character. You follow his naivety and trust him all the way his trip. He is so sure in his decisions and you believe him, he is convincing. That is one of the things that amazes me. You start feeling sorry for his parents and his sister because it appears that they don't understand him. He is doing right, He is a hero, he is smart, in fact - he looks smarter than everybody else in this movie. Boy clearly knows what he is doing. We should all look upon him, we should all go out and explore the nature, escape society, materialistic world we are surrounded by...But...What it seems so easy and ''natural'' doesn't always come out the way we expected..Nature is beautiful, but it is not beautiful for us, for humans... There were billions of years of struggle, fight, evolutionary selection, killings, death, suffering.. that made the nature the way it is. Nature is not there to amuse us, nor it is there for us in any way. If we are to survive in nature we need to: 1) Learn a lot about it, 2) Make subtle changes to it so we can fit in better, and the most important 3) to respect it. Not to act arrogantly like we are the main beings on this planet and like everything else is planted here according to our needs just to serve ours purposes.Basically, if you go bare-footed, uneducated and unprepared with naive attitude into the wilderness.. anything can happen... despite your youthful energy, positive thoughts, good collage degrees...",9,0,0,14 September 2017
