Come and See," Makes 'Saving Private Ryan' look like 'Mary Poppins'.
","Which is no slam against either of those flicks.'Come and See' is simply in a class by itself in the way it brutally depicts the horrors of war. It is thoroughly uncompromising, and determinedly unique. A harrowing, hallucinatory trip through Hell via WWII.Though it will challenge the squeamish, it is a magnificent film about a grim subject.",10,8,12,6 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Uh... craaap!
","Aside from the special effects and the intriguing origins of the great Boba Fett, this movie stinks to high heavens (yes, even those in a galaxy far, far away). Jar Jar Binks is given mercifully little screen time, but any screen time for that abomination is a crime against humanity. George Lucas should think about making some other films every now and then. He has seriously lost his way with this landmark franchise, and seems hellbent on completely obliterating his own legacy.",2,0,0,24 May 2002
