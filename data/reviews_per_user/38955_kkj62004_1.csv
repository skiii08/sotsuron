Black Swan," Holiday Turkey
","I saw Black Swan a couple of weeks ago and for the life of me cannot get over the accolades and praise this movie has received the last couple of weeks. I must have missed something between my popcorn and Coke. Am I on planet Earth? Yes, I'm sure Natalie Portman will win an Oscar for her notable portrayal of a disturbed young ballerina and am equally confident it will take home the naked golden man for Best Picture.Darren Aronofsky, the Director, attempts to lead us down the Rabbit Hole through the psychiatric disillusions of a talented, albeit coo-coo, young ballerina. There's no supernatural element here (as I was led to believe in the trailers) only the visions of a poor disturbed individual. Frankly, I find that notion a bit exploitative to all those who suffer from a mental illness. Yes, I get this is a thought provoking tale with the the whole White=Good and Black=Bad thing. The audience however, is left to wonder what the heck is going on. I must admit, I kept waiting for the shoe to drop but it never materializes. The tension builds nicely throughout but the payoff is a little too late.Someone called the movie 'Epic.' The only this 'Epic about Black Swan is hitting the bulls-eye for non-watchable. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.",1,18,34,28 January 2011
