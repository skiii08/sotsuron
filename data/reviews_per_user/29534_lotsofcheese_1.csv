The Ring," Yet another American remake of a classic Horror
","After watching this, I have to say I wasn't very happy with all the hype surrounding it, it was truly average next to the original, 'Ringu' The characters were pretty convincing in 'the Ring' the acting was good, and the development was Okay, but heres the thing that bugs me with this movie.The original had one use of special effects in it, no more then that because it wasn't necessary, also SADAKO as she should be called was far creepier because of her movements not because they made her jump she was a true horror, also whats with her face? she looks like swamp thing.Now here is another thing with Horror films which seems to be taken out of the remake, its what you don't see that is scary, like in 'Dog Soldiers' thats right that British horror film cult classic, I remember seeing the Werewolves for the first time in that and they were actually creepy, another, 'Alien' now that truly is a horror for its suspense.Overall it is a good film, and if your a fan of shock horror and cheap thrills this is right up your road, basically, Ringu the cult classic Japanese horror that was scary because of its suspense slow paced fear scenes is replaced with an average cheap American horror film.",5,0,1,22 September 2009
