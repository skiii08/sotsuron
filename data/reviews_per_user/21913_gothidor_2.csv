Ford v Ferrari," Masterpiece!
","With this movie you understand that exist two kinds of movies, blockbuster movies and real acting movies!
Christian Bale and Matt Damon has a perfect chemistry!
Bale leave you for one more time with your mouth open with his acting...
Thank you all for this movie, it's a triumph and a perfect legasy for Ken Miles and Carol Shelby!",10,2,3,10 January 2020
Joker," Overated movie...
","I don't understand how this movie got 8,6 rating...
Of course Joaquin Phoenix plays his role extremely well but the movie it's a fraud...
Scenario and plot it's something different from real Joker's storyline...
Extremely overated for me...",1,8,19,10 January 2020
