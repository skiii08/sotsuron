Ghost," Horrible
","Without a doubt, the worst Oscar-winning performance ever.  Whoopie Goldberg is terrible in this not-very-good-movie.  Watch the scene in the bank with un-sexy Patrick Swayze.  If you were put in that situation would you act that way?  No.  You would do your best to remain calm--listening to him while paying attention to the banker.  She is totally hamming it up and it doesn't work.  Bad acting by a bad actress in a bad movie.",1,11,34,13 October 1998
Dark City," Dark
","A darker, more intelligent 'Truman Show' You can't (and shouldn't) take your eyes off the screen.  Jennifer Connely has amazing eyebrows. Kiefer Sutherland is badly miscast--the doctor could have been a much better character.",Null,0,0,6 April 1999
