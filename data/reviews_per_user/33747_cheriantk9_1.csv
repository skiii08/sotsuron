The Avengers," Iron Man Hype
","The avengers was a undeniably a movie that was more than what we had ever hoped for. The characters and the way all of them came together from their previous solo moves was exceptional. However, as far as the cast goes, I feel that some of them dominated over the others, perhaps because of the success of their solo manifestations. For those of u who have had a previous knowledge about the avengers plot, would know that CAPTAIN America was their all-in-all leader. However, he never got the recognition or position that he deserved. Like i said earlier, this should be because of the fact that out the entire lot, Iron man was the biggest hit Hollywood had got. But this undeniably changed the entire outlook of the Avengers team. Although towards the end of the movie, he gave some orders to the rest of his team, it still does not entirely prove the leadership of captain America. The Hulk who smashed his way into the Hollywood scene with a second comeback film also shared the lime light with his hilarious 'uncontrollable self', and his total disregard to anyone, or anything that stood in his way of doing business.",9,2,6,7 May 2012
