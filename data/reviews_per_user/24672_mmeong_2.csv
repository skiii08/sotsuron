Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just Wait!
","At least that's what I'll have to keep telling myself for the next two years! Upon entering the theatre, my greatest fear was that I would be disappointed. The special effects solved that problem--they were truly amazing, it's now easier for Lucas to give his imagination the reins, he's no longer hampered by impossibilities.And therein lies the problem--What about the characters? The audience is left hanging...there seemed to be a lack of development with regards to the characters, their relationships, and most importantly their secrets.But perhaps this is due to the To-Be-Continued nature of this current trilogy. The original series doesn't carry the cliff-hanger mystique (duh, if I want to know what happens I no longer have to wait half a decade) but this one is a different story (so to speak).I am sorry that there isn't a little bit more mystery about...oh, Darth Maul (who would have thought he'd be such a lackey!) It would have been nice if there had been a little bit more cunning to go with those lovely little horns...Anakin's Christ-like birth is a real kicker too!--I 'pray' that one will be cleared up soon!We'll just have to wait and see!",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
Notting Hill," Can it be?!
","I may have actually encountered a romantic comedy that I could stand! Yes, Four Weddings* was comparable but lackluster in comparison. Admittedly Julia Roberts' character wasn't much of a stretch but there is some frank insight into the life of anyone ever caught in a British tabloid.Hugh Grant has this uncanny ability of always looking uncomfortable, like a penitent child. Still charming as ever though.I must say, that at first glance, Julia Roberts' character was distant, cool, definitively unlikeable--but that just goes with the territory. You don't truly appreciate her until the very end.Comedy made this film, and for that Rhys Ifans must be commended! It was more comedy than romance...All in all, a must-see (though for the life of me I don't know why...) Perhaps you will understand if you just see it!",8,0,1,20 May 1999
