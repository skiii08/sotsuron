Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You just cannot compare this to the others.
","I think that when people think of Star Wars, they think of a nice 'classic' movie.  Although, when you think of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace you just think of another movie.  Too many people are comparing the prequel to the three original films.  That is okay to a certain extent.  It is unfair to George Lucas, the three original films and to the prequel when people say that it is a bad Star Wars story.  That there was too much of something(Jar Jar) in it.  To compare the prequels to the originals is just unfair.  I knew that they weren't going to be the same. I didn't think that people would degrade it as much as they do.  All I'm saying is that it is wrong and unfair to think of it as an original Star Wars.",Null,0,0,7 August 2001
