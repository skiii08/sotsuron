Blade Runner 2049," A huge disappointment!
","I attempted to watch this movie yesterday and now I understand why it did so poorly at the box office! Although I absolutely loved the original, this has got to be one of the worst squeals of all time. In fact, in my opinion, it rates right up there with Dune, Conan The Destroyer and, Krull which were three of the worst movies I have ever seen! Thus, after watching the first hour of this worthless movie, I got so bored with it that I actually turned it off and I see absolutely no incentive to watch the rest of it!",3,1,3,6 January 2018
