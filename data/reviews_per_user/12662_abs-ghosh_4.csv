It," Too Dark!
","Well I liked the 1990's mini series, the horror aspect came eventually but the series spent a lot of time exploring bonds of friendship between a group of teen outcasts during a typical innocent summer adventure gone wrong.I felt like this remake focused much more on the horror aspect and not enough time exploring the group friendship aspect. Pennywise was a lot more menaching from the start and I am not sure I am a big fan of child mutilation and gore was a bit too much. I am fine with varying degrees of gore with adults but I don't know if I can stomach kids. Maybe its because I am getting old but certain elements of the kids lives felt a bit forced.I guess as a horror story of its own, its not quite as bad if you can stand seeing a bunch of kids being traumatized. I am interested in seeing the sequel and how it handles itself. Overal its an okay movie but it a little too forced in a few areas.",7,0,1,8 February 2019
Split," Good movie but forced sequel to another good film.
","Three highschool girls become victims of a kidnapping during a ride home by a troubled young man suffering from multiple personality disorder. What starts out as a traditional slasher/thriller flick takes on a new layer of mystery as the kidnappers 23 distinct personalities seem to be working together towards a larger more sinister plan.I personally wasn't aware of this being a Shyamalan film till the very end. I think that bit of a reveal worked towards my enjoyment of the movie far more than it should have. Since this is a non spoiler review, I will simply say its one of those rear treats from Shyamalan who was once a rising film director that eventually faded to obscurity after a sling of failed movies. McAvoy is the higlight playing the kidnapper with multiple personalities and its definitely a movie that should be watched at some point in time. I am not sure if this is a movie I would have liked to have seen in theater however.",8,0,0,29 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," You should have aimed for the head!
",Just got back from the midnight showing and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I get that its the final avengers movie but they spent two hours paying homage to previous films and characters and retread a lot of the original plot. In doing so they effectively dulled Thanos's presence and much of the enjoyment of the movie. I hate to say it but Captain Marvel seemed like a useless addition as she really didn't bring much to the table and her presence ruins Thanos's threat. Anyway the production values were great and it was nice to see all the characters make an appearance in some form but it wasn't bet foot to go out on.,6,2,6,26 April 2019
Drive," Heavily borrowing ideas from classics and laying it on the cheap
","Watching the trailer of this the first thought that came into my mind was that this is a remake of De Niro's 'Driver'. I recently got a chance to watch this film last night and I must say it was pretty bad.Turns out I wasn't entirely wrong about the movie, the main character is definitely the superficial version of DeNiro. This character is a walking cardboard, I know they were going for the strong silent type bordering on a psychotic outbreak but there is no meat to his character.The music selection was easily the most terrible part of this movie, it destroyed any tension that was to be gotten.The plot is the work of mediocrity in the land of generic plot threads. There are a total of 4 or 5 people and its very easy to see where the whole mess is going to lead to. Also this being about heists and robberies where are the cops except for the first 5 mins of the dumbest escape scene ever.The acting was decent (cept for the driver) but really hardly any dialogue, mostly its the terrible choice of music in the background.The camera work was'nt bad terrible but its slow plodding pace made the movie feel slower than it was.There was a time where Indie flicks actually told good stories at the cost of production rate now its just as aimless as the Hollywood blockbusters...",Null,1,4,4 November 2011
