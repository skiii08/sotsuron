The Longest Yard," Quite simply an awesome movie
","I honestly don't know how this movie did not achieve a higher rating. It had everything you could ask for; a good mix of a comedy, sports, and overcoming the odds. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock and the rest of the cast did a great job of keeping us laughing, while keeping us rooting for the inmates. I know it may sound weird to cheer for convicts, over prison guards, but as the movie progressed I just wanted to see the prison guards crushed. Many people have said it was nowhere near as good as the original, but the truth is that it was not a remake but a homage to the movie. I watched this movie, and then again about 3 three times, it was just that good. If you didn't give this movie a chance the first time around, I would advise you to get it off Netflix, your local DVD store, whatever means you have of getting hold of this. Despite what you may have heard this movie is a must see.",10,0,2,29 July 2010
