Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Bravo To All Involved
","Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is nothing short of spectacular. Great congratulations go out to all involved in creating this epic, most notably Industrial Light and Magic, for amazing effects, John Williams, for an excellent score, and, of course, George Lucas, for obvious reasons.  I encourage anyone, Star Wars fan or not, to see this movie.",10,0,0,23 May 1999
