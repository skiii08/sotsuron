Changeling," Just Not Good Enough Clint and Angie.
","Changeling is a reasonably well written and well made movie, but personally I don't think it's one of Angelina Jolie's best performances and I'm not certain she was truly Oscar-nomination worthy for this. (She didn't win.) Normally I'm an Angelina fan, but I couldn't warm to her in Changeling at all. The cast includes John Malkovich, Michael Kelly and Colm Feore, all of whom are good within the limits of fairly one dimensional characters, but there was something about Jolie's persona in this movie that I just didn't find believable.Perhaps she has reached that unfortunate stage where she is just such a big deal in the media, so often plastered all over the internet and the gossip magazine covers, that it's hard to suspend belief and allow her to sink into a character. In the morning, while standing in line at the grocery store, you idly read about her marriage to Brad, in the evening you try to believe in her as a devastated 1920s mother. Tom Cruise has reached a similar stage for me; I just look at him and think 'Oh yeah, that's Tom Cruise in a costume' Which is a pity because he's not a bad actor either.I've loved Jolie in many other movies, I thought her performance in A Might Heart for instance, far superior to this. I also liked her in that popcorn flick Wanted, because in a film of that nature, it doesn't matter that she's a media babe. But for me this movie was all about Angelina Jolie in a costume, not about Christine Collins, the character she was trying to portray on screen.Ms Jolie looked stick thin even by her usually skinny standards, almost to the point of emaciation, with huge rouged lips which dominated the screen in every shot she was in, emphasized by her skeletal appearance. I just couldn't take my eyes off her mouth, which may well have been the director's intention but it ruined the movie for me. Angelina has two gestures in this film; eyes brimming with tears or her hand attempting to cover her mouth. I found the gestures over used, and no substitute of good acting. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but I've seen her give much better performances and I think she was miscast.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the script is based on reality and deals with both the disappearance of a child in 1920s Los Angeles, and the corruption of the city's police force at that time. It's certainly an interesting story and well worthy of telling. When her son Walter goes missing, single parent Collins (Jolie) is understandably frantic with worry. Days, then weeks and finally months go by with no word, then finally a child of the right age turns up in Illinois and the police bring him home. The LAPD arrange a big photo op at the train station, to help their flagging public image, damaged by accusations of corruption at the highest levels. But the child isn't Walter, and Collins says so, vociferously.The police will not admit they have made a mistake and try to convince Mrs Collins that Walter has simply changed because of his long absence. How, she wonders, can he have shrunk three inches? How come now he is circumsized? But the police employ a psychiatrist to refute Mrs Collins assertion that the child is not Walter, shifting the blame onto her (thin) shoulders and trying to label her reaction 'feminine hysteria'. Hysterical women were a popular theme back then, with us girlies labeled as too unstable and hormonal to hold down serious jobs. Women had, after all, only just gotten the vote. It was the word of an emotional mother against the might of the LAPD, and the latter won. Collins was shunted off to a psychiatric hospital for a strip search and examination and held against her will for some time, alongside some genuinely disturbed people and many rather clichéd stereotypes, such as the Tart with a Heart. We also see the Unfeeling Brutalized Ugly Nurse and the Macho Doctor Who Can Never Be Wrong.Eventually, aided by Malkovich's crusading Pastor Briegleb, Collins is released. The truth comes out about the 'son's' identity when the bodies of many small boys are revealed at a desolate country farm after a police investigation into an illegal immigrant. Arthur, the substitute son admits he just wanted to get to LA to meet cowboy Tom Mix. But Walter is still missing, presumed dead.Vindicated, but still dedicated to finding her lost child, Collins takes part in the subsequent trial of the killer and the clean-up of the corrupt police force, but never really achieves resolution about Walter's fate. To her death, she still hopes he is alive. It's a tragic and poignant story, yet at no time did I ever truly believe in it. All I ever really saw was Angelina and that mouth. Sorry, not a winner for me. You can do better Angelina. You can do MUCH better Clint.",Null,3,9,18 May 2009
Frost_Nixon," Unexpectedly Spellbinding and Full of Tension
","On the face of it, a movie about a TV interview doesn't sound that exciting does it? But Frost/Nixon is utterly absorbing, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It's the second movie I've seen this week based on a stage play - the other was Doubt - and while such films rarely include much in the way of action or special effects, they do give actors something to really get their teeth into and often offer some of the year's best acting performances. And that's true of both Frost/Nixon and Doubt. I go to the movies (often) for lots of different reasons, sometimes for a bit of escapist fun, sometimes because I want to see a favorite actor, and sometimes to see great performances (getting all three at once is the Holy Grail of movie watching for me!) and Frost/Nixon definitely gave me some great performances to watch.Michael Sheen plays David Frost, British TV personality, talk show host and public man about town. He may be new to the younger American audience, but as I'm a Brit (transplanted to the USA in middle age) he's been on the radar since my youth, famed for satirical TV shows That Was The Week That Was, The Frost Report, and a trademark 'Hello, Good Evening and Welcome!' line. (My brother does a rather good impersonation of him.) In 1977 Frost  who was considered a journalistic lightweight- rather audaciously gained an interview with disgraced ex president Richard Nixon (Frank Langella), who had resigned after the Watergate scandal in 1974 rather than face impeachment. Nixon's successor Gerald Ford pardoned him of any wrongdoing that he might have committed so Nixon was never brought to trial, much to the regret of many Americans. Frost and his team of researchers wanted to give Nixon the trial on TV that he never had in court, while Nixon and his team of minders thought Frost would be a pushover, and that this might be a way for Tricky Dicky to reinvent himself and get back onto the political scene.And Frost almost was a pushover according to this view, (which I think Frost himself has indicated is about 90% accurate.) He struggled to raise the money for the enterprise after the US networks refused to pony up to pay Nixon for the interviews (citing an aversion to check book journalism), and he allowed Nixon to dominate the early meetings. Nixon rambles on about less pressing issues, reciting tired anecdotes about Kissinger and Mao, evading the hard questions, while Frost's researchers and producer gnash their teeth and chew their knuckles with anxiety, the dollar signs burning before their eyes. Frost had staked his personal wealth as well as his reputation on this encounter, and everything was pinned on the last interview session, where, finally, Nixon got as close as he ever got to an admission of guilt and made the classic statement that a crime isn't a crime if committed by the president. When finally shown on US TV, the interviews got huge audiences, the networks ate some humble pie and David Frost's reputation was made (and his bank account saved!) Director Ron Howard masterfully brings out the tension of that last bout, after which Nixon emerged semi bewildered to disappear back into the political wilderness until his death. Brit Peter Morgan wrote the stage play and the screenplay. A great screenwriter, he also wrote The Queen, The Last King of Scotland and Longford, and I suspect he's one of the best writers around just now for nailing a character study. The cast includes Sam Rockwell (whom I last saw in the rather strange Choke), Kevin Bacon, Matthew Macfadyen (Mr Darcy opposite Keira Knightley in Pride and Prejudice), Oliver Platt, Toby Jones and a very decorative Rebecca Hall (seen to more effect in Vicky Christina Barcelona) as Caroline Cushing, Frost's girlfriend at the time. Frank Langella has deservedly been Oscar nominated for his work in Frost/Nixon, and Michael Sheen is excellent too (although he's forever imprinted on this cynical Brit's mind as the ingratiating young Tony Blair in The Queen.) A thoroughly worthy Oscar nominee. I'd love to see the stage play.",Null,3,6,25 January 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," What can one meaningfully say....?
","...Nothing much, so I'm just going to take it at face value. If you are one of the six people in the Western world who haven't yet seen this movie, I recommend a trip to the pub first. And probably afterwards as well. There is absolutely no point in trying to over-intellectualize here. I'm certain Cohen - the guy behind Borat - has been through the full intellectual process and come out the other end. Yes it's boorish and sophomoric - that's the point. It's also extremely funny, especially in the first half, and occasionally rather frightening, but the joke is pretty thin and, I'm afraid, wearing out towards the end. Still..... I was creased up with laughter at the scenes in New York and at the sight of Borat chasing New Yorkers around a subway train, trying to kiss them. Then the chicken got loose.......wonderful! I loved the rodeo, and that homophobic, racist guy shooting himself so utterly and completely in the foot on film for the whole world to see, but the funniest part wasn't that or even Borat's rendering - or strangling - of the Star Spangled Banner. It was the horse falling over in the background. You can't script that kind of stuff. One of my favorite scenes was at the TV station, where the interviewer was trying so sweetly and patiently to get Borat to sit down and stay in camera range, and the weatherman just lost it completely and dissolved into giggles. Those guys need promoting! But the bear joke wore thin very quickly, the frat boys deserved everything they got, the driving instructor was bordering on heroic, and the revivalist meeting terrified the hell out of me. That's one of the more frightening things I've seen on screen this year. I felt sorry for the lovely couple in their Bed and Breakfast house and hope - assume - they got very well paid. The Baywatch / Pamela Anderson thread was a bit tedious by the end, and the naked wrestling was funny for a while but went on way too long.Some sharper editing would have helped. I was very impressed by the size of the 'black boxes' which were apparently necessary to cover up Borat's wedding tackle during the wrestling, (is that how the rest of the world saw Borat or is it just the USA which is so terrified of nudity?) but I'm seriously concerned about the fate of the chicken. Please someone. Tell me what happened to the chicken!",Null,2,5,25 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Good Stuff!!
","I have to admit that the only reason we went to see this movie was because we couldn't quite believe that Edward Norton had made it. Norton is an interesting and hugely talented actor, and as far as I'm concerned he's never made a bad film. I loved him in Keeping the Faith, in American History X (an intensely powerful film), in Fight Club, in The Painted Veil, in The Illusionist.. the list goes on. And he seems to have resisted over exposure in the media, which makes him all the more interesting. Cute too And the main reason this adaptation of The Incredible Hulk works is because of Norton. He brings such intense vulnerability and credibility to the role of Bruce Banner that the audience is filled with sympathy for the guy right from the start, which keeps us interested even through the fairly predictable special effects scenes where Banner becomes the Green Eyed monster /hero of the title and smashes everything in sight. I haven't seen any of the other iterations of this comic book character beyond a half watched TV episode or two many years back, so I can't make valid comparisons to Ang Lee's version and must review it as an entity by itself. But I thought this film extremely well cast, well written (Zak Penn) and well put together. It was a very pleasant surprise, as I hadn't expected much of it. Comparing this incarnation of The Hulk to the 4th Indiana Jones movie which I saw a couple of weeks ago, is pretty easy. This is a vastly superior film in every way. The opening sequences of the chase through the Brazilian favela are extremely well done; we get a real feel for the claustrophobic narrowness of the streets and the tough life of the inhabitants, as Banner runs for his life from the US Special Forces team who want to capture him for weapons research. I was gripped. I was interested. I was convinced. I wanted him to escape and I was totally drawn in. I thought this was one of the better chase scenes I've seen recently in a movie. Contrast that to the yawn inducing car chases in Indy 4, where I glanced at my watch thinking 'How much more can they possibly string this out?' Back in the USA Banner hooks up with ex girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler in the best role I've seen her in for a long time. The female love interest in an action movie isn't going to win anyone an Oscar nomination, but she made the most of it) and their scenes are played out with a surprising degree of tenderness and occasional humour (anger isn't the only thing to raise Bruce's pulse rate). Surprising? Well yes. These special effects driven films are not usually noted for their convincing emotional content. This was well done without  I hope  alienating the young male audience who seem to be the Holy Grail for Hollywood producers. William Hurt's villainous General Ross was matched only by Tim Roth's wicked and egotistical Emil Blonsky who morphs into The Abomination, a guy who makes The Hulk look cuddly. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and it came in briskly at a little under 2 hours rather than the obligatory 3 hours which nowadays seems to turn every action movie into cinematic purgatory. Good stuff!",Null,4,7,19 June 2008
3:10 to Yuma," Almost Classic Western
","Russell Crow was born to play an outlaw. This is the best role I've seen him in since A Beautiful Mind, making up for a few clunkers, and despite his high profile recently for an apparent attempt to make the Australian Olympic free-style phone chucking team, I found him utterly compelling as Ben Wade, in this good Western remake. Or perhaps it's because of his high profile for being a bad boy, that he seems born to play this part. Either way, I loved the movie, I loved Russell Crowe in the movie, and I loved just about everyone else in it too! This was a blissful two hours in Santa Cruz' Del Mar Theater for me.3.10 to Yuma is that very rare endangered species - a remake that actually works. It is very well cast, with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale squaring off as the Bad Boy and the Good Guy in a classic Western. I've been a sucker for Westerns since I was a little kid and watched Bonanza with string stirrups and reins festooned around a dining room chair. I was born 100 years too late and the wrong sex; I should have been a cowboy. As in all the best Westerns, the plot is not overly complex and I'm not going to attempt cheap psychological analysis. This is a movie about the people, rather than the plot, so it allows the actors to get their teeth into their characters. Dan Evans (Christian Bale) volunteers to help escort prisoner Ben Wade to Yuma, to be put on the prison train which will take him to custody. Evans is a Civil War veteran, injured but surviving. He is running a small ranch with his supportive wife and two half grown sons, and fighting off the wicked railroad barons who want his land. Times are tough. He takes the escort job because he needs the money. His older son William gets in on the act too, turning it from a dangerous escort duty into a dangerous escort duty with parenting duty thrown in too, but it never descends too far into cliché. This is yet another great part for Christian Bale, who just goes from strength to strength. He is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors. He squares off against Crowe's outlaw Ben Wade, an intelligent survivor who leads a gang of train robbers. The showdown in Yuma is a classic of almost High Noon proportions, and all concerned can feel satisfied that they have produced a Western to match any of the old greats. The whole cast was good, but worth mentioning are Ben Foster, whom I found utterly chilling as Ben Wade's sidekick, Gretchen Mol as Mrs Evans and Logan Lerman, as William.",Null,1,4,5 November 2007
Deja Vu," Good Entertaining Movie
","'But.if she was saved and they didn't find her burned, mutilated body on the riverbank, how did he know to go back in time and save her, he wouldn't have gone to her apartment ..?' 'And if the guy wasn't on the bridge but went back to the ferry and got shot, then..'. 'Umm, yes, but remember time is a braided river, heading ever onwards towards the ocean. Or something.'These were only a sample of several similar conversations my husband and I had after watching this movie on DVD. It's a pretty good movie. Not a classic, not a great movie, and of course the whole premise is hokum, but it's pretty well written, well acted and well filmed. I would expect no less from a combination of Denzel Washington and Tony Scott. I suspect that two middle aged codgers like us, are well past the age of the target audience, hence our need to mull over the plot afterwards! Washington is a good actor who seems to be without pretense. Every film I have seen him in, he gives an honest and totally committed performance. I loved him in Inside Man, which was one of the most underrated movies of 2006 in my opinion. He was, perhaps, less successful in American Gangster, if only because he seems to play a goodie more convincingly than a baddie. In Déjà Vu, as Agent Doug Carline, he goes back in time to try to prevent a terrorist attack on a ferry boat on the Mississippi, and to catch the terrorist. In the process he falls in love with a woman he first encounters as a corpse at the beginning. The necessary technobabble was slickly done, and the special effects were good without being overdone. The supporting cast were all more than adequate, and the story had a satisfying conclusion. Not the kind of movie to win any awards, but the kind that keeps people turning up on a Friday night to fill the movie theatres. Oh yes! And the rather gratuitous shots of victim Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) in her bra and then naked in the shower were nicely balanced by several equally gratuitous shots of Denzel without his shirt, so happiness all round. I'm a great believer in equal opportunity in sexploitation.",Null,2,4,20 January 2008
In Bruges," Blood and Redemption in Bruges.
","This is an interesting movie and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. It is extremely bloody, especially towards the end, so although it has its moments of black humour, no one should be under any illusion that this is a light weight comedy. It's not. Trailers I saw in the theatre last year (I finally watched the film on DVD at home) seemed to project In Bruges as some kind of British farce, and like other reviewers here, I find the actuality of the movie different to, but better than, the trailers had suggested. I'm not sure what prompts movie publicists to misrepresent movies, because In Bruges is good enough to stand on its own merit as a black comedy drama. Suggesting it's some kind of light comedy just brings in unsuspecting viewers who will be upset at the blood.Written and directed by Martin McDonagh the action is set in the unlikely locale of Bruges, a beautiful medieval town and UNESCO World Heritage Site in the north west of Belgium. Part of the irony of course, is that this is a movie about hit men, set in a place of astonishing beauty and in a nation widely believed (whether justly or unjustly is not for me to say) to be one of the most boring on earth. Better known for fine lace and beer, Bruges itself is one of the movie's stars and its architecture provides the backdrop to the violent action. This sets it apart from run of the mill hit men movies where we normally see people being wasted in deserted warehouses and on bleak streets. Here they expire before stunning ancient monuments on pretty cobbled streets or fall to their deaths from popular tourist haunts.Ray (Colin Farrell) plays an Irish hit man who has accidentally killed a child. The actual target was a priest, but while assassinating the priest a bullet went straight through him and into the child that Ray hadn't seen. Boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) packs him off to Bruges to wait while the situation cools down, in the care of Ken (Brendan Gleeson), the moral centre of the film. Ken is very taken with the culture and beauty of Bruges and treats the interlude as an unexpected and rather welcome vacation. Ray, a fish out of water, is unimpressed with the culture around him and initially whines that he is bored. He hooks up with a local woman Chloe and passes the time drinking. But we gradually see him disintegrate psychologically as the enormity of his crime sinks in. He killed a child. Can he redeem himself from such a crime in any meaningful way? The denouement comes after Ken discovers that Harry's plans for him go well beyond just being Ray's minder.The whole cast is excellent. This is probably the best work I've ever seen Colin Farrell do, I've never been a fan of his before. Ralph Fiennes gets his teeth into being a baddie and pulls off a passably good Cockney accent. Reviewing this movie prompted me to look at Fiennes profile on IMDb, and the range of characters he can play is just enormous. This is an actor who can make Voldemort real in the Harry Potter films, who played a gay butler in Bernard and Doris and a repressed lord in period costume in the Duchess, and I recall his as the stand out performance from The Constant Gardener some years back.And speaking of Harry Potter, In Bruges is something of a cast reunion. Brendan Gleeson, excellent as Ken, is one of those actors with a resume which appears to require extra bandwidth. Gleeson played Mad-Eye Moody in Harry Potter and it was also interesting to see Clémence Poesy again. Poesy plays Chloe  Ray's love interest - and I last recall her from a Harry Potter film too! She is perfect as small time crook and drug dealer Chloe who may or may not eventually help Ray redeem himself.A very politically incorrect movie. If the very idea of redemption from murder offends then just don't watch it. Personally I found the writing, acting and setting refreshingly original.",Null,1,3,1 March 2009
I'm Not There," Interesting Attempt at Something Different
","This is an interesting film and a brave attempt at something different and I have to admire it for that. Whether it really works, well, I'm not sure. I thought it too long and occasionally a bit lacking in narrative direction (I looked at my watch about 15 minutes from the end, which is not a good sign), and it would have benefited greatly from more ruthless editing. Nonetheless, I think it is praiseworthy.Director Todd Haynes has attempted to show the various aspects of Dylan's complex persona by using different actors to portray him as different people at different stages of his life and development as an artist. Some of these personas work better than others. At the risk of repeating what everyone else has already said, Cate Blanchett is astonishing. The movie is certainly worth watching just to see Blanchett. She has an uncanny physical resemblance to Dylan and has his mannerisms to a T. She portrays Dylan as he evolves from adored folk star to reviled rock star, dealing with a world which wants him to say something profound, when all he really wants to do is play his guitar and sing. The world wanted a messiah. Dylan apparently wanted a house in the country and lots of women, much like many other rock stars.I also loved Marcus Carl Franklin as Woody Guthrie Dylan. I think we are going to see much, much more of Franklin in the future, he is obviously a great talent. The first Christian Bale character works, and Heath Ledger is pretty believable as Straying Husband Dylan. But I was bemused by the Billy the Kid character as portrayed by Richard Gere, and pretty indifferent to Ben Whishaw / Arthur Rimbaud. For me, those didn't work so well.I'm Not There is probably best viewed after watching Martin Scorsese's No Direction Home and I have to be honest and admit I much preferred the Scorsese documentary to the Todd Haynes film. But this was a very creative approach to movie making, and for that reason, well worth watching. Cate Blanchett will probably get another nomination for this role.",Null,1,2,31 December 2007
Star Trek," Terrific. Super. Wonderful. Great!
","OK, I'm a closet Trekkie, let's get that out of the way upfront. But you don't have to be one, to enjoy this movie. It's fast paced, well acted, exciting, beautifully made and perfectly cast. It's a good movie - Trek or not. It's not especially cerebral, but neither is it as dumb as most big budget action flicks, and importantly for those of us who have watched every version of Star Trek over 40 years, it does stick to the spirit of the original show, bringing humanity and humour to space.Watching this origins episode (tagline The Future Begins Here) of the ongoing Star Trek story (and calling it a mere franchise just doesn't do it justice. It's a part of our cultural heritage) something occurred to me yet again, something that I often felt while watching the TV shows. The reason Star Trek works, is because it's about people. It's not about space flight, or science fiction or digital trickery or aliens or warps in the fabric of the space-time continuum or fabulous special effects, although those are all there in abundance. It's about people. As Kirk famously said in an earlier iteration of the Star Trek story (and I'm paraphrasing) 'I'm from Iowa. I just work in space.' This story just happens to be set in space but what it's about is Spock, Kirk, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu and the anonymous ensign who always dies early. It's about the humour and the interactions, the relationships and the characters that have seeped into our consciousness over the decades. And it had me hooked by the end of the excellent opening sequence.The story traces the early days of the crew of the USS Enterprise, as they pass through Starfleet Academy and take their place in the ranks of Starfleet officers. It explains the background of Kirk and Spock, and follows them and their colleagues as they must work through their differences to save earth from destruction (well what else would it be about?) Others will explicate the detail of the story, which involves the Romulans as enemies of the Federation, enemies who are seeking vengeance in the past for the destruction of their home planet at some future date, allowing their bad guys to travel back in time to confront Spock, Kirk et al. and the fabric of space time to be thoroughly upset. I think.....But what I'd really like to emphasize is the excellence of the casting which is truly inspired, the tightness of the script and the perfection of the effects which do EXACTLY what special effects should do – namely enhance the story telling, not drown it. I thought each and every actor was perfect in the part, but special mention must go to Zachary Quinto who is just superb as a young Spock wrestling with his human-Vulcan biracial origins. He looks uncannily like a young Leonard Nimoy but he is also a nuanced actor. Chris Pine as Kirk actually looks less like William Shatner (as compared to Qunito/Nimoy) but has the character to a 'T' without in any way just being an impersonation. Zoe Saldana as Uhuru was super and her flirtation with Spock was an unexpected but welcome aside to the main story, they brought a real sensuality to their scenes. Simon Pegg and Karl Urban were also perfect. I found Sulu perhaps the least believable of all the characters but that's a minor criticism. Chekov was perhaps a little too puppy-like, but nonetheless endearing. My only one slightly negative comment might be that this is very much a Boys Own story. Uhuru was of course the only significant woman on the original show back in the 60s, but we've gotten used to seeing the girlies take a bigger role in The Next Generation and the various other spin offs. It seemed strange in a prominent movie about the future, to see the women taking such a small role. And Scotty's fluffy friend was a bit unnecessary and reminded me too much of an Ewok. But apart from that - great! I'll buy the DVD. (Sad eh?)",Null,2,10,10 May 2009

I'm an old cynic but I allowed myself to be carried away by the dream, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Dennis Quaid was excellent, made for the part.  And my husband and son?

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Yo Ho No.
","I just know my daughter is going to kill me if she ever reads this. Normally a young woman of impeccably British cynicism and with barely an iota of emotion, she goes completely to pieces at the sight of Johnny Depp. And Orlando Bloom. Put them both in one movie and she's positively girly. So of course she thinks Pirates of the Caribbean 2; Dead Man's Chest is quite the most wonderful thing since, well, Pirates of the Caribbean 1. And I don't. I'm only giving it 5 stars so she doesn't leave home.Yes Johnny Depp is very nice to look at, (what the hell is he using on his skin? It's just beautiful..) and he is faultless and entertaining again in this his second outing as Captain Jack Sparrow. And Keira Knightly is lissome and lovely and feisty, and Orlando Bloom is, umm, Orlando Bloom. Sweet, inoffensive, very straight and loyal as Will Turner, and struggling hard not to be completely overwhelmed by Depp. The effects are awesome of course, Bill Nighy is excellent, Naomie Harris is good value, Tom Hollander does 'prissy' so well etc etc.This is an 'Oh look there's' movie, as in 'Oh look, there's thingy, wasn't he in......er you know, that TV thing, and oh look there's what's his name..' You get the idea? But this movie is half an hour too long, way, way too complicated and not as good as the first one, which I thoroughly enjoyed, mostly for its complete honesty. Yes, it was cheesy, but it was high class cheese. Hand-made farm organic Stilton. This is Kraft cheese-food slices. And it's bordering on the cynical, in its efforts to milk every last drop of interest out of the audience. And I'm afraid it lost my interest way before the end. Trilogies rarely work for me, although I'm sure the bankers love them. The only trilogy I've ever seen where part 3 was as good as part 1 is The Lord of the Rings. Somehow I doubt that Pirates 3 will be up to the standard of The Return of the King. Tell me, have they fired every film and story editor in Hollywood? Truly there were at least four places in the last third of the movie where I reached for my handbag thinking 'Well that must be it,' but no, it dragged on into another scene. And another. And another. More is NOT better. Sometimes less is better. This film could have lost at least 20 minutes, maybe thirty, and it would have been a far better movie for it. We would still have loved Johnny Depp, we would still have gasped at all the clever CGI stuff, we would still have put our hands in our wallets and gone to see part 3. In fact, I'm less inclined to see part 3 after sitting through 150 minutes of this one with my legs crossed. It's ironic that cinema owners love these super sized blockbusters because they fill the cash registers with money from pop corn stuffing and soda slurping kids, then the movie-going experience is ruined because every few minutes after the first hour and a half, someone gets up and clambers all over you to get to the bathroom. They should sell incontinence pants in the foyer, not sodas.I'm not the first person to note that the current tendency for movies to go on and on and on and.... is just way too much. King Kong, Superman Returns, X Men 3. All way too long (although the latter was worth sitting through just to see Hugh Jackman finally take his shirt off.) Enough already!",Null,3,6,23 July 2006
Public Enemies," Off to a Slow Start.
","Personally I thought the first third of Public Enemies was rather disjointed. Had I known nothing about the background to the story, I might have been struggling. I sat in my seat with a slight sense of disappointment, but not quite able to put my finger on exactly what wasn't working for me. Then, about one third of the way into the movie, maybe slightly less, it picked itself up, and I started to enjoy it. Maybe it was the appearance of Marion Cotillard as Johnny Depp's love interest that livened things up and made everyone suddenly multi dimensional? Or perhaps it's just that we expect so much of star Johnny Depp, and so much of director Michael Mann, that anything less than utter perfection is bound to disappoint? Public Enemies is certainly one of the better movies I've seen so far in 2009, and I watch a lot of movies. But it didn't really live up to the high expectations I'd set for it. Good? Yes. Great? No.Let's be honest here, any movie featuring my two favourite actors on screen at the same time – Depp and David Wenham – would have to be pretty dire to truly disappoint me, and I simply cannot see Depp getting involved in anything dire, can you? But this isn't Bonnie and Clyde, although it may well have had ambitions in that direction. It will not be seen as a classic of the gangster movie genre.Depp, as always, is charismatic, as Public Enemy No. 1 bank robber John Dillinger in the Mid West of the depression era. This guy was no Robin Hood, and the movie doesn't gloss over the slaughter and mayhem his gang caused. When the movie opens, the gang is being busted bloodily out of jail. They set off on a string of bank and train robberies across the Mid West, upsetting not just the authorities but also the Mafia, for whom Dillinger is a renegade, a free agent and a nuisance beyond their control. Crime has moved on, they tell him at one point, beyond the freelance small time gangs such as his, into massive organized crime such as wire fraud. Against this backdrop, J. Edgar Hoover (a very good Billy Crudup) is trying to set up the FBI, a force able to pursue outlaws across state lines. Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis the G Man tasked with tracking Dillinger down, but it's a rather one dimensional performance. Eventually Dillinger is betrayed by a supposed friend, a woman who will be deported if she doesn't finger him.The performances are all pretty good. I especially liked Cotillard as Dillinger's girl, Billie Frechette, and Diane Krall puts in a brief appearance as a night club singer. The sound track is good and the cinematography just fine, the time period is lovingly recreated. But somehow, for me, it never really rose above the sum of its parts to become the truly exciting film it should have been with a director and a cast this good. It lacks that extra magic that distinguishes a good film from a great one. As I said above, good but not great.",Null,1,1,12 July 2009
Hot Fuzz," At last! A reason to be proud to be a Brit!
","I've seen a bunch of movies in the last couple of weeks, mostly because I'm going offshore to work for a while and won't have access to a cinema (lots of DVDs though). I had to get my movie fix in advance for a whole month! I'm an addict. I watch movies for lots for different reasons, entertainment, education, to be moved, to be frightened, to be transported away from the everyday dull reality of life, and in the last few weeks I've seen The Wind that Blows the Barley, Hoax, 300, Music and Lyrics and The Lives of Others, all satisfying in their own way, and for many different reasons.But rarely do I watch a movie which makes me feel patriotic! (Quite the opposite, mostly I feel that the Brits have a lot to feel bad about......see my review of The Wind that Blows the Barley and The Proposition) But Hot Fuzz made me nostalgic for a country I left 10 years ago. I saw the movie in a mainstream cinema in California, which was completely full, the audience were in hysterics, and everyone clapped enthusiastically at the end! I felt positively proud to be a Brit!! No other country could possibly have made Hot Fuzz. It is quite perfect. A parody that is more than just a series of skits, it is classy, hilariously funny, well written, very well made and utterly British. Hot Fuzz contains every cliché you have ever seen in a cop movie, woven into a wonderfully nutty story line, and it's perfectly acted and edited. I loved Shaun of the Dead, this is even better and deserves to be a huge hit.This, I think, is Wallace and Grommitt for grown ups, with the same very British sense of humour and self parody. There isn't that much wrong with a nation which can take the mickey out of itself so well.Oh God I'm getting homesick...................!!",Null,4,7,23 April 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Not Just Gay Cowboys..a Laughing Audience too.
","Although that is, of course, what's got all the attention, this is very much more than a story about two gay cowboys. This is a story about unfulfilled and frustrated lives in general. And it's also quite a stark appraisal of hidden rural poverty, because if there's one thing most of the characters apparently share in this look at 1960s Wyoming, it's lives defined largely by their poverty, in contrast to the much more affluent Texan characters. It's a tragic story, beautifully filmed, perfectly scripted and wonderfully acted with a good soundtrack. Heath Ledger (Ennis Del Mar) gives a terrific performance as a gruff guy living a life of constant frustration and suppressed anger and passion, torn between what he wants to do and what society expects. I can forgive him the mumbling, which meant a few of the words were lost, because somehow you still knew what he was saying. Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack Twist) is equally good in a slightly smaller role, and the supporting cast members are all perfect. I loved this movie, and everything that can possibly be said about it has already been said on this web site and at many other sources, so what I'd really like to assess is the rather strange reaction of the audience with whom I shared the viewing experience.I saw this movie in an art house cinema in an ultra liberal, west coast, university town, amongst a largely young audience, many of whom I suspect were local students. The show was sold out. This was an audience ready and primed to embrace everything this movie stood for. At one of the most tragic parts of the movie, when Ennis Del Mar's young, unsuspecting, wife first discovers that her husband is attracted to other men, (she sees him furtively kissing Jack), a large proportion of the audience burst out laughing. I sat in utter astonishment as the kids around me chortled and guffawed, apparently thoroughly entertained at the idea that this poor woman's life was falling apart. It could have been a sitcom, judging by their reaction, with wifey saying 'Oh gosh! Silly me! Fancy me not realizing dear ol' Ennis is gay!' As we watched this woman's confusion and distress unfold on screen, they laughed! Many times. In truly inappropriate places. As she checked out his unused fishing gear, to see if her worst fears were confirmed, as she eventually confronted him, they laughed.I've puzzled about this reaction ever since. Have we really come so far in 40 years that kids can't imagine a world in which homosexuality was not just dangerous but illegal, and now they think it's some kind of joke that many people hid it within marriage? And if we have come that far, is it a good thing or a bad thing? Have they really no idea how horribly innocent women were back then (my mother's generation  I remember it well)? Are their senses so dulled by the over stimulation of modern life that they have lost the ability to empathize with other people's personal pain and tragedy, even when it's so well presented to them? I was astonished by the laughter, and a little disturbed. Fortunately, as the movie progressed, they 'got it', finally seeming to appreciate that this was indeed a tragedy, of Shakespearean proportions, not a fall-about comedy. They were silent by the end, and, I hope, moved.",Null,38,47,16 January 2006
Juno," Manipulative and Simplistic
","Look, I do get it. I fully appreciate that a film about a girl who gets pregnant, has an early abortion, then manages to move on, would be a pretty short movie. In fact, so short it wouldn't get made. No one wants to know about reality. And certainly in 21st century North America, no one wants to portray abortion as a viable option. Very, very bad form currently.But when I see this film reviewed as 'blazingly truthful' and the pregnant 16 year old central character described as being 'in a pickle', as I did in one review, as if perhaps she'd forgotten a homework assignment and might get detention, I have to admit that the cynic who lurks in my soul gets full rein. This is basically a cutesy film about being pregnant at 16, where despite a few problems, everyone gets to live pretty much happily ever after. Gosh, girl in a pickle comes good! Ahhh!! And apparently everyone in the cinema where I saw it was quite overwhelmed by attacks of the warm fuzzies, except me. Two seats away, a woman slightly older than me was weeping joyfully by the end while behind me, young women were giggling happily as sweet Juno's bump grew. Good grief! Is this really a message we want to give to 16 year olds? I'm beginning to think I'm something of an oddity. You see, I don't find it 'blazingly truthful' that a bright, resourceful and articulate 16 year old as Juno is portrayed, would be so dumb as to have inadequately protected sex then seem surprised to find herself up the spout. One point of the script is that Juno herself apparently initiated the sex, thought it through in advance in fact, because she was bored. I therefore assume the pregnancy was at least to some extent planned. And if she really had no idea that sex might lead to pregnancy, her parents (portrayed as bemused but supportive), should be excoriated for such inadequate parenting. And if I see one more review which describes Juno as a comedy about growing up 'and the bumps along the way.' (I'm prepared to bet good money on that having been written by a middle aged man), I swear I'm going to run amok in the local mall with a urine dip stick. Being pregnant at 16 isn't a sweet joke, abortion clinics (whatever you think of their morality - and I'm neutral on that) are not run by morons, and while Juno has some amusing one-liners, and a good central performance from Ellen Page, it is basically a deeply flawed, superficial movie which is trying too hard to be cute. It's extremely manipulative.I'm going to be very controversial and suggest that far from being surprised by an unplanned pregnancy, Juno might actually be a very willful young woman who wants to add pregnancy/childbirth/adoption to her 'experiments-in-living' list. At everyone else's expense. It certainly makes her the center of attention. She wouldn't be the first girl to get pregnant for that reason.I found the situation between the adoptive parents more convincing. Childless Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is desperate for a baby. Husband Mark is not so sure, and does at least eventually face up to the truth of his uncertainty by making a break for it. He may be 40 going on 18, but he's being honest about it. And for me the most moving scene in the whole film was when Vanessa held the newborn child in her arms for the first time, having decided to go it alone as a mother anyway. If there is a message to be taken from this movie, it's possibly that becoming a mother when the time is right, is just fine. A superficial, cutesy, lightweight movie. The fact it was written by a woman is no excuse. I am gobsmacked that it's been nominated.",Null,662,1089,13 January 2008
Match Point," OK but not brilliant
","'Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive'. Unless of course we get lucky, and the crime gets blamed on someone else.I liked this movie if only because the baddie DIDN'T get his come-uppance, and we weren't required to sit through the requisite, predictable, Hollywood moralistic ending. My spouse said Match Point made him feel uncomfortable but couldn't quite put his finger on why. Maybe the lack of justice for the protagonist, maybe the squirm inducing look at the unpleasant and exclusive face of upper class England (and I'm saying that as Brit born and bred in London who spent the 3 worst years of her life at a posh English boarding school alongside many of these sort of people.) Actually the fact that the movie is set in London is mostly irrelevant; it could have been the upper classes of any nation  I suspect they all behave in much the same way. The movie explores themes of infidelity, hypocrisy, patronage and deception, and makes much of the rather uncomfortable idea that our fate in life is decided by sheer luck as much as anything, despite the fact that we all like to fool ourselves that we are really in control of our destiny.Poor boy made good Chris, takes a job as a tennis coach at an exclusive club and finds himself drawn into the world of the landed rich. Marrying into a monied family, he gets accustomed to their style of living and is happy to accept the patronage of his father in law, rising in the family business, spending weekends at the country house, and generally worming his way into a world hitherto barred to him. Fine, except that he lusts after a woman other than his nice but naïve wife, and he's living a complete lie. Which will win out? An ignominious life with lusciously sexy but poor, screwed up and rather humourless Nola (gorgeous Scarlett Johansson who gets better in every movie she does), or the rich pickings of life with sweet but dull wifey Chloe, and the comfortable shelter and patronage of her family? The family admire Chris for having 'pulled himself up by his bootstraps' and made something of himself from humble beginnings, but the truth is of course, that Chris is utterly amoral and totally weak, and when forced to make a choice, he opts to commit a terrible crime rather than give up his pleasant lifestyle.The crime he commits is very far from perfect, in fact it's really amateur and botched, but by sheer good luck, he gets away with it. We hate to think that could happen, but in real life, maybe it does? I thought the performances reasonably good, but the casting choices rather strange. To be honest, I never could quite understand why either Chloe or Nola had the hots for Chris, who seemed to me to be rather too self absorbed and moody to attract a girl like Chloe, even before the great deception began, although he was certainly pretty to look at. Penelope Wilton seemed altogether too middle class to fit convincingly into the upper class lifestyle - although that may be my problem not hers, as I kept thinking of her performance in Shaun of the Dead - and Brian Cox (who is a wonderful actor) seemed a bit out of place as a dynamic businessman, looking more like a slightly crumpled engineer. Also not entirely convincing, Chris's meteoric rise to the top in the family firm. Britain is not quite the class riddled place it used to be; businesses there are run for the bottom line, just like they are anywhere else. You don't get to be a hotshot purely by connection to the boss these days, you actually have to be good at what you do and efficient, and we saw little evidence of that in Chris.But altogether it was gripping and quite entertaining, and I wanted to see how Chris's dilemma was resolved. Certainly not a wasted night out.",Null,0,2,29 January 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Just see it.
","Hotel Rwanda is a true story. Attempting to write a review of this movie seems pretty trivial, and can never do it justice. The bare facts are straightforward.In 1994 in the central African state of Rwanda, approximately one million people, men, women, children and babies, were horrifically murdered by a savage and uncontrolled militia. It was an ethnic war, genocide, in which no one but a Rwandan could possibly have known who was who and why it was happening. The world stood by and let it happen. The foreigners and press fled, the UN did little. Amidst all the carnage and mayhem, one man, Paul Rusesabagina (marvellously portrayed by Cheadle), who had the very unheroic job of Assistant Hotel Manager, saved well over one thousand two hundred people from certain death by taking them into his hotel, and using his wits and his connections to keep the militia at bay and play one side off against the other, mostly with a combination of cash, booze and Cuban cigars. What started as an attempt to save just his own family, ended up in total heroism, and many, many people owe him their lives. The comparisons to Schindler's List are obvious.What really surprised me, given the facts, is how little explicit gore there is in this movie, and I think it is a great credit to the film makers, that, by focusing on the emotions and relationships of the central characters, the movie accurately depicts the utter terror and desperation of the events, without forcing the audience to turn their heads from the screen in nausea. We are shown corpses, and the terror on the faces of innocent children, but little gut-wrenching special effects gore, thank god. This film is little short of a masterpiece and the performances are perfect. It should be compulsory viewing for everyone over the age of 14. I'm taking my teenagers next week.",Null,0,0,15 January 2005
Once," Interesting Tale.
","Watching the opening sequence of this film you might be forgiven for thinking you had stumbled into a screening of Jackass. Or Candid Camera (if anyone out there is old enough to remember that?) The Guy (Glen Hansard) is busking on the streets of Dublin, when a drunk runs off with his takings, sitting in his guitar case. Thrusting his guitar into the hands of a startled stranger, the Guy gives chase across town to retrieve his money.The camera work looks like it was shot with a hidden lens, which it may well have been, and it sets the scene for the movie which has the feel of cinéma vérité. I can appreciate that it's not a style to everyone's taste, and there are certainly moments when the film has a distinctly amateurish feel, but this is not a movie which is pretending to be a Hollywood blockbuster or a big budget pot-boiler, despite the nominations and awards. It's a small movie with a low key, little known cast (little known here in the USA anyway), and the filming style gives it a naturalistic, intimate feel. Which I assume is the intention, so it could be considered a success, even if the style leaves many people puzzled.The Guy sings popular songs during the day, interspersed with work in his dad's vacuum cleaner repair shop, but at night he sings his own songs. And that's when the Girl (Markéta Irglová) stops to listen to him. She is an immigrant, and is having the full immigrant experience, working several jobs, cleaning houses, selling flowers on the street and taking care of her baby and her mother. And her vacuum cleaner needs fixing. But superficial appearances are deceptive; she's a classically trained pianist, and, like the Guy, also a talented musician. Lacking a piano, she slips into a city music shop to play the instruments there. She left her husband back home in the Czech Republic to come to the West and try to make a success of her life. The movie follows the lives of the Guy and the Girl over the course of several days as they explore their burgeoning mutual, creative interests, her words and keyboard skills giving his songs depth. Their relationship centers around the music, but will it ever be more? His clumsy attempt at seduction is rebuffed, but it's obvious they have a mutual attraction.Rounding up some other musicians from the streets of Dublin, they rent a studio to make a demo. Afterwards, demos in hand, the Guy goes off to London, seeking fame, fortune and his ex. But the Girl has responsibilities and can't go with him, having a baby and a mother to support. She enriched his creative process, but will probably be left behind now. Life intervenes. (Let's hope she signed a royalties deal..) I found it interesting, and fresh, and I enjoyed the opportunity to watch something just a little bit different from the usual cinematic fare. I quite liked the music, but on reflection I doubt we'll be humming it a year from now, (it is a little over wrought.) On the whole I thought this was a pleasant movie. It's not earth-shatteringly good, but it's touching, and an original look at the creative process and human relationships, shot in an unusual style. My husband thought it quite wonderful, and trotted straight off to the music store to buy the soundtrack.",Null,7,11,17 June 2007
Crash," One of last year's best
","I recently rewatched this movie on DVD, having seen it months ago at the movie theatre. I'd forgotten just how very good it is. This is a type of story telling I really enjoy, thought provoking and non-linear, taking something as random as a car crash, then using it as the basis for weaving several apparently disparate story lines together. Intersecting lives showing the 'butterfly wing' effect, how one event affects another in a chain reaction, until the tiny air movement of a butterfly's wing causes a hurricane. I also love movies with an ensemble cast such as Crash has, not one huge star and a scattering of lesser mortals but a multitude of parts exploring a wide range of characters. Everyone here was excellent without exception. The film explores such diverse themes as ingrained racism, crime and corruption, the inadequacies of the health care system for the elderly, and family duty, against the backdrop of Los Angeles. It tries to show how none of us can live in isolation in the city, our lives are interdependent whether we like it or not, and, whatever our backgrounds, most of us are trying to find the same things in life; safety, security, a reasonable living. The movie also explores how the constant frustrations of life, and mis-communications can cause people to flip, from anger, fear, distrust and despair. Matt Dillon's cop trying to care for his father, and Don Cheadle's cop trying to care for his mother, stood out for me, and Jennifer Esposito was very good in too small a part. Well worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.",Null,0,4,29 January 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Simply The Year's Best
","This is without a doubt the best movie of 2007 and I am astonished that it hasn't been nominated for Best Picture. In fact, I think it's a travesty of justice. Yes, Johnny Depp (Sweeney Todd / Benjamin Barker) is nominated and deservedly so, Depp is riveting here. But am I alone in being incredulous that director Tim Burton is not also nominated? The supporting cast is excellent too.Admittedly Burton had pretty wonderful source material in the Stephen Sondheim musical, but his translation to the screen is masterful. The evocation of Dickensian London, the gloomy, almost overwhelming design (I hate to use Gothic yet again, but I guess that's what it is), the casting, the realization on screen of this story, is just perfection. I love it. To quickly summarize the story, Benjamin Barker was shunted off to the Australian penal colonies by a corrupt judge who desired his pretty wife and now holds his daughter captive. Returning some 15 years later as one Sweeney Todd, Barker swears revenge and with the help of his landlady, Mrs Lovett, starts dispatching the undeserving upper crust of London. Barber Barker slits their throats, Lovett makes them into tasty pies. I have always been a bit of a sucker for musicals, because I think when well done they are a sublime form of pure entertainment. But this works on a whole different level. No singing and dancing in the rain here, but drama, passion, blood lust, revenge and wit. This is more opera than musical. My daughter, who is a musical theatre student and a bit of a Sondheim fan, told me they left out one of the best songs, but I can't say I noticed. Johnny Depp is terrific in this role. His esoteric career choices (I watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas the other night, and it would be hard to get further from Sweeney Todd than that) show him to be a truly great and disciplined actor. He can create convincing characters and rise above his movie star status. Much has already been said about his singing, but I think it's just fine for the movie. No, it wouldn't work on stage, but this isn't the stage, that's the point. This is a movie, an entirely different medium, he doesn't need to be able to project his voice into the upper dress circle . Yes, he does sound like David Bowie as many reviewers have noted - which is interesting given that he comes from Kentucky and David Bowie is from Brixton - but Depp is a much better singer than Bowie is an actor. Helena Bonham Carter (Mrs Lovett) could perhaps have done with some more singing lessons. She just about gets away with it, because she's a convincing actress, (I could well see her making Priest Pies), but I have to admit I couldn't hear all her words, and words are the essence of Sondheim. That is my only criticism really. Ed Sanders, the young actor who plays Toby, is very good and sings beautifully, Alan Rickman, long one of my favourite actors, gives another great performance as the nasty judge, and Timothy Spall is perfectly cast as Beadle Bamford. Also very good, is scene stealing Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, Todd's first victim. A lovely over-the-top performance, which made me view him in a whole new light (I'd only seen him before as Borat.) It's stylishly gory, highly dramatic, and very gripping. I saw it twice in the space of a couple of weeks and gained even more from second viewing. It will definitely join my DVD library. This is a film which will stand the test of time in a year of pretty indifferent material. I am at a loss as to why it's not been nominated for Best Picture.",Null,1,3,3 February 2008
Closer," Tedious and self indulgent
","Closer disappointed me. It's one of those irritating movies about self obsessed, clever, cruel people who apparently never want for money and who have nothing better to do with their time than mess up their lives. Gosh, where did that come from? As Yoda might have said, 'Move me, it did not.' In truth, this movie did nothing for me except make me sigh with frustration. Because I think with some sharper editing and tauter writing it could have been a lot better. Still not great, but at least passable. I disliked all 4 of the major players, although Natalie Portman was certainly the least irritating of the group. And this movie managed to achieve the rare distinction of making me rather ashamed to be a Brit! Take it from me, not all British men are quite the immature, manipulative, dysfunctional w*&%^rs portrayed here by Clive Owen and Jude Law. Some but not all. I watched this on DVD at home, and almost switched off before the end, something I hate to do, as I take some kind of perverse pleasure in sticking it out, no matter how dire the movie. I guess it's the grown up movie-goer's equivalent of being told to clean your plate as a child. But I mean, who really gives a toss about any of this lot? Possibly the characters in the original play were more engaging, but I failed to engage with any of these.The basic story has Julia Roberts playing Anna, a depressive (and depressing) photographer, who falls for Dan (Jude Law) but marries Larry (Clive Owen) while Portman plays the ex-stripper Alice / Jane who for some reason I never quite fathomed, adores Dan but may or may not have had a fling with Larry while working as a Pole Dancer. With me so far? Good. We see them split, come together, split again all in a totally humourless way, and by that time I just wanted to pick the lot of them up and bang their collective heads against a wall. If this is supposed to be a look at the love lives of post-ironic, 'smart' people, all I can say is 'Thank God I'm Stupid'. I may have had relationships as bad as this, but at least I could enliven the proceedings with a good drunken row occasionally or a hearty bout of hysterical crying. These guys are trying to be so cool and mature, but end up simply being cold and passé. And doesn't anybody ever laugh at themselves in this super trendy, smart world of interconnected love lives? In short, this film is badly conceived rather than badly made, and should probably be avoided unless you are an uncritical obsessive fan of one of the leads. And although I like Natalie Portman and could be won over by Clive Owen (very good in Gosford Park and simply stunning in Inside Man), I remain puzzled as to the appeal of Law and Roberts. Especially here.",Null,1,2,27 March 2006
Capote," Just about perfect
","It's very rare that I watch a film that truly mesmerizes me. It's even rarer for me to write a review that doesn't have me reaching for the thesaurus to find synonyms for 'cliché'. I often feel that everything I watch is just a re-hashing of something else (possibly a sign of encroaching middle age?). But I truly thought this was one of the best films, and one of the most original, that I've seen in a long time. I don't know enough about Truman Capote to be able to comment on the veracity of Philip Seymour Hoffman's interpretation of him. But you don't need to be a Capote expert to appreciate the film or the performances, because it stands by itself as an interesting portrayal of a writer and the writing process. I really can find almost nothing to criticize  very unusual for me, cynic that I am! The story is simple and true. It's 1959, and four terrible and apparently motiveless murders take place at an isolated farmhouse in Kansas. An entire family wiped out brutally. Truman Capote, already a successful novelist and screen writer, reads about the murders while in New York and, intrigued, decides to go to Kansas to investigate not just the murders, but the background and the whole process which produces a man  or men - who could do such a thing. Not so much a Who Dunnit? as a Why Dunnit? The effete New York socialite hardly blends into the small Midwestern town, so he takes his best pal Nel Harper Lee, herself about to become famous for To Kill a Mockingbird, to act as an assistant. The murderers are quickly caught and put on trial, but that's only the beginning.Over a period of five years, through appeals and stays of execution, Capote extracts from one of the murderers, Perry Smith, the guts of his most famous work, In Cold Blood. Switching between Capote's New York life, and the stark, grim prison within which Smith is awaiting execution, we watch the relationship between them develop and try to assess who is using whom. Capote wants his book, his story, his adoring public and his satisfactory ending  the explanation for the crime. Smith wants a decent lawyer and repeated stays of execution and maybe the recognition that he is someone, not just a nobody.If Capote cruelly manipulates and uses Smith for his own literary ends, then Smith keeps him waiting, for that crucial exposition of what took place inside the house on the night of the murders. Smith appears intelligent and artistically talented but warped by childhood neglect. Capote himself had a miserable childhood, and realizes how easily their roles could have been reversed. In the end there is never any doubt that the men were guilty, but maybe  or maybe not  Capote has fallen in love with Perry. Certainly he never finished a book again after this defining period of his life, and he died of the side effects of alcohol. Did he enjoy some kind of icey pleasure from seeing Smith hang? Was he utterly amoral in his approach to using Smith as the source for his book? The performances are all outstanding, not just Philip Seymour Hoffmann's, but the supporting actors too. I thought the cinematography excellent, and I wouldn't have changed a single word of the script. We see the patronising attitude of 1950s men to women and the clever, arch and artsy society within which Capote moved, and wince that, for my age group at least, this may look like another age, but it's all so close to home. Very good. Very, very good. If only more people had seen it. Addendum: I've now seen the second Capote film, Infamous. That too was excellent but personally, I think Capote just has the edge. A purely personal opinion.",Null,3,4,5 March 2006
Burn After Reading," Contemplate After Watching
","I enjoyed the Coen's Brothers Burn After Reading, but perhaps not quite as much as I'd hoped, after seeing the trailers for weeks beforehand. The trailers definitely featured all of the best bits, and, I think, rather spoiled it for me.; instead of whetting the appetite, they built up the expectation to such an extent that it would have been hard not to be slightly disappointed by the actual product. Let's be honest here, the story is pretty slim and very contrived, the characters mostly stereotypes. But, it was fun to see that many big stars on the screen in one vehicle and they all appeared to be having a good time. This is most definitely an 'Oh look, there's' movie, and it's enjoyable on that level, but it doesn't pay to read too much into it. For a light comedy, the violence when it came was rather shocking, perhaps out of place in such a film. I felt that perhaps this movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be, a biting satire or a fall about comedy. There's a difference.In brief, two self obsessed gym employees (I hesitate to use the word 'instructors' because all the gym instructors I know are such nice, well balanced people!) find a CD in the locker room, a CD which appears to contain some CIA files. The files belong to one Osborne Cox (a beautifully malevolent John Malkovitch), recently defrocked by the CIA for his alcohol habit and now filling his empty days at home with bad memoir writing and step aerobics. Unbeknownst to him, he is about to be divorced by his viper-tongued, doctor wife Katie (fabulous and astonishingly slim Tilda Swinton), who is having an affair with Treasury agent Harry (George Clooney), whose author wife is having an affair with some other guy.and so on. Harry is himself a compulsive seducer, who picks up women via the internet. The files on the CD are worthless, but our two heroes Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) are certain they have something of value to 'the enemy' and try selling them to a rather bemused Russian embassy employee. The Russians? Yes, the Russians a running theme throughout the movie. And they can't even see Russia from where they live in DC.. Linda wants money for plastic surgery. Chad's motives are less specific if equally dubious  he seems to just want the adventure of being a big shot. Linda meanwhile has a date with Harry, and all the characters get interlocked.Now much has been made of Brad Pitt's performance in this movie, and it's certainly entertaining to watch, not because you think 'Wow! What a wonderful characterization of a gym bunny,' but because you think 'Wow! Brad Pitt is aging well,' (he is) and 'Hey! So a guy interested in architecture and world peace doesn't take himself so seriously that he can't have fun playing an idiot!' In fact my main criticism of this movie is that Brad didn't take his shirt off. But you're never, ever in any danger of forgetting that this is Brad Pitt. His death (at the hands of a surprised Harry, when discovered hiding in a closet) is untimely and rather cruel and unnecessarily graphic and blood spattered, I felt. The scenes in the Russian embassy are fun; the picture of Putin looking down from the wall over the shoulder of the chain smoking, skeptical Soviet diplomat. Other small details are fun too; the tedious subject matter (the workings of Congress) of the children's books Harry's wife writes, Chad donning a geeky cycle helmet and biking to his blackmail encounter with Cox. And Frances McDormand holds the whole thing together; Linda is a heart breaking character, searching for Mr Right in a cynical world of bed hoppers, banking on surgery to improve her chances, and convinced that this CIA CD is her one big break. McDormand is great. Ted Treffon (Richard Jenkins) is perhaps the one totally straightforward character in the movie, he adores Linda just the way she is, but ends up dead for his pains, hammered to death by Cox who finally cracks up. Jenkins (who delighted in The Visitor) produces possibly the best acting in this movie. His was the only character to appear where I didn't think 'Oh look. There's...' There are certainly laugh aloud moments in this film. The two CIA bosses (J.K. Simmons and David Rasche) are fabulous in their surreal discussion of body disposal, yet it left me feeling it could have been better, and I'm really not quite sure what it was trying to say beyond DC is a sad and dysfunctional place. Perhaps I'm trying to read too much into it?",Null,2,6,21 September 2008
Watchmen," Camp But NotYerKidsComicBookMovie
","It's taken me some days to decide about Watchmen. I enjoyed it far more than I'd expected, given the indifferent reviews and the vivid descriptions of graphic violence and spraying blood that a friend had given me. So I waited for the hype to die down and approached it with an open mind and an empty stomach. I haven't read the comic book (graphic novel or whatever's the current politically correct appellation.)I gave Zack Snyder's last creation 300 a straight 10/10, but possibly for reasons he'd not appreciate (all that beautiful muscular male flesh) and I think as a creative force, Snyder is best described as feverish. But Watchmen is well executed, well edited, creatively made, briskly camp and occasionally witty with a few (but really not enough) one liners. It's also overly long, somewhat pretentious, occasionally daft, ever so slightly racist and very bloody. But more about the gore later.It's the 1980s in a parallel universe. Nixon is into his third term having won the Vietnam War for America, the normal rules of government abandoned. A retired superhero The Comedian (who reminded me vaguely of Robert Downey Jr.) is murdered. Is it a plot to annihilate the last of the superheroes? Were they out of control? Public opinion turned against them, so they've been living quiet lives out of sight - especially the big guy, Dr Manhattan, who is a very fetching shade of blue from the top of his bald head to the bottom of his feet and all points in between. Dr M, product of a nasty lapse in lab HSE rules, is all ponderous technobabble and hands. He's lost touch with his humanity and sounds like a mating between Data from Star Trek and HAL from 2001. This is a guy who can grow in size at will; I like him. Rorschach, masked Invisible Man style and asthmatically husky, investigates the death while Dr M wrestles with his inner demons. M's girlfriend Laurie - the daughter of another superheroine and played by leggy Malin Akerman - leaves him for Nite Owl II who is the Watchmen's Clark Kent. They decide to get back into the old tights (very tight in Laurie's case. Can one only be a superheroine in groin splitting leotards and a garter belt?) and start righting wrongs, while Ozymandias, the brains of the gang (bearing a striking resemblance to David Bowie) makes a fortune and may well be killing humanity to save it from itself. With me so far? Good. He lives in an Antarctic reconstruction of the Temple of Karnak with a genetically modified tiger. Dr M lives on Mars, and with poor Laurie tortured by her love for him Venus style, you don't have to be a genius to understand Snyder's agenda. But I don't have a problem with that, this is a fantasy and it's not subtle stuff. Nite Owl and Laurie get it on quite nicely and both look suitably buff and perky naked. Patrick Wilson has a nice butt. Watchmen works its way to a not unexpected conclusion in a fairly entertaining way with enough sex to keep me interested.Now, that blood and gore, which ruins the camp allure. We see an axe splitting a head open, a guy getting his hands taken off by electric saw, the remains of a kidnapped female 6 year old fed to dogs, a woman's face as she's beaten up and then splayed face down over a pool table as a prelude to doggy style rape (but she must have enjoyed it, right? Apparently she went back for more later and got pregnant with Laurie. Now doesn't that bring a lump to your throat?) There's a guy getting boiling cooking oil in the face, others set on fire, beaten senseless and the usual routine shootings. All vital for that important 18 – 30 male demographic without which we are led to believe the movie industry wouldn't exist. Watchmen is an R certificate in the USA. Which actually means that small kids can watch it as long as a 'guardian' is with them. I saw it 3 weeks into its run, quite late at night, which meant, thank goodness, a fairly grown up audience. My friend saw it a few days after it opened and much earlier in the day and the theatre was full of kids. Now I blame the parents when children see a totally unsuitable movie, and I don't especially blame Snyder who is out to make a buck like all corporate execs. But I'm less enamored of Warner Brothers marketing machine. They know that a movie this expensive will not return a healthy profit unless a large number of under 18s go and see it, so they market it as a Superhero movie (watch the trailers) when it's borderline horror in places. The R rating allows everyone to be totally disingenuous and say 'Well it's all down to parental supervision.' But the truth is far too many parents can't be bothered to censor what their children see, or to hire a baby sitter, so young kids sit through this stuff, munching popcorn and sodas while little girls are ripped up by dogs, women get raped and men get their hands chopped off. And we wonder why so many are dysfunctional? And what is it with Snyder and the irritating narrations? We got one in 300, (in slightly off kilter Queen's English. Why? The actor's Australian. I assume the Spartans spoke some kind of ancient Greek dialect so why not just do the narration in an Australian accent and be damned? It's just as (in)accurate.) Here we have Rorschach's hoarse narration which is intensely grating after 2 hours. I am deeply suspicious of any movie which requires a voice over to explain the plot. But on the whole, as a consenting adult, I actually quite enjoyed Watchmen. I'm just worried about the non consenting kids.",Null,1,4,30 March 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Perfect Friday Night Movie
","I'm going to invent a new category of film. Forget Film Noir, Date Movies, Chick Flix and Romantic Comedy. Think instead Friday Night Movie.The Friday Night Movie (and I'm talking here about something watched on a public cinema screen, not on the DVD at home.) is a movie which provides good entertainment without actually insulting the intelligence of the viewer. It is worth spending $10 of your hard earned cash on a ticket after a tedious week at work, but won't cause you to spend the drive home interrogating your date on who said what, where, and when, and whether your inability to follow the plot is a function of encroaching middle age. A Friday Night Movie should  ideally  see you leaving the movie theatre smiling not cringing. It should not be so long that you spend the last third with your legs crossed, and it should set you up for the weekend, not send you diving into the nearest pub to drown your sorrows.Little Miss Sunshine is the perfect example of a classic Friday Night Movie. I loved it. Perfectly written, not a word was out of place, stylishly acted, witty and entertaining, it didn't tax my concentration too much. But I didn't have to make lame excuses for watching it either. I laughed out loud throughout most of it, and smiled wryly in many other places. My sister used to own a Volkswagon mini van very similar to the one featured in Little Miss Sunshine. An ex-German post office van, I took it on many adventures to pop festivals back in the 70's. The automatic choke possessed a mind of its own and used to suddenly stick on 'full' - usually when you were driving down a narrow one way street in the middle of London - meaning that every so often I had to pull up abruptly on the side of the road, run around the back (rear engine) to adjust the choke, and then leap back into the driving seat before the traffic piled up too much behind me. The horn sounded JUST like the one in this movie! This movie was so well observed. I just know the writers must have owned a Volkswagon of a certain age. Possibly they bought it off my sister..The whole cast were fabulous, the characters were slightly over the top but not so far as to be utterly unbelievable. I especially loved the episode where they are wrestling Grandpa's body out of the hospital window.. the final scene on stage at the pageant is maybe slightly too long but that's a very nit picky criticism. Great fun. I hope it makes millions for all concerned.Other good Friday Night Movies I've seen over the last few months include The Devil Wears Prada (Meryl Streep was fabulous), The Queen (Helen Mirren was fabulous), Look Both Ways (everyone was fabulous) and maybe  just maybe  Borat, although I think the jury is still out on that one. I definitely was cringing in places during Borat. And I feel vaguely guilty at admitting how much I laughed. Especially in the first 30 minutes. It's Friday tomorrow. Work will be over for the week. TGIF. I wonder what's showing at my local theatre? Probably nothing as good as Little Miss Sunshine.",Null,2,5,23 November 2006
The Orphanage," Chilling
","I'm not usually a big fan of scary movies but Spanish movie The Orphanage (El Orfanato) is so well made, such a classy movie, that I found myself riveted to my seat even as I was chilled. I saw it first in the theatre then rented the DVD later to see it again, not something I often do. This is a very good example of how to make a deeply disturbing film with barely a drop of blood and no gore. It's produced by Guillermo del Toro, director of Pan's Labrinth, and similar themes of childhood imagination are revisited. Laura (Belen Rueda) spent her early years in The Orphanage, a large remote house near the beach in northern Spain, where she lived with a small group of other children and her caregivers. But she was adopted at quite a young age and left her friends behind, losing touch with them. As an adult, she moves back to the now unoccupied house with her physician husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son Simon (Roger Princep) with the intention of setting up a small care home for mentally disabled children. Simon is an only child and he lacks playmates so he invents imaginary friends, but soon after they move in to the house, strange things start to happen; an elderly lady masquerading as a social worker visits and is later found ransacking the storage shed, the house is filled with creepy noises, and Simon insists that he can see a group of children in the house, that his friends are not imaginary but real. Simon wants his mother to visit the 'little house' of his friend Tomas but she dismisses it as childhood fantasy. Then, at an open day for the new care home, Simon disappears completely. Months and months go by but there is no sign of what happened to Simon. The police have no clues but the old lady who visited the house is run over in the street, and an investigation reveals that she once worked at the orphanage. Who was she and what happened to Laura's friends after she left the orphanage as a child, and most importantly, what happened to Simon? How can a child disappear without trace? Lacking police leads, Laura is drawn to a psychic in a desperate attempt to find Simon. Her husband is equally desperate but warier of being conned. The Orphanage shows the fine line between the supernatural and mundane reality; sometimes a creaking house is just that, a creaking house, and ghosts are all in the mind. But overwhelmed with despair, Laura, certain that something terrible has happened in the past, decides to try and recreate that past, in a last desperate attempt to communicate with her childhood friends and find her child. The ending is satisfactory although sad. What makes The Orphanage work for this scary movie skeptic is the excellent standard of the performances and the atmospheric mood of the film. It is rarely 'jump out of your seat' type scary, more bone chillingly dark and moody, taking us back to a time when to be a disabled child often meant a lonely and unhappy life, rejected by society. Overall, very good.",Null,1,3,6 August 2008
Wanted," The Pied Piper of Warp and Weft
","Aka A Modest Yarn of Mixed Fabrication A warning; if you are a vegetarian, don't even think about going to see Wanted. Several scenes take place in a kind of meat store, and the large hanging chunks of meat are as vividly memorable as Angelina's tattoos.I'm almost ashamed to admit that I rather enjoyed this piece of Friday Night Fluff. No, fluff is the wrong word. It's extremely violent in a cartoonish way, and not remotely fluffy; lots of lingering shots of bullets penetrating skin and the red stuff flying hither and thither. To call it light weight is paying it a compliment. It's so light weight it makes Ms Jolie look like a body builder. Wanted is watchable because it never takes itself too seriously. I spent the first ten minutes wondering if I should get up, go home and have an early night, then I grasped that it was a comic book, and went along for the reasonably entertaining ride. I should point out up front, that this film is aimed unapologetically at the 18-30 male demographic, with its lingering shots of Angelina's butt and mouth, and routinely obnoxious female characters (Ms Jolie excepted.) So we all know what we are getting with this one, OK?James McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, a rather weedy young man who works in a cubicle as some kind of customer service rep. His girl friend is bonking his best friend on his IKEA dining table (am I getting old or does that look really uncomfortable?) and his boss resembles a beached walrus with a bad hangover. One day, on a trip to the grocery store, someone starts shooting at him and, to cut a long story short, he discovers he is the son of a fabled assassin who belonged to an ancient order of assassins  The Fraternity - who masquerade as weavers but spend their off time taking out the world's nastiest people. Think of them as boy scouts with very large weapons; they are always prepared. And in order to prepare our Wesley to take his place amongst the splatterati, The Fraternity prepare him very well indeed by beating him up daily and dunking him in rejuvenating baths. As spa treatments go, this one is awesome; looks a bit like hot wax. Mmmmmmmmmmm!Angeline Jolie as Fox is one of the top honchos, which has me wondering whether calling it a fraternity might not be a bit misleading? I guess calling it The Co-ed was a non starter? She plays this strictly tongue in cheek, and looks so underfed that I doubt she could raise one of the weapons to shoulder height, never mind wield it menacingly. Morgan Freeman plays the boss, Sloan. Every now and then the magic weaving machine spews forth the name of another victim, and that was about the place where I actually started giggling. How did Morgan Freeman manage to utter the words 'Loom of Fate' with a straight face? This must be the kind of stuff they prepare you for in acting school, and all I can say is, I take my hat off to him. After an encounter with Terence Stamp playing a monk (my but hasn't Stamp come a long way since Far from the Madding Crowd?), there is a fairly entertaining chase through a train, and a spectacular wreck in a deep gorge, and our hero Wesley finds out that his dad may not be who he thought and the goodies may be the baddies after all. The Loom of Fate has spewed his own name out, but he takes his revenge with a novel plague of explosive rats, who all become willing suicide rodents because they are high on peanut butter. Or some such equally ludicrous detail. Anyway, if James McAvoy was looking for something diametrically opposite to Atonement, I think he found it in Wanted. It's unlikely to get Oscar nominated, but I think I could actually sit through it one more time, just to hear Morgan Freeman say 'Loom of Fate again. Classic! (I was mildly interested in where they filmed this so I sat through the endless reel of credits to the very end. Just to put me out of my misery, can anyone tell me what a Libra Head Technician is? Do they have a head technician for every sign of the zodiac? Just curious)",Null,6,14,6 July 2008
Van Helsing," Not camp enough unfortunately
","I've seen some comments on this film suggesting that it has been misunderstood because, really, it's just a camp, cult film. The problem I have with it, is that if that was the intention, it fails because it's just not camp enough, and if that wasn't the intention, it fails because it's dire. Camp dire is fine. Just plain dire isn't. If I was Bram Stoker, I'd be suing from beyond the grave.Now I loved director Stephen Sommers 'Mummy' movies, especially the first one, which was lots of fun, I really like fine actors Hugh Jackman, Richard Roxburgh (wonderfully camp in Moulin Rouge) and David Wenham and I was fairly open minded about Kate Beckinsale as I'd hardly seen her in anything before, so I sat down to watch this movie (on pay per view at home) perfectly willing to be entertained. I rarely watch a movie about which I can find nothing good to say, but this was one of those rarities. From the incoherent script, to the confused plot, to the ear splitting sound track, to the overuse and abuse of CGI, to the tacky Brides of Frankenstein (or whatever those girlies were supposed to be. When it comes to scantily clad women, erotic is good, tacky isn't), to Kate Beckinsale's silly costume, to the revolting peasants, the entire thing was such a mess. I think it just proves again that the quality of a movie bears little relation to how much money you throw at it, and that there is really no substitute for a decent script.I'm not averse to special effects movies. Try and imagine films like, say, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, or Star Trek: First Contact or last year's War of the Worlds, without special effects. Doesn't really work, does it? And those are all movies I loved, because the effects are used to enhance the story, to tell it better. But what you have at the core of those films, is a good exciting story, well written, and with characters you care about.Who cares about any of these guys? Van Helsing fails mostly because it substitutes special effects for character and story, and then tries to take itself seriously. It's quite a cynical film, hoping to find an audience dumb enough to lap it up.I'm still trying to imagine what good actors like Jackman and Wenham were doing in this? Maybe it was one of those movies that's much more fun to make than to watch, I'm sure they had a blast in Prague, or where ever it was, and earned enough to pay the mortgage for a few months. I'm also well aware that as a middle aged woman I'm probably not the target audience for Van Helsing. So it really only remains to say that I sat down to watch it with my two teenage kids, one of each sex. They hated it too, and gave up watching long before I did. When a movie is so bad that my teenage son would rather do his homework than watch - that's bad!",Null,33,61,1 December 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A Pleasant Surprise
","I put off watching this movie for a long time because I assumed it was going to be crass. But it's not. It's well written and, dare I say, surprisingly sweet and touching. I couldn't for a moment imagine anyone other than Steve Carell pulling off the title role of Andy, the guy who has indeed managed to reach forty without getting laid, certainly a feat worthy of a movie in 21st century America. He brings a unique combination of integrity, humor and honesty to the role which actually makes him quite believable. Catherine Keener likewise is perfectly cast as the single parent Trish, who hasn't quite given up on the hope of finding a nice guy. She's attractive and sexy but actually looks like a fully grown woman not a teen supermodel, and we are spared the usual wishful thinking of Hollywood that 40 year old men and 18 year old women are a natural fit.Andy is a little nerdy but certainly not lacking self awareness. Sitting in his neat apartment, surrounded by his collection of still-boxed (virgin?) action figures, his video games chair and his toy soldiers, he knows something is missing in his life but doesn't quite know what to do about it. His life is not unpleasant, but he's just treading water, wondering what comes next. As played by Carell, he comes across as a nice guy, not a sad loser, and it would have been so easy to reduce this story to that of a sad loser. I'm glad the writers resisted that temptation. Andy's not a middle aged virgin because he is unattractive or dumb, or lacking a libido, but almost because he is too nice. Things just never quite worked out with girls when he was younger, and gradually as the years crept by, it got harder and harder to change the status quo. His colleagues at work, on discovering his pristine, still-boxed condition, are determined to get him laid and throw every cliché in the book at him, trying amongst other tricks, to teach him how to pick up drunks in bars. Some scenes are funnier than others.The colleagues and other supporting cast are mostly stereotype figures, the horny female boss, and the foul-mouthed 'lads' who love 'em and leave 'em (and who, surprisingly, come across as the real losers.) But when he actually meets Trish, a potential partner, and gets a date, Andy manages to rise above them all, forming a genuine relationship as he and Trish take time to get to know each other, before he has to reveal the truth to her. The ending is fairly weak, but the whole movie was a pleasant amusing interlude mid week after a stressful day at work, and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. I guess I have no excuse not to rent Knocked Up now, do I? I doubt it will be this cute.",Null,1,2,4 November 2007
Dark City," Not Great. But not Bad.
","I have Netflix to thank for seeing this movie; I'd never heard of it before it popped up on my 'Recommended' list after I rented another sci-fi DVD. Of course I'm watching it more than seven years late and I don't ever recall seeing it gracing local movie theatres here in California, but then most Australian movies seem to pass us by. I'm not sure why. Perhaps they could do with a new Australian Film Marketing Office? I'm a long time science fiction fan, dating back more years than I care to admit, to when I was a teenager and discovered Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein and the strange but talented Philip K Dick. I'll even admit to being a closet Trekkie, so I can safely say I've seen an awful lot of sci-fi over the years, of various degrees of quality. And I think this is a pretty fair movie.Not faultless by any means. But reasonably good. A man wakes up in the bath with blood on his head and nothing for company except a goldfish, and he can't remember how he got there. He's not suffering the after effects of a three day bender but he IS wanted for a series of brutal murders, and he has an attractive, devoted wife he can't recall. Outside it is always night-time, and apparently he's been missing quite a while. The city is run by shadowy aliens (all male by the look of them) and he holds the key to their defeat because he is immune to their control. The movie addresses the usual sci-fi questions of reality, memory and perception, and is based on the fairly unoriginal idea that life on earth (or in this case, a city), is really the large scale experiment of a superior life form, with human beings taking on the role of lab rats. But the script is mostly well written and intelligent, and approaches the 'alien experiment' idea in an original way. The overall design is suitably dark and brooding, reminiscent of a Holodeck reconstruction of 1940s America, with everything just a little too perfect and clean to be real. I suspect the production designer may have been a closet Trekkie too.Blade Runner meets The Truman Show came to mind. This is a plot and character driven science fiction film, where the effects enhance rather than overwhelm the story, so it gets my vote. I love sci-fi and fantasy but despise the way special effects are so often used as substitutes for decent writing and story development.My main gripe would be the sound track, closely followed by the costume design (yes really!). Why do the producers of sci-fi, (on film and TV), always seem to think we need a continuous and portentous sound track to guide us through the plot? I found the sound track intrusive. Subtle it is not. And my gripe with the costumes? Well how often have we seen aliens garbed in high collars as if they all have spinal damage and need neck braces? I live with the hope that higher intelligence will lead to more imaginative taste in clothing. The alien dialogue was a bit of a cliché  if these guys can manipulate reality and matter, they can probably learn to speak English properly too, and Keifer Sutherland's performance was a little irritating. His breathy and stilted delivery of his lines had me wondering if he was supposed to be asthmatic? I kept hoping someone would pass the poor guy an inhaler. I enjoyed Jennifer Connelly's performance immensely, and I thought William Hurt very good.But good sci-fi is such a rarity that I'm willing to ignore the faults. Thanks Netflix! Keep the recommendations coming!",Null,6,9,16 July 2006
Tropic Thunder," I Admit I was Surprised..
","at how funny this film is. I would never have gone to see it had my (grown up) children not suggested it when we thought about a family movie outing a couple of weeks back. I was aware of the controversy and felt a bit dubious about how offensive it might be, and, let's be honest here, I'm not a huge Ben Stiller fan. So my reaction was a resigned 'Must we.?' But I freely admit I was wrong. This is a satire, it's genuinely funny and as a satire, probably works better than Burn After Reading, which I saw last weekend. It's the best spoof I've seen in a while.A bunch of diva actors are cast in a Vietnam war epic based on the story of an heroic vet, Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte hamming it up wonderfully). There's Jack Black as Jeff, with his cocaine habit, Robert Downey Jr as 'serious' Australian actor Kirk Lazarus, so into The Method that he darkens his skin for the part and once spent 6 months working in a Beijing textile factory as preparation for a role. Brandon T Jackson is Alpa Chino, Hip Hop star, Steve Coogan is a posey British director, Tom Cruise is an obnoxious producer and of course Stiller himself stars as Tugg Speedman, star of a never ending series of dire action movies. All want in their various ways to be taken seriously, in what's hoped will be the Vietnam war movie to end all Vietnam war movies. As their demands become increasingly hard to deal with, the director sends them off into the real jungle, away from their Blackberries, Tivo and luxury hotel to film out in the backwoods, hoping to get some gutsy performances. The plot has them getting caught up with local drug warlords and dodging real bullets and mines. And it's funny.Contrast the death by landmine of Coogan's director (funny despite - or maybe because of - the flying head) with the death by shooting in Burn After Reading of Pitt's gym bunny at the hands of George Clooney. I'm not quite sure why, but the former works, the latter really doesn't. Downey and Stiller are fabulous in this, pitching the humour at exactly the right level, and whilst I appreciate the arguments of the disability groups who have objected to this movie, I think in this instance, they are wrong.The conversation in question, about Stiller's previous role as Simple Jack, discusses how disability is usually portrayed in film in Hollywood. Namely, that audiences seem happy to watch disabled people as long as they have some exceptional gifts in compensation because it makes everyone feel better, the 'Feel Good' factor. However, when a disability is portrayed accurately, then audiences aren't interested because it makes them too uncomfortable. And who wants to be confronted by anything remotely uncomfortable in a movie? Is this not actually a very relevant point being made? I know there will always be some members of the audience who don't get the subtlety of the satire, but surely they are in the minority? Or am I over estimating the audience here? I thought the spoof trailers at the beginning were just classic! I challenge anyone not to smile at 'Kirk' and Tobey McGuire as two gay monks. Almost worth going just for the first five minutes alone. Anyway, Tropic Thunder entertained this family for a couple of hours. Good value, a good piece of Friday Night Fluff.",Null,1,4,23 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," Black Humor amongst Texan Mayhem.
","One interesting facet of your kids growing up, is that it broadens the definition of what might be considered Family Entertainment. Gone are the days of anodyne kiddie films for my guys.So it was, that my entire family decamped to the Santa Cruz Del Mar Theatre the day after Thanksgiving (my favourite movie house in the whole world with its exquisite Art Deco interior) to see No Country for Old Men. Mum, dad, son, daughter and daughter's boyfriend, complete with mini van and popcorn. It may not be Disney, but my family were definitely entertained (but broke  do you know how much it costs to take 5 people to the movies? Whew!) Welcome to the brave new world of grown up family entertainment; murder, violence, sex and swearing. And the only one cowering under the seat during this movie, was my husband, gentle soul that he is.This is the Coen brothers' film of the Cormac McCarthy novel, and whilst I've read and enjoyed several of his novels, I haven't yet read No Country for Old Men, so I'm not going to comment on the relation of the movie to the book, but consider it solely as a movie. The plot is not complicated. It's 1980. A guy out deer hunting (Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin) stumbles by accident on the scene of a drug related massacre. Amongst the shot up cars, bodies, dead dogs and drugs, he finds a briefcase containing $2 million. He keeps it, packs his wife off to her mom's, and then tries to dodge the psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is sent to get the money back. Also on the trail is Sheriff Bell close to retirement, played by Tommy Lee Jones, who has patrolled this rough border country for decades but is having trouble coming to terms with the degree of violence that drug smuggling has brought into his world (hence the title) and, briefly, an over confident bounty hunter Woody Harrelson's Carson Wells.Describing Bardem's Chigurh as psychopathic is being nice to the guy. Early in the movie he strangles a sheriff's deputy with his hand cuffs, and it goes downhill from there. He has a novel method of killing  compressed air. He blows neat holes through his victim's head. The canister he totes also comes in useful for taking out door locks, and he appears to be immune to pain and utterly without remorse. This is not a nice guy. Bardem plays him wonderfully, and I found him convincingly chilling. Tommy Lee Jones is suitably grizzled as the sheriff, and brings a certain resigned irony to the part. Has the world always been quite this bad. he wonders? There is a degree of black humor to the movie which stops it taking itself too seriously, which I hadn't expected, and there is, thank god, very little 'Look  here comes the bad guy' type music. Brolin's wife is played by Kelly Macdonald, an actress seen far too little on the cinema screen here in the USA. She shone in Gosford Park, but I first noticed her in Trainspotting. She is excellent.The movie rolls along nicely for the first two thirds, but then rather loses impetus after the hero, Moss, is abruptly killed. I felt it really lost focus at that point, because up until then, the audience was rooting for Moss to succeed in evading the killer Chigurh. After that, it was merely a question of when Chigurh would get the wife, and whether Tommy Lee Jones would give up and choose early retirement. I guess the moral is 'don't pick up strange women at hotel pools', but killing off the hero too soon was a big mistake, even if it was true to the book. And everyone in my family party felt the same. The last third of the movie let it down.I think we may celebrate the Christmas season together with the murderous barber of Fleetstreet. Violence, song and Johnny Depp. Perfect family fun!",Null,0,2,23 December 2007
Mamma Mia!," Put your brain in neutral and just go along for the ride!
","I am an unashamed lover of musicals. Always have been and probably always will be, so I was more than willing to enjoy this piece of classic Friday Night Fluff, mediocre reviews notwithstanding. It's unpretentious and frivolous, modestly entertaining and whilst not brilliant, it's not as bad as many people have suggested.Musicals come in all shapes and forms, from the dramatic and dark (Sweeney Todd) to the Sixties Rock variety (Hair) to the utterly brilliant (West Side Story) and all points in between. The best musicals don't date, which is why Oklahoma sounds better than Hair these days. Mamma Mia doesn't readily fit into any usual musical category because the story was written long after the songs first saw the light of day, and it was written to fit (and it's not always a perfect fit) around existing songs. I'm old enough to have been an Abba fan when they were at their height, although at the time I doubt I would have admitted it publicly. Very uncool.. I haven't seen the stage show.Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is very young, pretty and lives with her Mum Donna (Meryl Streep) on a beautiful Greek island. She is about to marry Sky (Dominic Cooper) and arguably anyone who can think seriously about marrying a guy called Sky is obviously far too young to get married. But she wants the works, white wedding, romantic church, all her friends and, most of all, she wants to be given away by her father. But that's the problem, she doesn't know who her father is, although perusal of her mother's pilfered diary, has narrowed the field down to 3 potential studs, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgård). She invites them all to the island, thinking foolishly that as soon as she sets eyes on him, she will instinctively recognize her father, but she doesn't, and the movie follows the trials and tribulations of the following day or two, against the beautiful backdrop of a Greek island. Donna is less than happy to see the 3 old boyfriends, but very happy to be reunited with Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski), her old pals from the days when she sang in a girl group. As this is a musical, people launch into song and dance in ridiculous ways and places, and we, the audience, get to revisit most of Abba's old hits.Many, many others have already commented on Pierce Brosnan's absence of vocal talent so I won't labour the point, except to say that it really doesn't detract much from the fun, and I think he's quite well cast overall  Brosnan can carry off almost anything these days. Meryl Streep is simply superb. Is there anything this woman can't do? At the age when most female actors are complaining that there are no good roles for women, Streep appears to be having the most fun of her career. She paid her dues with the harrowing roles in her youth (Sophie's Choice, Kramer v Kramer etc), now she has reinvented herself in comedy drama (The Devil Wears Prada) and a musical. I adore her! Whatever you may think overall of Mamma Mia, I challenge anyone not to be gobsmacked by Streep's performance of The Winner Takes It All just before the wedding scene. It's a showstopper. I was also quite surprised to be genuinely moved by Slipping Through My Fingers, as sung pre-wedding by mother and daughter Streep and Seyfried (possibly it resonated because I have a daughter of exactly that age.) And as a middle aged woman, how can I fail to love the sight of Christine Baranski dancing with twenty or so twenty something males on the beach, while belting out Does Your Mother Know? at the top of her lungs! No it won't win any Oscars, but I make no apologies for having loved it! One thing that struck both my husband and me (yes he came too and hummed along through most of it) was that the younger members of the cast were simply acted off the screen by the old codgers. Seyfried was perhaps a little weak as Sophie, sweet but rather vapid, although she does bear a striking resemblance to Streep, so made a convincing daughter. Cooper was basically a prop for her cuteness. The rest of the younger cast members I have forgotten entirely, although they danced energetically enough. The middle-agers stole the show, which makes a pleasant change.Not a great movie, but more than adequate. My only real question is what happened to Knowing Me Knowing You, my favorite Abba song? No - on reflection it's probably best that I recall it as my favorite Abba song, rather than listen to Pierce Brosnan strangle it!",Null,1,3,4 August 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Lovingly Made But Frankly Rather Tedious – for a Theatre Movie
","Rent The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford when you have a whole evening to spare and an entire bottle of wine to drink. I'm not saying it's a bad movie – it's not, it's pretty good – but it doesn't have a great deal of action and it's overly long, for a theatre movie. I understand it has been lovingly gleaned from the pages of a biography of James by Robert Hansen, but somewhere along the line the director and producers lost sight of what makes the difference between a good read and a good view. Or perhaps it's just that this would have worked better as a 3 episode TV mini series than as an almost three hour movie? It's the medium which is at fault here, not the message.First, let's consider the positives; the cinematography is superb, there's no doubt about that. The whole enterprise is wonderfully filmed. The sets look authentic, the cold winter scenes look genuinely chilly, the houses are Spartan, the outdoor shots absolutely stunning. Ten out of ten for cinematography. Then there are the period details; the costumes and the accents look and sound spot on. In fact the latter are so good that occasionally I was straining to catch the dialog and had to hit the 'back' button on the DVD player to listen again to a line of speech. The performances are all very good, and the script is fine – or perhaps it's more accurate to say that it would be fine if this were a 3 episode mini series. Given that it was released to be seen in theatres, the script could have done with some pruning and tightening. This is very close to being that personal bete noir of mine - the 'Depends' movie (and you'll have to read some of my other reviews to find out what a 'Depends' movie is.) And that brings us to the negatives; the movie is too long and too slow for all but the most dedicated fans. It's also almost exclusively a Boys Club, with the women playing very small bit parts on the periphery. That may well be an accurate representation of how women lived back then, on the periphery of the men's world, but to keep the interest of a mixed age, modern audience in a 21st century movie theatre, some effort could have been made to make the women slightly more visible, even on a domestic level. I tend to get tired pretty quickly of watching taciturn men doing manly things, even when well acted and basically factual.The actual story, of the killing of James (Brad Pitt) by Ford (Casey Affleck), is interesting and well presented, we get the full psychological picture of the younger man, an over confident under achiever if ever there was one, smitten with his hero then, after the ultimate betrayal and shooting, sliding into a life of parody and gutlessness before being shot himself - in an act of poetic justice perhaps? The James Brothers were described as Confederate guerrillas during the Civil War. After the war they took to plain old fashioned robbery; Robin Hood they were not. The movie follows the last few months of James' life from meeting Ford until the killing. We see James living life on the edge, a family man trying to blend into polite society when not out bank robbing and holding up trains, but being chased by the Pinkerton Agency, and becoming increasingly ruthless, paranoid and depressed, killing in cold blood, but constantly watching his back – literally – waiting to see which of his gang would turn him in, and picking them off one by one as the Feds move in.It's a good story and it's well made. It's just not a theatre experience – it's a TV mini series. But of course if it had been made as a TV mini series, we wouldn't have seen Brad Pitt in the starring role, would we?",Null,2,4,1 July 2009
Revolutionary Road," Riveting.
","This is a very good movie.I think what a number of the negative commentators on IMDb have failed to realize is that this is not a 21st century look back at the 1950s. This book (yes I've read it. It's very good) was actually written  by a man  in 1961. This was very much a contemporary look at the state of 1950s marriage and social mores. Not some feminist diatribe written by a modern author 'looking back in anger' at a bygone age they never knew. And it's damning.Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio give utterly committed performances as April and Frank Wheeler. Winslet in particular is excellent (the movie is directed by her husband, Sam Mendes, of American Beauty fame.) I thought to start with that Di Caprio was a bit light weight for the part, but then Frank is a fairly lightweight character, so in retrospect, I think he was perfect for the part. The story hinges around the idea that the beautiful, bright young Wheelers think they are too good for the 'burbs, and that they are creative, arty types who should be living a far more Bohemian lifestyle. April puts up a good pretence on the home front in Connecticut while Frank plays at being an office drone in New York, but where is the lost promise of their youth and passion? Shouldn't they be doing something more profound with their lives? April hatches a scheme by which they can move to Paris and she will support them while Frank discovers himself. On the surface this seems like a very superficial idea for a major film, but it really all hinges around that central idea, are we all truly 'special', individuals, doomed - trapped - to live the life of battery hens, or should we just accept that most of us are pretty average and get on with it. The Wheelers of course, inhabit the worst of all possible worlds, they ARE average but think they're not. April failed as an actress, even in community theatre, Frank may have a book in him. But I doubt it. They spend a summer making tentative plans to escape their life, but it all derails completely when April becomes pregnant with her third child after an act of unprotected passion on the kitchen counter (well Frank enjoyed it anyway) with tragic consequences.And at this point I have to say that I think Winslet should be up for some kind of award for sex in uncomfortable places. In Little Children we saw her stark naked on the washing machine; this time it's the (front) seat of a car and on the cold Formica. I take my hat off to her (but only my hat...) This is a stark look at unhappy relationships in a time which was more socially constrained. I was born in the 1950s about the time this movie is set (a third child, and admittedly in the UK not the USA, but believe me, bad marriages are universal), and I recall from early childhood the very apparent strains within my parents' marriage; the 1950s were a time of recovery from the war, when everyone was supposed to pretend to be happy even when they weren't and one was expected to put up a good 'front.' Very, very different from today. I'd go so far as to say that I was aware from quite an early age that my parents really couldn't stand the sight of each other anymore. But divorce was totally out of the question, it was social death, and my own birth is testament to how unreliable contraception was back then. Home-made and highly illegal abortions were really not that unusual. The period details are all perfect, the incessant smoking - again well remembered from my own childhood where in retrospect I see everything wreathed in a cloud of my mother's cigarette smoke - the hats, the shirt-waister frocks. The only thing I don't recall from Britain is the Martinis. Sweet sherry was more the thing.Kathy Bates as the realtor is great but Michael Shannon as her son, let out of the psychiatric unit for a four hour furlough, is just extraordinary. I see today he's been Oscar nominated and it's well deserved. After many hours of electro shock he lacks the necessary social conventions to put up a good 'front' and he is damning in his analysis of the Wheelers' relationship. It's good stuff, not exactly entertainment, but riveting nonetheless. The musical score is excellent.One of the year's best, a movie all about the acting. OK, I'm off to work on my book now. I know I've got one in me.",Null,9,13,22 January 2009
The Lives of Others," Truly Excellent Film
","This movie is quite simply one of the best, and one of the most moving, that I've seen in a year. When it won the Oscar for best foreign language film a couple of months back, I hadn't even heard of it, but some excellent reviews induced me to forsake the California spring sunshine for the cool darkness of the Santa Cruz Nickleodean on a Saturday afternoon, and it was well worth the sacrifice. It's astonishingly good. I can't recall the last time a film genuinely moved me close to tears. (Usually when I cry at a movie, it's out of boredom or sheer frustration at the utter banality and lack of imagination.) It is totally engrossing, but never so complex that the story is hard to follow (an occasional fault with spy stories.) Set in East Berlin in 1984, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, The Lives of Others examines the menacing control the state police, the Stasi, had over the lives of everyone in East Germany, especially artists, who might have been considered subversives.Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and Christa (Martina Gedeck) are an attractive couple. He is one of the few East German playwrights who is produced in the East but retains enough credibility to be read in the West. He treads a fine line with work which keeps him out of trouble with the Stasi, while still socializing with writers who are banned. She is an actress who is lusted after by the culture minister, an unpleasant individual who abuses his power by trying to have dirt dragged up on Dreyman, so he can move in on Christa. Stasi captain Wiesler (marvelous Ulrich Muhe) is set to spy on Dreyman and Christa, bugging their apartment, and reporting on their lives, trying to find something incriminating. All day he sits in the loft over their building, listening, but as their lives unfold he gets absorbed in their humanity and starts to doubt the system of which he is such a vital part. His own life is lonely; committed to the state which has nurtured him, he lacks warm, affectionate human contact but is at least still capable of recognizing it in others, and perhaps envying it. And when Dreyman's close friend, a fellow playwright, commits suicide out of despair at the hopelessness of life in the East, Dreyman can no longer maintain his distance, and he becomes involved in the political opposition, with tragic consequences for him and Christa, but surprising consequences for Wiesler.One of the things that is intriguing about a movie like this, at least to me, is all the little details of the spy's techniques, the sheer efficiency with which the apartment is completely bugged in a few minutes, for example. Or the classroom full of eager students learning interrogation methods. Very well illustrated too, is the air of menace which kept a population subdued with very little obvious physical violence. I've always been a sucker for spy stories, anything by John Le Carre, Graham Greene or the recent movie Breach, etc. The Lives of Others is right up there with the best stories. Congratulations to all concerned on the Oscar. Very well deserved.",Null,4,5,23 April 2007
I Am Legend," Pretty Good but not Great.
","I'm not usually a fan of the megaplex blockbuster type movie but I have to admit I thought this was pretty good - leaving aside the dubious religious message at the end which nearly spoils it.The movie is totally dependent on an excellent performance by Will Smith, who I think is now truly one of the world's great superstars, appealing across the boundaries of age, gender and nationality. (I watched I, Robot on TV the night before going to see I am Legend, and he was pretty good in that too, but it's easy to see how much he has gained in experience since.) He is one of those rare actors who can star in an effects driven movie, and still make a real human being, that you actually care about, the pivot point.Smith plays the last 'normal' person left alive in New York after a virus, engineered to cure cancer, runs amok as a rabies variant, and destroys humanity. By day he drives around the city with his trusty dog Sam, stalking deer, and talking to store mannequins. By night he and Sam cuddle up together in their dark, shuttered apartment, gun at the ready, while Dark Seekers take over the streets looking for food. The Dark Seekers are victims of the virus who have not yet died, but who have been driven mad. He is a scientist still seeking the cure. But is he really the last unaffected person alive? It's all hokum of course, but I admit I enjoyed it. A Saturday Night movie which had me occasionally on the edge of my seat but never struggling to follow the plot. I've been a Sci Fi fan since I was 14 and first discovered Asimov but I've often felt that when Sci Fi is transferred to the big screen, the effects are allowed to overshadow the human interest. Without characters you care about, a Sci Fi movie can just become an exercise in gadgetry and computer graphics, with about as much interest for me as a video game. This movie avoids that. The special effects are good and often scary, but they never overwhelm the central character or the writing.The last few minutes nearly let it down however. The sudden appearance of God in the equation really jars, and the heavy handed symbolism of the church appearing in the closing shots made me sigh. Man created this mess. Why not let man sort it out? (PS. The Dog is great!)",Null,0,2,31 December 2007
Gran Torino," A Vintage Vehicle but Hardly a Classic
","Gran Torino is a rather one dimensional vehicle for Clint Eastwood, who has been one of my favorite actors since Rawhide. I freely admit I was disappointed by it and I don't share the general adulation of other reviewers, amateur and professional.My viewing experience was also rather strange. At 53 I'm well used to being a very unimportant part of the demographic - I 'get' that I'm not supposed to be a movie fan. That important role is left to the 18 to 30 age group. (We'll ignore that I have 2 kids in that age category who go to the movies one tenth as often as I do) So finding myself in a movie theatre full of people far older than me was a slightly unnerving experience. And I haven't shared a movie viewing with such a vocal audience since Brokeback Mountain, and, just like BBM, the audience laughed heartily. I'm still digesting quite why. Gran Torino is mildly amusing in places but really, it's not that funny. It's tragic. The genuinely hearty laughter from the 'mature' audience at all the racist jokes left me mildly bemused.Eastwood plays embittered Korean War vet, and ex Ford car plant worker Walt, who has been recently widowed. He's being patronized by a wet-behind-the-ears young priest who promised his late wife that he'd keep an eye on Walt for her. He's hung on in the old neighborhood even as it's got rougher and tougher as various migrant groups have moved in, his family are pretty much waiting for him to die so they can inherit whatever goodies there are, and, the final insult for our politically incorrect hero, a family of Asians (Hmoung) live next door. And they are not heavily into lawn care. Walt pretty much thinks an Asian is an Asian and they're all equally undesirable as neighbours, after all he fought them in a war. He's an old school racist.When the son Thao (Bee Vang) attempts  very ineptly  to steal Walt's muscle car, a '72 Ford Gran Torino, as part of a gang initiation he doesn't want to do, Walt gives him a series of chores as retribution, and a tentative father-son relationship ensues. Thao's brighter and westernised sister Sue (Ahney Her) becomes the conduit via which Walt and the neighbours start to interact. The point is somewhat labored that Walt lives alone, alternately ignored or patronized by his family who clearly find him tedious, while the Hmoung all seem to live in one big happy extended family with granny cheerfully spitting on the front porch. Walt digs out his old war weapon and chases off the gang when they harass Thao, thus becoming an unlikely neighbourhood hero. Grateful, they smother him with food and hospitality whether he wants it or not, but trouble is brewing that will eventually lead to tragedy. Alongside the story of Walt, the gang and his neighbours is the coming of age tale of the eager young priest (Christopher Carley), and Walt's failing health.So far so good. The movie isn't too badly written and its heart is in the right place. It seems a little out of date now  with the economy in freefall and construction jobs being shed faster than a Labrador's hair, I doubt Walt could really get a totally inexperienced kid a job on a building site no matter how well he knew the Irish foreman  and I found Walt's attempt to teach Thao 'manly' interaction at the barber's shop fairly excruciating  wherever these guys live it's apparently still 1957. Walt hates everyone including his own sons and grandchildren but the thought that they might have gained their family values from him never seems to occur to him.The cinematography is good with the house interiors, the neighbourhood, the yards and the church all looking genuinely authentic. But the movie sags in the middle and feels very contrived, all the characters are one dimensional and the acting is best described as adequate. If this were not Eastwood, and he were not 78, I doubt this would be scoring 8.5 out of 10 (as it is at the time of writing) on IMDb. In fact, I doubt it would have gotten made. It lacks any real bite, and is fairly predictable. It's not actively bad, but it's simply not as good as it could be or as many IMDb reviewers seem to think it is, and Eastwood is in danger of becoming a parody of himself. There is a level on which I think it appeals to the audience's basest instincts, and I'm still disquieted by all that hearty laughter from my cinema companions. But maybe it's me.",Null,29,48,17 January 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Another Curious Case of Over Hype?
","This is not a bad movie, but, like There Will Be Blood last year, it's not as good as it's been hyped up to be.Granted there are good performances from the leads, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, excellent support from the likes of Tilda Swinton and Taraji P. Henson (fabulous in last year's Talk to Me. I have no idea why she wasn't nominated for something) and the make up and special effects that are used to age Brad Pitt are brilliant, and yet, and yet...... I can't get that enthused about it, try as I might. The movie takes far too long to draw the viewer in. The first half an hour is really inexcusably slow. And, like so many films of the last two years, it is simply too long.The basic premise, as surely everyone knows by now, is that Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born an old man and ages backwards. Now if that was the backdrop for some profound adventure, it might be more interesting, but the whole basis of the film is simply that, a man living backwards. He goes through much the same life circumstances that everyone else does (or did at that time), watching friends die, getting a job, war, fatherhood etc. He just does it in the wrong order.I'm sure we all know the aphorism that youth is wasted on the young? That's certainly one of the ideas at work here, that as Button 'youngs' as opposed to 'ages', he can use the wisdom of age to enjoy his youth, while at the same time tragedy waits in the wings, because, after all, how can he burden the woman he loves with having to watch him grow younger while she grows older? How can he expect her to care for him? Certainly one of the underlying messages, is that you take the hand life dealt you, and make what you can of it. OK. So far so good.There are certainly some very nicely constructed scenes in this movie; Cate Blanchett's Daisy becoming a dancer then suffering a terrible accident which changes her life; or Button serving as a merchant seaman on a tugboat during WW2. (The zinging bullets when they are attacked by a submarine will have you diving under your seat, it's that well done.) But the scenes in the hospital in New Orleans as Daisy lies dying with Hurricane Katrina approaching, are marred by a rather ordinary performance from Julie Ormond as Button's daughter Caroline, and by Blanchett being forced to mutter through so much aging make up that I struggled to hear quite a lot of her dialogue. More could have been made perhaps, of the profoundly disquieting effect that discovering her weird ancestry might have had on Caroline. It's very underplayed.Benjamin Button is one of those slightly off kilter movies where you wait for the drama to build and the crescendo to approach, and it never quite does. It's a fantasy about a man aging backwards, and that's about it. Beautifully made, nicely constructed and very well acted, but nowhere near as profound as it would like to be.We went to see this on Christmas day when it opened, a rare outing for our whole family (both genders and an age range of 18 to 60.) We all enjoyed it, yet I think I wasn't the only one who felt that it wasn't quite what it could, and should, have been. Personally I don't feel it is Oscar material, except for achievement in make up where it's streets ahead of anything else I've seen this year (it's hard to tell where the computer effects end and the make up begins, which is exactly as it should be: seamless.) But as best picture? No. Wallee was a far superior movie.",Null,3,6,3 January 2009
The Dark Knight," Dark, Dramatic and Excellently Cast
","The first thing I want to say about Dark Knight is that this is most definitely NOT one for the kids. It really appalls me when I see small kids at movies like this (which I did), and I can't even begin to imagine what their parents are thinking. I remember enough about my own childhood to know that the image of Harvey Dent's face burning and his subsequent disfigurement would have stayed with me a very long time. And children will not 'get' the moral ambiguity of the plot. Much has been written about the unrelenting violence of the movie. But violence on screen is not necessarily a bad thing, it just needs to be watched by the appropriate audience, and with this Batman movie, personally I don't think that includes children under 12 or 13.Leaving aside doubts about the certification, this is a very good film, although it is unremittingly dark and totally lacking in any kind of light relief. It's gripping, well edited and has a complex but comprehensible story arc and well written dialogue. And, most important for me, the special effects are excellent but they don't overshadow the characters and the human interest. From Batman flying among the high rises of Hong Kong to the truck tipping end over end on a Gotham City street and the hospital blowing up, the effects are terrific but what grips us still is the interplay of the people and the dilemmas they face, not the size of the explosions. I usually object to movies running at much over 2 hours, but I barely noticed how long this was; it had me completely engrossed from start to finish. The story, described extensively elsewhere, sees Batman joining forces with the police (Lt Gordon) and Gotham's clean cut, new DA Harvey Dent to round up the criminals in Gotham, an act which forces the criminals into the arms of a totally amoral psychopath -, The Joker - in an attempt to beat Batman and kill him. The Joker sets the city a moral challenge, which he hopes will turn them on each other. Will they prove their worth or will they cower in the face of anarchy? Meanwhile Rachel, the love of Batman's life, and one of the few who knows his true identity, has fallen for Dent and is put in mortal danger.Christian Bale is a compelling Batman, making the transition from billionaire playboy to caped crusader seamless and utterly believable. Previous actors in the role have been believable as the playboy or the Batman; I'm hard put to think of one who has displayed both personas so well. His Batman is totally self contained, although I found the raspy manner of speaking a little wearing after a while. Forests have already been felled to describe Heath Ledger's Joker, so all I will add is that it's all true, he's terrifying. Maggie Gyllenhaal brings real weight to the role of Rachel Dawes; good to see someone cast in the role of superhero's love interest who is so much more than just a pretty face. Michael Caine (Alfred) is fabulous, Morgan Freeman (Lucius) is reliable, Gary Oldman (Lt. Gordon) just melts into his character- all are excellent. But for me the real revelation was Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two Face. I last saw Eckhart in No Reservations - a movie which is best described as little as possible - and had thought him very nice to look at but light weight as he coasted through it on cruise control; this role stretched him so much further, and I really enjoyed his performance. I thought he was an inspired piece if casting. Altogether a terrific movie, and one I might just have to go and see again, there's so much to it.",Null,4,11,22 July 2008
Pride & Prejudice," Exquisitely filmed.
","Pride and Prejudice has always been one of my favourite books, so any screen incarnation has to live up to certain personal expectations of character, style etc. And of course, there is the gold standard of the 1995 BBC series, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, had the luxury of several episodes to cover a story that here takes just two hours. So I was truly delighted to enjoy this movie so much. It had a lot to live up to.The first thing I must say is that it is exquisitely photographed. The atmosphere set by the beautiful cinematography, is perfect. The film deserves to be nominated for an Oscar on that basis alone. I am in awe of the technical crew and director who could find such unspoiled vistas and such perfect weather in England, and I say that as a Brit who used to live very close to some of the eastern England locations! I sat right through to the end of the credits to see where it was shot, because I assumed it must have been filmed in some remote, rural, continental European locale. I felt quite ashamed that I had doubted the ability of my native land to still provide such delightful scenery! The mist rising off early morning fields, geese on a perfect farm pond, magnificent country estates and enormous trees more usually associated with California than England. Also perfect were the interiors. The air of genteel poverty in which the Bennets lived was well captured. The slightly down at heel scruffiness of the Bennet's farm and house, and the general dirtiness of 18th century life for most people, contrasted well with the ridiculous, rich fussiness of Lady Catherine de Bourg's house and the stark, museum-like beauty of Darcy's home.The cast were excellent. I thought Rosamunde Pike as Jane Bennet was perfect, Simon Woods as Mr Bingley was charming although perhaps a little too puppyish, I enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn as Mr and Mrs Bennet and I'm one who thinks Matthew MacFadyen did a very good job as Mr Darcy, a characterization which was slightly more user-friendly than Colin Firth's 1995 Darcy. Also outstanding were Claudie Blakley as plain Charlotte Lucas, rescued from a life of unmarried oblivion by pompous Mr Collins (a very good Tom Hollander) and Kelly Reilly, as the bitchy Miss Bingley. Is Rupert Friend (Mr Wickham) destined to play Orlando Bloom's brother? Am I alone in seeing a similarity? Of course, Keira Knightley plays the title role of Elizabeth. I have followed her career closely since Bend it Like Beckham, and I thought this easily her best acting performance so far. She captured the playfulness and wit of Lizzie's bright mind wonderfully well, and made me think long and hard how truly frustrating it must have been to be an intelligent young woman in a world that expected nothing more of her than an ability to choose ribbon and to capture a husband possessed of money. The only possible slight criticism I might make, is that Keira Knightley is perhaps a little too waif-like to pull off the 18th century characterization entirely convincingly. She is stunningly beautiful, but her stick thin appearance alongside her more robust looking screen sisters, made her look as if Mr Bennet might well have doubted her parentage!",Null,12,15,27 November 2005
Avatar," Dances with Wolves Meets My Little Pony - But I Loved It!
","If you are going to see Avatar, see it in 3D. I can't imagine it having anything like the impact in boring old 2D as it does in 3D. Possibly 2010 will be the year that 3D finally comes of age? I really loved this movie – it blew me away. The movie just leaps off the screen visually and grabs you by the jugular.The story is quite obviously director James Cameron's unapologetic take on the white man's conquest of North America and the assault on the Indians (well it could be any act of colonialism really, the British in Australia, the Spanish in Central America.. basically the locals are in the way of the invaders' desire to grab the resources), except in this case, the Indians win. You can call the story simplistic, you can accuse it of plagiarism, but it is what it is and Cameron need make no apologies for it. It's a vehicle for the stunning CGI, nothing more nothing less, it's not subtle but neither is it pretentious or 'posy'. What you see is what you get. And what you get is spectacular. The performances are all excellent; I loved Sam Worthington in the role of hero Jake Sully. I last saw Worthington in the Australian movie Getting Square, alongside one of my favourite actors David Wenham and I think he has a huge future ahead of him as an international star. Worthington's Sully is a paraplegic ex marine on the planet (OK it's a moon really) Pandora, taking the place of his dead twin brother to become an avatar, mind melded to the genetically modified body of an aboriginal inhabitant of the planet. Pandora is under major assault from the military industrial complex, who are after a local mineral, Unobtainium. The biggest deposit of Unobtainium is right under the local's main spiritual site, and the invaders want to move them. As Dr Grace Augustine, Sigourney Weaver is in her element. Grace is the leader of the avatar program, and determined to protect the locals from the rapacious advance of the miners under the command of Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) a slightly rabid, gung ho Colonel who has little time for the bleeding heart, liberal approach to planetary conquest. Going undercover on Pandora amongst the locals – the Na'vi – Sully in his avatar embodiment inevitably falls in love and turns from the Dark Side to the side of the angels, becoming a hero who helps them fight off the invaders. His love interest is Neytiri (Zoe Saldana – previously fabulous as Uhura in Star Trek). Neytiri is a bow wielding strong Cameron woman in the tradition he has established of Girlies who can take care of themselves - and I love him for that alone. That is the bare bones of the story. It is how it is told that makes Avatar worth seeing – possibly more than once. Cameron throws in elements from just about every big movie franchise of the last two decades. There are 'nods' to Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dances with Wolves, The Magnificent Seven and even, dare I say, My Little Pony. But it is all quite upfront and obvious, nothing subtle here, so I don't have a real problem with it. Pandora is a low gravity planet and the science makes reasonable sense. My spouse – who counts himself as something of an aviation expert – tells me the helicopter rotors were believable for low G, and certainly low gravity plus a very thin atmosphere might lead to tall, lean people of the type seem in Avatar, I'm not sure the blue skin color is believable, but who knows? Certainly if evolution had followed a similar course to the earth, the absence of a cataclysmic meteor impact might leave a population of large reptiles, even flying reptiles, and a fairly insignificant mammal population. This is all stunningly presented to the viewer in glorious technicolor and 3D which literally leaps out of the screen and grabs you by the eyeballs, aerial jelly fish float above the seat in front of you, primordial creatures leap off the screen at you. I haven't seen anything this impressive since I last went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and I found myself wondering how long Cameron has spent standing in front of the Sea Nettle exhibit? Avatar is an astonishing achievement, and I am quite prepared to forgive Cameron the simplistic characters and linear story, because he has had the guts to produce something this visually stunning. I'm really looking forward to the next 3D offering that the movie world has to offer.",Null,0,4,16 January 2010
Up," Pixar take animation to new heights
","Up is fabulous, and I love Pixar. Were it not necessary to submit at least 10 lines to IMDb, I'd leave it at that and leave you groaning at the terrible pun above! As with WALL-E last year, it's taken an animation studio to give us an object lesson in story-telling and empathy. When did you last see a mass audience film featuring an old person and a boy scout? And enjoy it? Up tells the tale of seventy eight year old Carl who always wanted to travel to South America with his wife Ellie to find their hero the missing explorer Charles Muntz, but life kept getting in the way and Carl and Ellie never made it before Ellie died. With his beloved wife gone, and their home threatened by redevelopment, Carl ties thousands of balloons to the roof, and takes off for South America anyway, taking along an unlikely accidental stowaway, the intrepid scout Russell. Up is the story of their adventures. The story features a pack of dogs that have been given voice by the wicked Muntz, by way of collars containing technological wizardry. But the dogs are still dogs, not too cutesy, and are interested in doggy things like squirrels. In fact, one of the best gags in the movie is the sound which emanates from the voice box of the most macho hound, the Alpha dog who sounds like a diver on helium. What Pixar are so good at, is eliciting the audience's sympathy for the characters without drenching the movie in the over wrought sentimentality so often used by Disney. We are allowed to listen and observe, and reach our own level of sympathy and empathy, rather than being hit over the head by unbearable cuteness – the dogs being a case in point. For me, Up is not quite in the same class as WALL-E which I adored, hence my score of nine out of ten rather than ten out of ten, but for script, direction and technical brilliance, it's the best movie I've seen so far in 2009.",Null,1,2,1 July 2009
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Guilt Inducing History Lesson
","The British did some appalling things in Ireland. Well, let's be honest, the British did appalling things on every continent of the globe, but they seemed to reserve a particular wrath for the Irish, whom they treated with a nasty brutality normally reserved for the inhabitants of far hotter, more distant lands.This is a truly depressing movie, but beautifully filmed. I made a mistake watching it on a Friday night. I should have reserved it for a wet Monday. As someone born and raised in Britain, but with an Irish father, I came out of the cinema not sure if I should feel guilty at being a Brit or proud to be Irish. It's a conflicted feeling, appropriate for a movie about two conflicted protagonists.Damian (Cillian Murphy) is a clever lad, a newly qualified doctor who wants nothing more than to be a healer. As the movie opens he is about to travel to London to take up a post at a major teaching hospital, a great opportunity for him personally. His brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) is a budding leader of the Irish Republican movement, trying to get rid of the British in general and the dreaded Black and Tans army unit in particular. It's 1920 and Ireland is poor and under the heel of Britain. Before he can leave, Damian witnesses two acts of utter brutality on the part of the occupying British army, and decides to throw in his lot with his brother and the band of insurgents  or freedom fighters, depending on which side of the Irish Sea you were living at the time.But nothing is ever simple. Rarely is a war about simple freedom resolved simply, with everyone living happily ever after. The self governing Irish Republic has been voted in by the Irish people, but is not recognized by the ruling Brits and has been forced underground. The insurgent army, a determined and disciplined collection of local men from the countryside, is supported by the poor, rural population, and hands out swift and fierce punishment to anyone seen as a traitor to the Irish cause. Their guerrilla campaign wins a partial victory for the Irish, a treaty with the British which allows a degree of self government but still acknowledges the rule of the British crown. Teddy, a pragmatist, supports this limited victory, but Damian, an idealist, wants to keep fighting all out, for total victory and complete freedom for Ireland. The brothers find themselves on opposing sides, and the scene is set for tragedy. And the British can sit back cynically, and watch as the Irish fight each other instead.Cillian Murphy is terrific in this movie. He was good in Breakfast on Pluto, although I found that movie vaguely disappointing, and he was chillingly good in Red Eye as a very nasty baddie. I'd go so far as to say he made Red Eye the surprisingly excellent thriller it was. I had been trying to think who he reminded me of, when a local film critic dropped the name Terence Stamp into his review of The Wind, and I found myself nodding in agreement. They both possess faces of angular beauty, all chiseled planes and haunting blue eyes. Here Murphy acts with an engaging air of honest vulnerability and is utterly compelling. The supporting cast is terrific, and the location shooting in County Cork shows the Ireland I remember from childhood holidays in the 50s and 60s, beautiful, windswept and poor. Thank goodness things have improved now, and Ireland has prospered in the European Union. Director Ken Loach and writer Paul Laverty are to be congratulated on an excellent movie.",Null,1,7,22 April 2007
Inside Man," Simply Terrific
","At last. A movie to which I can give a 10. I haven't felt this enthusiastic about a film in many, many months, and I can't recall at all the last time I sat right through the credits so I could write down the name of the record company who are marketing the soundtrack. I was gripped from the entrancing opening shots of the city, to the intriguing and satisfying conclusion. I'm rather ashamed to admit that this is the first Spike Lee film I've ever seen, but if his others are anywhere near this good, then I shall make a point of looking them up. This movie has an interesting plot, very good acting and a fine script. Such standards should of course be common, but they're not. This is quite a rarity unfortunately. It's intelligent and very entertaining.The story is a variation on the well worn theme of the bank heist, but it becomes evident very quickly that this is not any ordinary bank heist, and we are not in for two hours of yawn-inducing cliché and special effects. A gang takes over a bank, holding staff and customers hostage, then demands a plane to escape. But what are they really after? Are they simply stalling for time, does the bank founder have a nasty secret hidden in the vaults and between the police and the robbers, who is outwitting whom? It's more of a whydunnit than a whodunnit and it's closely plotted. The dialogue is crisp and real, managing to infuse occasional asides of humor into the characters' interactions, especially amongst the police. The movie is, of course, set in New York and Lee throws in many passing references to the city's varied ethnicities, who live uneasily cheek by jowl.The performances are outstanding; Denzel Washington, as the police negotiator, has never been better, and with this role Clive Owen, as the gang leader, has more than made up for the irritating prat he played in Closer. I have always loved Jodie Foster and she gives a perfect performance in a small but important role as a wealthy power broker. I can think of few other actresses who could pull off the subtle mix of elegance, sexuality and authority that she exudes here on screen. All the supporting performers are equally good too. Good stuff! Go see. Addendum: I went to see this again two weeks later. Even better second time around where I picked up many nuances in the major performances (Washington, Owen, Foster, Defoe) that escaped me first time around as I concentrated on the plot. I remain convinced this is one of the best movies in several months. One small criticism; some of the 'outdoor' street scenes are quite badly lit and are quite obviously filmed under artificial light.",Null,2,4,6 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Just OK
","This is not a great movie and it's not going to win Tom Hanks another Oscar nomination, but I quite enjoyed it. There! I've said it! I enjoyed it. I do appreciate that it's really rather naff to admit to liking this movie, but truly, it's not as bad as the critics made out. I've passed worse time in a cinema on a Friday night after a long tedious week at work. Had I seen it at a time when my brain was functional, possibly I would be less kind.I won't go through the plot again, so if you are one of the ten people on the face of the planet who don't know what it's about, read another review. The story premise is interesting, and ties together some history, lots of myths and many half truths in a way that suggests it could be plausible...maybe. It seems to get people riled up for some reason I can't quite fathom, but then I'm not a practising anything, let alone Christian.I read the book, which I thought was just appallingly written (yet somehow I couldn't put it down...) and I thought the movie stuck to it pretty closely. Probably too closely, as some acknowledgement that the screen and the page are different mediums might have helped the rather leaden dialogue. But the action trots along briskly, the editing is good, and the French actors all did their stuff in a suitably Gallic manner. I rather enjoyed Jean Reno's impersonation of a bloodhound, and Marie Francoise Audollent stood out in a small part. There were some pretty pictures of the Louvre's glass pyramid, and it made me nostalgic to see Lincoln Cathedral (a few miles from where I used to live in England) standing in for Westminster Abbey. Apparently the Abbey wouldn't let them film inside, but Lincoln Cathedral will do anything for money and the Chapter House, as shown here, is certainly worth a visit.As for any controversy - it seemed to me they bent over backwards to be non-controversial, with Hanks character Langdon, and McKellen's character Teabing giving lengthy expositions of balancing opposing views to the point of tedium. In fact, the movie would have been improved by more controversy, not less. Sir Ian was wonderful, worth the admission price alone. Without him, the movie would be very dull and I get the feeling he's had rather a lot of fun with it. But far and away the best reason to see The Da Vinci Code - as opposed to reading it - is because you will be spared Dan Brown's terminally banal prose.Not too bad a movie. But I doubt I'd ever watch it again.",Null,1,4,23 May 2006
The Holiday," Is Physical Assault Really Funny??
","I watched this movie on a 14 hour plane ride from San Francisco to Hong Kong, and believe me, I can't imagine any other circumstances in which I would have sat through the entire thing immobile. I'm not a great fan of Romantic Comedies, which I find are rarely very romantic and even less frequently funny. Possibly I'm just too old and cynical. But there wasn't much choice as a combination of boredom and a very efficient Cathay Pacific stewardess, had tied me to my (coach class) seat. And I started about a third of the way into the movie, which I realized later was definitely the best place to start.This is a movie about two young women Amanda (Cameron Diaz  not one of my favourite actresses) and Iris (Kate Winslett  I adore Kate Winslett so I'm almost prepared to forgive her this dire interlude), who swap houses on a whim one Christmas, to escape their various romantic entanglements. Of course they meet new men and fall in love, as one always does when swapping houses, in this case with Jude Law and Jack Black. And I can't even recall the name of their characters (Graeme and Thingy? Ben and Jerry?) Amanda, who owns her own film promotion company and is a skinny over achiever (portrayed as a bitch of course, because she is successful), trots off (first class) to the English countryside where she wrestles with every British cliché in the book, such as driving on the left and stumbling across snowy meadows to reach the quaint, idyllic but chilly Rose Hill Cottage. Iris, an under achieving journalist, wronged in love by a classic British cad, legs it (economy) to LA, where she finds herself living next to a curmudgeonly old screen writer who turns out to have a heart of gold  no surprises there then. I came in where Iris arrives in LA and Amanda arrives in the UK.Amanda falls for Iris' brother (Jude Law), widowed tragically and left with two sweet children. We never find out how he was widowed so young but I spent most of the movie hoping that it would turn out he had murdered his wife, and wishing he would do the same to Diaz. This would have cheered me up enormously, but I guess Cathay Pacific wouldn't have shown it on a long haul flight? (This script has definite possibilities as a horror movie. Isolated cottage, stranger knocking at the door at night, etc. In Surrey, no one can hear you scream.) I have rarely seen a worse matched pair than Cameron Diaz and Jude Law. She is all sharp angles and a whiplash tongue, playing the crazy LA stereotype and he is wildly miscast as stoical Graeme (or Thingy?) Diaz here reminded me of a piece of barbed wire. Meanwhile Iris is getting up close and friendly with Jack Black's character in LA, who has himself been wronged by some actress or other. I actually found Winslett and Black a much more convincing couple than Diaz and Law, although it looked briefly like she might get shacked up with the curmudgeonly old screen writer. Jack Black is actually very good here, playing it very straight, and his character won my sympathy even if I can't recall his name. I found myself warming to them both by the (very predictable) end. I could see why she found him appealing. Then, as the film looped back to the start, I saw the first third. Oh dear. Truly awful. Diaz' character, Amanda, is just appalling. Can she seriously enjoy playing this kind of stuff? Or does it fill the time between surfing? Does anyone really find this offensive portrayal of modern, successful, young women entertaining? Is it me or is this just so unfunny? At one point, Amanda actually physically assaults her ex lover, with two right hooks to the chin which knock him flat. This is presented as amusing entertainment. Just imagine if you can the reverse; a couple splitting up, so he decides to go out on a high note by punching his ex girlfriend to the ground. Would we still be expected to laugh? We have spent years trying to convince the world that men assaulting women is wrong, and here we have a woman assaulting a man presented as light entertainment. Is that really OK with everyone?Yes I know this is just a popcorn movie, and I'm not the target audience  far too old and boring. But it matters, it's insidious. I don't want my teenagers watching this trash. And the worse part? It was written and directed by a woman. She should be ashamed of herself.",Null,32,58,25 May 2007
There Will Be Blood," Masterpiece or Over Hyped Melodrama?
","Well I can't decide. Although I'm tending towards the latter conclusion right now. I'd been looking forward to seeing this after the Oscar nominations came out, and my son gave me a good report too, but after sitting through all two and a half plus hours with a friend, we turned to each other and 'Hmmmm?' was about as philosophical as we could get. This movie is not as good as it thinks it is. It treads a narrow line veering dangerously close to pretension, and has 'Look at me, aren't I a masterpiece?' written all over it. But the jury is still out on that. If I wanted to be really cynical, I could just dismiss it as another movie about men doing manly things. But it does deserve more thoughtful analysis than that.I'm prepared to concede that Daniel Day Lewis gives a tour-de-force performance and the musical score is good. There are some other things about There Will Be Blood which are very good too; the cinematography for instance. It's an interesting story, both as a character study of a strange, driven man and as a history study of the early days of the oil industry. The time is turn of the 20th century, the place the western USA. Daniel Plainview (D D Lewis) survives a mining accident to become an early wildcatter, strikes it lucky, and then, after a tip off from one Mr Paul Sunday, heads west in southern California to drill one of the biggest finds in the state, on the Sunday's dirt poor, hard scrabble goat farm. He gathers leases on land and eventually overcomes the locals' religious fervor, to build a pipeline to the coast, thwarting 'big bad' Standard Oil, but running foul of the preacher, Eli Sunday, Paul's brother or possibly his alter ego, I couldn't quite decide. (Paul Dano, trying hard but miscast in my opinion.) Along the way he adopts a child, the orphaned son of a worker, and the child is rendered deaf as the result of a spectacular, explosive blow out at a well. So far so good. The first hour is far better than the second.To me a film needs more than a strong central performance, music and gritty filming of an oil fire, to be nominated for Best Picture. It also needs good editing, and strong writing, and to fully engage the attention of the audience. And there were times in There Will Be Blood, especially during the second half, when to call it ponderous would be putting it kindly. It is painfully slow in places, almost to the point of tedium, and the fact is that Plainview is an unpleasant man, with whom it is hard to sympathise on any level. He is unpleasant from beginning to end, and except for a few moments of affection for the son, we see a one dimensional character. The obvious character to arouse our sympathy is the adopted son, but he is presented as pretty much functionally mute even before he loses his hearing, so there is little even there to grasp on to as a character with whom to identify. The rest of the cast are bit players, and this is definitely a girly-free zone. Plainview reneges on a promise to give $5,000 to Eli's church, and seems to renege on other promises too, such as drilling for irrigation water, building a road and a school (situation normal for the oil industry, I'm sure viewers are muttering.) He does whatever is needed to succeed, shunts his deaf son off to boarding school by cruelly tricking him onto a train, beats up the preacher in a weird scene, murders a man who poses as his long lost brother and generally seems to be someone for whom arrest and a strait jacket are long overdue. We are given little insight as to why he is such a piece of work.Eventually he makes his huge bundle of money and lives as an alcoholic in a vast mansion. The final dénouement is played out in his private bowling alley after his son, now grown up, has left him to set up on his own as a rival. The pesky preacher  who strangely seems not to have aged a day. Very poor characterization in my opinion  meets his maker via an appointment with a bowling pin.So what are we to make of this? Is there some message to be read here? Power hungry control freaks often meet a nasty end? Beware preachers who have read Revelations once too often? Goat's milk is better for the liver than whiskey? Insulting your adopted son and mocking his use of sign language will leave you lonely in your old age? I wish I knew.I'm glad I saw this. I don't want to be totally negative. It's certainly interesting in concept. But it's far too flawed to deserve Best Picture, and I've seen better movies this year. Sweeney Todd, for example, which truly IS a masterpiece, or even Michael Clayton, which I thought excellent. There Will Be Blood is, however, far, far better than Juno, a movie whose nomination for Best Picture has left me truly bemused.",Null,17,30,3 February 2008
The Wrestler," Watch it for Rourke and Tomei
","There is really only one reason to go watch The Wrestler, and that's to see Mickey Rourke's screen comeback as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. I can remember almost nothing of his earlier career but his return has certainly elicited acres of press coverage, and I was curious to know what all the fuss was about. I also have to admit a certain grudging admiration for anyone who can put himself through the kind of physical torture that I suspect making this movie must have been.There is nothing especially profound to be gleaned from this movie. Don't expect a damning critique on the morality of sadomasochistic wrestling as entertainment. The story isn't terribly original, nonetheless it is done well, given the limits of the genre. It's unpretentious entertainment. Old pro wrestler, down on his luck and surviving on past fame, tries for one last big comeback. His life contains various trashed relationships - including a daughter who doesn't want to know him because he's been a lousy father - and he patches himself up physically with copious amounts of steroids, cocaine, a fake tan and rather enviable blond highlights. Mentally he's a basket case, a tough guy prone to sentimentality and weeping, with truly appalling taste in clothes.His best friend is a lap dancing stripper (an excellent and brave performance from Marisa Tomei) and he makes ends meet working in a deli. At night he returns to his trailer park home, unless he's late with the rent, when the landlord locks him out and he sleeps in his truck. After one particularly brutal bout of extreme wrestling he suffers a heart attack and nearly quits, but the thought of a rematch with his nemesis The Ayatollah, brings him back to the ring one last time. You've seen it all before but it manages to stay remarkably fresh, and the writers and director deserve full credit for that.Personally I can't stand pro wrestling, and the thought that there are people out there in the real world who actually enjoy watching grown men jump off step ladders onto each other's bellies, roll around on barbed wire and cut themselves with razor blades, makes me despair for the future of the human race. This is not a film for the squeamish. It's gripping and entertaining in a high quality Friday Night Fluff kind of way, but it didn't stay with me long after the lights went on.Whether or not Mickey Rourke deserves an Oscar is another question entirely. Does he truly get under the skin of a character or is he basically playing an extreme version of his younger self? After all, he's been a boxer, wrestling isn't that much of a stretch from boxing. He certainly deserves a nomination, but if I had an Oscar vote, it would be going to Sean Penn for Milk.",Null,2,3,10 February 2009
Hancock," Kind of Weird  But OK.
","Hancock, Will Smith's latest offering, is kind of OK-ish but should have been a lot better. Perhaps the best thing I can say about it, is that it wasn't in the least what I was expecting, and I do like to be surprised by a film. But the writers/producers try to throw everything in there to appeal to a broad base, and essentially leave us with a movie that doesn't quite know what it is. The premise is reasonably original and the first half is fairly entertaining, in a brain dead, Friday night sort of way.Hancock is a flawed hero. Badly flawed. A drunk and a bad boy, his super hero antics (rounding up criminals, rescuing damsels in distress) tend to leave a trail of expensive destruction in their wake, and after rescuing the damsel, chances are he'll grope her. To put it bluntly, Hancock is not a very nice guy at all. The rescue of a down on his luck PR man Ray, (Jason Bateman  who for me was the best thing in Juno) leads Hancock to clean up his act. Ray is stuck on a level crossing with a freight train bearing down on him. Hancock slams into the engine, stopping it in its tracks and we get a rather effective shot of the freight cars piling up like spilled dominoes behind them. The public start to berate Hancock for the mess he's made, while Ray defends him 'Hey! This guy just saved my life!' Ray takes him home to meet his family, an adoring son and a beautiful wife (Charlize Theron) who is surprisingly cagey given that Hancock has just saved her man, then Ray persuades Hancock to improve his public image, first of all by doing the jail time he's been evading (for some of his more egregious acts of superhero-dom) and Hancock slopes off obediently to the state penitentiary where he finds himself alongside some of the very guys he helped put away. As you can imagine, he's not popular. He comes out with much improved people skills and a politically correct agenda. So far so good. But the movie can't quite decide what it wants to be after that; a comedy about a superhero dealing with jail and its aftermath (there is a semi comic scene where he assures an injured female police officer that his touching her is totally non sexual, before rescuing her from a gun battle) or a quasi profound examination of the role of heroes in society through the ages.If I'd been the writers, I'd have stuck with the first option, which had many unexplored opportunities for comedy. Instead they try to make Hancock more 'meaningful' by introducing Charlize Theron as his female opposite number, and then explore a 'can't live with her, can't live without her' theme which seems to suggest that our superheroes are some kind of fundamental particles of opposite charge which cancel each other out and die when they are in close proximity.Theron's super heroine has dealt with the loneliness of the long distance super hero by doing what any good girly does in the circumstances; finding a nice safe man (Ray) and helping him chose diapers. A so much more valuable use of her time than, say, rounding up drug cartels or refreezing the melting polar ice caps. Ahhhh! The satisfaction of domestic bliss! All humour is gone by the end and for the finale there's a spectacular and bloody gun battle in a hospital before the baddies get their come-uppance which I guess is what we really need from a super hero movie.It was OK. But I get the feeling that Will Smith could do better. I like the guy. He has a much better movie than Hancock in him.",Null,5,9,18 July 2008
Sherlock Holmes," Not Your Mother's Sherlock Holmes
","Sherlock Holmes as imagined by Guy Ritchie, is not the Sherlock Holmes of Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett. Downey brings a certain punkiness to the role which somehow I had never imagined Holmes to be capable of. Yes I know he was a morphine smoking junkie, but dash it sir, he was a classy one! I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, but it was all just a little frenetic for someone brought up on a more cerebral imagining of the great crime solver. Some of the geography left a little to be desired too. I mean they go into the sewers beneath the Houses of Parliament and pop up in no time at all, next to a half built Tower Bridge.several miles away to the east along the Thames. Hmmmm.. curious my dear fellow.The story involves some confection of Hellfire Club type sacrifices of young women, dastardly noblemen and a plot to take over the British Empire. Or something. It's really not that important. The costumes are pretty, the acting smart and the movie is entertaining, in a Friday Night Fluff kind of way – in fact it's probably the best Friday Night Fluff I've seen in a year. Rachel McAdams is a beautiful Irene Adler and Jude Law is excellent at bringing some pith to Watson. It's a chance for any number of British character actors to pop up and earn a few bob, including James Fox, Geraldine James and the quite wonderful Eddie Marsan as poor old leaden footed Inspector Lestrade (Marsan was last seen as the vitriolic driving instructor in Happy Go Lucky.) No, what annoyed me just a little was some of the rather cartoonish CGI. There were just too many places where it was obvious we were looking at a computer image, which in this day and age I find really inexcusable. And some of the studio scenes which were supposed to be outside were very badly lit, making it quite obvious that the action was taking place indoors. Perhaps I'm being a little pedantic, but if you are going to use CGI instead of real locations or studio sets, make it seamless, and if you are using studio sets get the lighting right.

WALL·E," Pure Genius
","I very rarely give ten out of ten to a movie, but I have no hesitation in giving that perfect score to WALL-E. It is sublime. Not just the best animation I've seen in a long time, but simply one of the best movies I've seen in many months in terms of coherent and effective story-telling and seamless editing. It's extremely well put together. The animation is in a class of its own. My only slightly negative comment might be that clearly this isn't a movie aimed at little kids, and perhaps the marketing strategy is showing too much of the 'cute funnies' and not enough of the sheer artistry of Pixar's vision. This is not a bright, sunny view of the world where everyone lives happily ever after, but quite clearly a message movie; if you agree with the message, you will love this film.Disney may own Pixar these days, but there is an artistic divide between the two production styles. If you want predictable sentimentality watch Disney. I loved Disney's older classics but some of their later offerings  with the exception of Beauty and the Beast which was very good - made me wince when I took my kids along. But in contrast I have loved every single film that Pixar have made since Toy Story in 1995, and if you want something more wry, but still possessing humour and heart, then Pixar is probably going to be your choice.The story is simple enough. It's the year 2700 and the earth has become uninhabitable, not through some terrible cataclysmic event, but by a slow accumulation of suffocating junk. It's a wasteland devoid of living things. As the opening shots pan in, we see that the skyscrapers are actually tall mounds of compressed trash, and that the compressing is being done by WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth class), a small, solitary robot which keeps itself going by scavenging parts from all his clapped out siblings. WALL-E's only companion is a cockroach, and he fills in the time in his trailer home during long dust storms by watching an old video of Hello Dolly. WALL-E is an unlikely hero, rusty but trusty. I hesitate to use the word cute, endearing works better. One day he finds a single plant growing. He doesn't appreciate its significance but takes it home anyway where he squirrels it away with his other treasures such as a Rubic's Cube, a lighter and a trash can lid.Then a space ship lands and EVE emerges (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). Eve is in a whole different class to WALL-E. She can fly, he is earth bound, she is sleek, dangerous and single minded while he is bumbling and rather dowdy. They communicate with beeps and eye twitches, and WALL-E is hooked. When WALL-E gives EVE the plant he has found, she recognizes that her directive  to find evidence of photosynthesis on earth  is fulfilled and shuts down. The ship comes back to pick her up and WALL-E clings on, desperate not to lose her. Arriving at the mother ship, we find the last remaining humans (apparently all American!) who have fled the earth at the behest of the CEO of Buy N Large, a conglomerate who ended up running everything. The humans are pretty much big, obese babies, who have lost the use of their legs and are spoon fed artificial food and platitudinous slogans in equal measure. The rest of the movie involves a plot by the auto pilot to take over the ship and keep it on course away from earth, while the captain tries to take it home, aided by WALL-E and an entertaining array of quirky malfunctioning robots let loose from the repair bay.Some of the best moments are to be found in WALL-E's interaction with everyday objects; a fire extinguisher for example, enables him to zip around in space in a balletic dance with EVE, he uses a lid as a hat to imitate the dancers he sees on his video screen. The humans are not presented as wicked or evil, just unthinking, and the movie ends on a positive and upbeat note, when they recover the use of their legs and return to earth to reclaim it as their home. There are nods to many classic sci-fi movies, Pixar's ubiquitous pizza truck is there near the beginning, and they are not beyond a little self criticism; there's a discarded iPod among WALL-E's accumulated junk.I found myself caring far more about the animated characters in WALL-E than the supposedly human ones in many 'regular' movies. Director Andrew Stanton and everyone at Pixar deserve huge credit for this movie and I hope it is an enormous financial hit for them. I also hope it gets an Oscar nomination, not for best animated feature, but for best film.",Null,29,46,29 June 2008
Music and Lyrics," Adequate Friday Night Fluff
","I like Hugh Grant. He's unapologetically British and exudes a self deprecating wit in his screen roles that makes it almost impossible to criticize him. Whatever you could think of to say against him, I'm sure he's thought of it already and probably said it too. He does what he does; like him or leave him alone. And in this movie, I liked what he did quite a lot. I presume the movie was written for him, because it would be absolutely nothing without him.Music and Lyrics is a reasonable Friday Night Movie. Entertaining in a very accessible way but not actually brain dead. It is not terribly original, and is more than a little clichéd, but contains enough good one-liners to make the audience laugh aloud, and I certainly left the cinema feeling I'd had my money's worth - although I'd be the first to admit it wasn't an especially intellectual two hours. But, as I've said in these reviews several times before, what more do you really need after a tough week at work? Grant plays an aging rocker (Alex Fletcher) from a once fashionable 80's pop band. He now makes a modest but adequate living playing gigs at theme parks and high school reunions, while being mobbed by middle aged women. (Predictably the girl he hooks up with is much, much younger of course.) When the movie begins we see him being induced to take part in a new TV show, Battle of the 80's Has-Beens. Fletcher points out helpfully, that as his last hit was in 1990 he is, strictly speaking, a 90s Has-Been, thus setting the scene for a movie full of gentle self mockery. The problem is that the TV Exec takes the 'Battle' part of the title literally and plans on pitting the now middle aged pop stars against each other in the boxing ring. Fletcher isn't quite that desperate yet, although the TV show is a running gag throughout the film. His agent Chris Riley (entertainingly played by Brad Garrett) wants him to take it.Out of the blue he finds himself with an opportunity to write a song for a new star, a young, nubile popster Cora Corman played by Haley Bennett (who is simply drop dead gorgeous.) Our hero can write music but not lyrics. Enter stage left one Sophie Fisher (rather inadequately played by Drew Barrymore doing cute and fluffy yet again. I like Drew Barrymore, but I found her unconvincing here) posing as a plant waterer, who just happens to be a poet. A fairly predictable romance occurs, and after a few pitfalls, they all live happily ever after. Ever grateful for small mercies, I'm at least glad the script didn't call for Grant to hook up with the barely legal Corman. The running gag about hip replacements was slightly overdone. I mean this guy is supposed to be in his late 40's not his 80's.What makes the movie worth watching are the cringe-inducing scenes of Grant, as an 80's hipster - with a dreadful hairstyle and matching wardrobe - prancing around with his band, and also the reasonably witty dialog. Those of us who were around and semi-adult in the 80's have a lot to answer for. Was it really as bad as this? Some of the jokes are passably funny, and both my 50-something husband and 16 year old son enjoyed it more than I thought they would. Sample dialog; Alex (humming song melody) 'I've been sleeping with a clown above my bed'. Sophie; 'Clown? Clown? It's CLOUD! Why would you sleep with a clown above your bed?' Alex; 'It wouldn't be the first time, trust me.' And so on. All good clean fun, and you'd have to be a Spartan not to crack a smile. Which brings me onto this week's movie. But that's enough for here and now. Music and Lyrics works at a certain minimal level. Just don't expect too much.",Null,1,3,11 March 2007
Trainspotting," Stands the Test of Time
","The last time I watched this movie was before I left the UK for California, and that was in 1997. So it's got to be at least 8 years since I last saw it. My membership of that online movie rental company whose name I won't mention, has allowed me to track down and re-watch semi forgotten classics. A couple of weeks ago it was Cinema Paradiso, this weekend Trainspotting, and quite honestly, I'd forgotten just how good a movie it is. And now my teenage kids are old enough to watch it too, but they weren't in 1997. It's a very British movie, and after 8 years of living here, I can understand why so many of the American commentators didn't like it. Black humor and irony just don't go down well here. That's not intended to be a criticism, just a fact. Other people have said that they are 'too old' to appreciate or understand it; well I'm 50, so I don't think that's a good enough excuse! Even after all these years, it's a movie that still has the power to shock, because it's laugh out loud funny in places and horrifying in others, and it's the juxtaposition of the two that makes it work. What we see are a bunch of losers. They are selfish, asinine, scruffy and lazy no-hopers, dumb beyond belief after a British education, given to petty criminality to feed their habit, and living lives on the margin of society. They possess nothing of beauty or value as it's all been sold or pawned, they have a neglected child and live in filth and squalor. Heroin is their lives, they are utterly amoral and, as they are presumably consenting adults, we wouldn't give a toss about any of them except, of course, that they are funny in that dumb way that only total losers can be, and they might even be sleeping with our daughters and there's that baby haunting the film. And of course the worst of the lot, mad, psychotic Begbie, isn't even a junkie. 'Wouldn't touch that filth,' he says as he downs another pint and pulls a knife on his fellow drinkers. At least I think that's what he said.....When Renton, the brightest one of their number, kicks the habit with some tough love from his parents, and starts a fresh life in London, he still can't escape as the rest follow him there. He steals the proceeds of their one big deal, and finally makes off with the filthy lucre. Is it theft if you steal from thieves? I can't quite decide why I like this movie so much. Maybe because it's just so uncompromising. Maybe because it's just so British. But it's worth fighting your way past the accents and it bears repeat watching. It was also interesting to see an early performance by Kelly Macdonald who went on to give such a very good performance in Gosford Park. She should be more widely known here. Maybe 2006 will be her year?",Null,0,1,16 January 2006
La Vie En Rose," Remember your Audience!
","That's by way of a plea to movie makers. Edith Piaf was around still when I was a child and I'm well into middle age now, but her career was just about over even then. That means that most of the people who have heard of her, or at least who care about her and her music, are at least my age. And mostly older. (Of course I guess that's not true in France, and in fairness this is a French movie. Maybe I'm being too Anglocentric here?) But the night I saw this movie in my local theatre, I'm fairly sure I was one of the youngest people there. And all around me people were whispering tell tale comments like 'What's going on?', 'Who is that?', 'Where did he come from?', 'Is that the guy we saw just now?' etc etc. In other words, they were confused and they were not the type of audience who were used to watching movies that skip all over the place in time zones. Even I was confused, and I take my Gingko Biloba every day without fail. The movie has some good performances, and of course the backbone is the great singing of Piaf herself, but the story telling method is way too complicated, with at least three time lines going on. I think this distracts from what could have been an interesting insight into what made Piaf tick. She was certainly not a very touchy-feely human being, and she had a pretty bleak start in life, but I do think she had an extraordinary voice. The best part of this movie by far (as in most coherent) was the central core story of Piaf's love affair with a boxer, when she was truly at her happiest. Perhaps the coherency of the story telling here is supposed to convey that this was indeed the most coherent part of Piaf's life? He is killed in an accident, and after that her life pretty much descends into a drug riddled mess made worse by the death of her only child and her own poor health, and comparisons to later divas are too obvious to even mention. Marion Cotillard gives a good physical performance as Piaf (the singing is all Piaf originals), I found her very convincing. I've certainly seen far worse movies but that's damning it with faint praise. It could have been so much better with a more linear story.",Null,5,8,30 September 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Girls Gone Wild in Barcelona
","Or Beautiful People Doing Beautiful Things. This film features a gorgeous cast but luckily they can all act, making for an all round pleasurable experience. I enjoyed it immensely for its humour, originality and great writing, as well as a generous amount of casual sex and great views of Barcelona.Two young women arrive for the summer in Barcelona (one of the world's great cities  I recommend it), planning on staying with old friend Judy Nash (Patricia Clarkson, excellent as always). Vicky (Rebecca Hall, who I enjoyed in The Prestige. She seems equally at home playing Brits or Americans) is engaged to be married. She's intelligent but cautious, traditional and more than a little skeptical. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) is restless, artsy without any direction, perhaps shallow, rootless. Cristina is looking for some kind of ultimate love affair, while Vicky is more practical, settling for what she sees as a 'good enough' relationship with reliable Doug back in the USA.At a gallery opening they see Javier Bardem's Juan Antonio from a distance; he's an artist, well known, successful and very, very sexy. Later in a local restaurant, he approaches them and asks them to fly to Oviedo with him for a weekend of good food, good wine and, hopefully, good sex. In an amusing scene, we see cynical Vicky telling him exactly why they won't go with him, while Cristina tells him with everything including her body language, exactly why they will. Juan Antonio is charmingly upfront. There is no pretense, no coyness. Just 'Life is short, let's make the most of it and share some pleasure.' He is quite irresistible. I think whoever is managing Javier Bardem's career is doing a really good job, because coming after his psychopathic killer in No Country for Old Men, this is a glorious part for him. Yes, it's a male fantasy, but with a guy this good, it could be a female fantasy too.They fly to Oviedo where Cristina gets sick and takes to her bed, while Vicky and Juan Antonio find a surprising amount in common. Later, back in Barcelona, Vicky throws herself into art study and language lessons, determined not to let her quickie with Juan interfere with her life plan, while Cristina moves in with Juan Antonio and takes up photography. Everything goes swimmingly until his erratic (and erotic) ex wife Maria Elena, played fabulously by Penelope Cruz, shows up. Cruz is just so much better in Spanish than English. She and Juan Antonio have a 'Can't live with her and can't live without her' type of relationship, and at one time she has tried to kill him. Talented but manic, there is a question over how much Juan Antonio owes of his own success to her. The women get along in a ménage a trois for a while but Cristina gets restless again and decides to move on, and Maria Elena is never far from eruption. Vicky meanwhile is reviewing her own life plan, with Doug turning up in Spain.One reason why this movie is so satisfying is that all the peripheral characters are so good. Juan Antonio's father, who writes beautiful poetry but decides to punish the world he despises by keeping it to himself; Patricia Clarkson's Judy, who is suffocating in her loveless marriage but is too scared to move on alone; Doug, Vicky's fiancé (Chris Messina, who is new to me.) It would have been easy to make Doug a figure of fun, but he's not, he's just a nice guy, decent but not very exciting. Every character is well written and their inter relationships keep us interested to the end. The use of voice over is never over done, and the sub titles are used to great effect, with Juan Antonio yelling 'Speak English' at his ex wifein Spanish.This is not a movie of great social importance, no one is poor or really struggling to survive. Everyone is pretty and rich. But neither is it superficial and trite and there isn't a special effect or over wrought explosion in sight. It's witty, grown up and very entertaining, certainly one of Woody Allen's best efforts in a while. I like most of the work he's done since he went to Europe to film, but I think this one is the best to date.",Null,3,10,4 September 2008
Munich," Great story obviously but oh dear, those clichés
","I remember the events of the Munich Olympics 1972 fairly clearly. I was 17 at the time, and resident in England. It made a big impression, watching it unfold on the BBC, the vivid images played out on TV. The slaughtered athletes, the botched German security job, the debate over continuing the games (they did but shouldn't have.) I remember the hijackings, Leila Khaled, Black September, Bader Meinhoff, The Red Brigade, the IRA, all that early terrorism that rather passed America by in the pre-9/11 world. So I was predisposed to appreciate this story, and it was certainly time that the story was told. I can't exactly say that I was predisposed to enjoy it. Is it right to enjoy a true story about a real-life slaughter? You can't possibly analyze the story, all you can do is analyze the telling of it, which is what I'll try and do.To me, this movie is a classic example of how to ruin a really good story by throwing every cliché in the book at it. There were parts of it I loved. Eric Bana's performance, for example, was really outstanding, by far the best I've seen him give. It certainly works on the level of a thriller, as we watch the shadowy team of Israelis track down the shadowy team of Palestinians across Europe. I found the mental disintegration, self-doubt and mounting paranoia of Avner very believable, and the individual details of the kills were quite fascinating, although the lingering shot of the bullet wounds over the pretty Dutch assassin's breasts was perhaps slightly overdone.The trouble is that Spielberg doesn't just set the scene for us as we move from country to country, he hits us over the head with it and then grinds our noses into it just in case we missed anything. To give a few examples. London. In the space of half a city block we are shown two red telephone booths, a red post box, a red London bus (double decker of course), a Mini Cooper, a Ford Zephyr and a black taxicab. And just in case you missed any of those, it's raining. This is London, OK? London. L-O-N-D-O-N. All it lacked was a Cheery Cockney Chappie to run up to our hero and say 'Mornin' Mate' for it to have included every London cliché from A to Z (although had that happened I might well have got up and left.) Then there's the 'Oh look, it must be Paris, I can see the Eiffel Tower' scene. And everyone was smoking at the table and mentioned cheese frequently, so we'd know they were REALLY French, not masquerading Belgians. Was that the Spanish Steps in Rome? We have bikes and canals in Holland, and Hey! it's Brooklyn, she lives in a brownstone and there are the friendly neighbors sitting on the steps! All Spielberg spared us was an aerial shot of the Acropolis in Greece. Is it a necessity for geographically challenged American audiences to be bludgeoned over the head with all this visual imagery so they'll have no doubts about where they are? Did someone in the props department find a locked closet with 'Europe' written on the door and insist on using everything they found inside dating from every European movie made since 1930? The head-tossing sex scene towards the end, cutting between the violence and Avner's trauma also made me shake my head in disbelief that anyone as good as Spielberg could throw in such an obvious cliché.The London street scene actually reminded me of Austin Powers, and that really wasn't the memory I wanted to retain of this movie, because it makes some very good points, chief amongst them being that for every terrorist you kill, ten more will stand up to take their place (especially true if you kill parents in front of their children.) And that exacting revenge has a terrible effect on the avenger. And did the Americans really make a Faustian pact with Black September to keep terrorism out of the USA? Interesting and thought provoking stuff, and yet it was thrown in almost as an after thought. That one question would make a great movie all by itself.But I'm afraid mostly this movie just made me sigh. Am I getting too old to go to the movies any more? Is there anyone left out there who can make a movie devoid of cliché? Because for me this ruined what should have been a deeply moving story. But at least it has left me wanting to know more about the story, more about what happened after Munich, so it wasn't a total loss. Maybe I'll go and look for a book about it. With no pictures.",Null,1,3,14 January 2006
300," I'm Off to Take a Cold Shower..
","I love this movie  but certainly for all the wrong reasons! My first suggestion is that Snyder and Warner Brothers fire the entire marketing department. This is definitely not, as they may think, a movie for the impressionable 18-30 male demographic, with its fairly obvious homophobic overtones and clichéd, war-like call to arms (did the US Marine Corps put up the money?) No, no. This, my friends, is a movie for the 40+ female demographic, with acres of lush male flesh on display and muscles so tight you could hear them rippling if the soundtrack weren't so loud. (I recommend you turn your hearing aids down ladies. You won't gain much insight from listening to the dialogue anyway.) I haven't seen this many well toned abs since my Opthalmologist gave me a tricky new prescription for bi-focals, and I wandered by accident into the wrong locker room at the gym! If I hadn't taken my husband and son with me, the theatre staff might well have had to scrape me off the floor at the end of the show. Did the ancient Spartans really fight in Speedos? Seriously, I guess I have to say something intellectual about the actual movie, not just the natural wonder of Messrs. Butler, Santoro and Wenham's physical attributes, which are very much on display here. This movie was interesting on several levels - not least because it's the first film I've seen in a long time where the men had bigger chests than most of the women, although, gratifyingly, the women appeared to have more gray matter between their ears than the fellas  and I really don't quite know what to make of the suggestions that it's really a Neo-fascist call to make war on Iran. I mean, are the American public really that gullible? If so, I'm handing back my Green Card and heading back to Europe faster than a quarter would bounce off Vincent Regan's pecs. This movie must have been 5 years in the making, from the first glimmer of an idea in Zack Snyder's heated brain to its display on the Santa Cruz cinema screen. Is the guy really that prescient? Personally I find it hard to believe. Some of the critics of 300 need a sense of humour infusion.I think I'm just going to settle for being totally disingenuous, and take 300 entirely at face value, as a re-creation of a comic book, and leave it at that. And as a re-creation of a comic book (sorry but nothing on earth is going to induce me to call them 'Graphic Novels' even though I know that's the politically correct thing to do. I know a comic book when I see one. Fanny Hill is a 'Graphic Novel'. It's a novel and it's graphic.) it works pretty well. It's certainly a fine display of technical movie making, very stylized and a bit thin on plot but very well edited, and if you want depth and complexity, go and see The Departed instead (which I did a couple of weeks ago, and it's terrific.) Neither should you expect too much historical accuracy, but then this IS Hollywood. This movie is unapologetically gory and violent, but in a cartoonish way, has a multitude of nipples on display of both genders, and no one, but no one, can possibly not know what they are letting themselves in for when they shell out their 10 bucks and buy a ticket.Gerard Butler gives an honest, engaging performance as King Leonides, a man who clearly loves his wife, as we see during a mildly erotic interlude where they trot briskly through a variety of positions for our, and I hope their, pleasure. Lena Headey plays a strong Queen Gordo; I'd forgotten just how good she is, although there were moments I thought she might be channeling Queen Amidala. David Wenham, clad in slightly more costume than he wore in Better than Sex (but only just), remains firm-jawed after losing an eye in battle ('Never mind  I've got a spare!') although I found his delivery of the narration ever-so-slightly irritating. He does a great cockney accent but his 'Queen's English' is less convincing (to a Brit, anyway.)This may well become a cult classic. Personally I think I'll buy the DVD and keep it on a permanent loop on the screen of my laptop with the sound turned off. It could enliven many a dull moment at our quarterly management meetings! Definitely one for the girls.",Null,4,10,12 March 2007
Moon," Intriguing
","I'll nail my colors to the mast right at the start by saying that I am a long time science fiction fan, so when a rare sci fi offering comes around - and they are few and far between - I'm predisposed to feel positively towards it. And whilst there have been some fairly lukewarm reviews for Moon, personally I really enjoyed it. The movie hinges on a really very good, very strong performance from Sam Rockwell as the 'hero' Sam Bell. It's a pity that sci fi very rarely gets recognized by the panels who select nominees for awards, because Rockwell's performance here is really outstanding. He IS the movie, it's nothing without him.I last saw Rockwell in one of 2008's stranger offerings, Choke, the story of a guy who spends his days working in an historic re-enaction theme park, and his evenings pretending to choke in restaurants so that people will save him. He was also pretty good in Brad Pitt's recent Jesse James film. In Moon he simply IS the whole movie, and he is compelling to watch. Few other actors can command our attention in that way. I just find him an utterly believable actor.The story is fairly standard sci fi fare, but enjoyable. The director successfully creates the feeling of claustrophobia that I can well imagine must exist in such a confined space as a space station. It's basically a movie about worker exploitation, hardly a new theme. Yet put in a new setting, it is fresh.I must be getting old, but when I was a kid reading about astronauts living in space for months – or even years- on end, it was all just total fantasy. Now of course, with the international space station, we barely register anymore when a new crew blasts off, or someone returns after several months up there, in orbit above our heads. It is almost routine and we only seem to take much notice if something goes wrong. Has space travel lost its mystery and excitement, are we too jaded for a film like Moon? I hope not.",Null,2,5,30 October 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," We Have a Winner!
","Director Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is one of my all time favourite movies, and Mr Wroe's Virgins was a stunning piece of television, so I'm possibly a little biased, but this is one of the better films I've seen in the last twelve months.I've seen this movie criticized by American reviewers as being a sanitized version of Indian poverty, then seen it criticized online as portraying India as a 'third world dirty underbelly', it's been criticized for being patronizing and insulting to an entire nation (India) and for showing too much dire poverty - and too little. In fact on one page of comments on IMDb I've seen it described as horrifying for the poverty and abuse it portrays and horrifying for its pandering to stereotypes, as simplistic, clichéd, racist, graphically violent, cynically exploitative and naive! In other words it appears to have upset both ends of the spectrum of opinion - so it has to be doing something right.Personally, I really enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire. There is absolutely nothing wrong with an occasional feel good, happy ending to a movie, especially a movie which is fairly well written, has a good story arc with a beginning, a middle and an end, and satisfying performances. This one just happens to be a feel good movie set in India, and it's not directed by an Indian film maker (although the book it's based on was written by an Indian national). But since when has it been such a big deal for people to make films outside their own countries? It happens all the time. Having said that, as with any feel good, happy ending, it pays to bear in mind that life is rarely like that. Still - nothing wrong with a bit of dreaming every once in a while. This is one of the few movies I've seen recently where I didn't slump into my seat with a disappointed sigh and the feeling that I've seen it all before. Slumdog Millionaire offered this particular jaundiced movie fan a new story and a fresh set of actors, far removed from the usual line up of Hollywood 'stars' and over paid, over exposed media darlings. I'd give it a pretty high score just for presenting some fresh new talent to the world. It's not a complex story; Jamal and his brother Salim have grown up poverty stricken in Mumbai. Somewhere along the line Jamal met and lost the love of his life. Many years later he gets an opportunity to appear on the wildly popular TV show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? He succeeds despite being an uneducated 'Slumdog' and Char Wallah because every question refers him back to a situation in his past life. By appearing on TV and transfixing the whole nation, Jamal connects once more with his lost love, and everyone lives happily ever after, the movie ending with a Bollywood production number. I appreciate that on the whole Indians don't spring into song and dance routines at major railway termini. Dev Patel gives a lovely performance as Jamal. Dev can be seen in 'Skins' on BBC America if anyone is interested. Also quite fabulous is Anil Kapoor as the condescending game show host. I thoroughly enjoyed Slumdog for the straightforward, uncomplicated piece of entertainment that it is. Good luck at the Oscars guys!",Null,2,4,18 January 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Redemptive Power of Hard Work
","If this were not a true story I would simply not believe it. There really is some truth in the old adage that truth is stranger than fiction, because if this were merely a Hollywood fictional rags to riches story, I'd have been yawning and looking at my watch after the first half hour, and the word cliché would feature large in this review. But how do you reasonably criticize something which is essentially fact? Put briefly, Chris Gardner survives a string of disasters (the demise of his business selling bone scanners, the loss of his disillusioned wife, becoming homeless and a single parent, broke and even at one point, a felon - after he is arrested for unpaid parking fines. A wonderful use of tax payers' money I'm sure, jailing people for unpaid parking tickets) to go on to become a multi millionaire stock broker and father extraordinaire, a cuddly capitalist, the epitome of The American Dream. As one disaster after another lays him low, his sheer tenacity keeps him going, to eventual financial salvation and professional success. It's a movie about the redemptive power of sheer hard work, politeness, honesty and love. And it also proves the relevance of another old adage  nothing ventured, nothing gained. Offered a chance to intern at a major broker, Chris grasps the opportunity, working his balls off despite the lack of regular salary, just on the slight hope that at the end of the internship he might be the one out of twenty hopefuls chosen for a proper job. But the movie doesn't actively ram anything political down the audience's throat, his ultimate success speaks for itself.As the disasters in his life piled up, Chris' remarkable lack of cynicism had this viewer shaking her head in disbelief. But you have to take this movie at face value and accept that there really are people around as remarkable as Chris Gardner. I'm going to take this movie totally on trust and assume the story hasn't been prettied up too much for the screen. If it really can be taken at face value, then I find it rather reassuring that the Chris Gardners of this world can succeed. Resourceful and dogged in his pursuit of success as well as happ(y)ness, he never resorts to self pity even at the lowest points (sleeping in a public toilet, bathing his son in a sink at a homeless shelter.) And like any parent under stress he occasionally cracks and loses his temper with his vulnerable young son, but as a good parent he pulls himself together and shields the child as much as he can.Will Smith is remarkable in this movie. I've always liked the guy, who seems affable and clever, but this movie proves that he is an excellent actor. It's a very honest and engaging performance which draws even the most cynical of viewers in completely. I thought it was a terrific performance. Also remarkable is Smith's real-life son Jaden Smith playing his son in the movie. The child is just wonderful.It looks as if most of this movie was made on location in San Francisco, and I thought the cinematography as excellent. The location shooting worked well to give the film an authentic feel, with mostly natural light, suitably grimy exteriors etc.One small gripe; the sound track. Intrusive sound tracks are really becoming one of my bêtes noir. Just at a moment when everything seems blackest for Chris, and we wonder if he can possibly keep going, a bright, zippy, zingy little piece of music intrudes so we know in advance that everything is going to be OK. This drives me nuts, and in this movie, it ruins several moments of tension, signalling as it does, an upbeat outcome in advance of the resolution. A movie should succeed or fail on the basis of its performances and its writing, and the performances and writing here are very good. Good enough to carry the dramatic moments of the movie without advance guidance from the music. But overall  a pretty fair Friday Night Movie.",Null,1,4,17 December 2006
Valkyrie," Anticipating the Inevitable.
","I enjoyed this movie and I'm not sure why it's been given such a lukewarm reception by critics. Operation Valkyrie's had several previous treatments on TV and in movies, both fictionalized and documentary, by the Brits and the Germans, but this is probably the highest profile attempt yet. It's well made, with a strong script, good production values, appropriate music and a flawless roster of actors. In fact the cast practically amounts to a roll call of every decent, middle-aged, British male actor currently working, with a sprinkling of Americans and Germans thrown in for good measure. The real problem with the movie is that right from the beginning we know the inevitable, depressing outcome of the story, so it amounts to two hours of watching a juggernaut gather speed and momentum but knowing it will eventually plunge off a cliff into tragic oblivion. It's just a case of how it gets there. I was raised on a constant stream of stories of WW2 (my parents survived the London Blitz and when I was born in the 1950s, WW2 was something still spoken of literally every day. It wasn't history, it was very recent daily life) so I approached Valkyrie with a sense of gloom at the tragic, known outcome - a plan to assassinate Hitler going horribly wrong and heading for disaster like a train heading for a pile up at the buffers while you stand there watching it happen, unable to intervene. But I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.I think it's important that films like this are still made. WW2 happened in very recent history, but already too many people have quite forgotten about it; they have forgotten about Hitler, the Nazis, the Death Camps and the huge war that tore the world apart. Unfortunately I suspect it will be mostly people of my generation who go watch it. Of course no one nowadays is raised on stories of WW2 as I was, but nonetheless we shouldn't forget.The Operation Valkyrie of the title, was a plan developed for the Reserve portion of the German Army and approved by Hitler himself. It was intended to be used in the event of a breakdown in law and order within Germany or the countries it occupied, a breakdown caused by Hitler's death or civil unrest. A group of officers who were a part of the German Resistance to Hitler, could see the way the war was heading, that Europe was being laid waste and Germany was losing, and they were also disturbed at aspects of Nazi rule - the Death Camps for instance and the killing of civilians  so they plotted to kill Hitler and utilize an amended Operation Valkyrie for their own ends to take control of the nation after Hitler's death and to negotiate a truce with the Allies. If it had worked, they would have used Hitler's own plan against him. But crucial to the plan was Hitler's death. The plot was aborted once, and when finally carried out in 1944, failed to kill its target. Poor communication, indecision on the part of some of the plotters and a late start in implementing Valkyrie led to complete failure and within hours all the plotters had been rounded up and executed.The plot was lead by Colonel Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) who was put in charge of Valkyrie and made Chief of Staff to General Fromm, after being badly injured fighting in N. Africa . He had access to Hitler but was also to be vital in the follow up to the assassination, which  according to a source I read online  ruled out a suicide attack. Which was a pity, because as I watched this, I couldn't help pondering how much the course of history might have been changed had Stauffenberg chosen the current favored method of assassins, the suicide bomb. Had he got closer to Hitler at that fateful meeting and sacrificed himself, instead of leaving the bomb under a solidly built wooden table which helped shield the Fuehrer from the blast, the whole course of history since 1944 might have been different. Still, it wasn't to be. Hitler was dead anyway nine months later, committing suicide in his Berlin bunker as the Allies approached. Berlin was carved up amongst the Allies, the Death Camps were finally liberated and the Cold War began. Tom Wilkinson plays General Fromm, who was commander of the Reserve Army, and the only person apart from Hitler who could put Operation Valkyrie into effect. He ordered the execution of Stauffenberg and the other plotters but was himself executed in 1945. Other plotters included General Olbricht (Bill Nighy), Colonel von Quirnheim (Christian Berkel), Lieutenant von Haeften (Jamie Parker), General Beck (Terence Stamp making a rare appearance as a goody) and Fellgiebel (comedian Eddie Izzard  an interesting piece of casting but very effective.) They are all excellent. The location shooting is perfect, often using the real life settings in Germany (for instance the plotters are executed by firing squad in the courtyard of the real Bendlerstrasse.) The lack of German accents (widely commented on) is quite appropriate. Given that everyone in the movie would have been speaking German, there is no need to give them distracting accents at all. The use of accents is really only necessary when the audience is expected to distinguish between several different nationalities in a movie.As for Cruise, well I've always thought Tom Cruise a perfectly good actor. The problem is that his private life has become so high profile and the subject of so much speculation and even ridicule, that it's now hard to watch him playing a serious character on screen. Which is a pity. He will obviously bring an audience to this movie, but I can't honestly say that he brings much weight. Nonetheless it's well worth the investment of ten bucks and a couple of hours.",Null,5,7,4 January 2009
Atonement," Lots of Acting
","'There was an awful lot of acting in that movie,' said my husband as we left the theatre. I know what he meant. Atonement's the kind of movie that wins awards because the relatively simple story line and lack of explosions and car chases, gives the actors a chance to string coherent words together, more than 2 or 3 at a time, and deliver them without simultaneously drawing a gun or jumping over roof tops. Not that I don't like action movies. I do. It's just nice occasionally to watch something more cerebral. There are many things I loved about Atonement, yet still, at the end I was surprised it didn't move me more or have a bigger emotional impact on me. With such a tragic storyline, I was fully prepared for a good weep, but somehow it never fully engaged me emotionally. I'm still trying to decide quite why. The cast was certainly excellent. Keira Knightley (Cecilia) is not only gorgeous to look at for extended periods of time on screen, but she's very effective portraying Cecilia, the eldest daughter of an upper crust family, whiling away a long, hot, sultry summer in a country house just before World War 2, when Britain was still in the grasp of an enervating class system. Women of her class were still required to do little at that time beyond marry well, and Cecilia is clearly bored to tears and frustrated on every level. Her clipped tones and delivery are perfect. Contrast this with Knightley's 2002 performances in Pure, or Bend it Like Beckham, and you will see just how far she has come as an actor. Four years have taken her from gangly kid to sultry sex symbol with no pit stops for rehab, and I adore her for it. James McAvoy (Robbie) seems to have come from nowhere to become a major male star in very short order, although I know in actuality he's been around a while. I've thought him excellent in every movie I've seen him in, especially The Last King of Scotland. All three actresses who play Cecilia's little sister Briony as she ages, are equally good, and all the supporting cast are very proficient. Director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice) creates a languid and vaguely erotic, sexually charged atmosphere between Cecilia and Robbie, a couple who are wildly attracted to each other but separated by the artificial barrier of class. He contrasts Robbie - bright, well educated and stifled by his humble origins - with the crass, upper class twitishness of Cecilia's brother Leon and his unpleasant friend Paul. Cecilia and Robbie cross paths repeatedly, trying to ignore their obvious mutual attraction. This is a classic example of how to create sexual energy and tension on screen with very little actual physical contact, before the fateful library scene. But when they do finally come together they sizzle, positively setting the screen on fire for a few brief moments before fate, in the shape of nosey Briony, intervenes. It's hard to define chemistry in a couple on screen, you just know it when you see it. These two have it in bucket loads.Wrongly accused of a sexual assault, Robbie is dragged off to prison, and the summer idyll comes to an abrupt end, not just for the protagonists but for the whole country, as WW2 looms ahead. Four years later Robbie is in the army, stranded at Dunkirk and Cecilia has become the efficient ward sister of a London hospital. Briony, also a nurse, wants to make amends for the terrible accusations she made which put Robbie in jail. But the past can never be undone. Much has been written about the Dunkirk beach scene, so I won't repeat it except to say that it is cleverly filmed but looked a little too much like a graphic novel storyboard at times. The cinematography of the whole movie is beautiful, as it was in Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice in 2005. He has a real feel for the beauty of old British country estates, and he certainly showcases Knightley at her very best. Yes, that dress is stunning. Yet I felt the movie lost emotional impact by showing us the various real and fictional endings (fictional as imagined by an adult Briony, now a novelist.) In that respect it reminded me of The French Lieutenant's Woman. This is almost an attempt to be too cerebral, and it comes at the expense of emotional involvement. Which is a pity. There is still a place in cinema for the unabashed representation of love, whether thwarted as this is, or fulfilled. Somehow this is just too detached. I haven't read the book so I'm willing to believe it is an accurate interpretation, but personally, I'd have simply shown the tragic ending, rather than Briony's fictional option, and left the audience to work out the 'what ifs' for themselves. It would have left at least this audience member sad but more satisfied.",Null,4,6,21 January 2008
V for Vendetta," Interesting but not amazing
","V for Vendetta is not faultless by any means. I thought it got a little 'soggy' in the middle during the prison interlude, a series of scenes which would have benefited from some livening up and editing, and the movie was both too wordy and too worthy in places, but overall, I thought it a good investment of two hours of my time and almost ten bucks of my money. Hugo Weaving's performance as V was astonishing, hidden as he was behind a mask the whole time, yet still able to covey pathos and purpose. While credit must be given to some intelligent writing, most of it was down to Weaving's sheer physical ability as an actor. His voice was both seductive and sinister and his presence never less than compelling. And Natalie Portman just gets better with everything I see her in. Stephen Fry also stood out as a gay TV host in a future Britain where homosexuality is once again a serious no-no.I came to this film as a Brit who grew up celebrating Guy Fawkes Night (or Bonfire Night as it's more often called in colloquial English), and the playground rhyme Remember, Remember the Fifth of November is for me immediately evocative of chilly, foggy November nights from my childhood, shivering crowds gathered around a bonfire and letting off fireworks, hands clutching steaming mugs of hot chocolate to ward off the cold. Few of us gave any thought at all to the historical origins of this strange celebration; we simply seized the opportunity to indulge in public displays of pyromania, united in our rather subversive love of a good fire. Would Brits turn up in their thousands to watch the Houses of Parliament burn down? It's an interesting question. I rather think they might. (And I'm not going to get into the politics of 17th century Britain and the Protestant v Catholic debate or the recent appalling terrorist attacks.) The connection between Guy Fawkes and V in this movie, may be a little lost on other nations, but it makes the obvious point that terrorism has been around a very long time (with a variety of names), and that the old adage 'one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter' is as true now as it has ever been.A future Britain has become a fascist state where information is tightly controlled and the population is kept in line by fear of the chaos and anarchy existing elsewhere. Or maybe chaos doesn't exist everywhere else? Who knows when a few people control the media and the populace prefer to spend their time watching brain-dead TV dross? Does this ring a bell? (Presumably the Internet and communication satellites have been closed down in V's Britain.) Undesirables of every type are rounded up and shipped off to secret facilities where they are the guinea pigs for various biological warfare experiments. A lone survivor of the worst of these facilities, a character known only as V, sets about single handedly bringing down the government and setting the population free by exposing them to the truth. And by blowing up a lot of London and killing not a few people.The movie is interesting as a contrast to the Wachowski brothers previous Matrix trilogy. Fewer acrobatic displays, more old-fashioned explosions. And the plot is easier to follow but perhaps not as original. I have never seen the comic book from which it is derived, so I can't comment on the interpretation. But one thing I do like about the Wachowski's movies is that although they are full of stunning special effects, they are ultimately character driven, and we can get a sense of empathizing with the people at the centre of the plot. That's something too often missing from science fiction Â– or perhaps future fiction, as V for Vendetta might more correctly be called. I enjoyed it, and I think I could happily watch it again. My teenage son, perhaps closer to the target audience, thought it wonderful.",Null,2,4,27 March 2006
