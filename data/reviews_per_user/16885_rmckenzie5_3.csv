It," Inappropriate script for kids
","Not only do they use inappropriate language for kids of their age, the sexualized a 15 year old girl for this part. Maybe these things (language and perversion) do happen occasionally in real life, but we don't have to promote it as if it's the norm.The only reason 'it' got three stars from me, is it could be a good story, if the script was age appropriate, or the characters were 'script' appropriate.",3,1,6,9 September 2018
Gravity," laws of physics need not apply!!!
","I really thought this was going to be good, but almost as soon as it started the laws of physics ended. You can only stretch the truth so far before it becomes a total joke. The acting was very much less than stellar by these two main characters. But it's the mistakes (many, many, many of them) that made me lose interest first. I started to think maybe this was just a low budget project a friend of one of the actors talked them into doing, until I saw the movie budget of ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS!! That's an awful big mistake! Honestly, I can't think of one thing about this movie that was factually accurate, or that interested me enough to recommend it. It's just that bad! If you live in Co., or Ca. Where people are perpetually high, it might be entertaining, but if you're sober, or have any brain cells left, pass on this one.",2,3,8,4 August 2014
Now You See Me," great story, although...
","This movie is a very good story, very innovative and original, but the casting was totally off! It seemed to me, they should have cast mostly unknown actors for the characters of the four horsemen. Ruffalo was all wrong for the part he played. Pierce Brosnan, or someone like him would have been a much better choice. Ruffalo just doesn't exude the intellect to adequately pull off a part like this with confidence. Jesse Eisenberg has an ever/never ending ego I just can't digest in any movie. Dave Franco seemed to always try too hard to correctly pronounce every word instead of acting natural. Woody Harrelson, well, can anyone ever imagine him being this smart? Isla Fisher, just like Anjelina Jolie, seems to spend more time worrying about how she looks than how she is acting. Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman are the only two that really fit their parts. Worth a watch, but not very satisfying due to the casting errors.",2,0,1,24 June 2014
