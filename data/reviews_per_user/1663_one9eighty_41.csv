Despicable Me 2," Still happy
","Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is back. Retired from being a full-time evil villain to care for his adopted children he now dedicates his spare time to Jam. Unfortunately the world is not ready to forget him, he's hired by the Anti Villain League to investigate the disappearance of an arctic lab. Together with Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) on the investigation trail it looks likely that El Macho is behind the crime - and he's supposed to be dead. Evidently he's not dead and to make matter's worse, El Macho's son is taking a fancy to Gru's eldest adopted daughter, Margo. With his hands full he doesn't notice the slow disappearance of his trusted Minions. Gru really has to up his game and gadgets to resolve so many situations.The sequel to Despicable Me is another charming film, I was worried that the first film may just be a fluke and any sequel would be a poorly milked clone. This is not the case; the film stands up on its own merit and is amusing for all the family. Given the choice I prefer the first film because it gave us something fairly new in its characters, plot and set-up. However this is by no means a failure of a film just because it's got familiar characters in it, there has been growth and development - which is more than some blockbuster films have. It's colourful and creative, beautiful to look at, has action and humour in the right places too. Absolutely worth a watch whether you are seeing this film with, or without having seen the first film - Enjoy 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,12 July 2018
Angels & Demons," A bit watered down and obvious, but still a book smart chase/adventure movie
","Robert Langdon is back with another mystery to solve. A vial of anti-matter is stolen from the LHC (Large Haydron Collider) project. The current pope of the Vatican dies in mysterious circumstances. Four cardinals are kidnapped by what appears to be the illuminati - who confirm that each hostage would be killed on the hour leading up to midnight, where, at which time a bomb (the anti-matter) would be set off - destroying the Vatican, and a large area of Italy. It's a race against time for Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) and Vittoria Vetra (played by Ayelet Zurer) to rescue the prisoners and stop the bomb. To do this they must solve century old riddles left to the through religion and literature. If you've seen 'The Da Vinci Code' then expect a lot more of the same. It's the usual book-smart adrenaline filled detective journey film that Ron Howard brought to screen, basing the content on Dan Brown's book by the same title - 'Angels and Demons'. Like the first film, some of the scenery is lovely to behold (possibly not as nice as the first film though), also like the first film - a decent cast is assembled who mainly do a good job. There were some parts which felt a little wooden and didn't allow me to connect emotionally but all in all it was harmless. I think the biggest let down for me in this was actually Ewan McGregor's character - Cameriengo Patrick). I like him as an actor, but this character felt like a let down because it was obvious from the get-go that he had his own motives. There were some clues to his character development on show but his general mannerisms from the off suggested there was more to come. Maybe it was Howard's direction that led him to deliver the way he did because he hasn't been that obvious in other films - say that, this is probably likely as there were a lot of things in the film which seemed to be dumbed down - I'm certain younger audiences could have followed along with no problems. Having read the book I know that there was a lot more to the character and there was also a lot of information, interactions and characters missing. This makes me feel that the film is 'lite' version of the book. This film is actually darker than the first 'Da Vinci' film both thematically and aesthetically. My overall verdict is that this story had the potential to be better than the first film but it wasn't delivered because it felt watered down and quite obvious throughout. 6 out of 10. It was still a simple and brainless film to watch, it's not awful - but it's not outstanding either.",6,0,1,30 July 2018
Alien 3," Meh... aliens vs prisoner cell block H
","In a vain and desperate attempt to further extend the 'Aliens' cinematic universe, this third film feels a little rushed and under developed. In a true reflection of the 90's it's a lot of style over substance which unfortunately counts against the film, when held up against its excellent predecessors.Crash landing on planet Fiorina 161, Ripley is once again the sole survivor to escape from an Alien encounter - nee the last film. She finds that this planet is a male penitentiary/ mining colonized world so instantly she doesn't fit in, the lack of a penis being one of the main issues. While being held and supervised within the colony until a rescue ship is sent to collect her, strange things start to happen, mysterious deaths and random faults. It seems that an alien managed to get on-board the escape vessels that brought Ripley to the planet that Alien is slowly gaining size and strength as it works its way through the colony. Being part penitentiary there are no weapons on the planet yet survival is the aim at Ripley and the colony do their best to hold out until rescuers arrive.So why does this film not rate as highly as the first two films? That's a strange conundrum. The acting in the film is great, with so many gritty (and British) actors on display the only person that occasionally comes across as cheesy is at time Sigourney Weaver herself - but that's not because it's a bad performance, its more just a case that she stands out at an occasionally witty and upbeat American surrounded by so many hard faced and gritty male performances. The visuals likewise don't bring the film down, there are still moments of shock and horror, there are definitely scares, and nothing really looks out of place anywhere. Maybe the thing that brings the film down is actually the grittiness; it feels like a bleakness is been forced onto the audience. If the first two films gave the excitement of a chase with the potential to survive, this film tells you that there is nowhere to run and not a great deal you can do - almost like you have lost before you have started, and the only thing you can do is to prepare for the eventual doom. The pace and flow of the film also made enjoyment difficult - with director duties given to David Fincher this film relies on dialogue, but it seems that in attempt to deliver good dialogue action is sacrificed - which was a solidifying factor for the first two films. It's probably fair to say, if it wasn't for the first two films, this film as a stand-alone film would probably be received better - as it was though the expectation that was created after the first two films was let down in this film. Some bad decisions and bad ideas made the film a little sloppy - killing off fellow survivor at the very start of the film, the editing choices which cut up action when it needs to be explored further, a soundtrack that troughs and peaks at wrong times. Having enjoyed other Fincher films I find it difficult to put the blame onto him, he was working with a script and concept that wasn't his, you can see his input with the way the film feels bleak and gritty. Unfortunately you can also see the studio influence in the way that certain things need to be formulaically copied in order for audiences to like this, and that makes it feel like it isn't entirely an auteur driven ship - which could be part of the reason why it's choppy, editing isn't on tee, and the feel of the situation varies more than it should.I'd still give this a 6, but it is a massive drop in the franchise of Alien films and rather than add something to the cannon, it seems to weaken it's magnitude a little bit.",6,0,1,12 February 2020
Gremlins," 80s Christmas Horror cheesefest!
","A timeless classic! Boy gets pet, pet spawns evil monsters, boy and pet have to save town from monsters.It's Christmas, it's the 80's, it a small town in America with kooky residents where nothing ever goes wrong. Horror waits around the corner!Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is given a new pet at Christmas, a Mogwai - a cute little teddy bear of a creature. Looking after a Mogwai is simple as long as you adhere to 3 simple rules; keep it away from bright light, don't get it wet, and don't feed it after midnight. One by one the rules are broken, resulting in the Mogwai multiplying, creating evil copies of itself; which gradually turn from cute fuzzy little creatures, into scaly and slimy monsters with a penchant for chaos and destruction. Before the town knows what's happening it's overrun with Gremlins, and thus the horror is in full swing. Supported by his love interest Kate (Phoebe Cates), Billy and his Mogwai (he's names it Gizmo) have to stop the Gremlins and save the town.This is a fun film and because it's staged over in the festive period you are likely to encounter it year after year. I originally watched this as a child in the 80's and unless modern children have become really soft this is a film which is likely to entertain and not cause an offense. The scariest part, the pantomime villain, is probably old Mrs Deagle who wants to put Billy's dog 'to sleep'. Some of the effects and animatronics look a little dated now, but they still look a little better than some of the expensive CGI that's pushed on us today. It's simple, charming, entertaining, and much like the people in the film who are watching nostalgic black and white movies in the background as they enjoy Christmas, this film is one day going to be the nostalgic film in the background as you enjoy Christmas.A typical 80's family comedy horror film, Joe Dante's film is fun for the family. 8 out of 10.",8,2,3,12 February 2020
Iron Man 3," The sequel Iron Man should have had
","In the third instalment from the Iron Man films Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) finds his world torn apart and demons from his past come back to haunt him. In a time before the Iron Man tech Tony's ego forces him to stand-up some advancing, if not amateur, scientists who are making advances in their own fields, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). Who would have thought that in years to come they would end up working together to try and bring Stark and the world to it's knees. Of course Tony doesn't know this until the later parts of the film, initially his attention is on bringing down the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a terrorist leader who is hell bent on destruction and revenge. Working with the Iron Patriot (the painted re-branded War machine) (Don Cheadle) he attempts to bring the Mandarin down and serve justice. While all this is going on Tony is fighting new demons and anxieties which are a result of the incidents of the Avengers movie, it seems going through a worm hole in space has left him changed slightly. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is now running Stark industries and a reformed Killian (when he tried meeting Stark in the flashback at the start of the film, he was suffering a disability) meets with her to try and get Stark Industry backing for his Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM) project 'Extremis' which harnesses the brains power to alter DNA. Meanwhile Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is seriously injured in a blast, its up to Tony to investigate this, which is a good idea as the investigation will help to uncover Killian's plot and also who the Mandarin really is and what his intentions are. This is a really good film, I prefer this over the second Iron Man. There is a good pace to the film and it isn't all about action but there is some mystery and suspense thrown in too. There are times when Stark has to rely on his own ability away from the Iron Man suit which is an interesting story because he has to overcome his demons at the same time. The action that is in the film crescendo's at the climax and is a beautiful spectacle, almost operatic as all the suits that Stark has been building all meet in one location. It's like a opera or classical score building and building till everything goes off at the end. The action is tasteful and the CGI isn't off-putting at all. The cast are all strong in this, they are believable throughout. If I were to single one weak link out it would be Kingsley as the Mandarin. His performance is good of course, but the Mandarin character isn't written well and is nothing like the maniacal mastermind of the comic's. While the character isn't done well here I have read various forums to suggest that the real Mandarin will be in future Iron Man films and this showing is a divertive introduction. This is the sequel that Iron Man should have had, it's much better than the 2nd film and brings together all the chemistry that a great cast give and mixes it with a good story, actions, thrills, spills, mystery and suspense. This is a darker film than the second, and the first for that matter, with Stark having to deal with demons he thought were in the past which affect his current life and happiness. This works both as a standalone movie and also as part of the Iron Man series of films, it also adds more substance to the 2nd Avengers film. Billed as a summer blockbuster this film lived up to the hype and then some. 8 out of 10 from this reviewer.",8,0,1,16 May 2016
The Maze Runner," Decent teen action
","Waking up on a lift, with no memory, Thomas is thrown into a world where everything seems wrong. He meets a handful of other young boys who also appear to have very little memory beyond than the lift. Thomas has to make a life living between the peaceful glade he finds himself in, and a maze which is full of cyborg 'Grievers' who hunt anyone who goes into the maze. He learns that a new boy appears on the lift every couple of weeks - he isn't the first, and he wont be the last. It seems though that the maze is the only prospect of escape from the glade where they are trapped. As they start to get on with life everything is suddenly flipped on it's head when a young girl appears on the lift one day.Plenty of young stars who have been in a scattering of decent films already, and I'm sure they will be seen in other films too. This is a nice adventure film which often has bursts of high octane. Some questions are answered as the film advances, some are left covered up, building up for a definite sequel or two. Based on a book by James Dashner this is a decent film which will entertain and keep you hooked.Happy to give this 7 out 10. Hopefully the sequels are able to maintain the momentum in a time where teens vs adults/the world films seem to be in abundance.",7,0,0,12 June 2020
Captain Marvel," Could be better, but still not terrible
","In the already large list of superhero films which have been gracing the big screen between 2010 - 2020, the MCU brings its latest origin story, Captain Marvel. Taking place before the events of pretty much all of the previous MCU films (apart from of course Captain America), Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) used to be a test pilot in the American military, she doesn't really remember that though as she has a new life on a strange planet far across the universe. Living with the Kree she is being groomed by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) in an elite Starforce Military. When a mission takes an unexpected twist she finds herself working with two enemies, the Skrull and Humans. As the journey advances and Danvers grows she begins learning things about her past, things that lead her to realise that there is a lot more to her than she's being told by the Kree race that saved her.This film as a whole is fairly entertaining, nothing spectacularly new to cinema, but still a good yarn to pass away some time. Having a central female lead was important to the MCU to show diversity in their universe of characters. Brie Larson does good, without really being outstanding, she shows a good range of emotions and delivers a generally believable performance. The rest of the cast actually do well too, notably Jude Law. I haven't ever really been a big Jude Law fan but in this he makes a good bad guy that I was happy to buy into.The pace of the film is decent, at times it can be a little slow, but that tends to be as story is uncovered. With Danvers not really knowing her past there are notable moments where she needs to take stock of things, and these moments tend to slow the film down, but are acceptable as the action in the film is strong enough to keep the audience engaged. As well as the action and adventure element of the film its packed with fun and humour too. There are nods to other things in the MCU and 90's culture (in which decade the film is based). The humour tends to be driven by Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg's characters who somewhat resemble and odd couple cop due in most of the 90's films I grew up with. In comparison to a lot of other superhero films there is a lot of CGI, however this is an accepted trope to superhero films. What I would say is that at no point did this look too cheesy and forced though.All in all I enjoyed the film but it wasn't something that I think will change cinema or the MCU - it was a good middle of the road film and a good way for Marvel to introduce a strong female character to its movie franchise. 6 out of 10.",6,1,1,12 February 2020
Iron Man 2," Has he lost his mind? Can he see or his he blind?
","This is the second film in the Iron Man series (in case the title didn't give you that info), directed again by John Favreau and starring Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. With the world now aware of Tony Stark and his Iron Man suit, he has to deal with his own demons as well as a world who fears and craves his technology. A vengeful mad man with ties to the Stark dynasty surfaces to try and take Stark down. Ivan Vanko (Micky Rouke) is Whiplash, aided by Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who himself envies Stark's success and genius, is tasked with bringing Stark down. Stark has to deal with Whiplash, Justin Hammer, the US Military, a mystery man called Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who thinks that Stark has a lot to offer the world, and Stark's own demon's and doubts. All the usual's are there; Gwyneth Paltrow is Pepper Potts, Clark Gregg is Agent Coulson, John Slattery is Howard Stark in various flashbacks, Garry Shandling plays Senator Stern again and Paul Bettany once again voices Jarvis. This time around Don Cheadle plays 'Rhodey' Rhodes (War Machine), and Scarlett Johansson, makes an appearance as the story progresses as Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) giving a glimpse of what her character is going to bring to a future Avengers film - sexy but deadly. My own personal opinion is that this 2nd film is definitely as glitzy and action packed as the first film and is a good sequel, but, the story doesn't seem as strong. The story takes place almost straight after the first film with many of the conversations/ actions a direct reflection of events of the first film. To me this felt like Iron Man 1.5 rather than an Iron Man 2 but I still enjoyed it as a movie in its own rights. Robert Downey Jr once again demonstrates why he was born to play this role, he is both believable and lovable. I can't fault any of the casting or acting. The CGI is tastefully done and only adds to the on screen spectacle being played out. The pace of the film is like a mild jog with the occasional sprint to keep things interesting. I'm awarding this 7 out of 10. I enjoyed the film and it tickled my taste buds for more to come from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7,0,1,13 May 2016
Alien: Resurrection," When alien hillbilly cousins mate - a ugly mess is born
","Dear oh dear or dear - Sad face.What the hell happened?What was that?What did they do to it?Those were just some of the things that I thought after watching this film. There were more things I was wondering, but such expletives would get me banned from reviewing films on here so I can't write them. This was slightly annoying, slightly horrible and a bit weak too.So, 200 years after Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself for the good of humanity to make sure Aliens didn't become a menace to the universe, she is reborn. A clone of her is created in order to extract the Alien that she was carrying. In recreating her, the alien she was carrying is also recreated. Unfortunately as they both share one body the DNA gets a little mixed up and they both become part of each other. The ship where she was created is attacked by hijackers/ protesters/ smugglers and becomes unstable subsequently freeing aliens. She forced into teaming up in order to survive, in teaming up she learns information that puts her in a conflicting position that tests her allegiances.Amongst some of the other questions I had were; why contain aliens with acid for blood, in containers that aren't acid proof? Why have autopilot sequences that return the ship to earth the minute the aliens escape? What is plan B for emergencies - or is plan B just run for your life and hope to escape? Also, Winona Ryder - why? In the world of sequels this feels like 'Batman and Robin' - it's almost cartoon and colourful in its appearance, it contains stupid segments that add nothing to the plot or universe, and it might as well have nipples on the alien suit (a-la Batman). Sure there are worse film in the world, but for a franchise that had so much potential in the first films and in novels and comics - this is served up as a lite version of aliens which looks like it's just there to gross some money from fans willing to pay for anything Alien related. It's formulaic; it's ill-conceived, woefully executed. Maybe as stand-alone film you find on the Sy-Fy or Horror channel this works, in the franchise of Alien films, not. 5 out of 10 is a bit kind but this review has found me on a good day.",5,1,2,12 February 2020
Blade," Vampires, Actions, thrills, spills, horror and fun. Before there was an Iron Man, there was a Blade.
","This is a Marvel comics inspirited film from before the Marvel Universe films got big like they are today, it follows Blade, the 'day walker'. Played by Wesley Snipes, Blade, was born a half breed human-vampire cross, all the strengths of a vampire and none of their weaknesses. Before entering the world his pregnant mother was bitten by a vampire and as she's dyeing in hospital from the Vampire bit Blade is born, this origin is explained right at the start of the film so that the audience is in no doubt how he came to be. Now an adult Blade is fighting Vampires with the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who saved Blade from himself and from becoming a Vampire himself when he was a child living on the streets. Together they fight the cause with Blade doing the dirty work and Whistler providing the tech and back up. Blade's only weakness is 'the hunger', the vampiric need to consume blood which he keeps under control by periodically injecting himself with a serum. The film follows Blade dealing with a rebellious uprising within the Vampire community. After saving Dr Karen Jensen (N'Bushe Wright) from a Vampire attack Blade becomes aware that a plan is unfolding in the Vampire community who up until then have generally remained quiet and discreet as a community who lives side by side with humans without them knowing. Deacon Frost (played by Stephen Dorff) is trying to become all powerful despite the Vampire orders express wishes. He is part of a new order, not born a Vampire but turned into one, keeping his human characteristics which include greed and the need to be all powerful. He has stumbled onto some old literature which talks about the Blood God/Demon. Believing he can invoke the demon Frost sets his plans in motion but he is one ingredients short of success, the day-walkers (Blade's) blood.This is a thoroughly enjoyable film and in my opinion is probably the best I have seen Snipes on screen, I even like Dorff, thinking about it I can't recall many other stand out films that Dorff has done before or after this. The plot and script are straight out of the comic world and such are punchy, dramatic and humorous at times. The effects in this film are great, from the way the fight scenes unfold to the way that the vampires meet their demise. The film is dark more often than not but that's because of the nature of the subject and vampires not particularly liking daylight - this is one of Blade's strengths so there are daytime shots too, don't worry. The soundtrack to the film is fantastic, a lot of thought went into making both the film and the musical score fast paced and exciting and it really worked. Other actors in the film hold their roles well from Kristofferson playing grumpy Whistler, to others like ex-porn star turned actress Traci Lords and Donal Logue as the cock-sure vampire Quinn. If you haven't seen the film and you like action, adventure, a bit of horror, comics, heroes, or vampires then you should enjoy the movie. Although it was a moderate success at launch it become a cult favourite and has since spawned two more sequels bot of which maintain the look and feel of this film.I'm awarding this 8 out of 10.",8,2,4,8 April 2016
Chicken Run," Poultry in motion
","This is the tale of chickens who want to change their fate. Instead of ending up as the content of a chicken pie, they dream of freedom and growing old in peace and harmony. One day, Rocky the cockerel flies into their enclosure, Ginger, Bunty, Babs and the other chickens see this as their opportunity to learn how to fly so they can escape the evil Mrs Tweedy.Filmed using Claymation (is that the right term?) like 'Wallace and Gromit' or 'Morph' this is a charming feature length film which mirrors a World War 2 prisoner of war style film - think the great escape, just with playdoh chickens. It's littered with stars too; Mel Gibson voices Rocky, while some of Britain's finest voices lend their vocal chords to the supporting cast, including Julia Sawalha, Phil Daniels, Jane Horrocks, Miranda Richardson, Imelda Staunton and Timothy Spall to name a few.I got dragged to watch this at the cinema by a girlfriend in the 90's and I really wanted to hate it. I swore that I wouldn't enjoy it, and I would rather have watched 'Species' which was being shown at the same cinema. I have to confess that I ended up enjoying it, and if history has taught me something, 'Chicken Run' has outlasted 'Species' for its timeless charm and entertainment. This is family fun at its finest as it has something for audiences young and old. I totally understand that this kind of film isn't for everybody, but if you stop for a moment and at least give it a try like I had to, you probably will find some fun in this.Queue the chicken themed puns.... This is an eggcelent movie which flows beautifully and never misses a chick - you could say its poultry in motion. If you fall fowl of watching, you'll be making clucking stupid decision. Eggs pecked to be entertained, laugh at some of the yolks, hen fowl in love with the characters in the charming film. (Ok, I'm done now) 7 out of 10 from me.",7,0,0,12 February 2020
Terminator Salvation," oooh, a prequel sequel, or is it a sequel prequel?
","In the grand scheme of Terminator films this is a weird one, possibly because it isn't an out and out rehash of a time travelling story as suggested in the 3 previous films. To start off with we witness a death row convict, Marcus Wright, being put to death. He wakes up and find that everything is different. He's in a wasteland and machines seem to be killing off all traces of humanity they find. He helps and befriends a couple of kids, one of them a young Kyle Reece (who you may know from the first Terminator film becomes the father of John Conner after he goes back in time). The kids are captured for termination leading Marcus to search for them. He ends up running into a resistance fighter who convinces him to go and meet the leader of the resistance, John Conner. An accident occurs which shows everybody that Marcus isn't quite what he thought he was - spoiler, he a half-man half-robot hybrid. Meanwhile, the resistance have a new weapon in their arsenal, a radio signal which can turn machines off - if it truly works then the resistance could bring Skynet down for good.Despite the negativity in reviews, I really enjoyed this film, more than Terminator 3 in fact. It's a good addition to the franchise and it looks at things in a new way rather than rehashing old stories. This film sets itself in the future, which the antics of the previous films were fighting against. It's dark and its bleak, humanity is indeed on its last legs - if you have ever played the Fallout video games, it's that kind of a landscape. The film as a whole feels like what the first Terminator film promised the future would be like. There is an element of trying to 'save the present to save the past which saves the future which helps the present' (don't get too confused), but it's done in a way that works out and adds to cannon. The cast all do a fine job, albeit my biggest criticism is casting Christian Bale as John Connor which I found a little off putting at times - frankly I'd have been happier with an unknown playing this role, but Bale still delivers a good performance. Sam Worthington is central vehicle to the film and was happy to follow his story and actions, I found him to be an emotive and compelling character in the film. While T3 almost parodies itself by continually nodding to previous films, this treats itself as an action film and doesn't try to be tongue in cheek, which works. There is a moment for the Arnie loyalists - and it's done a tasteful way which makes the T800 series seem like the baddest of the bad Terminator units there is.I thoroughly enjoyed this outing and feel that this is more deserved of a place in the Terminator franchise than the previous T3 film. For me, this gets 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,12 February 2020
Deadpool 2," Your favourite 'merc with a mouth' returns to learn about feelings
","Ryan Reynolds is back as the wise cracking 'merc with a mouth' in Deadpool 2. The first film established the origin of the titular hero so this one didn't need to go into too many explanations - it shows what's been happening since the first film, and then goes off on its own adventure. An event happens at the start of the film which disrupts Wade Wilson's life. Throw in the introduction of Cable - played by John Brolin, who's own story arc crashes into Deadpool's and you have a mayhem fueled adventure which features all the action, comedy and drama that you'd expect. Comic-book fans can expect to see characters and concepts they are familiar with from print - Cable, Domino (played excellently by Zazie Beetz), Weasel (TJ Miller), Blind Al, Black Tom, Colossus, Juggernaught, Shatterstar, Bedlam, teleportation, time-hopping, future timelines, breaking the 4th wall. Fans of the film version of Deadpool, likewise won't be disappointed with familiar characters, established jokes continuing (the X-Men mansion for example), action slo-mo's, elaborate stunts and gross out humour, visual vileness, chaos, easter eggs, and a ridiculous body count - oh yeah, keep an eye (and ear) open for celebrity cameo's and see how many of them manage to stay alive till the end of the film. I was secretly hoping for an appearance by Nathaniel Essex (Mr Sinister), after it had been hinted in 'X-Men - Apocalypse' and 'Logan', and seeing as the Russell was living at Essex House AND cable was carrying around a teddy-bear (which is actually explained - although I'd hoped it was a nod to one of the famous Cable/Deadpool cross over comic events) - this hope for a Mr Sinister appearance is just my inner nerd projecting and it seems that we may get an X-Force which may or may not get a Mr Sinister - eek! The other hope I had was to see Lady Death, but it's probably too early in Deadpool's life (and death) to become obsessed with her yet, besides, Brolin as the Mad Titan Thanos in Avengers isn't doing the whole infinity gauntlet thing for Lady Death either - so would we realistically see her in Deadpool's life (I mean death) yet. For the time being Vanessa is still Vanessa, so Lady Death isn't a key player for Wade yet - I'm getting ahead of myself.I enjoyed this film, I was amazed to find that before I knew it, the film was ending and my disbelief had been suspended from start to finish. I laughed along and geeked out throughout, and I bloody loved the end credits - especially putting things right!! Some people have suggested that this sequel isn't as good as the first film because it has some similar situations and set up's despite a massive budget (which the first film didn't have), I didn't find this issue though - if you go to see Jurassic Park 2 or 3 you want dinosaurs, or if you see a James Bond film you expect one-liners and gadgets - so by that logic if you go to see a Deadpool film you expect vulgar lewdness, action, and gross out/ tongue in cheek humour. If you expect anything less then you are going to the wrong film. A total end to end fun experience had, I'd happily watch this again and recommend this to my friends, with the caveat that it's not for all ages mind. Like the first film this gets a good rating from me - 9 out of 10. Thanks.",9,1,2,2 July 2018
Ready Player One," Virtual Easter Egg hunters hunting Easter Eggs virtually
","It's 2045, the future is one where people spend more time living in a virtual reality simulation (called Oasis), than they do witnessing the real world around them. The creator of the Oasis, James Halliday (Mark Rylance) dies, but before doing so, leaves a challenge for players within the Oasis. The challenge is to find 3 hidden Easter eggs - keys, which would award the successful player with control of the Oasis and the fortune built up from the majority shares that Halliday had. Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) is one of the players and a massive fan of Halliday, he figures out how to get the first key. Sharing the information with his friends, they all embark on a virtual adventure to try and get the other keys before a megalomaniacal corporation IOI get them and ruin the Oasis for their own wealth and benefit.This Spielberg film is epic, both visually appealing and a decent (albeit cliché and predictable) story. It combines a lot of pop culture mediums into one movie; from video games, to films, from board games to music - if youth culture has embraced something, a nod to it is featured in this film. I asked myself though, do the references to different pop-cultures alienate some of the audience - I'm a mega nerd but there were some things in the film that got passed me. Thankfully, despite its visual complexity, the story was almost formulaic for a Spielberg film (even if the film was based on a book). Even if you don't get the references you can still follow the story and get some enjoyment from it.The cast were all decent, but they only evoked the same level of emotions from me as an audience member, as they portrayed on screen - which wasn't a massive array of emotions to say the least. At times in fact, some of the acting was almost wooden.I can only give this 7 out of 10 I'm afraid, and that's purely for the nostalgia is occasionally invoked and the beautiful scenery imagined. Sure the film was decent, but the fact that I wrote decent and not amazing tells me that I have seen better and I have seen worse. All in all, an average film which looked good but was a little undeveloped on brains and emotions.",7,2,4,31 January 2019
The Hateful Eight," Not the best Western or Tarantino film
","What do you get if you cross a Tarantino script, a western theme, and a cast of top actors? The answer is the hateful eight. I've seen a lot of 1 star reviews and some 10 star reviews but I'm afraid I sit somewhere in the middle. Before delving into my review I'll get a few points across: (1) this is not your typical western film - this is not akin to a Sergio Leone classics you may have seen. Don't expect roving shots of stark but beautiful scenery, don't expect massive gun fights or duels at noon. It's western in style, appearance and story but not much else beyond that, it'd be more likely to be seen as a stage based murder mystery transformed into a film. (2) this is not an action film, there is action but not what you would expect from a western film; in fact you'd have to wait about an hour and half for the first bit of gunfire. (3) the plot isn't complex - you could edit this down to about half an hour and make a good film but instead this film is closer to 3 hours with long drawn out lead ups. Granted the actions within the film are representative of metaphors for the American civil war and it's futility, but unless you are interested in that branch of history they'll be lost and frankly I didn't care and probably missed loads. (4) the script isn't exciting; the characters take an eternity to develop and there isn't really a likable character throughout, in a way all the characters are bad guys - but maybe sympathising with a bad guy is what Tarantino wanted. This is by no stretch of the imagination the best Western film you will ever see, but it's Tarantino's take on the genre, which will be more suited to modern audiences who like bloodshed and bad language rather than the generation brought up on westerns. There was an element of racism in the film which made me feel slightly uncomfortable. I realise it was intended to be more authentic of the age but how many times can the characters say the N word in a film? Tarantino's previous film Django Unchained seemed to overuse it too but that could be forgiven as the underlying theme of the film dealt with slavery so it didn't feel as offensive, this film on the other hand didn't seem to give a damn and was happy to overuse words to hammer home offence. The pointless interracial homosexual oral rape scene was less offensive than some of the derogatory language used just because it could. Like other Tarantino films this film is split into chapters - each which help the audience focus on key events which ultimately contribute towards the final climax of the movie. I understand that the chapters help control the narrative drive and timing of the film but it feels a little bit overdone now, how dumb must an audience be if they don't know how to interpret time and causality in the film? In the film 4 people with different motivation find themselves on a stagecoach heading for Minnie's haberdashery, which is serving as a stop off to escape a blizzard on the way to Red Rock. Waiting for them at the haberdashery are 5 more people all with their own reasons for being there. It's important not to believe anything you don't see or hear yourself, it's more of a murder mystery remember. The real mystery begins the moment the doors are closed, where is Minnie and what connects all 9 strangers?! Yes, there are 9 people so why the title suggests a hateful eight isn't clear until later in the film. Not fun, not his best film, almost like it was made because it could be made rather than to deliver a message or suspend audiences disbelief. 7 out of 10 stars.",7,1,7,19 January 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Doing whatever a spider can
","This Spiderman movie brings the titular web-head under Marvel Studios and into the Marvel Cinematic Universe - finally!After a cameo with other avengers (see Captain America 3 - Civil War) young Peter Parker, still coming to grips with his ability, looks to develop and grow under the tutelage of Iron Man a.k.a. Tony Stark. Off the back of the wreckage that previous Marvel/Avenger films have left, Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes works to clean up the country by dismantling alien technology. After he is forced out of business he goes it alone (with a band of merry henchmen) collecting tech and transforming it into an arsenal he can utilize to get rich. Spiderman accidentally stumbles upon his plans and is forced to put a stop to it, while trying to keep his identity, his friends and his countrymen safe from harm. Tom Holland picks up the mantle of Peter Parker for this movie and for me nails his performance moreso than the on-screen Spidermen that have gone before him. He comes across as neurotic and paranoid which for me is an accurate portrayal of the web-head which has kept comic fans happy for years. Spiderman isn't an out and out superhero, he's more delicate and geeky than that, he's more of a friendly neighborhood Spiderman. Opposing Spiderman, Keaton's portrayal of Toomes is gritty, nasty and evil. It works brilliantly and Keaton has managed to go from superhero (Batman) to super villain like not many actors before him. There are elements and portrays of characters in this film which aren't strictly true to the comic book roots but they didn't stand out as off putting so hardcore comic fans should be comfortable still. As you'd expect with a Marvel studio's film there is a lot of fun in this film, mixed with action, adventure and humour. Visually the film is sharp and engaging and the soundtrack is very complimentary. This is a solid addition to the MCU and is a fun and family friendly film to enjoy. It would have been easy to reboot the whole thing again but instead of doing the whole 'origins' story again the film assumes the audience is clever enough to know who Spiderman is and jumps more or less straight into a story, bravo on this, if I'd have seen another origin story I think I'd have been bored. Instead this is a 133 min's of pure fun. Sit back and enjoy!",8,1,5,8 August 2017
The Bodyguard," and IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-E-IIIIIII.... don't really like this over rated film
","Starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, who were both at the height of their star power this film is about a diva singer and her bodyguard. When Rachel (Houston) Marron's life is threatened, Frank Farmer (Costner) is hired to defender her. He is ex-secret service and she's a world famous pop tartlet. To co-exist they and survive they develop a special bond. This film looks at the relationship and all the drama along the way, as well as following the murder plot to take Rachel down and how Costner plans to thwart it. I have to admit, I wasn't really a fan, maybe it's because it's a blatant chick flick - or maybe it's the soundtrack song by Whitney Houston that makes me shudder every time I hear it - putting me off the film. The plot isn't that complex and there isn't really any sexual tension or chemistry between the two stars - which is a surprise as the whole premises is the whole 'will they/wont they', 'do they/ don't they' between the two potential lovers. They aren't that engaging as characters and I didn't care less what happened to them throughout the film. Where Houston and Costner are authentic is in their individual persona delivery - Costner is supposed to be fairly dull and bland - which I believe; and Houston is supposed to be a bratty diva - which I could also have believed. This felt more like a vehicle for Houston's vocal talent than a real attempt at a film. Overrated and not my cup of tea. I can't say it's a terrible film as some production value has gone into it and at least it's got a linear enough narrative to follow. 4 out of 10 from me.",4,0,3,27 July 2018
Blade II," Blade is back
","Blade (Wesley Snipes) is back, bringing his unique vampire hunting skills to a new scenario. You may remember that in the last film Whistler (Kristofferson) appeared to be killed off, well the audience was deceived and he wasn't killed off. Blade is doing his job while looking for clues to find his old friend. Filling Whistlers role at home with Blade is Scud (Norman Reebus), a young wannabe cool kid who enjoys making vampire slaying equipment and watching powerpuff girls while toking on a big fat spliff. Blade finds Whistler and attempts to detox him. All of a sudden Black Ops vampires (Leonor Varela a.k.a. Nyssa, and Danny John Jules a.k.a. Asad) infiltrate Blade's base of operations with a message from the vampire overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). Blade and his merry gang of slayers agree to meet the Vampire overlord who tells them that a mutant vampire strain is making a new breed, dubbed Reapers. The only way to stop the mutation is to kill his alpha carrier Nomak (Luke Goss, who is great BTW), killing him will kill all the reapers he has created as they are linked via blood. Blade begrudgingly agrees to join the Black Ops Vampire team, a.k.a. The Bloodpack which features random vagabond bad-add vampires such as Reinhart (Ron Perlman), Priest (Tony Curren) and Lighthammer (Daz Crawford). Working with Vampires to bring down a mutant vampire lets Blade be exposed to the real underground Vampire world, his hope is that working with the vampires will allow him to learn enough about them to bring them all down in the future. And so, the epic journey and battle begins. This film goes a long way to better the first Blade film and it actually does it in parts. The main gripes in this for me are Whistlers return after being killed in the first film, the overuse of obvious CGI in some of the fight scenes with Blade, and the obvious plot twist which is looming with Scud. Apart from those things the film is actually more mayhem and chaos than the first film which actually works really well. Despite it working good as a comic-book fan this isn't the Blade I'm used to, there are obvious attempts at humour and puns within the film which isn't Blade, but unless you are a comic purist like me you'll probably enjoy it. The origin story is featured in the film again (directly stolen from the first film) so you do not have to have seen the first film to work out where Blade comes from and how he got his powers. I enjoyed this film, maybe not as much as the first film because that had charm and style mixed with a good plot and dialogue. As an action film though this film excels beyond the first film, I just think there was more potential that could have been milked from this. Blade's relationship with Nyssa maybe or using the member of the bloodpack more - bearing in mind Donnie Yen (Snowman) has a lot of experience in the martial arts combat choreography featured throughout this film. All in all though Guilllermo Del Torro has made a great film which fits nice in the series of Blade films or works as a standalone. Like the first the musical score is upbeat and pacey much like the film. 7 out of 10",7,0,0,8 April 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A modern film with a twist of retro themes and cold wars
","The Captain is back, and this time he's in the present. While the first film dealt with a back-story/ origin you may remember that at the end of the film Roger's is brought into the future after being frozen in ice for some 50-60 years. A lot has happened in that time and in between films you'll have to make the assumption that he has been debriefed and brought up to speed on the world which has changed significantly. If you search online you'll find a nice chronological viewing order so you know how to watch the films and where they sit on a chronological list; for the purpose of this lets say that the events of the first Avengers film have unfolded, as have all the Iron Man films and just before this Cpt America film Thor 2's events have also occurred. In this film you kind of get some of the fallout of those prior events (Shield is taking a lot of stick for events in the Avengers movie as well as the Iron Man films and is getting pressured to be safer and strong with controls in place) as well as things that spill out of Cpt America's past from the first film. Steve has a lot to catch up on and just when he's making friends (The Falcon) and finding his feet in the modern world Nick Fury is killed by an assassin working for Hydra. In fact Hydra have infiltrated Shield and parts of the American (and World) government so who can Cpt America rely on. Trusting nobody it's up to Rogers, Widow and Falcon to try and stop the assassin called the Winter Soldier and save the world, even when it looks like they are on the wrong side of justice because Hydra has infiltrated and corrupted most of the ruling bodies. The stars of the first film and other recent Marvel films all deliver credible performances, that's Evans as Cpt America, Samuel L. Jackson as Fury, and Johansson as Black Widow. Introducing Widow into this film was clever as it allowed an emotional probe and outlet for Rogers, typical of a man from the 30/40's he's very private and doesn't let his emotions out, he is absolutely a man out of time, using Black Widow to help convey his hidden pain was very effective and gives the characters an additional layer of depth. I have to mentioned Sebastian Stan for his performance in this film, he's still Bucky Barnes but he's also the Winter Soldier and as a brainwashed assassin he does really well and suits the role. Anthony Mackie is introduced as Sam Wilson/ Falcon and makes a decent first showing. Cobie Smulders works well as Maria Hill and I am expecting more great things from her to come. Frank Grillo (Brock Rumlow) lays decent foundations for a role which is set to get bigger if you recognise his name from the comics. Toby Jones (Dr Zola) is just as creepy in this as he is in the first film despite not making a physical appearance. I enjoyed this film as much, if not more than the first Cpt America film and other MCU films. It showed lots of clever depth with it's plots and sub-plots all unfolding at once and laid some great foundations for the 3rd Cpt America film which is set to put a 'cat amongst the pigeons'. This film is fast paced and very clever. It uses themes used throughout film and politics in the 60's, 70's and 80's including paranoia, secret societies and agendas, world domination, cold wars, and so on. This is not just a superhero movie but also a spy/action film with romance, heartache, reflection and ultimately a heart. 8 out of 10",8,0,1,10 May 2016
Doctor Strange," A decent intro in the shape of an origin film - more to come next time?
","This film is Marvel's cinematic introduction (or reintroduction if you believe that the 1978 film should be counted as the first outing - although that was before Marvel Studies was a thing) to a long-time favourite character of comic nerds everywhere, Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange is the master of mystical arts and one of the Marvel Universes most powerful people. More than just a magician or a wizard, he controls powers that affect time and space as in this existence and others. Like other movies, this is an origin story to introduce him. It accounts his story from being one of the world's finest surgical physicians who loses his skills in a freak car accident, to becoming a master of mystical arts and protector of Earth. Being a superhero film you'd already expect a lot of CGI, throw in the magical element and you know that nearly every scene will be CGI'd. Threat not though, for the most part it's actually tastefully done. There are some beautiful scenes in the city reminiscent of 'Inception', there are some wonderfully choreographed fight scenes too, and wit and humour is never far away from the screen. Some film's feel like they need the central character to grow up and become an adult with responsibilities in order for the film to advance. This feels the opposite, while Strange is a responsible adult at the start of the film he needs to relax and let go in order to be victorious. Perfect for what doubters and Marvel haters need to go through to watch something like this unreservedly without pre-judgements. If a man of science and medicine had to believe in magic in order to accept what his eyes and ears were telling him, then I'm sure cinema goers will be okay to sit and watch this for the joy of cinema rather than ulterior motives. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the Doctor and his portrayal, while a little wooden and void of emotional attachment at times, it was exactly how I'd image Strange being on screen when being plucked from the pages of a comic. I'm a fan of Mads Mikkelsen in general, I think his demeanour is very powerful, he is believable as the villain Kaecilius and I only wish there was potential to be in future films. Oops, nearly a spoiler. OK, so the story is a little formulaic, but it has to be, it's an origin story. The central character was X, then Y happens, now he has to cope with Y if he wants to be Z. It's simple sure, but at least this film had the manners not to pretend it was something it was not. It's a simple and fun film with visual treats that won't offend. I couldn't rate this as highly as other Marvel film's I've watched, but I'm not worried about that either. I know that this is an origin, we'll see Doctor Strange in other things soon, the next film, I'm sure will be better than this - but for now, I say decent introduction, 6 out of 10.",6,1,1,23 July 2018
The Lost City of Z," Floating down a river watching beautiful scenery, but with no paddle to speed things up or make it interesting
","Starring Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattison, Tom Holland and Sienna Miller - this film is based on true life explorer Col. Percival Fawcett, who mysterious vanished while chartering the Amazon in the 1920's. Probably not as accurate as it could be both in script and content this film still had something about it which didn't offend me too much, and allowed me to get to the end of the film without too much trouble or anger. There wasn't as much depth to the film as I would have liked, I came away from the film having not learned much - it seemed to be just a vehicle to say 'hey look, there was this explorer dude who lived during times of conflict, and he managed to find things that other people couldn't and wouldn't'. It was beautiful looking film and maybe that, coupled with the delivery that Hunnam and Pattison brought that allowed me to just switch off and keep watching things unfold. I have to say, I'm not a fan of Hunnam or Pattison (or Miller either for that matter), I think they are unproven and over-hyped -but they actually delivered decent performances which didn't have me shouting at the screen, and at times made me root for their success. That's probably high praise, because the script they were working from was fairly bland, predictable and none engaging. This is a long film so if you do want to give it a try prepare for a numb bum - oh, and prepare for an ending that leaves more questions than answers.I'll give this 4 out of 10. Could have been better, but still not as awful as some of the reviews suggest.",4,1,3,8 March 2018
Ant-Man," Tiny hero with a big heart
","Another movie from the Marvel cinematic universe. This one is directed by Payton Reed and written by Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. Starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang and Michael Douglas as Dr Hank Pym. Scott Lang (Rudd) is a failure in life, he's fresh out of prison, he cant get a job and he's losing his family. He's convinced to do one more big job which will help him out of the slum he's in. Lang inadvertently stumbles upon and steals a super suit which when worn shrinks him down to the size of an ant, giving him the super senses and abilities of the insect too. It turns out that Pym (Douglas) has set Lang up and orchestrated the theft because he sees something in Lang which will help him. Corporate espionage and corruption is afoot, Pym's own company is being threatened and corrupted from the inside and Pym wants Lang to help put an end to it and prevent the bad guys from getting hold of his suit and his scientific advances. I didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as other Marvel films, truth be told even in the comic world I thought Pym and Lang were pretty lame and never truly enjoyed their story arcs. I think this film was done well though, Rudd played Lang as likable albeit unlucky and Douglas did well playing Dr Hank Pym. While not entirely true to the comic books this film was a good introduction to Pym and Lang and is well worth a watch. There is a brief mention of Pym's wife Janet Van Dyne who was one of the original Avengers like Pym was (keep an eye open in 2018 for a follow up to this penned as 'Ant-man and The Wasp'). Van Dyne was the Wasp to Pym's Ant Man/ Giant Man/ Yellowjacket. In this film she is lost in space having shrunk to sub-sub atomic size with no way of getting back. On the topic of Yellowjacket, there is an interesting twist as the bad guy in this film is Yellowjacket which in the comics was an alter ego Pym took up in later story arcs. In this film the Yellowjacket is played by Corey Stoll's character Darren Cross, his corporate enemy. I won't go on about Yellowjacket though as I'm a Marvel fan and I don't want to be seen sulking about comic to film differences. It's funny and entertaining and packed with action. The CGI doesn't let the film down and the fight scenes where Ant Man is shrinking and growing all come across as exciting and creative. Even the giant ants (when Lang is in his shrunken state) look authentic enough). More of a family film than some of the other Marvel films with a pace which keeps you hooked but without breaking too much of a sweat. It's difficult to directly compare this to other Marvel movies as it feels fresh and unique in comparison. I'd absolutely recommend watching it as it makes a great way to pass the time. An easy 7 out of 10 for this.",7,0,2,6 April 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Re-imagining a retro icon
","This is the story of the first avenger, Cpt America. This film chronicles how Steve Rogers went from weedy wimpy kid from the Bronx to joining the army in 1942, and how he went through a super-soldier experiment to become the USA's greatest weapon during the second world war. Recruited by Dr Erskine to go through 'Project Rebirth' when nobody else thought he was able to make a difference for the war effort, we see a physical and emotional change in young Steve. Once he's turned into a weapon, the film shows how the army didn't know what to do with him, leaving him to make up his own mind to stand for truth, justice and freedom in a fight against a rogue Nazi villain, Johann Schmidt, a.k.a. The Red Skull. This is an origin story meant to show new audiences what Cpt. America is all about so threat not if you haven't read any comics, you can learn it all here. Chris Evans plays his role as Cpt America brilliantly, I liked him as Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movies but I think in Cpt. America he has found something better here. Hugo Weaving is a great Red Skull, menacing vocal delivery as well as appearance. You can literally feel the evil oozing from him at times. Hayley Atwell makes a brilliant Peggy Carter, so much so that she got a spin off TV series which is one of the better Marvel TV series. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes is believable, he lays a great foundation for future appearances yet to come. He's Steve Rogers best friend in the early days and always believes in him which is something that Rogers needs for strength. Tommy Lee Jones (Col. Phillips) should get a mention as he plays the hardened drill sergeant who doesn't want to get involved in super soldier experiments while at the same time secretly wanting it to succeed for the good of humanity. He plays both sides of that characteristic really well and believable. Dominic Cooper makes a suave Howard Stark, easily believable as Tony Stark's father in the already screened Iron Man films. While being full of his own self importance he also manages to be believable as a genius when his interests are peaked. The strength of his delivery made him a regular character in the Agent Carter TV series that Atwell stars in. Stanley Tucci (Dr Erskine) delivers a caring and hopeful performance as the father of the super soldier imitative. His demise (sorry for the spoiler) provides the motivation Steve Rogers needs to be more involved in fighting the bad guys. He's the conscience that Rogers can refer to throughout the film and his death feels almost like the passing of a real father. Toby Jones (Dr Arnim Zola) is creepy and threatening, I practically needed to have a shower after seeing how creepy he delivered his role. Neal McDonough (Dumb Dumb Dugan) plays true to the comic books as one of the Howling Commando's who fight alongside Cpt America, loud, brash and confident. All the cast actually deliver authentic performances and I can't single out a weak casting in this film. While the film isn't a direct reflection of the comic books I didn't find that distracting, like the many multi-verses I just tell myself this is yet another re-imagining of the Marvel characters, in that sense it works. If you went into this expecting it to be exactly how the origin story worked in comic books then you may be disappointed. There are good mix between action and drama with a few giggles thrown in for good measure. The film is not too CGI heavy and has a certain look and feel which makes it come across as a great film. I really enjoyed this despite Cpt. America being one of my least favourite characters. I'm going to give this 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,10 May 2016
Oblivion," A fairly forgettable end of the world scenario
","A 2013 film by Neil Blomkamp featuring a future, post apocalyptic Earth and a defeated humanity. Planet Earth was attacked by Aliens and a war ensued. In order to win the war, humans had to lose the planet. They waged was with the aliens, launching nuclear warheads thus leaving Earth ravaged with radiation. The Plan B for humanity is the moon of Titan, humans have been shepherded off to survive there. Those who aren't already there are on a massive space ship just outside of Earth's atmosphere waiting to be taken. There is hardly any trace of human beings left on the planet. Two people that are still there are Jack and Victoria (Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough). They are maintaining drones and robotic equipment meant to take the last of the resources on Earth in order to allow humanity on Titan to prosper. They do their jobs and don't ask questions - they are an effective team. By night Jack is haunted by visions in his dreams but by day he risks life and limb maintaining equipment and dealing with scavengers, the left over aliens who have no hope of leaving Earth again. One day a human spaceship, the Odyssey, crash lands on earth, beckoned by a signal that the scavengers have set up in an old communications tower. This event changes everything and Jack soon starts thinking that not everything is as it seems and how he's been told. This was an enjoyable film albeit not that complex and surprising, I was able to guess the outcome and ending before it unfolded on screen. The cast are authentic but not that deep or complex, the most complex part of the make up was Jack's random dreams which sell the way the film is going. I haven't seen Andrea Riseborough in anything else and she was authentic and refreshing, the same applies for Olga Kurylenko (Julia). Morgan Freeman (Beech) plays the same character he usually does, intelligent but smart-mouthed. It's nice to see Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Sykes) not covered in dirt and blood (a-la Game of Thrones) but he comes across as bland and forgettable which was a pity. The film is all very straightforward and there is no disruption to the narrative or anybody who wants to question the situation. Even when uncovering the truth it's all very straight forward, nobody argues and they just accept what is being said. The big twist in the film is obvious and shouldn't surprise anyone. The saving grace for this film is backdrop and scenery, it shows Earth beauty despite some radiation ravaged landscapes. It reminded me a little of the kind of environment you'd expect to find in the game 'Fallout 3', the only things missing where the mutants and rad-scorpions. Despite being a big budget Hollywood film this felt almost second class and it isn't a film I'll remember in a few weeks time. The CGI was finely executed and the set was top notch and imaginative but with very little in the way of plot and story the film was never going to leave an everlasting mark on film history. This is one of the more light hearted post apocalypse films I have seen in recent years. A lot of style over substance I'm going to give this 6 out of 10 - not the worst film but definitely not living up to the potential it had.",6,0,3,11 April 2016
Baby Driver," Loves itself that much it should get a room with itself
","FTR this review does have spoilers - that's because I had a lot to write and get off my chest.Baby (Ansel Elgort) has somehow wronged (Kevin Spacey) Doc and to make up for it he is being used as a getaway driver, after all, he's the best there is (apparently). While this is generally okay as he's a damn good driver, it's also bad as it's exposing him to a world of crime and danger that a young man of his age shouldn't be exposed to. Baby is obsessed with music (he produces his own music), he has been since he was young, it also helps him cover a medical condition, he loves nothing more than dancing through life, whether it's putting a soundtrack to the crimes he's forced to support, caring for his deaf foster father, or falling for a local waitress. After all the hype and promos in the lead up to this I actually expected this to be an all singing and all dancing driving movie - unfortunately I wasn't blown away. The film was enjoyable and had some slick driving scenes, but it wasn't anything new, or exciting. The plot starts ok, but then quickly becomes pretty standard, before it becomes fairly dull and predictable. Some of the characters were weak and didn't feel convincing and some were just outright annoying, in some instances they drifted between delivery of emotions worse than Baby's lane discipline when outrunning the cops. I know it was supposed to be a 'car' movie rather than a character movie - but I'm afraid, for me, it was neither. Let's start with Baby himself, I found myself wanting to punch him in the throat at the start of the film for trying to be smug and cool - he's young, hip, music making, fast car driving, street dancing, free-running, caring, plucky and lucky (vomited yet?). Towards the end of the film I really wanted him to suffer on account of letting his foster dad suffer because he was too scared to step away from the criminal life, despite having the means and evidence to rat them all out, and for bringing Deborah into a world she didn't deserve (as well as just being a general jerk). I didn't feel sorry for him or his back story (dead parents), I didn't think he was sweet for trying to be caring, I didn't think he was enjoyable because he danced in the street to his own beat, I didn't care that he could drive well. Ansel Elgort did a damned fine job of disinteresting me and making me not give a monkey's. Next, Jamie Foxx, he played an out and out nasty piece of stuff in Bats, he's probably the second most featured person in this film so he gets a mention over anyone else. Frankly, he deserved what he got - and I was actually hoping for that outcome sooner in fact. He was the catalyst to everything going wrong but even before that he just upset my film taste-bud's, it was like he was acting out a 80/90's gangster stereotype - come on dude, hasn't society moved on?? Maybe the fact that he angered me so made his performance actually really good and I'm the idiot here?! Griff, JD, Flea pretending to be Flea, Buddy and Darling and others were neither here, nor there. At times they were just 'meh'. Even towards the end of the film when Baby is being hunted down by Buddy for Darling's eventuality (I didn't spoil it) - it didn't feel that passionate or driven. If anything I was surprised that he'd managed to escape soo many cops randomly, take multiple bullet-wounds, and still appear to walk, talk, and balk without trouble - he was a genuine superhero!! Doc is another example of giving mixed emotions; he's sinister, menacing and threatening all the way through the film, but then forgives Baby and sacrifices himself at the end of it (d'oh, I spoiled it). Some of the scenes had no relevance being featured and just ended up being stupid - buying guns from crooked cops, when they already had guns already - why would Doc send them with next to no info, especially with Bats and Baby - hell, why didn't he go himself?!?! Why make Baby 'scope' the post office when he looks guilty as sin, scared as hell and he's the getaway driver and does best off know nothing anyway?!? How stupid is it to find Doc still in the same office after every job, even when things go wrong - d'uh! The only character I felt emotional about (other than the hatred for Bats) was poor Deborah, she was fooled by a potential suiter who claims to be sweet, it turns out he's not as sweet as she was led to believe - loses her job, loses friendship of any colleagues she may have, gets exposed to violence and death, shot at, threatened, kills a man and then has to wait while the person she's fallen in love with spends time behind bars. And FTR, I didn't believe the chemistry between Deborah and Baby; it felt too rushed and unbelievable. They didn't appear infatuated enough to be convinced to run away together after just two or three conversations, in reality I wouldn't expect her to wait for him to be released from prison - but then hey, suspended disbelief and Hollywood ending so I suppose she would. I thought I'd feel sorry for Baby's foster dad he that felt like he was just there to meet a PC quote, he's black, old and disabled - well done, that gets a lot of ticks. I think the film had the potential to be really good, it had some decent action, it was modern and stylish with a good soundtrack - but it felt heartless due to its lack of character substance, and the quick degradation of an interesting plot. It felt to forced and too in love with its own hip-ness.
I haven't even written me discontent about this being a heist/getaway film yet - but I've got to stop writing now - this is making me angrier the more I type. Sorry, 4 out of 10.",4,1,4,17 July 2018
Justice League," Too rushed, looks cheap, no heart :(
","I'm afraid to say that this isn't the film I was expecting and it's not as spectacular as it was billed to be. I am not a hater of this film, nor am I a lover of this film - it's an average film which acts as a vehicle to get DC films on the map a little more, but doesn't do it with the spectacular grandeur that it could have done. Billed as the film to break Marvel Studio's successful grasp on Hollywood this had a lot to live up to, and I'm afraid it didn't work. The film felt rushed and cheap - which is a surprise as millions of dollars were spent on this. It felt like Warner Brothers desperately wanted to join the superhero party while it was hot and as a result HAD to put something out straight away, regardless of it was ready or not. It followed a familiar pattern set up in action films in general, FTR not just Marvel film patterns. It seemed to tick off cliché after cliché as if it was a formula for instant success. What this film missed, was a heart (and a better plot, better delivery, more thought...etc). I didn't feel engaged or part of the ride, being a comic fan for many years I can easily say there is more depth to a drawing on a piece of paper than there was in the characters here. It was a lacklustre showing and it was such a pity as there was soo much potential to be had. The thing that made me angry, more so than the predictable plot and outcomes was the overuse of CGI. I understand that we are in an age where CGI is massive, done properly it can make a film brilliant, but done badly it can make a film look cheap and rushed - and unfortunately this fell into that later category. It was that obvious when CGI and green-screening had been used that it was actually off-putting to my enjoyment of the film. I have read some reviews on here which absolutely nailed it true to form; saying that the villain in this looked like he had been lifted straight from a computer game, saying that Superman looked artificial due to the CGI, saying that they believed the back grounds in Errol Flynn swashbuckling pirate films from years of yesterday were more believable. I can't agree more with some of these sentiments. 
I really didn't want to nit-pick with this film for fear of starting an avalanche but there were scenes in this where I was thinking 'oh come on, give me a break'. For example, the 'where is everybody' factor. To many times through this film there was a big action sequence, yet not one random person was there, nobody in the background, no police or military presence, nobody. Millions of pounds of damage, and only a handful of people in shot and they all happen to have lines in the film. WTF - 'where was everybody'??Before I start nit-picking anymore I'll conclude...Did I hate the film? Not absolutely, it still was a brainless action film. Did I love this film, not by a long way. I'm afraid the best I can give this is 5 out of 10 - I've seen better films on the SyFy channel and I'm afraid that this is where I can see this ending up in a few years' time.",5,5,10,19 February 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," He should have considered not coming back
","In the grand scheme of Terminator films, this is the poor relation. It's been panned on various reviewing websites, and to some extent I can see why too - but I don't hate it, in fact if you give it a chance it's actually alright. In this film a new Terminator (T-X) is sent back in time to the past (our present) to complete another mission which will change its present (our future) and bring machines the victory in a war waged against humanity which has been blazing for a long time. John Connor is all grown up and living off the grid so he can't be hunted. While he isn't the intended target this time, he still manages to find himself on the run from the new super advanced T-X Terminator. Teaming up with his future wife Katherine Brewster, he is on his own mission to survive the conflict with the T-X, and to try and prevent the future from happening thus saving humanity.Some would argue this film raises more issues than it does solve them, but given the chance, and ignoring the numerous issues, this is a decent action film - not brilliant, just decent. The first Terminator film shows what imagination and storytelling, despite having a low budget , can do - a masterpiece. T2 shows what a big budget and a good imagination, despite only a decent story can achieve - another stroke of genius. T3 unfortunately, shows what a big budget but very little imagination and story can achieve - which ultimately doesn't get it to the heights of its two predecessors.There are times were it tries to give nods to previous films in the franchise, but in doing it once to many throughout the film it becomes a bit of a parody of itself. The cast in the film is decent enough, Arnie looks a little over aged for his role, but who else can you put in that role. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes do alright as the central humans in the film, but poor scripting means there isn't a massive amount to write home about. Kristanna Loken is a bit cartoony as the new terminator, which I'm not sure if it's down to an overuse of CGI on her - but still she is decent enough.Some of the issues I had included: T800's aren't supposed to be able to learn, yet Arnie's Terminator has learned plenty of new things. How is Skynet operational after John destroyed the core and every trace of previous Terminators. If Skynet can send Terminators back in time, as it has done plenty of times now (5 by my count), why not send an army of them back in time so that they can win this time? Why haven't the US Military got any security at its top secret facility, and more to the point, how can two young adults and their 6ft gun totting robot enter the facility without being accosted? I have plenty more issues, but I getting fed of myself whinging now.I enjoyed the twist at the end of this film more than I did the journey to get to that point, I enjoyed looking at some of the version 1 killing machines, I enjoyed the nostalgia this film brought. The biggest issue I had though is that this lacked balls, it didn't have attitude, it didn't feel right. I felt like a film for films sake, rather than a film for a great concept. Perhaps this got panned so much because of the great Terminator films which came before it. At best, for me, this is a 6 out of 10.",6,0,3,12 February 2020
Face_Off," Facing off with faces off in Face/Off
","Nicolas Cage and John Travolta face off, in, err, in Face Off, where they literally have a face off. Confused? Meh - don't be, it's a no brainer action film more than a thought provoking epic. Travolta is a cop, Cage is criminal. Cage gets captured and ends up in a coma, but the cops need to know what Cage knew, so they get Travolta to very literally swap faces with Cage - because it's that easy, quick and clean :D . Travolta, as Cage, then goes undercover as Cage to stop a terrorist plot - but unbeknown to Travolta, Cage comes out of his coma and escapes. He put on Travolta's face - living as Travolta with his wife and child. Cage destroys all the evidence previously linking him and his gang to the crimes, and while he's at it he destroys the facility (and staff) who can reverse the face swap procedure. Cage and Travolta meet, setting up a twist in the plot, confirming that Travolta (as Cage) needs to become more criminal if he's going to escape the prison he's in, while Cage (as Travolta) needs to be a little nicer if he's going to get away with things scot free. Of course, the middle ground shows what both of them would be like, if in their own lives, they took a characteristic of each other. This film comes straight from the 90's, where a fart of an idea would end up being the plot for an action movie. A lot of the acting is over the top, but intentionally done so in order to allow Travolta and Cage to mimic one and other, plus it gives the audience an easy in to see who is who, despite the faces appearing on-screen. There is plenty of action - there are plenty of gun shots (most of which seem to miss - in a small room Cage and Travolta can unload automatic guns and still miss each other, but when aiming for henchmen they seem to have pin point accuracy), but don't be surprised to see stunt cables, visible squibs or planted explosives on display - a bit lazy. This film was never going to win any major awards, but it won't drive you to smashing up the TV if you happen to catch it repeated one night. It's not the worst film but I've got to be realistic when rating it and compare it to other films of the era and genre, I can only give this a 5 out of 10 at most. A typical John Woo film, lots of action, little plot, stylised imagery, hardly any depth, a little bit corny, featuring totally unrealistic occurrences for the hell of it. The film probably helped John Woo's cult status, but it didn't do anything to move cinema forward.",5,0,1,11 July 2018
Alien vs. Predator," A good idea - but comic books did it better
","Scientists discover a structure under an Antarctic island and investigate. They find suggestions of Alien life form which seems to be blooming since the structure was opened to explore. Little do they know they have stumbled into a hunting ground for other coming-of-age aliens (well... Predators), who are there to get some skulls for trophies. Unwittingly the humans are caught in the middle of an Alien vs Predator conflict.The look and feel of the film is great. The action is great. The combination of Aliens and Predators works well and follows the source material pretty good. All in all so far, tick. The main issue I had with it was the stupidity of the humans and the average script the actors were working from. It seemed too cliché in places and almost cheesy. Saying that though, I didn't dislike the film for that, I actually enjoyed it. It could have had more blood, guts and horror in it - but audiences have changed and the rating system this film tried to achieve meant it had to be less gory that previous Alien or Predator films. I actually played the titular console game of this and it was hell of a lot more scary than this film. I think there were some opportunities in the film to make it better but they were missed and this also affects the pacing slightly - it takes a while to get to the action and then when we follow the humans it can be a little stop/start.One of the issues with this film I have found is the divided fan base. Fans of Alien films want this to be another Alien film. Likewise fans of the Predator films, want this to be another Predator film. Truth be told, it's neither and both at the same time. Watch this as a new film and it's a good action romp. Watch this with expectations of it being an out-and-out Alien or Predator film and you won't enjoy it.I give this 6 out of 10. Good, but not outstanding.",6,1,1,12 February 2020
Wreck-It Ralph," Disney 'fixed it' and made a great
","A lovely animated modern animation from Disney and it's thoroughly enjoyable without all the usual fairytale folklore and princesses. Ralph is a computer game bad guy in the 'Fix it, Felix junior' arcade game. He longs to be celebrated as a hero and just given the decency of been included with the other pixels. One night while out drinking in the in- between world of the arcade games (where all the arcade game characters live when the arcade is closed) Ralph hatches a misjudged plan to get into another game and finally become a celebrated hero, ideally with a medal too so he can 'stick it to' the characters in his own game. Disaster strikes, Ralph crashes from one game to another and inadvertently takes a viral component with him. Unbeknown to Ralph who is trying to solve the oddities if the Candy racer game the virus is mutating in the game. Can Ralph solve the candy racer game and help his new friends or is he doomed when the virus mutates out of control, watch this lovely film to find out. I enjoyed this. I'm a games nerd so I was delighted to see a lot of retro game characters from various consoles all coming together in one film, I particularly liked the bad guy therapy sessions that Ralph was included in. Like most Disney films this is good old fashioned family fun for all. Gamers and geeks amongst you will enjoy the attention to detail and accuracy of some of the statements and signs littered around the film. There were thrills and spills, action and adventure, and importantly fun and humour everywhere. The world which was presented was a beautifully crafted place which made the film visually appealing. The voice actors all hit the mark, I didn't question the inclusion of any of them and they all delivered. I've been delighted to read all the top reviews this film has received and I'm happy to add to those by giving this an 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,15 February 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Aesthetically pleasing but lacking brains or a heart
","An aging actor and his best friend/stunt man try to come to terms with how Hollywood is changing into something they no longer recognize and are no longer central to.There is a mix of fact and fiction throughout; some people real, some made up; some events real, some made up. Visually this film is breath-taking at times, some lovely scenery, and some gorgeous retro costume, sets, and vehicles. The actors in the film carried off their roles quite well, albeit without being engaging enough for me to really care about too much. Pitt and DiCaprio's bromance drives the film forward, and Margot Robbie provides a more light-hearted side story.So why the poor rating for what some people are calling a 10 out of 10 film?Well, unfortunately I did not really enjoy this long winded 'what if' look at Hollywood for a few reasons. Just to be clear, I am not 'new audience' and I do enjoy some of Tarantino's other films, this however was a struggle for me.I felt that the film was trying too hard to be cool and culturally relevant. It came across as aesthetically pleasing, but with truly little substance. A summary which pretty much explains how I felt about the entire film.... it looked good, really really good at times... but it didn't have substance, it lacked a real heart or brain, or in this case, a decent plot. It was just lots of beautiful things thrown together without ever going much further. If it has of been a 'paint by numbers' film, then it had all the elements it needed to make an extravaganza.... but the final masterpiece that was put onto canvas almost felt too manufactured and forced. Sure, there was a little character development from DiCaprio; but not enough to care or show growth. Sure, there was action in it from Pitt, but not relevant to the overall vehicle of the movie. Sure, there was sex appeal, but it did not contribute anything, it just was.'Once upon a Time... in Hollywood' is a really long film with a small climax that is far-fetched in the context of the rest of the film. In fact, the climax of the film it the one true Tarantino signature - you watch that part and you know you are watching one of his movies. The 2 hours prior to that though, it would be hard to see clear signatures of his famed auteurship.I was left unfulfilled and robbed of the time that I could have been watching other films. I find it hard to recommend this film and staggered and bemused by the amount of people who have awarded this a perfect 10 out of 10. If you have seen this, ask yourself some serious questions:
<ul><li>Would this have as much fanfare and prestige if it were not a Tarantino movie?</li><li>Would you have looked at the film twice if it did not have De Caprio and Pitt in it?</li><li>Would you have rated it as highly if Margot Robbie's legs were not on display? (Just to clarify, that is not me being sexist for objectifying female anatomy, look at other reviews and count how many times you see the aforementioned legs mentioned as a driver to a decent rating!)</li></ul>If the answer to the above is probably not - then how can this be the film of 2019? If the answer to the above is yes, then be careful with that growing nose.Not the best film I have ever seen, not the worst film either. An exceptionally long and at times disengaging film. Lots of beautiful aesthetics, no heart or decent plot. A 'just is', 'what if' film that will surely divide opinions that I personally did not enjoy greatly. 4 out of 10.",4,2,3,3 July 2020
X-Men: Apocalypse," An epic film and a fitting tribute to the comic
","I really really really enjoyed this movie, I remember sitting in the cinema watching it thinking 'I need to watch this again, quickly!' This was a roller-coaster of film which did justice to both the comic world and the world of film, and that's something I haven't said about other comic inspired films much. This is the best of the X-Men films, even better than 'Days of Future Past' which took some doing, because that was previously the best of them. If I'm honest, the reboot/ new timeline has done the X-Men franchise the world of good, the films are bigger, better and darker - something the X-Men definitely deserves. I personally think they are partly responsible for the success the current MCU and DCU are having. This is the 4th superhero/comic film of the year, I personally think this is better than 'Batman vs Superman' and 'Cpt. America: Civil War'. As an immersing spectacle to tantalize the senses this is on par, for me, with the 'Deadpool' film, and I really enjoyed that, but for different reasons. The film was set in the 80's and delivers for the actual time period with feelings of fear and nuclear war, as well as the colour and the sound of 80's fashion and popular culture. It also delivers on the feeling of early X-Men comics, fear of mutants and man's need to control them, with characters looking to find and understand themselves and what they are capable of.Brian Singer directs and has used the new timeline created in 'X- Men: Days of Future Past' to wonderful effects to weave a great story. The film introduces En Sabah Nur, or Apocalypse, the first mutant, woken from a deathly slumber about thousands of years. Events transpire that allow him to enlist his regular 4 horsemen to serve him and bring down humanity. His aim is to cleanse the world of the weak (humans and anyone that opposes him generally) and build the world again with him as it's ruler. Standing in his way are the X-Men, who themselves have journeys and story's unfolding at he same time. I don't want to spoil anything so that's as far as I'm taking the synopsis. The cast is brilliant and believable throughout, not just can they act but as an Englishman it's nice to see a Brit heavy cast delivering sublimely. Established characters as well as new appearances make great showings, nobody seemed out of place here. The emotional variances and deliveries were brilliant throughout, giving you everything from love to tragedy, fear to fascination, comedy to conflict. The action scenes were top notch and suited the characters in the film very well. With each unique character, a different power, and each variant is acted and delivered with class. Sometime the CGI and cabled action shots were a little obvious and overdone, but it was still damn fine eye candy and didn't ruin things. It actually served to offer the comic book physics that I'd expect. The film isn't afraid to set up a story at over two hours but it didn't drag at any point, I couldn't wait for more to happen and I certainly look forward to more X-Men films like this one. Stay tuned for the usual post-credits scene, if you know the MCU and X- Men comics you'll figure out who might be pulling some strings in the next movie and like me you'll be ready and waiting. A thoroughly well deserved a 9 out of 10.",9,22,40,19 May 2016
The Da Vinci Code," Decent adventure - but not outstanding
","Based on the popular book by Dan Brown, this film tells the story a race against time to solve a centuries old riddle crossing through religion, literature, folklore and culture. Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon, a professor/teacher/symbolist/literature expert/puzzle specialist who gets mixed up with a plot that put him both in danger, and in the driving seat to reveal one of religions biggest cover ups. It all starts in France, when a Louvre curator is killed. He is found in mysterious circumstances with mysterious codes on and about him. Langdon, along with Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) attempt to unravel the clues to the murder, and the clues to the cover up - this takes them through various locations all to do with Leonardo Da Vinci, as he was one of the perpetrators of the cover up. The cover up suggests that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene had a child and there is in fact an active blood-line of decedents still alive. Throw in the mix various corrupt law enforcement agencies, various religious sects such as Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, various independent parties too - and you have a adrenaline fuelled mystery that spans the time of man and religion too.Directed by Ron Howard this film takes it's source material from the Dan Brown book of the same name. I have read the book but I wanted to review the film without the book in mind - so rather complain about differences or changes - I'm mainly going to be focussing on the delivery of the film rather than the contents of the book. Howard's choice of locations make the film visually pleasing, some lovely architecture has been really looked at from interesting perspectives. On first inspection his choice of casting too seems to have been a good choice; there are times where the lines are a little wooden, leaving me unable to connect or empathise for the characters - but for the most part performances are decent. Hanks and Tautou do well to carry the forward, while other appearances from Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany and Albert Molina (amongst others) all come off believable. Effects have been done tastefully for the most part, with emphasis on clues to help the audience along - sometimes practically spelling out the issue for audience members unable to understand. There's a decent pace for the most part but there are times where action drags a little - presumably to allow the audience to catch up. All in all this is a decent detective slash chase slash journey of a film. It's like an Indiana Jones style film with less action and more book smart. I'd give this a 7 out of 10. It wasn't awful but it's not totally my cup of tea. The hardcore book fans probably won't like some things about it, but as a standalone film it's got enough to keep viewers entertained.",7,1,2,30 July 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Completing the trilogy of the best family films made
","In the final instalment of the Godfather trilogy, Michael Corleone is trying to legitimize the family business - but the past dealings and history of the family business keep pulling him back into the shadows of the crime world. It's about 22 years since what happened in Godfather 2; Michael is older, and as are the people around him, and his kids. In fact, its children from the generations of the films past that play a major part in this film, almost making them as important an entity as children were in the first Godfather film which saw Michael emerge from the shadows.Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) has a feud with Joey Zasa who's now the face of the Corleone business in New York, while at the same time falling in love with Michael's daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola), the face of Michael's charity business. Michael is less than impressed with Mancini, especially the fact that he has his eye on Michael's daughter, but he begrudgingly takes him under his wing - Michael also sees Sonny's traits in Mancini and feels he could be moulded. Unfortunately life has taken a toll on Michael and we see a frail side to him as his health slowly deteriorates. After a diabetic coma, Michael has plenty of time to reflect on life - in fact reflection becomes a major part of the film - Reflection of moments and people lost, of the finality of death and the legacy that is left when the body is no longer there. I think the misconception about this film, and possibly the reason for mixed reviews and low ratings is this - it isn't truly and out-and-out gangster movie like the previous two instalments have been. This film is about the conclusion of a character that, despite being a young man in the first film, wasn't really born until his father was attacked. We see the birth of Michael's darker side in Godfather 1, we see what he has the power to become in Godfather 2, and we see the results and conclusion of Michael in Godfather 3. This is more a fictional biopic than a gangster film. Sure it has Mafioso and Gangsters in it, but there is an underlying and unspoken narrative driving it forward, and when that clicks into place it's all about stories and reflections.Another reason why this film was panned in comparison to its predecessors is the casting choice and some of the dialogue - I don't see a massive problem myself though. Some of the dialogue when the issue was to do with the crime family were cliché and expectable - but that's because the other films set it up. The dialogue to do with Michael's real character, that's what was more unexpected - with how Michael built himself up in the first two, you wouldn't expect the frailty from him. At the final conclusion, it could be argued that a broken heart is what ultimately kills him - not bullets, not words - loss, unspoken emotion, feelings.My rating for this will match the previous two Godfather films. The other films were more obvious, this is more subtle and clever. I have read the books by Mario Puzo, I have read the books in-between the books (Mark Winegardner) and in-between the movies. I still can't not like this film - it's feels like a tragic opera, almost like it's a commentary of itself and the legacies that are paved the way for it. My rating for this, like the previous Godfather films is 9 out of 10.",9,2,2,31 January 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," A blonde bimbo of a film which looks good but has little substance
","A good looking film; jam packed with some real celebrity A-listers, in a tongue in cheek look at a side of the classic Hollywood studio system in the 1950's. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a 'fixer' for a studio; his job is to keep the stars in-line, safe and happy. They are after all, the main commodity to making 'pictures'! His job is a tough one, but he's good at it, and while he complains, he does actually like it too. While simultaneously solving various issues the studios main star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is kidnapped by communist's screenwriters from the set up Hail! Cesar - the years big budget blockbuster. Mannix has to sort this out along with the myriad of other problems around him.Directed by the Coen brothers this is a film I really wanted to like, but it doesn't seem to have a clear destination or journey, it's a jumble of things all thrown up in the air. Sure it looked pretty, and had a top cast, but it lacked something that left me expecting a twist or an improvement every couple of minutes - and it just didn't come.At best I can only give this a 5 because it was mildly entertaining to me as somebody who has studied the classic Hollywood studio system - but beyond that, it didn't entertain much and the plot was pretty weak.",5,0,1,4 February 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," A decent family movie
","I enjoyed this film - I wasn't sure that I was going to, based on the reviews I'd read - but I did enjoy it, in a mixed kind of way. This despite the fact that I remember the 1974 version, and the TV series version with David Suchet fondly. A lot of films nowadays tend to be big budget, all action, sweary-mary kind of films. It was refreshing to see a movie that was entertaining and suitable to watch with family members from teens to seniors. Hardcore fans of Agatha Christie may not be to happy with this adaptation/remake because of the way it's been Hollywoodified - maybe the finger can point to Kenneth Brannagh for this, as he directed and starred in the leading role (which can be seen as a vehicle for his success/reputation). Elements of the film had been modernised, primarily to meet expectations of it's potential audiences, rather than to drive the films on. It was fast paced, moody, sexy and clever at different times - but I don't think it actually needed to be or should have been. The cast was undeniably brilliant, and between them they probably have a massive trophy collection - but did it need to be? I suspect that if the cast was an attempt to do a star studded feature like the 1974 version then it meets that expectation. If the cast was chosen for acting prowess, then perhaps unknown stars could have faired equally well because the film isn't about personality and connecting with the characters, it's about their story. (Perhaps the use of superstars was a clever way of diverting the obvious revelations from the audience so they kept on guessing 'whodunnit' too.)If you haven't read the book or seen the other versions you might get more enjoyment out of this than anyone who knows the story. Either way though this was a decent family film which wasn't offensive and was made to fit for modern audiences. I'd watch whatever follow-up is planned (and hinted towards at the end). 6 out of 10.",6,0,6,28 February 2018
Wonder Woman," Wonder-fully making DCU seem relevant after all
","This film is a modern origin movie in the DC Comics universe which brings to screen Gal Gadot as the titular character of Wonder Woman. Living and trained by the Amazonians, a tribe of woman hidden away from civilization on the island of Themyscira, Diana - princess to the Amazonians, is finding her place in the world. In her mind she has lots of questions about her origins and her path in life. One day a male pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), crashes on the island shores. He tells stories of a massive conflict raging across the world, which the Amazonians are oblivious of. Diana decides that she want to help, taking what she needs she leaves with the Steve, much to the disappointment of the Amazonians. On her journey she encounters civilization for the first time and sees the travesties of man, a world war in all its gory glory. She feels that the war has been orchestrated by higher powers, so while fighting for humanity and discovering herself and her powers, she's also trying to uncover the source of evil driving humanity to the mass conflict of war. Directed by Patty Jenkins and written by Zack Synder this film is one of the gems in DC's sorry attempt to rival Marvel as a big player in the comic book to film franchises - sorry, but only a few DC film's found a level of creditability on screen. Set at the end of World War 1, thematically things were great, costumes seemed right, technology seemed right - it even felt like bleak and smoggy which makes the film feel as though it fits its time and place. The score was passionate and driving and fit the film well - to truly have a great superhero they need to have a theme, and Wonder Woman has one that stands up for itself well. The choreography was decent, a lot of the fighting felt like a ballet at times and it was visually please. The pace of the film was a bit cut and paste, long journeys seemed to happen within seconds with no transitioning - but a younger audience wouldn't be put off. The plot isn't really that complex and there are times when it feels like events of the first Henry Carvill Superman are mirrored in this film, down to the boss fight at the end. I think the acting was good, Gal Gadot - she was believable, naive, fierce - and everything you'd need throughout the film (albeit she occasionally adopted a superhero pose too often - maybe to remind people that she was a super). Chris Pine's Steve Trevor was the best character on-screen, he delivered depth and charm. My main issue was to do with the bad guys - the German's seemed very comical at times, rather than the scourge of the world. Dr Maru (Elena Anaya) could have been soo much more but ended up being a one dimensional baddy which seemed to be placed just to give the film a focal point. On to Ares (David Thewlis), where do we start - this is possibly a criticism of all the DCU films so far, like them Ares was a mess of CGI. Looking at him on screen hurt my senses - it was a let-down to have him as the linchpin to the evil in the film, he could have been soo much more. Honestly it looks like the Ares character was taken straight from a Playstation game, rather than something that had been added to the film on his own merit.All in all, I enjoyed the film. It was refreshing to have a strong female superhero as the lead. I think that from all the recent DCU films (I'm not counting early Superman, Green Lantern, or Batman films - or even Christopher Nolan Batman films), this has to be one of the best put out. It's a decent platform for them to get stronger and stronger. This is a good action film, good fantasy film, and film that can stand on its own should the viewer not be a fan of comics or other DC films. 8 out of 10",8,2,2,16 August 2018
Black Panther," Hoped for more based on the hype - just averaged :(
","This is going to be difficult, did I enjoy the film - yes. Did I think it was as good as the critics say - no. Do I think it's worthy of all the awards and plaudits it's received - no. Do I think it's been talked up due to the ethnic diversity contained in the film - yes (sorry). Black Panther introduces the Marvel universe to Wakanda, the fictional home of the Wankandan people and their king/leader/superhero saviour -the Black Panther. In a nutshell the movie is this - a new king arrives home, he doubts himself, the crown is threatened, a new king emerges and dethrones the old king, the new king turns out to be bad, conflict ensues to the point of civil war, fights occur everywhere, the old king realises his worth, by the end of the film everything is ok again. Chadwick Boseman plays a decent role as T'Challa, but Michael B Jordan plays a better villain in Killmonger for me. The coolest things about the film were the weapons and tech, the best character was Shuri (Letitia Wright) because she delivered humour as well as action. The plot was weak and it's been done before - I have an issue when superhero's fight practically identical carbon copy superhero's - the worst part of 'Antman' for example was Antman fighting Yellow-jacket as they were practically the same. The worst part of the Iron Man films was when he fought against carbon copies of the Iron Man he'd made. I even hated computer games that did that - Ken/Ryu in Street Fighter - SubZero/Scorpion in Mortal Kombat - It's lazy and it's cheap! Black Panther sadly does exactly that. Throw together two black panther suits, identifiable mainly by the varying shades used on the trim - and then the action scene's just look like lazy CGI dancing, something you'd expect to see a college computer design student make.I think this movie got the acclaim it did because 99% of the cast were black - for me I don't care what colour, race or religion somebody is - film is about the story, it's about losing yourself to something fun and exciting. There are some seriously great films out there with a black cast, but they didn't get the praise they deserved - I'm sure there will be excellent films in the future with black superhero's saving the day too. Unfortunately this film felt like it had already been done before a hundred times over. For me, it didn't live up to the expectation of hype I'd read into. I really wanted a lot more from Black Panther - I just hope that the next installment has a better and more original story line. I'd love to rate this higher but the best I can give it is 6 out of 10 because it didn't feel original or fresh.",6,1,2,2 July 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," DC's first proper wave splashes down with a dark and broody feel
","This film is one of the hyped films of the year, in the months leading up to its release you simply couldn't escape marketing for it. In the comic to film world this represents DC's big attempt at copying the success that the Marvel studios have had with its cinematic universe and cross story character arcs. Mix DC's two best-selling hero's with modern cinematic techniques, a big budget, a strong story and plenty of CGI and the promise of other supers from the DC world and you have Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. This is a long film at almost 2 and a half hours. It introduces Ben Affleck as an older, grumpier Batman than audiences are used to and reintroduces Henry Cavill as the last son of Krypton/ Man of Steel, Superman. The film has a lot of dark tones to it much like DC comics like to show off. This is just one of the differences between Marvel and DC, Marvel tend to do fun and colourful stories and DC like to do darker more serious stories. This film fitted into that darker mould nicely and with a lot of attitude to boot. Although I am not a fan of Affleck he did a good turn as the aging, grumpy dark knight and I was pleasantly surprised. Action shots showed him fighting like Batman and investigative detective work showed him thinking like Batman. Henry Cavill playing Superman came across a lot more pleasant than the typical Superman that I am used to from comics, and in truth despise for being self righteous and too 'all American'. Cavill's Superman in the film was also better than his appearance in the previous 'Man of Steel' film. The rest of the cast were on par with the main stars of the film which is credit to Zack Snyder's directing and casting. He likes to use good quality actors so that even the less important players come across as authentic. For me the weakest players in the cast were Amy Adams (Lois Lane) and Jesse Eisenberg (Lex Luthor). Both gave good performances which stood up well but for me their faces just didn't fit to my expectations, more so Adams. In the same breath as saying that I have to admit that Eisenberg's approach portrayed Luther as a pure evil madman genius which was brilliant but alas, for me, his face didn't fit my expectations - which is probably my problem rather than a detractor for the film. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/ Wonder Woman was extremely refreshing, instead of making the character camp and colourful the film actually delivers her as a genuine threat to bad guys and wrong doers. The Wonder Woman appearance was an absolute delight and proved the critics wrong, despite not being muscle bound Gadot proves that femine power and beauty can still kick ass. Kudos to Jeremy Irons as Alfred too, while I wasn't looking forward to Affleck playing the Batman I was equally doubtful about Irons standing in as Alfred, both actually worked out well.The story takes place after the first Henry Cavill Superman film - 'Man of Steel', the opening sequences show what affects the Superman Vs General Zod fight have on Metropolis. This is slightly eerie and looked very much like the aftermath of the genuine terrorist attack on the twin towers in 2001. At the time of the fight between Kal-el and Zod the millionaire playboy tycoon Bruce Wayne happens to be visiting and not only loses a building but also employees and friends in the aftermath of the fight. It's this that inspires him to question Superman's ability and angle of justice. Flash forward a few months and Lex Luther manages to pull the strings to manipulate and orchestrate a Superman and Batman fight. Along the way we learn a lot of things about the DC universe, including the existence of other Meta-human's such as the aforementioned Wonder Woman, also the Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman. The film sets these characters up for their own films which are due to hit our screens in the future and it also paves the way for the impending Justice League film which will be with us soon. Don't worry, there are recognisable bad guys too, we've already met Lex Luther and the now deceased General Zod but you'll get to see a version of one of Superman's greatest foes in Doomsday. There is plenty in this film to both annoy and titillate fan boys and geeky girls but for the most part if you are a fan of the DC Universe then you'll probably love this film. I won't spoil the film too much more. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this but I really did and I was surprised that I did enjoy it as much as I did. It did feel like the film could have been compressed more and made better but I understand why it wasn't, this is DC's big screen epic and it wanted to make a massive statement, which it kind of does. There were a few poor moments in the film such as Batman suddenly becoming friends with Superman because their mothers have the same name. Likewise the drawn out demonstrations against Superman's brand of justice which had predictable outcomes and ultimately didn't go anywhere. Also the day dream that Batman had about a potential future where Superman is the law and he rips Batman's heart our of his chest (much like he does to the Joker in 'Injustice Year One') before Batman has a vision of Cyborg trying to pass a message through time. These small things don't ultimately detract from the overall enjoyment. I want to award this 7 and a half out of 10 as it was fun yet dark and broody film, as I can't award half stars I'll settle for 8 out of 10, Zack Snyder has delivered a great first wave of the DC world.",8,4,8,5 April 2016
Deadpool," The Merc with a Mouth delivers maximum effort and will want to touch himself tonight
","Time to own up, I'm a comic-book fan and also massive Deadpool nerd. If my review is slightly excited I apologise. This film nearly didn't happen, Deadpool isn't a conventional hero by a long way, he's not even a hero, the characters traits he shows make him something that Hollywood feared making because they thought it wouldn't sell and feared it would be a legal nightmare - let alone the difficulties anticipated getting clearance by the censors! Leaked test footage in 2012 & 2014 combined with fan power gave this project wheels and the film is enjoyable to both fans and newcomers. It helped that Reynolds was such a fan of comics too; he championed the conversion from comic to film from 2005 on social media. Directed by Tim Miller this comes out exactly 25 years after DeadPool's first appearance in Marvel -New Mutants #98. In one comic I read writers joked at Reynolds to star as Deadpool if ever a film was made - granted there was one story arc where DeadPool gained Tom Cruises face, but that's a whole different story and it was always suggested Reynolds was the man for the job. Here we are in 2016 and that joke is reality as Ryan Reynolds delivers a great performance as the Merc with a mouth. He does much better job here than in his previous incarnation of the assassin in the 'X-Men Origins -Wolverine' movie, and so much better than he does as the green lantern which is even joked about within this film. Relatively true to the comics the cast portray the characters in the Deadpool world with T.J. Miller playing Weasel and Leslie Uggams as Blind Al amongst others (even Hydra- Bob makes an appearance!!). It's an origins story showing how Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, gets his regenerative powers and what he had to go through to save his lover Vanessa played by Morena Baccarin from Ajax, Ed Skrein. The action and humour in the film starts from the very moment the Marvel badge dissolves from screen and there is a great pace for the duration of the film all the way through the film and passed the end credits (you certainly get value for your tickets). Lots of camera and editing techniques used throughout to give the film a great look and feel, both modern with classic techniques too. While the main story unfolds flashbacks and flash-forwards act as additional narration to help the audience learn about the anti-hero's journey. I enjoyed the ride and that surprised me, being such a fan I expected Hollywood to ruin this film; this doubt was further reserved with all the great reviews that were coming in since the film was released, I really didn't want to be disappointed and I wasn't. Here I am after the film writing a review to confirm that I actually liked it a damn lot. The acting is convincing, the script is littered with humour and drama which worked well with the expected insanity and violence which was due. As well as the humour in the script there were visual jokes hidden in a beautiful crafted world, typically DeadPool broke the 4th wall with the character as well his surroundings talking to the audience. There were jokes and nods to the previous Deadpool character to feature a the below par 'X-Men Origins - Wolverine' movie like the action figure and the suggestion of sewing Wilson's mouth shut; a 'Green Lantern' (another role played by Reynolds) card was seen and Wilson even begs not to get a green or animated suit while being treated by the Weapon X programme; talking to the camera DeadPool refers to the previous X-Men films and asks Colossus if Stewart or McAvoy was the current professor at the institute; and at one point the merc even breaks the 16th wall by talking to the audience in a flashback already talking to the audience - typical DeadPool insanity. If you are familiar with DeadPool you'll already be aware of him constantly breaking the 4th wall, and you'll no doubt be aware that he got his 'Merc with a Mouth' nickname due to his constant talking and wise cracking. The film portrays that really well without ever getting confusing or boring. Sometimes the joke may not land but that's OK, it's DeadPool and he can't help himself. The minor negatives in the film for me, and let me be clear, these are teeny tiny negatives and didn't ruin the film for me; were Colossus and Ajax. I could have happily seen a different X-Man rather than the metal Russian. I imagine the CGI to create Colossus wasn't easy and maybe a simpler character could have fitted the film better - although the 'fight' scene with DeadPool on the bridge was really amusing. Ajax was a little forgettable and judging by the villains that DeadPool has fought in the comic's film-makers could have opted for somebody else - but then it wouldn't necessarily be an origins based film. I enjoyed this although I didn't think the film was as bat sh*t crazy as it could have been, it actually had as much of a heart as it did blood shed. I enjoyed it more than other movies in the Marvel Universe. The film doesn't take itself seriously and in doing so has a great mix of emotions at different times. Combine that with great action and you have a top notch film that's well worthy of a 9 out of 10 from me. I was more content than I thought I would be being an established fan and an over critical one at that. If you want a crude rude hard paced film with lots of bloodshed action but with a soft romantic side step up and buy a ticket. In fact buy two or three tickets to help fund a follow up movie which might have Cable and or Nick Fury in it!!!",9,3,12,15 February 2016
Alien: Covenant," Good Prometheus sequel, average Alien prequel
","In 2104, at least 10 years since the exploits of 'Prometheus' occurred; a colonisation vessel responds to a radio signal coming from an Earth like planet and decides to change their destination from where they were originally intended to go in favour of this new planet. Things have been going wrong for the vessel and landing on the new planet it the next phase in things turning out bad. They are attacked by various Alien life forms, then they are saved by a familiar looking person, that person turns out to be less familiar to their expectations, more aliens attack, things go from bad to worse - queue the escape/ chase attempt.I liked this more than the previous film 'Prometheus' as this looked and felt crisp and edgy -the first part of the film at least! After the first act, act 2 of the film leans heavily on the theoretical dribble that 'Prometheus' touched upon, theorising existence and life. Much of the dialogue is led by the android David (Fassbender) as he attempts to educate his guests on the planet. Act 3 returns to its roots and becomes an 'Aliens' kind of film, but recycles a lot of the content from those 'Alien' films. There are chase sequences, jumps and scares, and tension as you anticipate if the humans will outwit their pre-Xenomorph alien stalkers. With the difference in the three acts the pace feels a little off beat, some of the script and dialogue also felt out of place, at times, it became predictable in places and it didn't flow continuously. A lot of the characters were un-relatable - assumedly there to die rather than to connect to the audience or to drive a theory or theme. I guess, at least the film looked ok! There were a lot of situations that unfolded that left me frustrated and shouting at the screen, either at the characters decisions or something that broke the alien canon (or continuation in the films). I know that things occurred to scare or thrill the audience, but I couldn't help but get frustrated - it's like when victims run upstairs in houses when chased by knife wielding maniacs - it has to happen, but that doesn't stop me being frustrated. Perhaps my criticism is derived from my passion for the franchise and the hope that something would affect me the way the first two alien films affected me - but I have to be realistic, cinema has moved on, audiences are different - perhaps my expectations should be too.All in all, it was a decent film, I personally expected and hoped for more, but it was still a decent sci-fi horror film. I'd give this 6 out of 10 - it follows on from 'Prometheus' with a better (albeit average) film, it (very loosely) kind of embeds itself as a prequel to 'Alien' - but for me could have been oodles better - I'll still re-watch it a few times in the future though.",6,1,2,12 February 2020
