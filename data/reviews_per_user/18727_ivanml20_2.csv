Skyfall," Skyfall â€“ the fall of the double O
","I saw the movie last night. I thought it could not be worse than Quantum of Solace. At least they got Q back, right? I was so wrong. 2 hours and 37 minutes later after enduring numerous dark scenes, and forcefully pushing myself to like the sad sack sentimental and aging James (Lame) Bond I left the theater utterly disappointed with the after taste of 'What a waste of time!'. There was nothing, nothing and nothing in the movie. No balance of characters, couple of chuckles here and there on the lame humor and mostly dark sentimental scenes that were dragging f-o-r-e-v-e-r.I was collecting Bond movies until Daniel Craig started playing in them. I do not have the last three movies. I felt I really do not need them. They are off beat. Daniel plays worse than George Lazenby, but back in that time if the movie sucked the bad actor got kicked out really quick. Now in the new age of political correctness it takes 3 failed movies to say to Daniel Craig 'Hey dude, you really suck like James Bond, make space for someone new that at least smiles occasionally'. Here are the spoilers: <ul><li>Lots of violence, the villain leaves breadcrumbs of dead bodies for no particular reason. I guess Bond is out of shape not just physically, but also his IQ is lower than usual and can't find the villain otherwise. </li></ul><ul><li>James is particularly bad making love to women giving the sense he does it against his will, and giving the audience the impression he leaves them unsatisfied. </li></ul><ul><li>Love scenes between Bond and girls are short, but the 'busting out of the closet' gay scene with the villain is developed with great attention to the detail. It is obvious it did get James excited. Really! That is where we are going now? And this goes with PG-13 rating? </li></ul><ul><li>A beautiful classic car is destroyed just because </li></ul><ul><li>In darkness the movie is somewhere between Lord of the Rings and the 7 Psychopaths.</li></ul>Potential: <ul><li>Young Q could be great in the next movie </li></ul><ul><li>There is tiny pleasant surprise at the end related to the other girl in the movie. Would love to see more of that. </li></ul>Things that could help the movie: <ul><li>Do some sunny scenes, like Ursula or Halle getting out of the Caribbean waters </li></ul><ul><li>Let your imagination run wild, we could use some technology trends or ideas. We know Sony now sucks as Technology Company and I personally would not want to see even their commercials, but I am sure someone knows what is next. If in doubt consult with people in Silicon Valley or Redmond. </li></ul><ul><li>Where are the awesome product placements? We could use some ideas for cool watches or great future gadgets. After all did the reality outpace the movies imagination for real?</li></ul>",1,15,33,9 November 2012
Quantum of Solace," Major disappointment for all long time Bond fans
","Yuck! 'the decaf', 'the diet' or 'the zero calories' version of James Bond. James Bond without the substance of James Bond. You know economy is in trouble when you see a James Bond movie with:<ul><li>No transformer sports car</li></ul><ul><li>No funny gadgets or a modified wrist watches</li></ul><ul><li>No Miss Moneypenny and witty flirtatious conversation</li></ul><ul><li>No Q to present the imaginative new technology, to tell you well known science fact and express his warm and fatherly concern of 007's welfare</li></ul><ul><li>No new visionary spy technology, just boring product placements for products that lack consumer luster.</li></ul><ul><li>No humor, I guess the writers were on strike when the movie scenario was written.</li></ul><ul><li>People left out of the movie, action scenes too fast to follow</li></ul><ul><li>Special effect below mediocre with no imagination</li></ul><ul><li>No dialog that you can quote and make fun with after the movie</li></ul><ul><li>No catchy phrase to soften the accidental death of the villain.</li></ul>I can enumerate forever the bad features of another 'off-the-mill' spy movie. The movie sucks almost as 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. This time is not the actors, but the scenario, the bad product placements and the 'stiff' dialogs. If you want to see unbalanced movie with lots of violence, no humor or imagination go for it, spend your money on another mediocre product cranked out from a large corporation. My recommendation 'wait until the movie goes on cable'.Oh, did I mention no lasers and exotic underwater scuba scenes? I still wonder where all the money went they claim was spent.",1,2,2,9 November 2012
