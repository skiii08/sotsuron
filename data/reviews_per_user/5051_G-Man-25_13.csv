The Blair Witch Project," Much Ado About Nothing
","I'm not sure this movie is worthy of all the hype being heaped upon it.  I wanted the hype to be valid, I REALLY did.....I'm a big fan of independent films, so I wanted all the rave reviews to be true....most of all, however, I wanted to be SCARED!!!   Hmmmmmmmm.....well, I liked the way the filmmakers set up their story in the early scenes, giving background in to the whole Blair Witch legend, and there was the promise of a few mild chills.....but I found most of everything from the mid-section on to be rather tedious.  There were a couple of things that really kind of negated the whole thing for me.   The characters behaved increasingly more stupidly and illogically as the movie ran on (not TOO different from any other horror/slasher film, eh?).  And I know it's supposed to me a mock documentary but let me ask you this:  If you're awakened in the dead of the night out in the forest and scared totally witless, would you REALLY take the time and bother to pick up a video camera and film yourself as you're running away???  NO!!  You're terrified!!  Forget the camera!!  You'd just take off running like your very life depended on it!!  I'm not normally one to sit and actively poke holes into a story like this, but that fact just bugged me.  Maybe it's because of all the hype and people (even big-time critics) falling all over themselves and calling this a new classic...well, I don't buy it!  It's a nice try, but the entire group of people I went to see this with also gave it an 'is that all there is?' shrug.  It just isn't all it's cracked up to be.",4,0,2,13 August 1999
Fight Club," A Warped Masterpiece
","This is one patently indescribable movie, the story not at all what you might expect from the previews.  It's sharply written, terrifically acted and brilliantly shot and acted for maximum effect.  It's as dark and brutal as what you might expect from director David Fincher, but also VERY unexpectedly funny (in a very black and offbeat way)  It's undoubtedly THE funniest film Fincher has done so far and he scores very highly.Not for all tastes, to be sure....but if you're in the mood for something completely different and original, 'Fight Club' may be just the ticket for you.  I give it *** 1/2 out of **** stars.",Null,0,1,16 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," SOUTH PARK RULES!!!!
","Absolutely THE most subversively hilarious film of the year!  Just about every major character from the show is here, along with some of the more memorable supporting and guest characters.  I commend Parker and Stone for giving us MUCH more than just an extended big-screen version of the TV show. They use the film to take sharp swipes at everything that irks them (and us) and they aren't afraid to puncture many sacred cows to make their point. Unlike the Beavis & Butthead movie (which, funny as it was, didn't take any chances away from the show that spawned it...it WAS nothing more than the TV show on a bigger screen), Parker and Stone take full advantage of the medium (and the 'R' rating) to do things they couldn't do on the TV show.And any movie featuring a sex scene between Satan and Saddam Hussein? You just GOTTA love that!The musical numbers are sharp AND hilarious....a great surprise!Can't wait to see it again....sure to be a big hit AND an instant midnight movie cult classic in the coming years.   A solid '10' from me.",Null,0,0,30 June 1999
The Others," Good Atmosphere, But Otherwise Iffy
","This movie is ALL about atmosphere, and on that level, it delivers.  But the story is perhaps too old-fashioned to be truly scary.  There were a few mild chills and Nicole Kidman WAS very good as a mother clinging precariously to her sanity.  As a thriller, it's just too mild-mannered and quaint in this day and age.  I wanted to be frightened, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  A big disappointment.",Null,0,0,19 August 2001
Chicken Run," Delightful!!!
","A first-rate family film that will delight young and old alike.  This film deserves to capture a HUGE audience this Summer and word-of-mouth should help it to do so.  Superb stop-motion animation PLUS a hilarious, exciting and heartwarming story...what more could you ask for?  If you liked 'Toy Story,' you're gonna love 'Chicken Run.'  The voice casting couldn't be better and really adds to making the (mostly chicken) characters endearing and fall-down funny.  This is truly one of the best non-Disney family films ever made.  Grab your kids and RUN, don't walk, to see 'Chicken Run!!' ****4 stars",Null,0,0,17 June 2000
American Pie," Raunchy And Unexpectedly Sweet
","The buzz on this raunchy teen comedy has been building for some time now, with some predicting it to be (and comparing it to) this Summer's 'There's Something About Mary.'  While there's nothing blindingly original about the story, it DOES have its share of raunchy laughs and gross-out gags.  And yes, it DOES have an unexpected sweetness and innocence laced throughout it similar to 'Mary,' but without that film's mean-spiritedness.The young cast is very good, especially Jason Biggs as the innocent and confused leader of the gang who all pledge to lose their virginity on prom night...he seems to be the one caught in a majority of the most embarrassing situations, but admirably seems to escape with his dignity intact.  Eugene Levy is extremely amusing as Biggs' father, trying to impart wisdom to his son  but at the most inopportune times.A cut or two above most teen comedies and not as irresponsible as you might gather by the previews.  Very funny stuff!!",8,0,0,10 July 1999
BASEketball," Hilarious
","This movie came out at about the same time as 'There's Something About Mary' and didn't do well at the box office but for my money, it nearly matches that film for sheer, shameless belly laughs.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the creators of 'South Park') are a unique and very funny duo....they're not great actors, but they're not asked to be.  One gets the sense that they are basically playing themselves and their repartee and comic timing are right on the money.  Combine that with a supporting cast of many familiar faces and a script that takes pot-shots at our nation's obsession with and the vast commercialization of sports and you have the makings of a comedy classic. Yes, it's tasteless and juvenile....but go with the spirit of it and you'll be very entertained.  I give it 3 *** stars out of 4.",Null,0,2,23 June 1999
Liar Liar," Carrey At His Best
","Jim Carrey proves himself a comic winner again....is there anything this guy can't do?  He plays a half-way normal character here, not a half-wit (as in 'Dumb And Dumber') or a cartoon character (as 'Ace Ventura' surely is) and goes for the mugging only sporadically.  In this case, less is definitely more, becaused when he lets loose, it's twice as hilarious!There are several classic comedy sequences here, with the episode where he battles a blue pen by trying to say it's RED being a particular standout (trust me....it may sound stupid as described here, but you'll be in stitches watching Carrey pull it off.)A funny, funny film that belongs in everybody's comedy film library.",Null,0,0,15 July 1999
Driven," Pure Entertainment
","Having read a few of the other reviews of this film here on IMDB, I will be the first to admit that I know virtually nothing about the racing world and how accurately it is portrayed in 'Driven.'  And I can well understand that a true race fan in-the-know- can be put off by what they see as gross inaccuracies about thesport  Having said all this, I will also say that I found this movie to be spectacularly entertaining.  There's surely nothing intellectually challenging here, but since when did we expect that from Stallone? He re-teams here with director Renny Harlin, who put him through the paces in another rousing action hit, 'Cliffhanger.'  Harlin is an ace when it comes to action, and he's proven that he can jazz up even the thinnest and nattiest of material in the past.This movie is ALL ABOUT action, and Harlin keeps things slick, flashy and fast-paced throughout. The racing sequences (especially the point-of-view shots from inside the cars) are some of the best I've ever seen committed to film and it's all accented by a thundering rock soundtrack.If you're looking for something deep and profound, stay home.  But if you're ready for a pure adrenaline rush, strap yourself in and enjoy a pedal-to-the-metal thrill ride!",Null,0,0,1 May 2001
Slap Shot," Raunchy, Rowdy, Profane, and Sidesplitting!!
","This one belongs on the list of the greatest sports comedies ever made. The humor (and the language) is some of the saltiest you'll hear in a movie but it doesn't seem excessive at all.  This tale of a minor-league hockey team having one last go at greatness is boisterous and bruisingly funny, even if you don't care for the sport itself.  As the aging captain of the team who's constantly amazed at the crazy happenings around him , Newman is at his roguish, charming best.  Rent it with 'The Longest Yard' for a perfect double-bill.  A four-star **** classic.",Null,52,61,23 June 1999
Mission: Impossible II," A Great Sequel
","The first Mission:Impossible film was a flawed but entertaining enterprise. Brian DePalma did the best he could, working with a jumbled script and reportedly clashed frequently with his notoriously control-hungry star/producer....when you take these factors into account, it's amazing that the movie came out as good as it did.  The movie was stylish and exciting, but just as often confusing.  DePalma understandably took a pass on directing this sequel, which was handed to action master John Woo. Mission:Impossible 2 is a feast for action and suspense fans, featuring plenty of Woo's trademark balletic, stylized action in service of a simple, straight-forward story that's easy to digest the FIRST time.  Excellent, slam-bang in-your-face entertainment.  Strap yourself in for a great ride!",Null,0,0,24 May 2000
Detroit Rock City," Everything You'd Expect
","'Detroit Rock City' has all the qualities a good KISS album should have.....it's loud, raucous, wild, rough, raunchy and very funny.   It's like a cross between 'Dazed & Confused' and 'Rock N Roll High School' and while it's not quite as good as either of those, it's still plenty of fun. Director Adam Rifkin keeps his camera moving and the energy level high.  The kids are all fine in their roles and Lin Shaye, as the fanatically religious holy terror mom of one of the kids stands out also.  Throw in a killer soundtrack composed of memorable classic rock hits, a few new songs and of course PLENTY of KISS classics and you have the makings of a rollicking good time.",7,1,3,13 August 1999
High Fidelity," Overrated
","I can't really see why this movie has earned such rave reviews.  I haven't read the book on which it's based, but I can only guess that what worked on the page didn't fully translate to the screen.  The film is very slow-moving and while there are occasional laughs (much of them supplied by Jack Black as an irascible record store employee)and I do appreciate the movie's obvious love and reverence to music, it's all fairly forgettable.  John Cusack's character is a mopey, whiny drag throughout the whole thing...NOT a good move to make him the main focus of the story.  It should have been more of an ensemble piece, ala 'Singles.'  Maybe Cameron Crowe should have directed this one as well, then it might have been more lively and interesting.  My rating:  ** stars.",Null,0,2,8 October 2001
