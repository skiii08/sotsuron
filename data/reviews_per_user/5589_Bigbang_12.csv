Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Liam Neeson is overrated too
","Compared to the other Star Wars movies, The Phantom Menace was disappointing. Judged on it's own merits, it was boring, bland, cheap looking, badly acted, annoying, and I wasn't even impressed by the supposed incredible special effects especially after seeing The Matrix.The entire Star Wars franchise could quite possibly be the most overrated entity in the history of human civilization. It isn't that profound. Move on. It's just a movie.The Phantom Menace was a pretty bad movie with little cultural significance.Ha ha",5,0,1,17 September 2000
The Hangover," Hey another 'guys are complete morons' movie. That's new.
","I don't find the 'dumb guy' shtick funny anymore. If I want to see guys portrayed like complete buffoons all I have to do is watch television commercials and sitcoms all day. It's getting old and played out, especially because the Apatow clan and similar movies have covered this ground over and over the past few years. This movie just threw a bunch of random crap at the screen to see if it would stick and people would laugh. I guess they did, look at the high IMDb rating. I know that happens with new movies and the rating will go down over time, but come on.How many times have we seen the 'get so wasted in Vegas and wake up married the next day, not remembering how it happened' thing? Even the recent What Happens in Vegas with Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher was a lot better than this, which proves I'm not some anal-retentive humorless guy who forgot how to laugh or can't enjoy stupid movies. The clich√©s in Hangover are endless and the humor predictable.The ridiculous plot holes don't help. There's nothing wrong with absurd moments in comedies that aren't believable to get some laughs, but come on. Personally I need some connection to reality to get a laugh. A tiger in the hotel room? And then the guy walking in the room to hand the tiger a steak, instead of just throwing it in room and quickly leaving. Totally predictable. Although it was good to see the Mike Tyson cameo, they totally wasted it with more random nonsense. It doesn't help that he's a terrible actor.Heather Graham, who I used to love, continues to throw her career in the effin garbage. Although her mere presence helped at least. Well seeing that this move got high marks from a lot of people, we'll be stuck with this BS for awhile. No one is forcing me to see them, true, but even in decent movies there's always at least one 'dumb guy' character. I'm tired of it. I can't watch one more dumb guy. Enough already.",3,42,75,16 August 2009
The Patriot," one of the worst big budget movies I've seen in awhile
","Historically accurate or not, this movie stunk. When it first came out in the theater I was looking forward to seeing it because The Revolutionary War is a very interesting subject and hasn't been adressed on film. Then I found out Mel Gibson was the star and it seemed like a sure thing. But to my shock and disappointment I found out Roland Emmerlickme of Godzilla, Independence Day and Stargate was directing it. So I waited for DVD and I got what I expected, I pile of cliche-ridden fecal matter.  I'm an American but I didn't need to be force fed how bad the British were. They should have put scrolling text on the bottom of the screen reminding anyone watching who forgot 'remember people: American=good, British=bad'. Forgot? Ok lets go burn some women and children. Let's make the villain as ridiculously inhuman as possible, as if this is a fun James Bond movie.   Some people have complained about how the subject of slavery was treated, and I see where they're coming from. However slavery is so immense it needs it's own movie, you can't possibly adequately address it here so I understand why Roland only threw in a few token moments. Unfortunately those few moments were ridiculous anyway.  Good points: Gibson was good and the cinematography was beautiful.   The Patriot was long, tedious, cringe-inducing, and did not make me feel Patriotic in the least. Roland go make a German movie and leave the flag waving to us Americans.",4,1,3,24 January 2002
Jarhead," The Gulf War: A Comedy
","This can't be how Marines act or we would have lost every war. This is how sheltered Hollywood people like Sam Mendes see our military though; like over-the-top obnoxious clowns who can barely string three words together or shoot a gun. Also I wouldn't be surprised if Mendes or the original writer of this book were gay, because way too many scenes had these guys dancing around naked and pretending to screw each other. Never have I've seen guys act this way. Not even gay guys. But this is how Hollywood feminine men like to see guys act. The most awful example is when Jake Gyllenhaal is dancing around like a fool wearing nothing but a Santa hat.The music in the background was way out of place. How can I take a movie seriously when they start playing C&C Music Factory's 'Everybody Sweat'? I felt like I was watching an MTV reality show.There were some good moments in Jarhead, and some decent acting here and there, but as soon as it started to get good, the movie would break into comedy again. Just trying too hard to be funny or absurd. The superior Full Metal Jacket, which Jarhead tried to be like, took the natural absurdity and humor embedded in war and let it speak for itself. This movie instead forces it on you. It really is in an insult to everyone involved to turn war, death and destruction into a comedy unless it's done right. Gyllenhaal's problem with his unfaithful girlfriend was also not handled correctly. This was the seed that caused him to begin to lose his sanity. However the transformation is not well done or convincing. Actually the whole movie is just a mish-mash of points trying to be made that are never really made. It's just one big mess.",4,4,7,28 January 2007
Quantum of Solace," Another male icon destroyed by feminism
","Ugh, they've ruined Bond. A perfect example of our anti-male times. Sean Connery's Bond was cool, sophisticated, and smooth with the ladies, but the most important part is he was completely unapologetic about it. No groveling and apologizing for being a man. He was a 'womanizer'...so? He loved women, enjoyed being with them, and they loved him back. What's the problem? He treated them kindly but didn't take any crap from them.They began pecking away at Bond when Pierce Brosnan stepped in. I liked Pierce as Bond, but As soon as I heard M say 'I think you're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur', I knew we were in trouble. They had to knock him down a few notches because we can't have a confident, guilt-free man walking around like that.Now with Daniel Craig, we no longer have a man anyone can look up to. He's just another charmless, humorless movie thug. All Bond's qualities have been stripped from him by the feminist tyrants and their pussywhipped male enablers. Bond was ours and that bothered them. Now there's one less male icon guys can admire, and we let it happen.",2,8,13,7 February 2010
No Country for Old Men," worthless story but great film-making
","A psychopath killing innocent people with an air gun is not deep or brilliant. Watching a defenseless old man being shot point blank in the head for no reason is not symbolic of some deeper meaning. It's a sick reflection of the Coen Brothers personal and mental problems. And enjoying this movie is the same thing as being fascinated by a car wreck and all the people laying on the street bleeding. This movie is nothing but a slasher film like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. Tommy Lee Jones character tried to throw some philosophy in there but it didn't amount to much. It's a chase film involving a bag full of money big deal.But I gave this movie 8 stars for a few reasons. The Coen brothers are experts at creating tension and suspense. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire film. They let each scene breath. Most movies force everything down your throat with quick edits and dialouge as if the filmmakers are afraid that everyone has a short attention span. The Coen Brothers trust that the audience has brains and patience, and they're right.But in order for these long scenes to work you need great actors and this movie had them. Josh Brolin was born to play this role and does a great job considering his character had little dialouge. Javier Bardem deserved the Oscar. I forgot I was watching an actor and believed he truly was a psychopath. His screen presence was overwhelming and I hung on to his every word and mannerism, wondering what he was going to do next. I think what the audience is waiting for, or hoping for in his character, is the slightest glimpse of humanity, compassion, or morality. Right before he was possibly about to kill someone, we wanted at least the slightest morsel of good to come out. That's what made it suspenseful.However, even with the excellent direction of the Coens, and the great acting, I never want to see this movie again. Innocent, kind, defenseless old men brutally killed with a device used to kill cows is not entertaining a second time. It's not deep. It's not brilliant.",8,2,7,27 March 2008
The Dark Knight," I hated this trash
","Glad to see I'm not the only one who didn't like The Dark Knight. I can step back and objectively say it was a 'good' movie on some levels, the performances, over-the-top entertainment, etc. But the bottom line is I hated it. Loud, obnoxious, pointless, and soulless. Who are these awful people? Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker, and it was impressive. He's fascinating to watch. But what is the point of his character? At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role, Heath's joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value. I don't get the point. Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining, are we that desperate?I was disappointed in Christian Bale too. He is one of the best actors working today, but this time he was kind of flat. I thought he was better in Batman Begins. This entire movie is just so over-the-top: explosions (wow an explosion, that's new), the cool looking but ridiculous motor-cycle, the millionth chase scene, repulsive characters like Two-Face, and on and on. We've seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers, and this loud, obnoxious trash is the result. We really are getting desperate.I usually agree with IMDb more or less, the ratings are usually reliable. But right now this is #5, come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie? I'm not hating it on purpose because of the hype, I liked Iron Man and that got hyped, I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped. But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash.",5,9,17,7 February 2009
Pride & Prejudice," The Keira Knightley Show
","Keira Knightley carries this movie with an outstanding performance as Elizabeth Bennet. A great accomplishment considering her very young age and the historical weight of this role; she doesn't flinch. She shows range and maturity way beyond her years and has a great future as I consider her one of the best actresses working today. Hopefully she doesn't get involved with the Hollywood partying nonsense (Lindsay Lohan etc.) and continues to take challenging roles.It took me at least 20 minutes or so to get used to this movie, there was a lot of giggling going on by the girls in the beginning that was a little off putting and it was hard to follow what was going on as I had no exposure to Pride and Prejudice in any form beforehand. So much of Austen's novel was crammed into 2 hours that for noobs like me it may be hard to decipher the nuances of who's marrying who and why. Actually, when I watched this a second time I enjoyed it a lot more.After seeing this I watched some of the 6 hour miniseries but I like this version better. The acting and dialogue here was more natural and the cinematography was superior. Not to say the mini isn't good, it's just very different. I prefer this version.All the other actors involved are excellent, including Rosamund Pike as Jane Bennet, Donald Sutherland as the father, and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, although his performance while very good may have been a tad bit understated.Director Joe Wright should be commended for generating considerable tension from what is really a simple story, **spoilers ahead** even though you know that Elizabeth and Darcy are going to eventually get together. And when they do, it such a relief! In closing I have to mention again how great Keira Knightley is in this movie, and I can't believe others would call her performance 'awful'. That's just silly come on. She steals every scene she's in, and she's in every scene!",8,2,6,13 December 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," decent follow-up
","Following up the first Matrix, which came out of nowhere and blew many people away with original visual effects, was an almost impossible task. The many rip offs of the slow motion special effects seen in commercials and other movies (Charlies Angels etc.) made it even more difficult for the Wachowski brothers. They had to go all out and try to match that same outrageuos intensity of the first movie with 'Reloaded', and I think they succeeded. A few action scenes were spectacular.   But of course they ran into the usual problem with sequels, they forget about everything else; the dialogue, the characters, and a coherent flow. 'Reloaded' taken by itself is a great action film definitely worth seeing, but compared to the first it's a disappointment. Nothing new, I'll be saying the same thing about Terminator 3 soon.",Null,0,0,24 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," very good movie
","**may contain spoilers**I really enjoyed A Beautiful Mind. At a certain point of the movie I realized I was being manipulated and that they packaged the hallucinations and delusions of the mental disease schizophrenia into something entertaining for an audience, but I let it go and it didn't bother me.After years of watching brain dead movies like Swordfish and Tomb Raider, my expectation meter is permanently set to low. So maybe a movie like this seems better than it is but the acting was great especially Russell Crowe. The dialogue was above average containing some subtle lines and didn't seemed dumbed down for the audience. Perhaps there were moments of over sentimentality, but I admit I got caught up in it and felt some emotion for the characters particularly toward the end.Some critics are annoyed that some aspects of Nash's life were left out, mostly the unsavory ones which probably made him appear a more sympathetic character than he actually was in real life. Such as that he had some bisexual experiences. I understand that criticism but look, I don't want to see John Nash take a crap on screen nor do I want to see him fooling around with another man, so those critics should shut up. I don't see how a few gay scenes would have added to the story.I highly recommend this movie and Crowe may win the best actor Oscar.",9,0,1,14 January 2002
Sin City," could have been great, RUINED with ridiculous violence.
","I'm at the point where brutal and repulsive violence for the sake of entertainment doesn't work for me. Sin City is the most original looking movie I've ever seen, and I enjoyed the faithful translation of Frank Miller's stark and beautiful artwork. The old-time film noirish dialog was well done and a pleasure to listen to. Mostly the actors did a great job in their roles, especially Mickey Rourke, and I enjoyed his story the most compared to the other 2 or 3 in the movie. It's disappointing that Sin City could have been a spectacular film achievement but was ruined for me because of the ridiculous violence. I'm not usually squeamish or a pansy , and I realize that the violence is in the graphic novels, but seeing it on the big screen is different. I think it's a cop out. It's easy to emotionally affect the audience with increasingly inventive human physical suffering, but making something entertaining through dialog, character and story is hard. Violence as entertainment is lazy. I realize that it's over the top and cartoonish, and that it obviously doesn't bother many others as we can see from the reviews here. Still, why is chopping someones arms and legs off and then letting a dog eat at the wounds entertaining? How is slicing the front of someones neck so they become a human pez dispenser entertaining? While they're still alive and talking? Yes it's funny but it's also repulsive and stupid. How is ripping someones grotesque yellow genitals off interesting to watch? Do you feel good after you leave the theater? Well, it ain't for me, which is the reason I haven't seen any of the Kill Bill's yet, and probably never will. I'm tired of the moronic brain-dead violence, call me when you develop some real talent and don't need to resort to that to entertain an audience. I only gave it a 6 out of 10.Otherwise, Sin City is definitely worth seeing. It's a stunning work of film-making art.",6,2,5,3 April 2005
V for Vendetta," Terrorism is good
","*definite spoilers*I rented 'V' because its rating is above an 8 here at IMDb, and these ratings are usually reliable. Not this time. This movie was unbearable at times. The politics were awful. I really needed Hugo Weaving to take off that mask, I wanted to see a human being. Instead we're looking at a psycho clown terrorist for 2 hours, and it's hard to understand what he's saying because his voice is muffled. Although I appreciated some of the fancy English dialogue he spouts off. Natalie Portman was good, but there's always been a soft spot in my heart for her ever since her great performance in 'The Professional' when she was a cute little girl. She's the only saving grace of this movie, she brings some humanity to the otherwise cold, dark, bleak proceedings.So his plan is to blow up the English Parliament, and he does. And everyone is happy. Why? Will a new government be formed now? Of who? People, that's who. And those people will run for office, and need a new building to house government proceedings. And these people will then be known as the 'nasty government'. And then everyone will start to hate them to, and then blow up their building. Blowing up buildings is not the answer, but the filmmakers appear to be sympathetic to this 'idea'. They appear to support terrorism.America and the United Kingdom are not perfect obviously. But they have created the best form of government in the history of civilization, where the people vote and elect who we want to govern us. Fascism is not right around the corner, as much as Hollywood seems to want it to be. Collectively we're too advanced for that. No one is going to let it happen. George Bush? Please, he isn't smart enough for that. And even if he is, guess what, he's gone in a year. In America, we elect our government officials, if we elect a fascist, then i guess that's what the people wanted. If we elect a socialist...etc.More insulting, the one book in the world most associated with terrorism, is the Koran, yet the filmmakers also seem to like that book. What a joke. And people think this movie is profound? Grow up. It's an insult. Make a movie about real terrorists, not Shakespearean English gentleman who sip tea if they weren't wearing a mask.So, while interesting and entertaining at times, and Natalie Portman's lovely presence, 'V's' politics make it an insult to anyone who understands what Democracy is.",4,5,9,20 November 2006
