The King's Speech," Touching, moving and simply amazing. The King's Speech is a true masterpiece
","I could go on for hours praising this film. I really could, everything about this film is simply flawless and it is no surprise to see it receive twelve Academy Award nominations.Tom Hooper's The King's Speech is based on the true story of King George VI (portrayed by Colin Firth) and his story of overcoming his speech impediment, and as I repeated earlier, the film is flawless in every category. The way that the different emotions of emotional pain (watching him deliver a public message in the opening scene was particularly a joyless scene in terms of emotion) to eventual joy in a very heart-warming final scene combined with comedy despite struggling through the hardest of times is what makes this film so perfect.On top of that, the acting is simply amazing. Colin Firth is simply brilliant at portraying King George VI and the hard times that he faced during his life. He is supported superbly by Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth The Queen's Mother and his wife, who proves that she is currently one of the best actresses going around at the moment, as well as Geoffrey Rush who portrays his speech therapist Lionel Logue who also proves that he was one of the greatest Australian actors of all time. All of these cast members were acting as if they weren't acting at all. Their performances were so real and truthful.All of the technical categories were superbly done as well. The 30's setting was captured perfectly, along with the amazing shots of Westminster Abby, the score is incredible and Hooper's direction is perfect. There was not a single flaw in any of the scenes.In conclusion, if you are yet to see this film, do yourself a favour and do so, you will be in for an absolute treat, this is a truly brilliant film and it is likely to be one for the ages. This thoroughly deserves a 5/5.",10,1,2,26 January 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A little disappointing
","When I heard about Borat I was thinking it could be one of the funniest movies ever made. Everyone is saying it is hysterical so I saw it with two friends. When the end credits where rolling I was slightly disappointed. When they arrived at Washington D.C I thought they were going to fun of George Bush but they didn't. How annoying. When the fat man and Borat were wrestling naked, I thought that was pretty gross.I did laugh though e.g when he was singing the Kazakhstan national anthem with the American national anthem tune was funny. When he pooed in the plastic bag was funny. Other bits were funny to.In conclusion, it is slightly disappointing but it was still pretty funny. The problem is it could've been better. I give this movie a 3/5.",8,0,2,1 February 2007
Hot Fuzz," Wright has done it again
","After making the highly successful Shaun of the Dead. Edgar Wright made a movie called Hot Fuzz and wow! what a great comedy. This movie will make you laugh from start to finish it's two hours that you will thoroughly enjoy. This is a spoof a cop movies like Bad Boys 2, Point Break etc.Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) has been asked to become Sergent in a country stupid partner, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost.) While they're om the beat they come across some suspicious deaths which Nicholas thinks they're murders (but the others think they are accidents.) All the deaths link up to one thing.Overall, I think that this is a very well made comedy. This is probably going to be one of the best films of 2007, considering the others being bad e.g. Epic Movie and Norbit.5/5. Very well made and very well done. Two thumbs up.",10,2,4,17 March 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautiful, stunning and the best film of this decade
","Let me just say, that this is the best film of this decade (easily.) I am not surprised it got a 22 minute applause at the Cannes Film Festival. It really was that good.This is set in the Spanish Civil War in 1944 and a young girl called Ofelia is sent along with her pregnant mother to live with her cruel stepfather who is the captain of the Spanish army. During the night, she meets a fairy who takes her to an old faun in the center of the labyrinth. He tells her she's a princess, but must prove her royalty by surviving three gruesome tasks. If she fails, she will never prove herself to be the the true princess and will never see her real father, the king, again. This is truly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, it was robbed of the Oscar. The Academy that year, went way downhill.Trust me, this is not a kids fantasy film. It is dark and some of the creatures will scare young children, especially the pale man who is easily the scariest fantasy creature ever made.This movie is recommended to everyone but be prepared for a tragic ending. Everything about this film is perfect. The acting, the score, the directing etc. 5/5. See it now if you haven't.",10,3,7,23 June 2007
Battleship Potemkin," Early masterpiece of cinema
",The Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest film I've seen and it is also the first silent film I've seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie so I got the tape out at home and I watched it. When it ended I just thought that this was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the real-life Russian Battleship Potemkin. You wouldn't think it but some of it was sad and disgusting. Sad being that the mother dies and the pram rolls down the stairway and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with maggots in it.Today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and Russian films ever made. I think that everyone should see it (if they can find it.) You will be presently surprised at how good it is. It's a must see classic. 5/5.,10,3,4,2 February 2007
Disturbia," Just a dumb, teen thriller
","Disturbia is a good example of a modern day, dumb teen thriller. It pretty much rips off Rear Window.The plot is very simple. A troubled teen called Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeuof)is living under house arrest and is convinced that his next door neighbor is a serial killer after spying on a girl that he likes. He becomes obsessed of unraveling the truth and in the end it becomes a matter of life and death.Overall, this was an average film. It had cheesy moments and it was rather dumb. The acting was fairly decent though. It did have some tense moments but other than that it just didn't really work out for me.I will be generous and give it a 2.5/5.",3,2,4,10 November 2007
Cars," Lovely Little Film
","This was surprisingly a good film. I had low expectations for it, I thought it was going to be American shite but it turned out to be a cute film. The plot is a pixar plot. A racing car called Lightning McQueen has to go to California for a race but is caught by the police. Of course he gets to California and does the race.This should've won the Oscar for Best Animated Film. I can't believe it lost to the crappy Happy Feet, what the academy did was an outrage.There are minor flaws to this movie though. It is a tad predictable and a little long for a kids film and the humour is a little American but overall I liked it.This is the best animated film since Shrek 2 and the best Pixar film since Finding Nemo (I didn't like The Incredibles that much.) I rank this third out of the Pixar movies, just under Finding Nemo and Toy Story. 3.5/5.",7,0,1,30 March 2007
I Am Legend," If it wasn't for the CGI this would've been a great film
","This was an enjoyable film. Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the only man left in the world (or so we think) in 2012 after a virus wipes out the rest of the human race which turns them into vicious hungry monsters. Robert wants to find a cure so in order to find it he seeks out the infected beings at night and either takes them out to survive or drags them to his underground lab for research.I was sitting in my seat thinking that this was going to be a great thriller. Then came the horrible CGI. The monsters and the lions are terribly CGI'd. They looked like they were photo shopped directly from the internet. The daytime shots were done well but at night it turned into some lame cheesy action movie. It was a real shame because this had potential to be a great thriller.Aside from that, the acting is done well and some scenes were tense with some jump scenes. 3/5.",6,1,2,7 January 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," R.I.P Harry Potter
","When the first Harry Potter movie was released in 2001. It was a really good dark fantasy film. The second one was even better. But after that it went downhill and this one is one of the worst movies ever made. How much of the book did they miss? This is probably the most rushed book to movie film ever. This is even more rushed than The Goblet of Fire. and it didn't lead anywhere. The movie didn't explain much at all and I was just sitting there thinking 'what the hell is going on?' The acting was also at a poor standard. After seeing this I don't think I will be seeing anymore Harry Potter films.In conclusion if you want to see a good movie that's been released this summer, go see Knocked up or The Simpsons Movie. Don't bother with this unexplained, rushed piece of *beep*. 1.5/5. Just awful.",3,1,3,26 July 2007
Blood Diamond," Powerful and shocking. Probably one of the best films of 2006.
","Firstly, by shocking I don't mean bad. By shocking I mean I was shocked to see how they suffered and the child soldiers. I thought that this was an excellent film and the acting was great. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job at the accent as a South African diamond smuggler considering he had one month to perfect it. Jennifer Connelly did a great job as an American journalist and Djimon Hounsou gave a stunning performance as Solomon Vandy.I haven't seen Little Miss Sunshine, Pan's Labyrinth or The Departed as many people say they are the best films of 2006 but from what I've seen so far this is the best film of 2006. I wouldn't be surprised if this won at least three Oscars. For those who haven't seen it, I urge you to see it now. 5/5.",8,1,3,30 January 2007
The Departed," Brilliant!
","The Departed is the first Martin Scorsese film I've seen and I have to say this was brilliant. This is a great adaption of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. This is well directed, well written and all of the actors were great in their roles. Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan (a rookie cop.) Matt Damon as Colin and Jack Nicholson as the evil mob boss Frank Costello. I also think it is really good how Scorsese included some clever humour. I'm not surprised that this won best picture, this is probably the best film of 2006.This has a lot of language and violence in it, as do most of his movies.I intend to watch more of Scorsese's films in the future. 5/5. A great return for him.",10,1,4,28 April 2007
Psycho," This has to be the best horror movie of all time
","Let me just say that this is not only in my top 10, it is in my top 3. This is the perfect definition of a masterpiece. It was thrilling and suspenseful and everything is flawless. The shower scene has to be one of the scariest and best made scenes of all time. But the scariest scene of the movie is when Norman's mother's rotten corpse in the fruit cellar. The way the corpse is made just makes it so scary.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her employer's client and on the run, she stops at a motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins.) Under Norman's mother's domination, he murders her.Anthony Perkins's performance is brilliant as Norman Bates and just about every other actor was perfect in their role and the twist at the end is amazing. I can't see how anyone could possibly not like this movie because to me this is one of the best movies ever. I gave it a perfect 5/5. Alfred Hitchcock is truly a director of masterpieces.",10,3,5,15 December 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Absolutely Hilarious
","Anchorman is probably the best comedy of 2000+. I was laughing so hard I almost fainted. I found myself laughing a most of the jokes and most scenes had me laughing at least 10 times. The battle of the news teams was especially funny.Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell)is a popular San Diego anchorman in the 1970's but when Veronica Corningstone (Christine Applegate) becomes a new member of the channel 5 news team. After a fight Veronica makes Ron Burgundy say 'Go *beep* yourself San Diego. Ron Burgundy gets fired and Veronica becomes the new lead Anchor and Ron know has a bad life. After several months a Panda is about to give birth and Veronica is pushed in to a Kodiak Bear enclosure. Ron Burgundy jumps in and tries to save her. After Ron yells at her for what she did the bears wake up and are about to attack them but they are saved by Ron's dog and Ron gets his job back.In conclusion, this was a very funny movie. This is highly recommended to anyone that love 2000+ comedies or anyone that wants to get a big laugh. 5/5.",10,1,3,7 February 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Inspiring and Amazing. This is my favourite film
","The Shawshank Redemption has taken place as my number 1 favourite film. I was really looking forward to seeing this and when I did, I knew I was in for a treat. This is easily the best film ever made. It's very moving and inspiring. This movie has no action scenes, just men in a prison who chat but not for one second i was bored. Frank Darabont is a great director, as he also made The Green Mile. The fact that this didn't win the seven Oscars it was nominated for makes my blood boil. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give very memorable performances in their roles. The narration, the direction, everything is flawless. The ending is very heart-warming and happy.This is the best book-to-movie adaption I've ever seen. Infinity times better than The Cat in the Hat (as that is the worst film I've ever seen.) It doesn't surprise me that it is #2 on the IMDb top 250. i recommend this to everyone who hasn't seen it. As said in my summary and the start of the review, it's not only my favourite film of the 90's. It's my favourite film of all time. You know, I'm giving this 10/5. It's just that good.",10,0,0,22 April 2007
Happy Feet," Overrated, annoying, cheesy. Don't listen to the praise
","I know many people will find this comment un-useful. Anyway, I was never looking forward to seeing this movie but a friend invited me to see this and Night at the Museum at a drive-in. I never went to a drive-in before so I decided to go. At the start I knew I made a bad mistake. The I want to make love with you song is not suitable for 5 year olds. I thought that the plot of a penguin that loves dancing was cute but then it went too far with this aliens stealing the fish business. It's predictable you know that they are humans (which they are.) The jokes were very lame e.g calling the leopard seal rubber butt. I groaned at that joke. The pros are that the animation was brilliant and the music and dancing was also good. Other than that it is a very overrated and corny movie. 1.5/5",3,1,3,30 January 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Best Animated Film since Finding Nemo
","Yes, it is that funny. This is much more entertaining than overrated films like The Incredibles and Happy Feet. I will give you a detailed plot.Lake Springfield is becoming very polluted and Lisa wants to help but has no success. With the help of an Irish boy, Colin, she is able to hold a press conference and the town agrees. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and brings it home. Marge warns him that what Grandpa said links to the pig. Later, Homer is forced to dispose of the waste properly but when Lenny tells him that Lard Lad Donuts is giving out free donuts, he dumps the waste in the lake making it very polluted. The EPA traps Springfield in a dome possibly forever. Don't leave as soon as the credits roll because there is a special treat a couple of minutes in the credits.Homer is his stupid self in this movie and some of the humour is Family Guy like humour. It feels like it's a movie length episode form season 4 and 5 because it's funny. There are a lot of funny jokes including the classic 'Spider Pig.' This is definitely a new animated classic, it's the funniest movie released this summer. Forget crap like Harry Potter, this is one of the movies of the year. Very funny and a must-see for everyone, even if you're not a fan of The Simpsons. 5/5!",8,2,7,27 July 2007
