Casablanca," Casablanca great movie
","I had alway's heard that Casablanca was a classic, but had no idea what it was actually about. The whole cast was likable and clever. My favorite character was the French man that was supposed to be working with the Germans, but generally looked out for himself. This was a common theme that I enjoyed. Every character had an agenda and it was up the audience figure it out. I have to say although the plot was explained to me, there was just so much going on and I am sure there were many subtle jokes that I missed. Again I like how a director can take such a serious issue and make it comical without losing the message. I think that this was the best black and white movie I have seen to date and will be watching it again to see what I missed.",9,0,2,11 March 2015
