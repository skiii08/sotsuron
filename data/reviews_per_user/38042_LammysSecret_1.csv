Lucky Number Slevin," Brilliant
","The story starts kind of all over the place and leaves you wondering just what's going on. But, when it finally divulges what's really going down, you are in awe because you fully didn't see it coming. This movie left me and my friends sitting on the couches with our mouths open. All we could say was, 'That was an amazing story'.I really recommend that everyone rent this movie. It's a brilliant story. They couldn't have picked a better ensemble cast. Although, Lucy Lui's character was a bit annoying, she wasn't too quirky that you couldn't fall in love with her. Since it's already out on DVD, I really suggest renting it. It won't be a waste of your money.",10,2,5,26 January 2007
