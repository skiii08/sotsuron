Moneyball," Excellent Story
","Without saying to much this film has everything you could ever want in a film great action, great acting, and a beautiful and wonderful story. The only reason I give it 9 instead of 10 was due to the way they spoiled the girls song with additions at the end. And the fact that he didn't make some decisions which could of helped him achieve more. But it is understandable some people are idealistic and place greater things, above the value of money. Which I think adds another level of depth to this well named film title.Iam from the Uk so baseball is not one of our main sports but I loved this and all the other big baseball films I've seen such as The Natural, The Babe, Field of Dreams, A League of Their Own and Mr Baseball . Which makes me see quite clearly that baseball is an exciting and wonderfully interesting game one that I'm surprised hasn't taken off worldwide in the way that basketball has.",9,0,2,24 July 2012
