The Ring," The Ring holds up with multiple viewings
","I have seen this movie 4 different times and I can sincerely say, that for me, it held up each time and kept me captivated.  Obviously, the more you see it, the more likely you are to catch things that you may have missed the first time you viewed it.  While it isn't as scary  after the first time, I found this movie to be full of suspense and disturbing and the sort of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you thinking.  If you don't like to think when watching a movie, you won't enjoy The Ring.  It is an intelligent horror movie that will leave you guessing.  And the ending was extremely refreshing...something that is needed in this genre.I give it a 10.",10,0,0,4 November 2002
