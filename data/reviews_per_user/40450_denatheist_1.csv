Blade Runner 2049," No match to the original !
","Sorry but no match to the original....I saw the original an i have to say that this sequel left me disappointed.It felt flat, without real depth from start to the end.Ryan Gosling is in no way a match to Rutger Hauer who gave the first one a touch of this 'lost cause' with his presence, charisma and formidable acting.It was visually not bad but i think they got the wrong choice with Ryan Gosling.Something was missing that turned it into a watchable movie but without the edges to make it great.So only 6/10! :-(",6,1,3,27 December 2017
