Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why it sucks less and more than you realized
","Some said the movie was too simple. In fact, the plot of Phantom Menace is a great deal more complex than any of the original three SW films. The simplicity of this one lies in the extraordinarily bland characters. In Phantom Menace, the good guys are really, really good and the bad guys are the baddest of the bad. I understand the whole 'not everyone is who they appear to be' angle, but no one is especially interesting. On the plus side, this movie does exactly what it set out to do: it introduces us to the people who will be crucial in Eps II and III, and I for one am even more excited about them than I was before. Overall, this film was a disappointment, but I truly believe that ten years down the road it will have taken its place in Star Wars history.",6,0,1,6 September 2000
