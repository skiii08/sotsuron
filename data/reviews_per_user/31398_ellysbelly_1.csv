The New World," simply familiar
","I do not know what made people like this movie this much at all.. a very familiar story, the so-called civilized man, the princess of the so-called barbarian tribe, their painful love affair etc.. it is like a standard of Hollywood, and 'the new world' is no different. besides, the movie, with the way it deals with love, is almost the same with a famous and legendary Turkish movie: 'Selvi Boylum Al Yazmalim' (aka 'The Girl with the Red Scarf') based on the novel by Chingiz Aitmatov. we cannot know if the writer watched that movie or read that novel or not, of course, and that would be a heavy accusation. yet, I can say that we have seen a better one decades before..",2,1,7,27 June 2007
