E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of the Few Perfect Movies Ever Created
","I remembered that this was on Netflix, so I popped it on, not having seen it since my teenage years and this movie came out in 1982, the year I was born, so it has been a while.Viewing this movie through adult eyes was a powerful experience. I was of course reminded of the movie from my childhood having watched it dozens of times, but I didn't anticipate how drawn in and emotional I would feel over it.Everything about this movie was perfect, every beat of events, every line, every scene. I was powerfully drawn into the lives and interaction of the three siblings, as if I was there with the family. E.T. felt like truly an empath as a creature. And the acting with the siblings and especially the Elliott character was exceptional. I can't recall any other child performances from a child that age which was so real and brilliant. I'm the type that does not become emotional at movies, almost no matter what movie or what occurs, but I was no good at the end, even knowing every scene by heart. It just drew me into the felt experience of virtually every main character. The one criticism was that I felt as a critical adult, that the flying bikes seemed like too easy a plot point but hey, it's a somewhat family movie anyways. Although it's a little heavy for a standard family film.This is one of the greatest, most perfect pieces of film making every to occur and I hope that the younger generations can appreciate ET as my generation has.",10,1,2,17 June 2016
Captain America: Civil War," I Give Huge Props to the Russo Bros
","Wow, this movie was amazing for the simple fact that it won me over. As I have become cynical and burnt out by these big budget superhero movies. So it has to take a great cinematic experience for me to care about any of these demigods and endless fan servicing.Although most of these marvel movies don't carry the weight as stuff like The Dark Knight, or the Daredevil show, for example, I generally cared about the characters and the result of the action and story. When most movies in this marvel world feel more and more flat, despite any escalation in melodrama or big action, this movie had great depth of character. The superhero parts of this seemed secondary to the interpersonal nature of the movie. The few weak points were minor, such as a few too many close up and edited hand to hand fighting scenes that were difficult to follow. Or that a few characters felt thrown in there at the ending battle. But these did not distract from the movie. I especially appreciated that the battle at the end led up to a conflict more personal at the end, which felt more epic than all the lot duking it out. Although I don't really look forwards to many superhero movies these days, despite any hype, I'm looking forwards to what the Russo brothers may do next.",9,2,8,8 June 2016
Alien: Covenant," Like a mediocre derivative of the best of the previous films
","When I first saw the trailer of this my reaction was that it seemed so similar to Alien or Prometheus that it would have to be damn good to win me over. I didn't hate it but found it lackluster and forgettable. I truly thought that the end of Prometheus signaled the origin of the xenomorph but they scrapped that and made something else that just was too convenient and took away the mystery of the creature. I had felt that it was supposed to be mysterious but it now seems kind of ruined.The characters were like a forgettable rip off of the characters of Alien and somewhat of Aliens. I just didn't get into any of them. Seemed like the same territory was tread with space jockeys in Prometheus and Alien, and done significantly better.They changed several things about the growth and character of the creatures for plot convenience that was simply inconsistent.I don't feel the effects were bad at all like some reviewers have complained about. But some creature parts at the end looked like CGI from a video game.To me it was similar to Spectre in the James Bond franchise. Rehashing what has been done before by the franchise with unnecessary layers of back story we never seemed to have asked for. Just feeling like a retread.I really don't mean to hate on this movie. It's of course Ridley's excellent direction but I just didn't feel anything for this. Love the xenomorph itself though. Still one of the greatest and most menacing creatures of all time.",4,5,12,19 May 2017
