Hereditary," If you like cheap things this one is for you
","At first I thought I was watching a low budget film. Everything was so easily cliche I just couldn't stand any of the characters. It's unrealistic with certain circumstances. Let me explain like it was a genius idea to let a teenager go to a party with his younger sister. No real parent I know would even think about that. The mother takes the cake with how truly incompetent she is it is almost infuriating. I've seen great horror films and this one is one of the worst ones. Everything is almost expected to happen with this movie. The ending where the mom is killing herself because she is 'possessed' is just probably the only thing that is considered being good, considering you know that movie will end. I also did not like the little detail of the paranormal wave the affected ones 'see' when they are being tormented by an evil 'entity'. Pathetic movie. Pathetic actors.",1,1,5,15 January 2019
