Requiem for a Dream," Amazing, Powerful, Realistic, Emotional.
","There is not at all much to say about this wonderful film. The score is so emotional, just listening to it makes you want to cry. The acting in this film could not have been better. Ever actor played their part like they were that person, and the characters do not look too easy to play.
Requiem for a Dream is one of the most frightening films I have seen, and the best horror film. And yes it is a horror film, Darren Aronofsky happens to say so in an issue of Fangoria magazine.The last sequence of this film can only be described as amazing. It's so fast paced, and so sad, I couldn't help but shed tears for each and every character.Darren Aronofsky is a force to be reckoned with, a master at what he does, a guy who crafts emotions into each scene. He is truly a cinematic genius and could very well be considered one of the best directors in this day later on in time.Requiem is not to be missed, unless you can not take the images, and the power the film has. It is the best film of the year, and one of the best of all time.",10,1,2,28 June 2001
