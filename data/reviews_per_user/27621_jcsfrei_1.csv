Requiem for a Dream," Why?
","Why watch this film? It's a continuous display of disgrace over disgrace. It's just sad and awful. And BORING. It goes on, and on, and on and then it ends, with the characters suffering more and more disgraces. Is that really amusing? Is that really shocking? Is that really enlightening? Is this film really going to change somebody's thinking about drug addiction? What is this film for? To show that drugs can kill you and ruin your life? Sorry, I didn't know that... At last, I told myself: 'Well, I saw this terrible movie while I could be doing so much better things. The next time I wish to see boring and sad things, I might just watch the news...'",1,8,17,1 January 2004
