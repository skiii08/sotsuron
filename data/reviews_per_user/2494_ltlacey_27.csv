National Treasure: Book of Secrets," The Gates Family wants to clear their family name as being part of the plot to assassinate President Lincoln
","Note to Hollywood: Stop making sequels, especially if the original was not that great to begin with. The only sequel that has, so far, been decent, was Shrek 2, but that's another review. This sequel to the first movie was so ludicrous, well, where to begin? At least with the first movie, most of what happened was plausible. But in this sequel it would be hard-pressed for a 6-year old to buy into the fact that someone could break into Buckingham Palace, let alone into the Queen's private office, AND get into the Oval Office without a troop of Secret Service personnel everywhere. Then there's the issue of why The Bad Guy (played by Ed Harris, and unfortunately not convincingly) was now presenting evidence of a conspiracy, but the FBI never went after that angle. Yea, he wanted Ben Gates (Cage) to lead him to the treasure, but why not do that sooner, since the Gates character had been around looking for treasure for years? What we have here is an almost duplicate of the first movie, virtually line by line, with the added character of the mom (Mirren, who is miscast, but at least gives us something to look forward to), and Cage with a bad haircut and color job. That there is a 3rd in the making... Let's hope that in the 3rd installment that Cage gets a better barber.",1,4,7,7 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," An over-weight and out-of-shape panda is chosen to be the new Dragon Master
","Maybe I missed something in this movie, but I thought it was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite some time. At least for adults. True, there were a few cute jokes, but how many jokes can be done at the expense of the panda being fat and flabby before the audience, even children, say Okay, we got it. The theater was about 2/3 full and for most of this movie people were getting up to leave; adults and children. A man a few seats down was snoring, which was one of the more entertaining aspects of this movie. Some of the dialogue was muddled and some of the action so fast it was hard to keep up and not get a headache. It had a nice basic plot, which was okay, but there were aspects of this movie that were not fully developed, and this included character development. For example, when Po asks his dad if he's really his dad (since the dad was a duck). I would have liked to see more development of the main characters, other than Hoffman's, as that would have at least added something to the movie for the adults. And apparently not too many kids liked this movie either, at least on the day we went, since throughout the entire movie they were talking, and not about the movie. And for the most part, the voices for each character fit, but Black's voice for Po just did not work well for the personality for the character on screen. It seemed like Black was holding back, which is too bad, since, like Robin Williams, for example, you let them go and what comes out is pure magic. Even in animation and the dialogue is more scripted.",1,12,37,5 July 2008
Star Trek," The back story of how It All Began...with some comedy tossed in
","This was neither horrible, nor was it that good either. I grew up, somewhat, watching the original series, and have seen a few of the movies, and what could have been a fairly decent account of how they all ended up on the same ship just did not cut it for me. I think we could have had a fairly decent movie, you know, how everyone ended up where they did (Enterprise) and some basic history on more than just Kirk and Spock, without so much falderal concerning some Romulan with a grudge against a Vulcan. Needed more about the hows and whys on that one; or I dozed through it. And portraying Kirk as some James Dean wannabe was a tad over the top for me. Though I did like the fact that the young Spock was 'getting some.' Lots of plot holes that needed to be filled, and about 30 minutes that could have been sliced too. But if you are a Die-Hard Trekkie, then you'll love this movie. If you are only a somewhat DHT then there will be some eye rolling, but for the most part you'll feel like you did not waste your time.",5,3,7,13 January 2010
Superbad," Two high school seniors try to score some booze so that they can attend the party of one of the cool kids.
","Okay, I have to start this out that I barely made it through 20 minutes of this movie before I just had to turn it off. Maybe it's my age, but I have watched other 'teen' and 'young adult' flicks and found them at least cute. This movie should be renamed Super Awful. But the original title works just as well when describing this flick. I found none of the jokes funny, that the heavier kid had to use a 4-letter word every other word (or so it seemed), that the geeky kid was referred to as a homo, and well, just the general way they talked to one another, all this made the movie a major turn-off. I am around young people this age quite a bit (teacher), and have a son this age, and even he said he could not watch this horrible movie. My son at least made it to 30 minutes before he said he was not wasting one more second on this drivel.",1,17,30,7 May 2008
Juno," A year in the life of a 16-year old girl who finds herself pregnant.
","After all the hype about this movie I was expecting something absolutely wonderful. Yes, Ellen Page can act, and her role in the movie Hard Candy proves this, and her role as Juno was played perfectly as a quirky, smart, and sarcastic teenager, but basically this movie was a letdown and actually quite boring. Maybe because there was so much hype leading up to the movie. I did like the fact that the parents did not have a meltdown upon hearing that she was pregnant, and their little talk after she left the room was actually quite funny. The role of the hapless and clueless, but supporting, boyfriend worked, but only for so long. And what was it with Jennifer Garner's facial expressions? She looked like she had had 20 injections of botox and actually looked quite emaciated. Allison Janney is such a great actress, but her talents were wasted in this movie.",6,1,7,18 April 2008
Yes Man," A man who usually says no to everything is convinced to say yes to everything instead.
","The first twenty minutes of this movie looked promising, and actually was fairly good, but then it went downhill, and kept gaining speed as it went further and further downhill. What could have been a decent movie turned out not to be. Part of the problem is Carrey, who is getting too old to be playing such silly parts. There is a difference between silly, which can be fun, and stupid silly, which is just, well, stupid. As an actor ages there are some elements that made them famous in the first place that need to be matured and developed. There is nothing entertaining watching a man in his 40s behaving like someone in his 20s. And it's worse for women. Zooey D. was a total waste in this movie, and her monotone voice is getting old. The same advice goes for her. Liven it up, or just pigeonhole your career into the bored character that comes up with short and snappy lines (Big Trouble). And we won't even go there about the scene with the elderly neighbor. Shades of Grandma's Boy, without the good lines and younger characters. If you're a Carrey fan, wait until you can get it for free at the library.",3,12,18,7 April 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," The sequel to the first Hellboy.
","What happens when you combine Independence Day, Men in Black, I, Robot, Unconditional Love, Lord of the Rings, Galaxy Quest, Total Recall, and for good measure toss in some Barry Manilow? You get Hellboy II. What happened? What made the first movie much better was the sardonic wit of the main character and a story that kept on track. And though Perlman does deliver some wry comments, most of them really do not work. We start the movie out with a back story of how Hellboy was discovered then fast forward to when he is around 11, waiting for Santa Claus to come down the wood stove and wants a story from Father before he brushes his teeth and goes to bed. Father then tells the tale of the Golden Army. Fast forward again and we have The Bad Guy, out of exile from the time when mystical creatures made a pact with the human race, and he wants it all back. In all of this we have the story of Hellboy's and Liz's relationship, on the rocks and on fire (sorry), and Abe's first love. I don't know what else to say. Either you will totally like this movie or like a lot of us hope that there is not another sequel coming.",5,2,3,16 November 2008
Megamind," Do you have to be a super hero to be a 'super' hero?
","First off I want to say that this movie is aimed more for adults, since I doubt too many people under a certain age will get the jokes related to the original Superman movies, Marlon Brando doing his Godfather voice, and how the music linked in perfectly with what was going on. When 'Bad To the Bone' started to play I about fell on the floor I was laughing so hard. This is what made the movie an absolute hoot and very enjoyable: not only the script but the excellent use of music throughout the movie. Even the slower, more This Is Who I Am scenes worked because the music made it work even better. I loved the rivalry between Megamind and Metro Man, and the 'friction' between Megamind and Roxanne (he's had a crush on her from Day One), as it somehow made me think of some scenes from coming-of-age films, most notably some scenes from Diary of a Wimpy Kid. This is not to say that kids will not enjoy the movie, but a lot of the jokes will go right over their little heads. All of the adults in the theater were laughing their heads off, and I saw a few kids looking around at us, probably wondering what was so darn funny.",9,1,2,15 December 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," A poor lad is tossed out of his home at age 14 and makes a name for himself with his music.
","The songs are great. So just sit back, close your eyes, ignore the dialogue and what else is going happening on the screen, and wait for the music. The rest of the movie is just awful. Maybe I'm too old for Judd Apatow, since I find a lot of his movies very juvenile, and this movie is about as juvenile as it gets (but with actors too old to be doing this). And though I have seen some 'juvenile' flicks that are funny, I did not find one thing funny, or even clever, about this movie. The jokes were forced, the dialogue seemed something out of a Ma and Pa Kettle movie, and every single stereotype came across as not funny at all. I also thought, as some did, that the casting was wrong. Not that I do not like John Reilly, but lately he's been in some real bombs (Step Brothers comes to mind). John and Judd: You can do better.",1,1,5,9 April 2009
Tropic Thunder," A group of actors are dumped in the middle of nowhere so that they can learn how to act the part of real soldiers.
","When I first read about this movie (I had read no reviews) my first thought was this was a copy of Galaxy Quest. And in a way it is. The usual Fish Out of Water scenario, but this time the actors are forced to learn how to learn how to play military personnel since not one of them is able to do so and somehow end up being put down too far away from the movie set. Stiller is one of those actors that you really like him, or just tolerate him, or you cannot stand is grandstanding. It seems lately that most of his movies, other than Night at the Museum, he's showing off his great body. I had to turn on the English subtitles because I could not understand a lot of what the actors were saying, and this was not just Downey's part. Black, I do not know what to say, as he seems to get stuck in the same type of roles and I sure would love to see him branch out more. There's a lot of talent there and I think it's getting wasted. Same with Stiller. Diversify guys! But the premise of the movie is, as stated above, your proverbial fish out of water story, with a lot of special F/X tossed in. Also a lot of noise, which drowns out the dialogue. The story goes along according to plan, and you can figure out what will happen in the next scene fairly easily. This is not to say that the movie does not entertain. I think that was the main point. Forget a plausible storyline and believable characters and just let loose. I got the feeling that a lot was improvised, and if so, then maybe these were the areas in the film that were the best. At least for me. Pay special attention to the 1st few minutes when it's a true parody of movie trailers. This is the funniest few minutes in the entire movie, and one I went back to watch again.",6,0,2,18 November 2008
Enchanted," Fairy tale maiden in animated Disneyland setting gets sent to the real and unanimated world of New York City because the evil queen does not want to lose her throne.
","I must admit that my husband and I had no idea what to expect from this movie, other than what we had read in reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies we have ever seen. Usually when a movie is this bad we stop watching the movie, as we feel it is a waste of our time, but for some reason, inertia most likely, we stuck it out. We also thought that maybe it would get better. We were wrong. Other than when the dragon appeared near the end of the flick, the rest of the movie was painful to sit through and sickeningly sweet. Even the special FX we thought were sub-par. And the chipmunk, when in NY, was not that cute or funny. Not when one compares talking animals from other flicks.",1,9,30,23 March 2008
No Country for Old Men," A hunter comes across a drug deal gone bad and takes off with the money. Unfortunatelty, the person who 'owns' the money tracks him down.
","We read the book, which was one of the best books we have ever read, and we read a lot, but knew right away that it would be a challenge to make a movie out of McCarthy's masterpiece since a lot of what is going on in the book is what a character is thinking. How to portray that on film? We give the Coen brothers props for trying, but overall, this was one of the most boring films we have ever watched, and it would have been more so if we had not already read the book; therefore, we knew what was going on (what a character was thinking during one of the many scenes without dialogue). Sure, there was some superb acting, especially Javier Bardem, as no one I think could have done creepy, but in not such a creepy way, as well as he did (think Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd.). Having seen only 1 of the other nominees (Juno, also over-rated but more entertaining at least), we cannot judge just how this movie compares to the other 3 that were nominated. We guess it was a judgement call, and this movie won.",4,1,4,20 April 2008
2012," The end of the world is coming!
","I've devised a new rating system. No more 1 through 10, but rather how many 'Oh, brother' outbursts a movie receives. 2012, about what will happen when the world ends, got so many 'Oh, brother' I lost count. First off, at 2 1/2 hours this movie is at least 60 minutes too long. Of course we have to have our resident villain (Platt) and our resident hero (Cusack). Now toss in every disaster movie ever foisted on the public, and of course a lot of special F/X (and really not that spectacular), and you get this movie, in and of itself its own major disaster. If you are scientifically minded, or just logical, you're going to exceed 100 'Oh, brother' in the first hour. If we had to see one more car or plane out-running some natural disaster we were going to squeal for mercy. And yes, we could have stopped watching this flick, but it was on our Movie Club List. Question: If the world is going to end, who do you stock the Ark with? Older, or obscenely wealthy (like money is going to be worth anything in a new world?), people who cannot procreate or contribute anything, or young, healthy people with knowledge and skills needed to start a new world? Glad to hear that this is this directors last time doing a disaster movie. Nothing like NOT going out with a bang.",2,0,2,4 March 2010
The Mist," After a major thunderstorm a mysterious mist envelopes a local community with monstrous results.
","Usually, making a movie out of a Stephen King book has not been that successful, at least in my opinion. A lot gets lost from book to screen, but this movie somehow manages to work. The premise is your typical SK storyline: Something Is Out There (sorry for stealing that title) but we do not know what it is, and when we do find out, we do not know where it came from or why. After a major storm hits a local town a strange mist appears from the mountains. An area the military (same old theme, but we have to have a scapegoat or villain somewhere, and the gov't is such an easy target) is stationed doing something secret. Our local hero heads to the grocery with his son to pick up some supplies, and we start out with a fairly large cast trapped inside the grocery store when the mist appears and one of the residents says that something grabbed his friend outside. Before long the people figure out that there is a monster outside, but are not too sure just what or how many. After a few victims and some of the mysterious creatures get inside the store, all believe now. One of the characters is a very religious woman who claims that all that is happening is exactly what happened in the Old Testament, and soon her followers grow in numbers and we then must have our first sacrifice. For most of the movie the plot follows your typical horror movie, and the audience, at least those that read the story, know what will happen. But this is where it gets good. Though the acting was mediocre, even by some outstanding actors (in other flicks), and the alien creatures are done okay, and one cannot stop the feeling that this is a cross between Evolution (with David Duchovny) and War of the Worlds (with Tom Cruise), we somehow know that this is going to be about the same as most other movies with the same basic plot. Until we get to the very end of the movie. Five people manage to make it out of the store and decide to keep on driving until they run out of gas or get out of the mist, and of course they run out of gas. Now what? They are surrounded by the mist and know what waits for them out there. Some notes on the message board say that they do not like the ending and how could a father kill his own son, but in the movie the son cries to and begs his father to not let the monsters get him. So what to do? What would any parent do? There are 5 people and 4 bullets. Do you wait for the monsters to get you or do you end it quickly and sacrifice only yourself to a horrible death? I personally liked the changed ending as it made more of an impact when our hero realizes that the 4 people he shot were killed in vain. A lot of SK stories leave the reader wondering what happened, and the different ending in the movie, IMO, actually made what was an okay movie into a much better movie.",8,0,2,19 July 2008
Shrek the Third," The third installment of the Shrek series.
","Of any sequel to any movie I have ever seen, Shrek the Third has to be the worst I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. When a movie is this bad I usually will stop watching it, but I thought that maybe it would go somewhere. Well, it did. Reference the movie title, Flushed Away. This is what anyone who was connected to this farce should have insisted on happening. The storyline is plausible. The King is dying and must name an heir. At first Shrek is asked to become the new King, but the little experience Shrek has had with being royal has not worked out. The scene where he and Fiona are all decked out in royal attire is painful. Not just to the characters, even though they were just drawn, in wearing such uncomfortable clothing, but to the viewer who must endure this torture as well. So off our hero and his side-kicks must go and get the next in line, a wallflower-type geek, Arthur. Oh yea, before they are out of earshot Shrek learns that he will soon be a dad. I have read that some people say that it's because of Justin Timberlake that this movie was ruined, but like everyone else, all he supplied was a voice. A monotonous, squeaky one, but a voice just the same. In fact, it seemed from what I could tell just by listening to everyone's voices, that no one seemed to be really into their characters at all. Jokes and scenes that worked well for the 1st 2 movies did not work for the 3rd movie, and in fact, besides being stale, no longer had any appeal. That there is a 4th, and possibly a 5th Shrek, is scary. Be afraid. Be very afraid.",1,13,16,28 April 2008
The Hurt Locker," The latest in what I fear is a long-line of Irag war movies
","I wish I could write more about this movie, but the filming style made me nauseated, so I did not last very long. I heard more than I saw, and what I heard made me go, HUH? for a lot of it. Which probably means I needed to see what was going on up on the screen. But what little I did see, and hear, I was not that impressed. I am not a military person, nor am I that fond of war movies, but I wanted to give this one a chance since I had heard a lot of good reviews. My guess, especially after reading the blogs and other reviews, is that like so many 'Hollywood' movies, this was yet another in a long line of over-hyped mediocrity. That the Oscar for best movie seems to be between this one and Avatar (ZZZzzz, though is visually stunning) amazes me, and is probably why I take anything and anyone nominated with a large grain of salt. But back to THL. Since I was just hearing most of it (having left my Dramamine at home) what I have to say is based on dialogue, and what dialogue there was (maybe more of us should watch movies this way!) was lame, and oftentimes I was thinking, No one talks like that, especially with bullets whizzing by.",2,5,12,15 February 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A story inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's story.
","Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. One, the movie WAS too long and a good 30 minutes could have been lopped off easily. Second, if you are going to use actual places, events, and people then make sure the history is correct. Third, and I am experiencing this more and more with movies, there is too much mumbling going on, background noise (music, general noise) that blocks out dialogue, and some scenes are so dark you cannot tell what the hooey is going on. Works with horror flicks (the darkness), but not with something like this movie. And fourth, asking an audience to ignore the fact that the characters in the movie do not make any sort of Big Deal out of the fact that this man was getting younger goes well past what one should expect from an audience, as well as the script. This was the dawn of a new age, and advances in medicine and all that. Wasn't anyone curious? Now on to the good stuff. Thank goodness the makers of this movie did not follow Fitzgerald's actual story, as that story was quite stupid (IMO). Visually, other than when I could not see what was going on, this movie was a treat for the eyes. The music was perfect for what was going on. Blanchett carried the movie (though, when her character was a dying old woman in the hospital with her daughter I could not understand a lot of what she was saying), as we all expected, and what little we saw of Swinton was well worth the wait. Even Pitt was okay, and I am far from a fan of his. I do not understand how some people did not get the link with the clock. Think of this story as a fantasy, and it all works. I'd love to talk more about the link between BB's birth (and death) and the clock, but go and watch the movie and figure it out for yourself.",7,0,2,8 May 2009
Clash of the Titans," A remake of the classic
","And yet we have another, in a long line of barely mediocre movies, that is nothing but ear-splitting, headache-inducing drivel. There are millions of people starving all over the world. Quit wasting money on stuff like this movie. Now, I did watch the original, and it was OK (OK, no one and nothing can beat the 'heart and soul' of Ray Harryhausen), but this remake is a mishmash of mythology and the ever-lasting battle between not only man and gods, but the gods themselves. What is so sad is the resume of most of the actors is stellar, but somehow each and every one of them got lost in a crappy script, overdone action scenes, characters that were not necessary to the plot, and well, the list goes on. When the short scene with the mechanical owl showed up I thought we'd finally get something interesting. But alas, the owl was tossed aside, just as the decision to not go ahead with this movie was. What a waste.",2,3,4,6 September 2010
Avatar," Once again we have a greedy group pulling eminent domain on another.
","First off, this movie is absolutely visually stunning. But then so is an art museum. Second, the technology behind it all is amazing. But then so is a visit to MIT. And last, we have yet another overly hyped movie that turns out to be not as great as the media for it leads one to believe. The plot was predictable and trite and done so often, in real life, literature, theatre, and the movies, one just wants to scream, or leave, which some people in the theater did (those who were not snoring that is). And maybe if there was more than just a single indigenous clan on Pandora the tribe would not be so peaceful. Think about that one: All one has to do is look at our own history. But what bothered us the most was that a lot of the action was fast and furious, thus we could not 'see' it all. Some of us had to look away, close our eyes, or as I like to do, blur my vision; otherwise, it's Dramamine Time. And maybe if there was more to the plot, like a second tribe, and then all the tribes on Pandora get together to chase the humans off of their land, we would really have had something to work with. But if you want to be blown away with extraordinary F/X and not need a lot of brain cells to keep up with what is going on, then this is the movie for you.",6,1,2,5 February 2010
The Happening," A mysterious element is causing people to commit suicide.
","Is it me, or is each subsequent Shyamalan movie getting worse and worse? Where to begin. Well, the premise of the story is okay, but it's been done. Try watching the original, Day of the Triffids. Not the remake ('Hollywood', stop remaking classics!). Second, the script. The dialogue was stilted and made no sense most of the time. Here we are with the 'plant guy' who all at once tells us it's the plants. Okay, he knows botany, but how does he know what's going on when the only news that has been given out is that the country is under attack from terrorists? Oh, I know. Watch out for that daisy, there's a hidden toxin under those petals. And the acting. Even more stilted than the dialogue. And those facial expressions. What was this, acting class 090? And as previously noted, every single actor in this movie, okay the main actors, were not right for the part. Even Buckley, who is a fantastic actress, could not save her character's role. It made no sense. Shoot, the entire movie was a waste of time. Or as my hubby likes to say, There's 90 minutes I'll never get back. Mr. Shyamalan, your talent seems to have been blown away in the proverbial breeze.",2,1,4,5 December 2008
Hancock," A super hero that turns out not to be so super after all.
","When you need special F/X to make money on a movie, why bother with actors? Wait, they tried that with WALL-E and that movie pretty much failed as well. Hancock is yet another movie in, what I fear, will be a longer and longer line of disappointments. Smith is okay, not one of our greatest actors, but for the most part entertaining in most of what he does. I read that the part was first offered to Chappelle, which probably would not have made this movie any worse, or maybe better, since no one expects much out of him. Audiences do expect more from Smith and when he fails, as they all do, we seem to be more harsh, myself included. Theron, an award winner no less, well, I wonder what she was thinking when she considered this role. What we have is a down-and-out super hero who no one likes since whenever he saves someone he seems to cause more damage than if he did not. He's a depressed and lonely guy, but we only know this because another character tells us so. Otherwise, the audience figures he's just a drunk, but does not know why. In the first scene with Smith and Theron we all figure out that something is going on, and know that she probably has the same powers he does. The scene where they kiss then she slams him out of the house with a fridge made no sense. Of course we do not find out the why to all of this GO AWAY! from Mary until the end of the movie, so you have to sit around until then, or do what a lot of people do lately, and fast forward. But what really ruined this movie, other than a bad script, robotic-like performances with monotone dialogue, and over-done F/X, was the jittery camera work. Talk about needing some Dramamine before watching.",3,10,17,25 November 2008
WALL·E," After years of polluting the Earth humans have left, and all the remains is 1 robot to clean up the mess.
","Let me get the ratings over with first. If you are one of those people who are very concerned about our planet, and you happen to be under the age of 7, then you will probably like this movie and rate it very high. If, on the other hand, even if you are concerned about our planet and are not a little kid, you most likely will hate this movie. Not because of the message it is trying to convey, which is an important one, but because overall this is one of the most boring movies ever, even though visually this is one of Pixar's better achievements. If I had not had to watch it I would have turned it off after 9 minutes, and I usually give movies at least 20 minutes to get going. It took a good 35 minutes before anything of interest happened. So a good 1/3 of the movie is just WALL-E going about his business, compacting trash, and keeping items that he found interesting, making himself a little life and home with the trash humans left behind. He even had an old VHS musical that seemed to keep playing the same 2 scenes. His only interaction is with a cockroach (well acted I might add). Then one day a ship drops off a robot that is in search of plant life. This robot, which happens to be a girl (I had no idea there were girl and boy robots, but hey, this is 700 years in the future, so why not?) gets the interest of WALL-E, and he falls in love with her. When she leaves the planet he hitches a ride on the space craft. From there it got a tad more interesting, but only because we now had more characters, robotic and human, and some actual action (with good and bad robots of course), but the interaction between WALL-E and EVE was still dull (shades of Short Circuit and Electric Dreams...kind of). And we are also shown what will happen to humans when they have robots do everything for them and they spend all their time sucking down some drink and sitting/sleeping in chairs only watching 'TV.' Wait, aren't some of us already there? The plot was predictable, even down to the ET-like 'Don't leave me' scene. And in the end the Earth comes back (of course, since those that ruined it left). The audience is then left with a ray of hope that the humans have learned a lesson. Yea, right. I will always wonder if the writers kept going and showed that the fat humans who did not know how to do anything would say ENOUGH! and shuffle back to the comfy life they once knew.",5,4,10,19 November 2008
Music and Lyrics," A 'has-been' pop singer needs to write a song for a young singer in a few days.
","This movie, even with all the continuity issues, like Drew's hair color or what finger Hugh's ring was on, was actually kind of cute. Sure, there were problems with the movie, and all the continuity goofs were the major factors for the problems, but if you just sit back and listen to the dialogue and music and not focus on the minute details, you'll hear some very funny lines and get to listen to some fairly good music. Grant's snappy comebacks, all done with his typical serious face, and in some cases where he is being quite serious, are very funny, and Barrymore carries off being a total kook quite well. One of the funniest scenes in the movie occurs when Grant's character, Alex, is performing at a school reunion and he's doing his signature move, and because of his age hurts himself. He's also winded and ends the song sitting down, waving to the audience, who do not seem to notice, or care, that he's finishing the number in such physical distress. And Kristen Johnson as Sophie's older sister is a hoot. The dynamics between her character and the husband, as well as the dynamics between the sisters meshes well.",8,0,0,6 July 2008
Beowulf," The epic legend of Beowulf
","CGI aside, this was a very disappointing movie. Yes, I have read the epic poem, along with a translation, and not because I had to when I was in school. It's a wonderful story and a good read regardless. What ruined this movie for me was not that the decision was made to not just do a direct movie and to make it using CGI, or that the movie strayed from the epic poem, since so many movies based on great works get changed, but the way the lines were delivered throughout the movie. That, and the fact we had to turn on the English subtitles to get it all. Other than some of the dialogue between Grendel and his mother. What were they saying to one another? It felt like every line, some actors were worse, or maybe it was intentional to make them seem like idiots, were halting and robotic. Word-pause, word-word-pause, all throughout. No one talks like that. Okay, those who are hearing impaired might do so. And those in badly edited movies. Yes, this was beautiful to look at, especially Wright-Penn (when is she not?), and for some reason her lines were not so halting. Why is that? Because she refused to speak as she knew no one really did? And the actor who portrayed Beowulf, well, hot bod, but not so hot of an actor, at least in this movie. And the cast was littered with award-winning actors. Fix the sound (delete out all that 'white space'), don't keep it so dark so we cannot see everything (another complaint I have, and not just with this movie), and re-release this film.",3,0,0,15 December 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," An uneducated orphan makes it to a popular game show and manages to answer all the questions.
","First, I'll get out of the way what did work in this film. One, the scenery and cinematography. Two, though cleaned up, the abject squalor one sees in India, even in areas of prosperity. Three, that the audience is shown, for the most part, how Jamal knows the answers for most of the questions. That aspect of the film I really liked, and how his past was revealed through these questions. Otherwise, this film was a mess. First off, I found this movie one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I had no sympathy for any of the characters, even though we get a decent back story on the 3 main characters. None elicited any emotions from me whatsoever. The acting was sluggish, and for the most part, actually quite bad, and by most everyone in the film. I could see why the production company had so much press, even negative, to promote this movie. Another problem I had was that for a lot of the Hindi spoken we did not get subtitles, and some of it was important to the story. And though I noticed that all these uneducated, lower caste people spoke such good English, for some reason this did not bother me. Much. A 'smart' street kid would learn a major language; otherwise, how else to survive? Well, that's how I saw it. And I waited a long time (Netflix) to get this movie, only to take 5 hours to get through it. It's a basic love story (for a girl; for one's brother; for one's life), and a story of how even the lowest can 'make it' (have to have that happy ending you know), so if you want that, then this is the movie for you.",3,11,16,26 June 2009
The Proposal," A Canadian's work visa has expired and she needs to find a way to stay in the USA.
","I wish that I could say, Welcome Back Sandra Bullock, but that's not going to happen. I think the major issue with this movie is the genre it got stuck with. This was not a romantic comedy, but more of a movie about one's relationship(s) with others; specifically one's parents. So this movie was more of a Ryan Reynolds' vehicle than anything else. And if we stay with that premise, then I would have liked to see a lot more back story of why and how the father and son were so at odds with one another and some resolution, or at least know why the dad changed his mind (other than his own wife telling him to get his ^%$# together or the grandmother having to fake a medical emergency to get them to get along). That was much more interesting than the stale premise of a guy who deep down really loves the harpie he works for, or any of the (physical) comedy antics (which were not funny at all) Bullock tried to pull off. So much of this movie just was not plausible (the IM-ing at work and that she would never know about it comes to mind). But what really made me roll my eyes was the scene where Bullock is naked (you can so tell there was some body stocking, or something, going on there and that she was not naked) and she's covering herself up in front of a little dog. Please. We could have done without that totally, and just have her dash out to get a towel and run into Ryan. SB needs to move on, like some many other actresses her age, to roles that fit her maturity. Maybe that will happen with The Blind Side. Keeping these fingers crossed.",4,3,3,20 November 2009
The Soloist," The real-life story of a journalist and a musician
","And yet we have one more in a growing series of mediocre movies with lots of hype before release to get the public all excited (usually for naught). What is it with Hollywood and the drivel coming out with another not-very-interesting movie? Yet, the actual story about Ayers, and even Lopez, is interesting. Too bad that this movie did not, or could not, convey their story better. Or maybe this movie did portray exactly how the relationship was/is: Boring. But what got me, and is bothering me more and more, is the fact that actors are mumbling more and more. Downey has always been a fast talker, and mumbler, and Foxx, playing Ayers (with his associated psychiatric issues) portrayed a mentally disturbed individual fairly well, but if the audience cannot understand or hear (also because of too much or too loud background noise), what is the point of making the flick? Think I want to spend most of my time 'rewinding' to a previous scene so that I can figure out what was just said? I say enough of this already. Pay attention to where the microphones are. Tell actors to slow down their speech. And quit mumbling!",4,1,2,7 August 2009
