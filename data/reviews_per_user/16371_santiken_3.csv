Casablanca," Top 5 movies of all time...
","I think you can judge a movie by how many times you watch it...I have watched Casablanca over 50 times! The characters, the location, the music and the story all come together perfectly to form a masterpiece that never grows tiring. This is a movie that definitely grows on you. The first time I watched it I was somewhat confused by the story but after a few more viewings I fell in love with the movie and all the personalities. Rick is a character that exudes leadership and it shows by how much his staff at Rick's respect and love him so very much. They seem so genuine and that feeling of love rubs off on you and suddenly you find yourself loving and respecting Rick as well. It's these types of emotions that make this movie so powerful. The music is another element of the movie that stirs up your emotions from the scene at Rick's where Laszlo is singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's 'Vive La France!...just so very inspiring. You must see it for yourself...but please don't judge it on the first viewing...give it a few tries on a cold dark night and I promise you will fall in love with this movie.",10,2,4,12 November 2010
Coraline," 2d is beautiful, 3d is full immersion!!!
","To watch this movie in 2d is to watching the 7 star version. To watch in 3d on a 65 inch Panasonic Plasma 3d TV and the 3d BluRay version DVD is mind blowing and a feast for not only the eyes but for touch...yes, some of the scenes were done so well it felt like you could reach out and touch them in my living room. I would say they were even better than Avatars 3d which up to this point I thought was the most spectacular...but this stuff is just so good, so real, a whole different kind of TV. 2D Blu Ray even though it's super sharp, super colorful, just cannot compare to the added visual power of 3D and that's where the movie takes off...forget the storytelling, forget the characters, even though many were quite interesting, and sit back and enjoy immersion TV...some day they will make a 3d movies were the story is equal to or better than the visuals and then it will be a new dawn in television.",10,8,10,27 June 2011
Schindler's List," I hate Hitler and Nazi Germany!!!
","Watching this movie made me absolutely furious...why didn't anyone have the balls to stand up to these Nazi criminals?!!! Why didn't we bomb Aushwitz? Why didn't we stop these arrogant losers? I have nightmares about this stuff...the ghettos, the gas chambers, the skeletons...all of it. I just don't know how an entire intelligent nation could let this happen...Hitler was a blowhard who couldn't even hold a steady thought during his disgusting, burping tirades. My God, the minute this idiot starting spouting any kind of prejudiced hatred nonsense he should have been carted away. What kind of leader talks like this? ...I don't care how bad the unemployment was or how bad the economy was, or how hungry the people of Germany were. Total BS and just another excuse for hatred of another human being. Aryan blood and ethnic cleansing..? Good Lord, it sounds like something from a science fiction movie. What an insane point in human history it was for this to have happened. Makes me ill that this happened on our beautiful planet...humans can be so very evil at times. Anyway, this movie is very realistic and will generate an emotional response.",10,0,2,18 May 2011
