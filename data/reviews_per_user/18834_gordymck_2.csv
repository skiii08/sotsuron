Hereditary," Walked out!
","I walked out of cinema half-way through, which in hindsight is a whole hour more than I should have waited. This was dull, uninspiring, not scary, and didn't make me care about finding out any more.Initially I was impressed with the 7.7 IMDB rating and the first positive critic reviews in the list, which made me optimistic that it was likely worth seeing. I now wish I had scrolled through the reviews and read the Observer columnist review... it sums it up.",3,5,12,29 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Visually stunning, philosophically satisfying
","Don't be dissuaded by all the negative reviews about this film; just go and see it yourself before making up your mind. The vast amount of negativity on IMDb has started to seem like a deliberate smear campaign either against Disney or the director; but none of it seems to make much sense.For me, having grown up with Star Wars from it's beginnings with Episode IV, I've seen the evolution of the franchise from a somewhat mediocre sci-fi movie with an interesting backstory; to a phenomena with a growing philosophy regarding the Force, those that interact with it, and it's parallels in the ancient spiritual traditions of the real-world. For this reason, particularly this film's dialogue concerning the Force, I thoroughly recommend it and feel it more than adds to the evolution of the Star Wars Universe.The locations photography, particularly the island scenes, are breath-taking and would be reason enough to see the film if this were it's only merit. Fortunately the story and the action is fast-paced and engaging to make this a success. I understand why some fans may have been disillusioned with some of the story and character decisions, particularly the deviations from expectation; but Game of Thrones has been doing this for years and has pushed it's way to the top of the ratings as a result.Forget any prejudice you may have towards this film after reading any negative review, and remember that the success of Star Wars is far more than any single character or story-arc; it's an exploration of an energy that permeates all living things and can subsequently manifest as good or evil. Crucially, our current real-world quantum physics and Eastern philosophies are almost at a point where The Force from the Star Wars universe is more than just a fictional creation and it is this comparison that has the ability to make Star Wars real for so many.The caliber of the acting is high with Mark Hamill giving probably his best performance in the role, and I think praise should genuinely go to the Director for daring to be different and go his own way while preserving what is REALLY important to the Star Wars universe. If you go and see this film at the cinema, that'll be Â£10 well spent!",9,0,0,18 December 2017
