Requiem for a Dream," a 10 movie but not for the faint of heart
","This is easily one of the most disturbing movies you will ever see.  This movie has some kind of effect that you won't want to take drugs anytime after this movie.  I'd highly recommend this movie if you aren't squeamish. And no, it did not diserve the nc17.  I think kids should be encouraged to watch this movie.",10,0,0,23 April 2003
