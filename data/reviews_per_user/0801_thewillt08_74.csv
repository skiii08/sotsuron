The Hangover," An Epic Comedy
","What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, unless there is a Hollywood film crew there to capture it. What was supposed to be a bachelor party turned into a race against time to find the groom. The Hangover is a unique kind of comedy that is one of a kind. It is easy to say this movie was the best the first time thru but is still funny every time I watch. The crazy antics portrayed in this movie are hysterical and have nonstop laughter. From that awkward scene in the beginning with Doug and Allan till the pictures during the end credits, I laughed at every joke and almost all of them hit dead on. The plot to The Hangover is simple. Doug is getting married so three friends take him to Vegas for a weekend they will never forget, or remember. They have a drink and the next thing they know three of them wake up in a destroyed hotel room, Doug missing, a baby, and a tiger in the bathroom. Chaos then ensues from there as they try to piece together the night and find Doug before the wedding. Let's start with the characters. Allen is the lovable idiot who says and does stupid things but is the clown of the movie. A lot of the comedy comes from him and he nails it. His stupid comments bring a nice chuckle and his actions bring stomach aching laughter. No spoilers bit most of the misfortune is his fault and the other two have to deal with his stupidity. Allan is easily the best character in the story and the fan favorite. Then there is Stu, now I hate Stu. There I said it. He is a dentist who is whipped by his girlfriend and all he does throughout the movie is yell, be obnoxious, and be a Debbie downer. I may hate his character and may not be a big fan of Ed Helms, the actor, but his role meshed into the movie perfectly. The movie needed a man like that in this situation and he played as the voice of reason and a maniac at the same time. He is kind of a jerk but at the same time funny. Watching him and Allan butt heads was hysterical. Stu says, 'You are literally too stupid to insult.' 'Thank you.' Says Allan. It is little things like that which made the movie even better. Like I said, I don't like Stu but at least he had one of, if not the funniest, moment in the entire movie. That of course is the scene when he plays the piano singing his song. Then we come to Phil. Bradley Cooper is fantastic in this movie. He plays the cool and handsome guy who tries to keep things under control and deal with the situation. From his first scene he sets the tone for his character. Watch the movie and if you pick upon it you will know what I mean. Phil is a great character who fits well into the story as the guy who can laugh at the situation but still understand how serious it is. Stu is an extreme and Allan is beyond that but Phil is in the middle and he is very entertaining to boot. The movie opens with him on the phone explaining the situation and the mess they were in was funny because it made me think how they got there. It made me want to see what happened and made me invested in the movie. The Hangover is a comedy but it is a different type of comedy that works so well. You laugh but at the same time it has a strong story and a great script. You are along for the ride with these three and you want to find where Doug is. It is exciting and the twists and turns are something you see in a drama and not so much a comedy. The story was so well written and kept the audience interested in the movie while rolling on the floor in laughter at the same time. To that I say touché to the director and writers. There was a major flaw in the movie and that, my friends, is Chow. Now I know your reaction and people think Chow was hilarious and possibly the best part of the movie but I disagree. Chow is a good character who needed to be in the movie and play his part but he was so over the top. He tried so hard to be funny and at times he was funny and other times I thought it was forced. His voice and his demeanor annoyed me. When he rolls up the window making weird noises I couldn't laugh because I thought it was way too ridiculous. I will give him credit because he has one of the most interesting and funny entrances into a series that I can think of. I like the character Chow, I like his role in the movie, I like how he wasn't over used, I just thought he tried to hard to be something more than what he needed to be. Overall, The Hangover is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen. Dumb and Dumber was the funniest until I saw this. I think Dumb and Dumber was funnier but I liked this better. Problem solved. I liked Tysons cameo and when he sang Phil Collins, In the Air Tonight, I think I cried. This movie wasn't only funny but fun at the same time. I liked piecing together the events from the previous night and finding out where Doug was. Really good actors, great characters, an amazing script, basic but strong plot, endless funny moments, a high re-watch rate, but a little bit of over acting at times gives The Hangover the WillyT Seal of Approval.",9,1,4,28 May 2013
United 93," An Emotional Roller Coaster
","This review is dedicated to the heroes of flight United 93 who gave everything to save others. Rest in Peace and God bless. I never cry during movies, never, unless it is a true story or based highly off a true story. I have seen United 93 a few times and every single time I try to fight the tears, but they come out. I love this movie not for what it's about but for what it is. This is based on real events with real people and some people who were actually involved with 9/11 are in this movie, and that just makes it that much better.9/11 is the biggest tragedy in American history, in my opinion. I was in 1st grade and I had no idea what was going on. A few years ago I watched at least 10 History Channel specials on 9/11 and I was fascinated. I don't really believe in the conspiracy behind the attack, but I'm not going to talk about that. Back to the movie, it starts with the terrorists who hijacked United 93 praying and shaving in their hotel room. That was their ritual or something, they did what they believed was right, and now their burning in hell. There are some subtleties in this movie. The pilot and copilot are talking about their future plans and the audience just has this uncomfortable feeling because you know this doesn't happen. It's hard to watch this movie knowing everybody dies. The flight takes off from there the events are in control of the director because nobody knows what really happened. The director also focuses on the flight control people from New York and Boston, I think. There were so many it was hard to follow. I just listened for the accents. Slowly, the tragedy unfolds. We get the first few hijackings and the first plane crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. From then, chaos ensues. Most of these people played themselves in the movie and basically recreated what happened in the movie, and wow, the audience sees how confused these people were and they really had no idea what was going on. They did all they could but America was really rendered useless. They tried to contact the terrorists, planes were appearing, disappearing, then reappearing. The audience then sees the second plane crash into the tower and then everybody realized that America was under attack. I loved seeing the chaos in the control rooms and what America was trying to do to deal with this problem. We almost resulted to shooting down these commercial planes. The White House and Capitol Building were evacuated. The Sears Tower in Chicago was evacuated. Meanwhile, United 93 passengers were just casually eating breakfast completely unaware of the world around them. The only thing I could think was that this was their last meal, and tears started flowing. Every scene in the plane was just so emotional, between everyone saying goodbye to loved ones, to the terrorists being anxious and struggling to maintain control. I'm glad the movie didn't focus on the World Trade Centers and we didn't see them collapsing. This movie is about United 93 and what happened on that plane. Possibly the best part of the movie is that there are no major actors involved. There are a few 9/11 movie with big name stars in them and it is a different feeling. These actors are all nobodies and that is how it needs to be. It shows how these regular people took matters into their own hands and risked everything. These passengers are heroes and how they realized they were in danger by what their loved ones have told them. Unfortunately the plane ended up crashing in a field in Pennsylvania and there were no survivors. This isn't a spoiler, it's just history and everybody probably knows this. The last scene is the passengers attacking the cockpit and killing two of the four hijackers. They try to take control of the plane but the last shot is the plane going down into the ground. The ground gets closer and closer and the music gets more and more intense and then it just ends, black screen, a soft chorus, and information about 9/11 comes on the screen, then cue the credits. Overall, United 93 is an emotional roller-coaster and really depicts the events of 9/11 really well. It was horrible but in a day of darkness there was a small glimpse of sunlight. These people took matters into their own hands and even though they didn't survive, they made the terrorists fail in their mission and made that day that much less horrible. It was assumed the plane was going towards Washington and thanks to the passengers of United 93, that did not happen. This movie has my respect and should not be judged with an award or a seal of approval. It should stand on its own and be what it is. See this move and appreciate how America stood strong n the face of terrorism. Again, this review is dedicated to Flight 93 and all of its passengers and passengers who lost their lives, along with every other American who lost their lives on 9/11/01.",10,1,2,4 March 2013
Mulan," Disney's Most Underrated Masterpiece.
","Walt Disney created the masterpiece that is Disney Land and in that came some of the most iconic characters in history. One of the most underrated characters in the Disney Universe is Mulan, in my opinion. Mulan is a strong woman trying to find her place in China. Mulan is a fantastic movie with Eddie Murphy as a funny sidekick, before he was Donkey, and one of the creepiest Disney villains. Mulan is one of the better Disney movies but why does it not seem that way? Why it is not considered one of the best? Well, let's get into it.The story behind Mulan is rather basic. The Huns, led by Shan-Yu invade China for no real reason. I think that is a real flaw in the movie itself. The villains don't have a rhyme or reason to what they do. They just do it. They are evil for the sake of being evil. Shan-Yu leads the Huns and his haunting theme music is enough to scare any kid but still he is overlooked. This movie took a lot of risks for a kid's movie. There is a war going on, many people die, you do not see it but its implied, and the main protagonist is a woman. Now that is not a sexist remark but most of the memorable Disney movies has the lead woman be a damsel and not a strong leader like Mulan. I really like Mulan's character. She is incredibly relatable. She is a young girl trying to find where she belongs. She says it in one of the most memorable songs in any Disney movie. 'When will my reflection show who I am inside?' She eventually goes to war in her father's place. That right there is courageous and foolish. Women are supposed to stay in the house and make babies in China. They are forbidden to fight in war. She does this anyway, and yet she isn't considered one of the greatest characters ever. Mulan is somebody people can look up to and the movie does an amazing job of portraying her. Eddie Murphy has a special talent for voice acting. Mushu is the lovable dragon that kids enjoy. He brings comedy and many memorable moments. From the first time I saw Mushu as a small kid I fell in love with him. He too is looking to find where he belongs with the ancestors of Mulan's family. The obvious similarities between the two main characters are enjoyable. Thankfully Mushu didn't take too much of the spotlight. Disney is known for its lovable characters and evil villains but also for its music. Mulan captures some Chinese culture in the song in this movie and they are most memorable. The first song is a bit odd if you listen to the words. It is catchy and fun to sing along to but is basically about the worth of women in China. Look beautiful for a guy to want you and make babies to defend the Emperor. It is little things like this that could be why Mulan does not get the recognition it deserves but the rest of the songs make up for it. A Girl Worth Fighting for is a personal favorite along with Make a Man Out of You. I think I know every word. The songs are well placed and when one ends it reaches the saddest part of the movie. It goes from a high point to a low point. It is interesting for a Disney movie to have this much emotion. Mulan has many relationships in the movie. The obvious one with her father and Shang but I particularly like the relationship with the three side characters. I'm talking about the bald guy, the thin guy, and the short angry guy. These three are c0molete opposites from each other and bounce off each other perfectly. They are side characters to fall in love with and quote. They have moments that are classic in the movie too. Overall, Mulan is a great movie that is unfortunately overlooked. People may disagree with me but think about it. You ask somebody what their favorite Disney movie is they probably will not say Mulan. Mulan is extremely underrated and I think it is because it has some controversial parts. The movie itself has everything a Disney movie needs and it also got trashed with a sequel. If you ask me I won't say Mulan is my favorite Disney movie, that is a close one between Hercules, but it stands in my top three with ease. And of course it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. I imagine I will get backlash for thinking it is underrated and the reasons I believe so so please respectfully let me know in the comments.",8,0,0,25 November 2013
Memento," A Risk That Paid Off
","Every now and then you come across a movie where you are almost literally glued to the screen. This is basically what happened when I watched Memento. I went into this movie dry. I didn't know much about it other than it is about a man with memory loss and he tries to avenge his wife. That is basically the story but it sort of plays backwards. I watched this movie on recommendation by a few friends and when I heard Christopher Nolan was involved I was sold. Without further ado here is Memento.Like I said the story is kind of backwards. The movie starts with a lot of confusion but as the scenes progress a few questions get answered with even more questions. The big overall question is, who killed Leonard wife and who is responsible for the situation he is in? Leonard is a husband out for revenge but has severe short term memory loss. We are introduced to a lot in the first few scenes including Trinity form the Matrix and the bald guy from Baby's Day Out. As the story unfoldswe understand their importance and the story slowly starts to makesense. The only flaw I see in the movie is that it really drags and thebeginning is very slow. I wanted to watch the entire movie but it took me a little while to get into it and really into the story. To make it even worse I paused it to go to the bathroom and before I did I thought the movie would be wrapping up soon. Little did I know I was only about an hour into it with a little over an hour left. I did enjoy the movie once I got into it but it felt like I was watching it for six hours. The characters themselves were nothing short of hit or miss. The unpredictability of them was what I enjoyed the most. Leonard was a little bland but it made sense because he was always confused. Obviously he was confused because he suffers from memory loss so his simplicity was expected. He has tattoos all over his body and writes things down on pictures so he remembers what happened the day before. It is really a brilliant idea and we see the severity of his obsession on finding the man responsible for everything. Natalie started out as a really strong character I really enjoyed but there was one scene where I really didn't expect her to do what she did. That was where she takes advantage of Lenny. It was really unexpected but I thought that whole scene was great and it made the story that much clearer. My favorite character in the entire movie is Teddy. I love the actor, I think he is very underrated but fits best as a secondary role rather than a star. His actions are unclear because on the back of his photo it says 'don't believe his lies' so his intentions are unclear. It is another huge question throughout the movie. He randomly appears everywhere always advising Lenny to leave town. He is always involved in some way and he does an amazing job in dragging me into the story. Once I got into the story I was stuck in place and I wasn't going anywhere. Throughout the story there are a bunch of scenes in black and white where Leonard is on the phone telling a story about Sammy. The big question in my mind is how it was relevant to the story but I liked those scenes a lot better than any others. Maybe I liked the psychological aspect of memory loss and in these scenes we dive deep into the condition and the character of Leonard himself. This is where he shows his colors as a normal person and the type of man he was. If you see this movie and are bored with the chain of events and how it constantly backtracks take my advice, stick with it. The ending to this movie is mind blowing and what I really love about movies. Movies can play with your mind and make you believe one thing so strongly then completely switch it up in a matter of minutes. The final scenes to this movie answer everything and it all makes sense. We see the true intentions of each character and we get resolution in the story and it was very satisfying. I was thinking how I would have liked to see everything in order but if I did I probably would have hated the movie. Overall, Memento is a unique movie with an interesting enough premise to make me sit though the drag of the first act. I loved the black and white affect and the writing of the story. Christopher Nolan was involved so I had high hopes and he did not disappoint. The characters were good for the most part. I would have liked to see a little more form a few but the movie dragged enough as it was. The second act was a lot better than the first and the third blew me away. The acting was good for the most part, no Oscar worthy performances but it did get the job done. The ending did save this movie from being a wreck because if that failed then all the events prior would have been for nothing and a waste of time. Memento gets the WillyT Recommendation for its uniqueness and originality. The risk taken in the movie did pull off and is something I could easily watch again and probably should so I can make sense if it completely.",8,0,2,18 June 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Not What I Expected
","It is really known that when you see a movie by Quentin Tarantino, you are in for a movie experience like any other. The man who brought us Kill Bill, Django Unchained, and Pulp Fiction brings Inglorious Bastards. I expected really slick dialogue and a lot of action. I tried to enjoy this movie, I really did, but with the English subtitles taking me out of the story, the conversations and characters I don't really care about, and the little action, Tarantino swung and missed with this movie. Inglorious was his worst movie since Kill Bill 2. Brad Pitt stars, I guess he stars since he is in the movie so little, as a leader of the Inglorious Bastards. The Bastards hunt down and kill Nazis. When Pitt is on screen he is entertaining and he did a good job acting, but I wanted to see him more. It takes a long time to introduce his character and we don't see him all that much. Instead, the movie focuses on many characters and it is almost confusing to remember who is who. There was also the Jewish girl who escapes, the members of the inglorious bastards, a few key Nazis including Hitler, the random lady who I don't even know the name of, and then there is the Nazi General played by Christoph Waltz. Waltz is the only reason I didn't hate the movie. He saved the movie for me. He won an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role and for most of the movie I was trying to figure out why. He shows up a lot in the beginning speaking back and forth from English, French, and German, but his conversations are just boring. Pulp Fiction had conversations about milkshakes and it was way more interesting than any conversation in Inglorious Bastards. By the end his characters actions and a really intense scene between Waltz and Pitt really sucked me in and did save the movie for me. I was waiting for something to happen and there were flashes of brilliance in the movie but overall it was disappointing. The strongest point to a Tarantino movie is the dialogue along with some intense action scenes. This movie had very few of both. The very first scene of a movie is very important. Star Wars had Darth Vader's introduction. Lord of the Rings had the seven minute prologue. Pulp Fiction had the incredible conversation in the diner. This movie had nothing. I was uninterested from the very beginning. It is Waltz and a French farmer talking about nonsense and after almost ten minutes of pointless talk it gets interesting. The Frenchman was hiding Jews under the floorboards and the last minute or two of the opening scene had such a little impact because of the boring conversation. It didn't work for me. A lot of people didn't like that most of the movie wasn't in English and that it was subtitled. Now, I love subtitles. Even when a movie is 100%in English I put on subtitles. It is just a habit so subtitles didn't bother me. However, the subtitles took me out of the experience and I'm not too sure why. It made it difficult for me to connect or care with any of the characters. I got a few characters confused and a lot of them were just unimportant. There was a long scene in a bar and again, it had a good ending to the scene but the events leading up to it dragged on and on. This movie isn't suppose to be historically accurate, but this makes zero sense. The basic idea of the movie is to get a large group of Nazi leaders in a movie theatre to present a German war movie, and kill them all. It is the act of a Jew to get revenge on the Nazis with the help of Brad Pitt and the bastards. First off, Nazi leaders would never put all of their leaders in the same room, or at least they would premier in Germany and not France. Trying to sell this idea is completely crazy and you know this would never ever be possible. The ending scenes were amusing and fun to watch, as unrealistic as they were I still laughed. The final scene of the movie was terrible because I was asking myself 'That's it? What happens next? That was dumb.' The story wasn't finished. I feel like it was laziness by Tarantino which was unexpected. Was this movie a disaster? No, when there were action scenes they were really awesome. A huge Jew beats the skull in of a German officer and how do you not enjoy the sight of a Nazi getting demolished by a Jew? Pitt had a lot of smart dialogue and I loved his accent. The confrontation between him and Waltz was great, but it could have been so much better. This entire movie can really be summed up in a word, disappointment. Overall, Inglorious Bastards was not Tarantino's best, but it was not his worst either. I remember seeing trailers for this movie and I thought it looked stupid and I was uninterested. I then learned who Tarantino was and saw his movie and I needed to see this movie. I saw this movie because of its director but I didn't feel like I was watching one of his movies. I didn't know what I was watching but out of respect for the director I finished the movie and salvaged what I could. I did my best to enjoy this movie but it gets the WillyT A for Effort.",4,2,3,15 April 2013
This Is the End," Funny as Hell
","When I saw the first trailer for This is the End I knew this was going to be great and a movie for me. Seth Rogan and James Franco did not disappoint. This was the best movie I have seen all year by far. The plot is basic but the end result is hysterical. Seth Rogan, James Franco, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Jay Baruchel are trying to survive the apocalypse in the home of James Franco. The twist is that the actors are playing themselves and that gimmick worked better than I could have imagined. Before seeing this movie I had my honest worries. When a big group of celebrities come together for a movie like this one of two things can happen. One, it will be a huge success and a comedic masterpiece, or two, there will be way too many stars and it will be a mess like Movie 43. Luckily almost everything in this movie worked. The constant movie references were perfect for a movie lover like me. I am a big fan of these actors and their movies. I wasn't a huge fan of Pineapple Express but I loved Freaks and Geeks. The constant posters and actors of Freaks and Geeks in the background were subtly hilarious. I was also a little worried about some of the characters but each of them worked and was funny in their own way.In the beginning of the movie Jonah Hill was kind of annoying. With the introduction of his character I was afraid of something I like to call the Grown Ups affect. Meaning, the writers make that one guy who isn't funny on purpose like they did with Rob Schneider. Jonah Hill was annoying and at first I didn't like his character but he grew on me and grew on me and he was a star in the movie. Danny McBride was the hero of this movie however. Danny McBride is so good at what he does. He played the same character in this movie as he does in every other accept its better. He is a jerk but he is such a funny jerk. His first scene is hysterical where he cooks all the food and rips apart all the other actors. He and Franco have great scenes and the scene with the gimp almost had me on the floor crying with laughter. Danny McBride was easily my favorite character but picking out a favorite scene was impossible.At first my favorite scene was with Michael Cera. His scenes with him on coke were too funny for film. This was the first role I liked Michael Cera in. If you know me then you know I don't like Michael Cera but everything he did in the move was solid gold. Even his blazer was funny. He was beyond satisfying and whoever came up with the idea of him on coke deserves an Oscar. My favorite scene turned into Danny McBride eating the food, then the scene with Emma Watson, then the sequel to Pineapple Express, then the gimp, and so on. In the end I can't choose a favorite scene. Everything in this movie worked and it had a good story to back it up.The story was basic but carried out perfectly. The movie was in James Franco's house for most of the movie and that was perfect. Having the main characters going thru the city, running into other actors with pointless cameos would have been a disaster. There were many cameos in the movie but none of them were too much to handle. Rhianna Aziz Anzari, Paul Rudd, Channing Tatum Martin Starr, and so many others had just enough screen time to be funny and not take the focus off the main characters. A few references went over my head because I didn't know all the material Seth Rogan could have drew from but I got most of it. The friction between Jay and the rest of the group was a well written conflict added to the story and the characters were done well enough to get an emotional connection to. From the start the movie was funny. Jay and Seth have a weird conversation about glutton and it was so simple but funny. The writing in this movie had Seth Rogan's name all over it. He is such a good writer and he knows how to write a funny script. The random conversations from a milky way bar to the best way to drive in the Hollywood hills the writing in this movie was like no other. The words were more funny then the actions. Franco carries around a prop gun and the scene when they are passing it around and Jonah pretends to shoot was hysterical but not as funny as Jonah Hill praying to God to kill Jay. The writing reminded me of Tarantino's writing and everybody knows I idolize him. Overall, I feel like This is the End was made for me. It is a movie I always wanted made. I always thought it would be a good idea to have a movie where actors play themselves and even though they played exaggerated versions of themselves it still worked. This is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time and is probably in my top 5 favorite comedies. The writing was brilliant, the actors were funny, the scenes were memorable, the lines are quotable, and the movie itself was all around great. I will but this on blu ray the day it is released and I will watch it again and again. I will admit that this movie is not for everybody and I understand if you did not like it. Fans of Seth Rogan and his comedy will love this movie. This is the End easily gets the WillyT Comedic Crest, which is the highest rating for a comedy, and obviously gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",9,3,8,5 July 2013
World War Z," Surprisingly Awesome
","With Brad Pitt it is a hit or miss performance. Examples are Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a strike out to end the game while Fight Club is a grand slam. Then he did a movie like Troy which is more like an intentional walk. He was boring and almost unnecessary but still useful. With World War Z out I gave it a fighting chance it's easily an RBI double. You know I should have said Moneyball with all with all the baseball references but I haven't seen it but I assume he did well. World War Z is a zombie movie loosely based on the book and with all the zombie stuff that came out in the past few years with The Walking Dead and all the videogames about zombies I feared this movie would be too little too late. I had high hopes for this movie and I was not disappointed. The movie starts with a bit of a far-fetched action sequence but it kicked off the movie in strong fashion. We saw a little bit of his normal family life and everything seemed really good. We get a hint at an old job Pitt had but he left to be with his family. I personally liked his family. I was afraid once he left them they would not really be seen again but every now and then the audience is reminded of their existence and that is important. His family is why he fights and it is his drive for everything he does in the movie. With the way the movie kicked off I was a bit worried. In terms of action it was awesome and set a great pace but in terms of story it lacked, badly. The zombie outbreak just happened. No idea how or why. It was sudden and it came out of nowhere. One second the family is in traffic and the next there is an explosion and a huge truck plowing away traffic like snow. I was sitting in my theater giving myself a reality check seeing as that truck would never get thru those cars so easily but I let it go. The movie then took a turn and dug deep into the story. It turns out Pitt used to work for the UN and he is set out on a quest to find the origin of the virus and the leverage to actually do it is his family. I also loved the little Spanish kid they take in while they are in Newark, kid is a beast.Brad Pitt gives another stellar performance and so did the actress who played the little girl in The Dark Knight Rises, it's the little girl with the shaved head we all thought was a bay, yeah her, she was a good fit. In terms of acting Brad Pitt was the only one that mattered. By that I mean nobody else got enough screen time to get connected to. Anthony Hopkins plays a criminal in a South Korean prison and his character was awesome. The conversation between him and Pitt was my favorite scene is the entire movie. I wish it was possible to see more of his character and many others but to push the story along they had their fifteen minutes of fame, literally, and moved on. In terms of suspense this movie was grade A. The scene where the zombies are climbing up the wall by using a giant pig pile was brilliant. That whole scene was a giant mound of awesomeness I didn't want to end. The zombies themselves looked amazing and real. When I say real I mean if zombies were a real thing they would look like these zombies. The way they run in packs and swarm cities is terrifying and awesome to watch. The transformation from normal person to a hungry zombie was creepy and hard to watch. The action scenes were great, especially the scene on the plane. I saw it in the trailers and I was afraid it would be awful but it was awesome. Other than explosive and physical action there was a sense of suspense in sneaking around. Pitt finds himself in a hospital because he thinks has found a way to become immune to the virus. He and two other people are sneaking around and its gets intense. The crawling and sneaking is like something from a video game and it was fun to watch. It wasn't a short thing either, it took a long time for the scene to finish and it was highly entertaining. Overall, I thought World War Z was going to be a disgrace of a film but I walked out enjoying it very much. I heard this was the beginning of a trilogy which I am now OK with. With the way it ended I left with a feeling of wanting more. Brad Pitt did way better than I thought he would have and when it comes out on blu ray I will buy it. For now, World War Z gets the WillyT Honorable mention. It is a very good movie for the summer and is one that you should go see and enjoy as much as I did.",8,4,8,24 June 2013
42," A Good Way to Spend The Day
","Baseball is almost as old as America itself, and like America it has its dark past or racial tension. 42 is about Jackie Robinson and how he broke the color barrier. This movie is less about baseball and more about the life of Jackie himself. A lot of people wanted more baseball and a lot of people thought it was fine the way it is. Me personally I thought the movie was right to focus on Jackie himself because the movie wasn't about baseball. Harrison Ford brings his A-game in playing Branch Rickey, but I can't help thinking that 42 could have been so much better.When I first heard about this movie and saw the trailer I immediately thought Oscar winner. After seeing it, I see this movie being forgotten because it had so much potential to be a fantastic movie. The acting was good but it could have been better. The writing was good, but it could have been better. The racial tension and discrimination was good but it could have been worse, and by worse I mean it could have pushed the envelope and been more offensive. I'm fine with Harrison Ford and the semi-unknown actor who played Robinson because the man Jackie Robinson is too big of a character to be played by a star. If a big name guy played Jackie Robinson he would be criticized more than any other role because of Jackie's legacy. He did a really good job in his acting but in some scenes he was dull, but in a few scenes his emotion drove the scene and the story forward. His emotional acting made me in the moment and it felt like I was there next to him. The best scene in the entire movie is the scene in Philly. When the Dodgers play the Phillies the manager was getting under Jackie's skin with his racial slurs and you can see how it affected his game. As the frustration builds you could see the tension building as well. You can see the rage in Jackie's face as he wants to bash the manager's face in. Instead, he goes in the dugout, out of sight, and lets it out. He flips out and all the emotion comes out. Then comes in Branch Rickey to calm him down and the conversation they have is the best acting in the entire movie. Branch Rickey is the most important character in the entire movie and this scene proves his importance. We all know Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Indiana Jones, but now he can be referred to as Branch Rickey. He did an amazing job indeed, but come Oscar season he will be forgotten by the movies that will come around next fall. He could have done a little bit better, he was a few steps short of an Oscar performance and the fact that the movie came out in April hurts the entire film. In real life, Rickey wanted to win by any means and he thought the Negro Leagues had the most talent to he pushed to break the color barrier. In a selfish way he was a pioneer in baseball. In his greed for victory and money he became a hero. We even see it in the movie, he didn't care about black people and their right to play baseball, and he only cared about winning and making money. It's brilliant in a way and it worked. I liked seeing how white players slowly came on the side of Jackie and they slowly became friends. It was cliché, but that's really how it happened. Pee Wee Reece was the short stop of that time and he was a major star. I liked how it showed the term protest at first and Rickey shut them down, the one guy got traded, the other guy stands up for Jackie, the awkward moment when the one guy tried to get Jackie to shower with the team, it was all good to see in the movie. The movie focused on the team as much as it was Jackie. The main point of the movie was Jackie but sometimes it also turned and focused on Rickey, or the tram, or white people in general. As a team they overcame the racial tension and that was a good thing to see. Overall, 42 was a good movie. I saw it in theatres and I was generally entertained. I was never bred, the pacing was well done, and I was entertained. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not sure if I want to see it again. Ford was amazing, Jackie was well played, but I can't escape the feeling that it was missing something. 42 held something back that would have made it a great film. I think that was the racial attitude. T showed white and colored separation but it could have been a lot stronger and we could have sympathized for Jackie more. I expected to hate white people more and I expected more from the movie as a whole. I love Jackie Robinson and his story. I love baseball and the fact that this movie was finally made. I'm glad I saw it and you should go see it too. 42 gets the WillyT Recommendation.",6,1,1,25 April 2013
Shaun of the Dead," You Will Laugh Till you Die
","I have never seen a movie that is more quotable then Shaun of the Dead. I watch movies, quote movies, and let them impact my life in many ways but very few have a greater effect than Shaun of the Dead. The title spoofs Dawn of the Dead but this is nothing like it. A zombie movie, yes, but this is an Edgar Wright film with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This trio has made some great movies but this is the one that put them on the map. An idiot and his friend try to survive the zombie apocalypse by going to their favorite pub. The best part of this movie is the little details any fan of the movie can appreciate. From the opening credits to the very end, everything is connected. In the opening credits there is a girl at a cash register and a black guy checking his phone. These people return later in the film as zombies. Maybe you noticed it, maybe you didn't but I noticed everything. Snake hips, John, his wife, the other old lady, and even Nelson. Characters we see for three seconds or have two lines come back in some way. Every line is on purpose and everything is connected. The 17 year old kid is the same kid who is frequently calling Ed. I know everything about anything in the Shaun of the Dead universe. For the record, dogs can look up.I quote movies all the time. I have never seen a movie that I quote more than Shaun of the Dead. I probably say 'you got red on you' at least a few times a week. When I was 17 and somebody asked how old I was I would say 17 just like the kid in the movie. In fact, whenever I say 17 I say it like that kid in the store. Every scene has something funny in it through the script. The chemistry between Nick Frost and Simon Pegg drives this movie. They comedically play off each other all the time. 'There's a girl in the garden.' That entire scene is a riot. The throwing of the albums and kitchen objects was great. The zombie tackles Shaun and Ed goes in the house to get a camera. I laugh every time. Since I have seen this movie I call my mom 'mum' instead of 'mom' or' mama' that is the effect this movie had on me. The cinematography and camera angles are also really good. The beginning where the camera bounces back and forth between Shaun, David, Liz, and the other girl was great. The scene where Shaun and Ed are trying to come up with a plan was even better. It is little things like the teeth being brushed to the toilet flushing to the pinning of the Shaun name tag makes this movie great, that and the constant laughs. Every character in this movie was great. I love Ed, sympathize for Shaun, understand Liz, hate David, and am annoyed with Shaun's mum and the other girl I can never remember the name of. The story is at times obvious, like David being in love with Liz and that causing a love triangle between Liz, him, and Shaun. Now throughout the movie I wanted David dead. He was so obnoxious, all he does is complain and be an idiot, but that poor guy did not deserve what he got. Ed is obviously the best character with laughs from beginning to end. He is a guy I would easily get along with and as dumb as he is the friendship he has with Shaun is real. They have a real brotherhood and I love every second of it.Bottom line, this is a zombie movie. A very funny zombie movie but still a zombie movie so that means a few things. The zombies, the gore, and the endgame. The zombies in this movie look fantastic and the gore is great. When the zombie goes through the pole and her guts go everywhere was unexpected and disturbing, but also kind of funny. I really hope somebody laughed other than me. This movie did get serious as well and had some really emotional moments as well. There is one scene that is just so hard to watch and that is the climax with Shaun vs. David. That scene was so well done and watching the chaos was so entertaining. Shaun of the Dead is a roller-coaster of laughs but I guess I need to address the big question of is it better than Hot Fuzz. No. Plain and simple. The reason, Queen. That scene when Queen comes on the jukebox is one of my favorite scenes in movie history. Shaun Ed and Liz are beating the bartender with pool sticks. The zombies are trying to get in, the fire extinguisher going along with the song, everything in this scene worked. I can just see the writers laughing over it as they write it and Edgar Wright directing it with a huge smile. Overall, Shaun of the Dead is a roller-coaster of laughs. There is not a single thing I don't like about this movie. If I had to choose it would be that it is a British comedy and the accents can be too much and some of the language is hard to understand, but who cares. It never slows down, the laughs never stop, and I could watch this every day. I watched this movie countless times with an old friend and I suggest you watch this with as many people as possible. I have never met a person who has not liked this movie so it has to get the WillyT Seal of Approval. When Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright are together expect a seal of approval.",10,2,5,6 August 2013
Argo," I Wonder if the Original Argo Would Have Been Good...
","Way back when, I was not a huge fan of Ben Affleck. I didn't think his movies were that good. I called him a wannabe Matt Damon and The Town was a wannabe The Departed. I still stand by the statement about The Town but after Good Will Hunting Affleck started to grow on me. He is a very talented actor no doubt but he isn't as good as the other actors that are very similar to him, meaning Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg. Then I saw Argo. I hate admitting when I'm wrong but Ben Affleck may as well change his name to perfect.It's no secret that Argo won the academy award for Best Picture, and I think it deserved it but after seeing the movie a second time I wouldn't say it is flawless. It 100% deserves the Oscar but there were a thing or two wrong with the movie itself. I will start with the hate before I praise for 80% of this review. The basic plot is to rescue six Americans trapped in Iran during a mass protest and death to America ordeal in the late 70s. Affleck comes up with the idea to get them out using the idea of Canadian film crew. That is a great idea but I wish they spent more time in Iran. The idea of Argo is a cover up and they have that one intense scene and then the climax and the movie is over. There was so much time emphasizing the point of Argo and little work on the actual plan. The second problem is a nitpick and that is the movie only has a real impact the first time you watch it. The close encounters become less intense knowing the ending. I think that is important for a movie but it isn't the downfall of any movie at all.OK, that is out of the way let's move onto the brilliance, I mean Ben Affleck. This guy has been around the film industry all his life and he directed and starred in this movie. He was absolutely flawless. The writing was near perfect. Each scene flowed into the next so well and there was a lot of emotional attachment to many of the characters. The opening scene into this movie is crazy and sets the movie off in the right direction. The beginning is always important and it does a great job of hooking the audience to the story. That then led into the John Goodman character and the other guy bringing laughs and entertainment which led into the intense and thrilling ending. The ending to this movie the first time is so special. Little words are spoken but there is so much tension and a race against the clock. I never heard of this story before and I say this because it is historically accurate. These are real people and the fake Argo movie was really thought up. I'm surprised kids don't learn about this in school because the character Affleck plays is a hero and yes, the CIA kept it secret but when the story became public by Bill Clinton I thought schools would have taught it. In the credits of the movie they show real pictures of the events and people compared to the movie and they were spot on. Affleck and the producers did their research and down to the slightest detail made this historical moment come to life. From the shredding to the flag burning to the lady on the mic on TV. Like I said, the characters are fantastic in the movie. John Goodman plays the funny man in a lot of movie but the fact that he pulls this off in such a serious movie like this is commendable. The six Americans each brought their own likes and dislikes into the movie and they portray the stress of the situation so well. Some of them don't like the Argo plan and how can you expect them to? It was easy to put myself in their situation which made it easy for me to sympathize for them which allowed me to love this movie. The race against time and tension of almost getting caught is exciting. Audiences love covering their eyes, praying the Iranian police don't figure out they are American. It is that excitement that was probably exaggerated for Hollywood, especially the end, but this is necessary. This movie didn't have to be 100% historically accurate to be good. I can see people complaining about that but not me. It's a movie, sometimes you have to accept that the reality of the real life situation is not good for the big screen or business. I know the first time I saw this I was on the edge of my seat, holding my breath, waiting for the situation to unfold. Overall, Argo is an Academy Award winner for best picture and of all the movies nominated it was the right choice. Do I love this movie? No, but it was very good and very deserving of the honor of best picture. This movie is a roller-coaster the first time but gets less exciting after that. It is still a great movie and it completely changed my view on Ben Affleck. So, for that I say touché to Argo and give it the WillyT Seal of Approval.",9,1,3,24 July 2013
Ted," Better Than Family Guy
","When I first heard the idea of Ted I thought it was going to be the absolute worst thing ever. A comedy with Mark Wahlberg and a teddy bear with the voice of Peter Griffin did not sound too appealing. Obviously Seth MacFarlane was involved and that was the only hope I saw this movie having. Ted was one of the best comedies I have ever seen. MacFarlane delivers with his direction, writing, and even bringing Ted to life. The story is 100% cliché and predictable but its great and it works. After the intro scenes with John and Ted I thought this was going to be a story of Ted becoming too big and slowly becoming less and less interested in John. I don't know why I thought that but I did. The story turned into a relationship between John and Lori with Ted right in the middle. Still cliché but I was surprised how Ted and John's friendship stayed strong through their life. Their friendship did drive the story and did dig up a lot of the comedy in the movie. The first time we see them together as adults they are smoking weed, literally. Nothing made me laugh harder than seeing a Teddy bear smoke weed.I have said I do not like Mark Wahlberg in comedy roles, but he is great. He earned my respect as a comedic actor and would like to see him do more comedic roles. He has a lot of funny moments. He and Ted bounce off one another perfectly and it's really funny. The fight scene between the two of them is funny every single time. It's just like the Peter vs. the Chicken fights in Family Guy. When Wahlberg needs to be funny, he is funny. When he needs to be serious, he is serious. When he needs to be emotional, well, good enough. I was afraid of Ted having the exact same voice as Peter Griffin. I didn't want to watch this movie seeing Peter instead of Ted. This movie isn't like that. Ted feels like a real character and there is very little resemblance to Peter Griffin at all. When Ted talks I see and hear Ted, and that is important. There are moments where it is his voice over and I hear Peter or Stewie. Ted impersonates a fish and uses the Stewie Griffin voice and I hear Stewie. The lights are out and Ted is in bed with John and Lori and he says something. I hear Peter talking to Lois. I don't hear Ted. Luckily, this happens very little but when it does its inevitable. This plot has been done before but it's so funny I can look past the cliché with the comedy. The party scene with Flash Gordon is legendary. That whole sequence is one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any movie. MacFarlane has a writing talent where he references funny moments from any decade. The 90s when Ted is singing karaoke. The 80s with Flash Gordon and so on. MacFarlane sets this movie in Boston and it was perfect. They hit on the stereotype of Boston perfectly with the accents and the way some women act. I'm from Boston so it was really easy to relate. Plus they hit landmarks in Boston. Then end up at Fenway Park. Awesome. This comedy is really raunchy. It seems that these days comedies can only really be good if they are raunchy. I miss the old days of Dumb and Dumber and Billy Madison where a PG-13 movie can be funny. This is obviously rated R and that probably is the only reason why it was as funny as it was. The laughs are constant while most comedies tend to start strong, slow down to develop emotion and story, then end with a bang that is hysterical. That doesn't really happen. It does have its emotional moments but there are a few jabs of comedy that keeps the audience interested. MacFarlane is really good at that as well. He can draw emotion from a crowd while making them laugh.Overall, Ted is a great comedy with a cliché story that only makes it better. It is the writing and directing of Seth MacFarlane that makes this movie great. He is the true star of this movie. Wahlberg and Kunis are good but MacFarlane gets the most credit. I laughed a lot during this movie, as it should have. I can watch this movie time and time again. The writing was great, Ted himself looked real. The relationships were real and believable and the story was narrated by Patrick Stewart, the voice of a God. Ted gets The WillyT Comedic Crest as a comedy and The WillyT Seal of Approval as a movie as a whole. The story and little things push this movie to the Seal that is a rare sight in comedies.",8,1,5,15 October 2013
Superbad," SuperFunny
","It's no secret that I hate Michael Cera. Everything about the guy annoys me. His look, his voice, and especially the characters he plays. Despite the fact that all he plays is the awkward guy in a crowd but I have to admit it, the guy is really good at what he does. He was put on the map in Arrested Development. I didn't see Juno but I heard he was good. He stole the show in This is the End and he was a riot in Superbad. I finally saw Superbad after hearing so many good things about it and I loved it. A group of nerdy teenagers try to impress girls by getting alcohol for a party on a Friday night. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and McLovin star as the group of High School seniors trying to get some action before they go off to school.So, Michael Cera was really good but Jonah Hill deserves most of the credit. In the first act of the movie Jonah Hill is the fountain of funny. Everything he says is hysterical, especially in the store. Bottom line is that the first act of this movie is great. You can tell this is a Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg movie. This movie is straight up dirty. Hill tells a story of how when he was little he had a habit of drawing penises all day. The story of him and the little girl and the Christian principal was a riot. It was funny how the story went from bad to worse to extreme. As somebody who just graduated from High School it was very easy to relate to these characters as I myself feel like Michael Cera in this movie. Let's talk about the wildcard in this movie, McLovin. McLovin isn't his real name obviously but it is the greatest fake name ever. I can see Rogan sitting in a room with his writers and saying, 'how about the name McLovin' then doing his crazy laugh. Fake IDs are a stupid idea to begin with and this was the worst I have ever seen but then again that's the point. McLovin was about to get the run and, bam, the liquor store gets robbed and cops come in. Rogan and Bill Hader play the cops and these two with McLovin are one of the funniest trios I have ever seen. McLovin fits right in with the cops and they are too stupid to realize he has a fake ID. These three have one crazy night and it brings a great time and funny moments.I'm not a huge fan of Bill Hader either. I feel like he over acts in his roles and tries too hard to be funny but when he is with Rogan he is hysterical. He and Rogan play off each other so well and one isn't trying to beat the other one comedically. I also like how Seth Rogan is able to write himself in as a minor character and not take too much of the spotlight. The second act of the movie consists of Cera and Hill at another party trying to reclaim some alcohol and that entire sequence drags on way too long but the scenes with McLovin and the cops saves it from being a disaster. Needless to say, the third act of this movie is so satisfying. The loose ends are wrapped up and all the characters get their just deserts. Throughout the movie we see tension between Hill and Cera with the future and their situation on girls. There are some problems and disputes that aren't resolved. Hill and Cera bark back and forth throughout the entire movie and they sort of have their fallout but it gets interrupted. The movie touches on problems Seniors in High School have but they aren't really resolved. The scene at the end with Hill and Cera before they go to bed does a little but I wanted more.Like I said the second act is what hurts this movie the most as I felt it dragged too much. McLovin and the cops had a million different antics with the bar and the gun and whatnot while Hill and Cera are bunkered down in a house party. The scene when Cera is singing is hilarious but other than that I hated everything about it. I can't hate a movie for not doing what I thought would have worked but I just didn't like the second act too much. Overall, Superbad is super funny. I laughed a lot in the beginning; it is a perfect movie for a guy my age. This movie will be over the heads of people around 14ish but that's why its rated R. Any normal person in High School or above will love this movie and laugh with every viewing. This movie is absolutely funnier in numbers as comedies usually are. Laughter tends to build off itself and others but I watched it alone and still laughed. Superbad gets the WillyT Comedic Crest for being endlessly funny and enjoyable. As a movie as a whole I got to give it the WillyT Honorable Mention. This was a good movie and I will watch it time and time again but I can't get over the plot holes and boring second act.",10,0,2,15 August 2013
Hot Fuzz," Buddy Cop Movie Done Right
","Most people enjoy buddy cop films but a buddy cop film with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright at the helm; we get the best buddy cop film ever made. Sargent Nicholas Angel is forced to move out to the country where he has been promoted to Sargent of a village. He is not too thrilled but he soon finds himself engulfed in a murder case that the town is doing their best to ignore. The deep story is backed up by many laughs and moments this trio puts on the big screen so well.This movie plays the stereotypical buddy cop movie down to the last detail. Angel is the tough cop who is incredible at his job who is forced to pair up with an almost useless Nick Frost. These two bring their chemistry from Shaun of the Dead and bring it into this movie. Nick Frost is not as funny as he was in his previous role but he does a much better job. He is a much improved actor and shows great range in this role. Pegg on the other hand is funnier than ever. At first I hated Angel as a character, as I think I was supposed to, but he grew on me and Pegg nails it. Hot Fuzz ties absolutely everything together even better than Shaun of the Dead did. Things people say one time come back and play into the mystery. The first time you watch it you want to know who the killer is and solve the mystery. Great, but the second and third time you go back and pay attention to all the details. The details are revealed to the audience at the climax but going back and watching it again it is very satisfying. The writing is better than ever in Hot Fuzz. This movie had the laughs but the strongest aspect was the story. For a while the story wasn't really going anywhere but introducing all the characters and getting to know the village. That all changes with the shot of the guy in the black robe, face hidden, and holding an axe. I remember the first time I saw that, my jaw dropped. That was the moment the movie got real and it wasn't like Shaun of the Dead at all. The twists and turns this story take is awesome. The reveal of the murders is so satisfying. I won't spoil but Angel comes up with this whole conspiracy as to why the people got murdered but he was wrong. When the real reason is revealed it was a 'Wait, really? That's so dumb but awesome' moment. Its brilliant but at the same time it's a little lame. For the type of movie it is I love it but I can see people being annoyed by it. The gore behind the murders is terrific. The axe and the staged car accident was creative. The explosion was awesome, the shears was disturbing, but nothing was better than the church scene. Hands down, the coolest death I have ever seen. There could have been one at the end involving the model of the church, but he didn't die, which made it ten times better. Let's just say the scene is suspenseful and it got a bit messy. I went back and watched how he died in slow motion and I don't regret it a bit. There are some jokes in this movie that are hit or miss. Aaron A. Aaronson is a subtle laugh. When Andrew has the foam mustache on his real one brings out a smile every time. The laughs were not as consistent but it wasn't needed. The backbone of the movie is the story, not the comedy. In my Shaun of the Dead review I said that Shaun if the Dead was straight up better. I still stand by that statement but Hot Fuzz had the better stories, better characters, and it got close to better gore. Shaun of the Dead had a special impact on me that left a better taste in my mouth than Hot Fuzz did, but it really isn't right to compare movies it's just a popular topic. If I had to choose some flaws I will have to call shenanigans on a lot in this movie. This is a segment I will call Reality Check. First of all, I'm pretty sure Angel could have denied the promotion if he really wanted to. I understand it is England and it may be different but the guy should have rights and be able to turn down a promotion if he wanted to. Secondly, after Angel discovers the truth behind the town I was thinking to myself that it wasn't possible. I can't say why without spoiling the entire movie but I can say that somebody would have to notice if people randomly disappeared. Before the murders Angel and Danny walk right by the guy in the black robe. The first time he is in an alley so I figured it was possible. The second time he was standing in front of a white garage door, under a light. Come on, I know Angel and Danny were drunk but they walked right by them. At the church there was no possible way for the murderer to escape due to the fact that he didn't have enough time. Finally, I think the lady would have noticed a guy in black trying to kill her. She takes it like a champ before he bleeds out. It's frustrating.Overall, Hot Fuzz is a good time. I can watch this movie anytime anywhere and it has everything I loved from Shaun of the Dead. The cinematography was very much the same along with the humor. The ending was an action packed shootout I always wanted. Hot Fuzz is awesome and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval even with the parts I don't find possible.",8,4,6,7 August 2013
The Mummy," Good, but Not Great
","Every time I go to my grandparent's house one of two movies is always on TV, The Godfather and The Mummy. Two very different movies but let's talk about The Mummy. An ancient, evil, mummy comes back to life to revive his dead girlfriend while terrorizing Brendan Fraser and Rachael Weisz, I'm OK with that. The Mummy is an entertaining experience and goes down as one of my favorite movies as a kid.In the beginning there is a prologue showing Prince Imhotep and Anck Su Namun and their forbidden love story in the ancient city Hamunaptra. It is really interesting and the visuals of ancient Egypt and the story really sucked me in. I love a good prologue and the opening scenes to this movie were strong. Characters were introduced well with their first impressions. Imhotep is a clever villain. O'Connell is the level headed, strong, leader. Jonathan is the witty idiot who provides comedic relief, and Evy is the beautiful genius. The characters are cliché but for the goal of the movie it works. The plot is basic, acting is OK, and the special effects/action scenes are above average. The Mummy, for 1999 was a good movie but it is easily forgotten.Brendan Frasier plays Rick O'Connell and this is the best performance of his career, and that really isn't saying much. He is the standard superhuman who can do anything. He is smart, strong, handsome, and everything somebody wants in a hero. He wasn't a mindless action star because this isn't an action movie, thank god, so he has character development and is way different from the beginning compared to the end. He has his one-liners, he has his witty comments and funny moments, and sometimes they work really well, and sometimes it's painful to watch. When he first sees the mummy he freaks, says something stupid, shoots it in the face, and runs. That didn't work whatsoever. It was a typical one-liner that makes the hand smack the forehead. Then there is a moment where he yells at another mummy and it is his battle cry. The mummies respond and the look on his face was great before he runs away. I loved it, I laughed and it worked. Halfway into the movie we leave the desert and move to Cairo. This is where I expected the movie to slow down and become really boring, but it didn't. I loved most scenes in Egypt with the bugs that eat people and the digging in then tombs. That is all interesting to me and I almost wanted to go back. In Cairo, the movie gets really good because Imhotep needs to regenerate and seeing him slowly become human again, and by human I mean having skin and not a decaying corpus, was really cool and scary. The visuals of the ½ man ½ mummy were really cool. I love the visual of a bug crawling across his face and it crawls into a hole in his cheek and Imhotep just bites down and eats the bug, brilliant. For the entire movie I was waiting for when I would get taken out of the experience and would be turned off, and that was the plane scene with Winston. He was a pointless character with a meaningless plot point. I know why he was in the movie and it does make sense but I just hate it. The whole scene with the giant sandstorm was just so stupid. I watched it just loathing it and wanting it to end as soon as possible. Then it just ends in the worst way possible. I won't spoil but if this scene was cut out the movie would have been no different. For my favorite character it is a split between Beni and Jonathan. Beni is the weasel who works with the devil to save his own life. He even admits it. 'It is better to be at the right hand of the devil then in his path.' Every time I saw him I was waiting for somebody to kill him. There is no way he can possibly live and I was waiting for the bullet to the head, or the sword in the stomach, or even the mummy tearing him to shreds. Needless to say his character is very entertaining; we feel emotion towards him and is the wildcard in the movie. Jonathan is just straight up funny. He is dumb but had flashes of brilliance. He is kind of a sidekick but I enjoy seeing him on screen and his charisma adds a nice charm to the movie. This isn't a good movie without Jonathan or Beni in it.Overall, The Mummy is a good movie. It isn't a classic, but it isn't awful either. I liked the movie and every time it's on I will watch it. I can hop in at any point and have fun watching it. There is really nothing special about it, positive or negative. The CGI and special effects weren't groundbreaking. The acting won't win any awards, it's just a fun movie to watch and enjoy it for what it is. As for a grade, it's tough. It isn't good enough for an Honorable Mention, but isn't bad enough for an A For Effort. It is somewhere in the middle. I know, The Mummy gets the WillyT Recommendation. I recommend this movie to anybody who wants a decent movie to watch with friends and enjoy the story and action. Don't expect the best movie ever but don't expect garbage either. Just expect The Mummy.",10,0,1,5 April 2013
Troy," Weak Lead Role but Strong Support
","I have a sweet tooth for Greek Mythology and medieval war films. Troy had all the pieces to become a huge success. Wolfgang Peterson brought together a very talented cast to deliver the Trojan War to the big screen. Brad Pitt is the star who plays Achilles and given the role, it was good enough. Eric Bana gives the best performance of his career as the Trojan Prince Hector. Brian Cox plays the same villain once again as King Agamemnon. Sean Bean is a must for this kind of movie as he plays Odysseus. Then there is the wildcard in Orlando Bloom playing Paris. I love these actors, I love the idea, I love history behind the movie, but did it live up to my expectations? Achilles was played really well by Brad Pitt, but I didn't like it. I know, how does that make sense? Achilles is an arrogant demigod who can't be killed in battle. His character is very one sided and I think Pitt played him correctly and got the character correct, but I didn't like the character Achilles. He is the main character and so important, but I can't stand him. I enjoyed the movie more when he wasn't on screen. Good acting by Brad Pitt, not his best, but given the character and the role itself it was good enough. He has a girl he falls in love with but it doesn't work as well as it should. It sort of shows characterization and growth as a character but it almost makes me hate the character even more. Even though the main character was boring, bland, and hard to relate to the rest of the cast blew me away, mainly Hector and Agamemnon. Troy is so confident that they can fight off Achilles and the rest of Greece. Hector sees the world for how it is and he realizes that they are in trouble. He knows this war cannot be won and when his brother Paris takes the Queen of Sparta away, he wants to bring her back because he knows it will bring war. Helen of Sparta is the most beautiful women in all the world and Paris stole her from Sparta. Hector protects his brother even though he knows it will bring his doom. It really is noble of him because it shows the strength and weakness in his character. Throughout the movie we see all of his strengths and weaknesses. His greatest strength and weakness is the love of his country. We feel sympathetic for his character as we see him struggle with everything that is going on. Brian Cox plays the exact same character in all of his movies but it works so well. Agamemnon is the greedy brother of Menelaus, King of Sparta. He wants to destroy Troy and burn it to the ground. Brian Cox was casted perfectly for this role. He plays the villain so well and how he treats the world like a candy bar waiting to be stolen and he thinks he can do it so easily. His relationship between him and Achilles drives the movie forward, but the relationship was kind of one sided because Achilles shows little to no emotion and is boring. Agamemnon pushes the rivalry and emphasizes the importance of Achilles. Then there is his relationship between him and Priam, king of Troy. He and Priam are rivals and we see the difference in how they lead. Priam believes in the Gods while Agamemnon depends on an army. Both are their strengths and weaknesses. A major aspect of the story is how characters strengths are also their weaknesses, I just realized that.Troy is based off of Homers, The Iliad and lets just say I personally like Wolfgang Peterson's version better. In the epic poem the gods were more involved and the Trojan War is more of a game for them. The Greek Gods could have had more involvement but the focus on the movie was more on the characters and humans themselves. Certain characters die in the movie a lot better than the way they die in the poem. Ajax is the prime example. Ajax is one of my favorite characters in Greek Mythology and Homer did not give him justice. The warrior went down the way he should have, in battle, not him committing suicide over a dead pig, pr something like that. Peterson does stay true to the original story with some details that a true fan could enjoy but the two are mostly very different. Overall, I did enjoy Troy. The battle scenes were very entertaining, most characters fit well and were acted out appropriately, but I can't get over how much I hate Achilles. He literally almost ruined the movie for me. He mopes around and complains and acts like he is the greatest thing in the world. Even if he is and he is supposed to act like that, I hate him. I guess Peterson did his job in making me hate him. Another thing I enjoyed was that I bought the Directors Cut in Blu Ray. I always say, there is no such thing as too long of a movie and in the Directors Cut there are scenes that deserved to be cut out, but I loved seeing them. I liked seeing more interactions between characters and more development of characters, except for Achilles, and the extra battle scenes were disturbing but brilliant. James Horner does another fantastic job with the score. Nothing is more epic than hearing the magic of music in this movie. Music makes the movie, I say it all the time and once again, the music was amazing in this film. With the poor quality of the main character, a few plot holes, and a few nitpicks I have given Troy the WillyT Honorable Mention because I hate Achilles too much and the acting was weak at points, but still a great movie.",7,0,0,1 April 2013
The Terminator," The 80s at its Finest
","I didn't know James Cameron wrote and directed The Terminator, can't say that I'm surprised because only a genius could have created it. The Terminator is early on in Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron's careers' and this movie put them on the map, or at least made them bigger stars. James Cameron created a world of time travel and the inevitable end of the world with a war between humanity and machines. What could possibly go wrong? The answer is nothing.Arnold plays the terminator, a emotionless, flat, cyborg, killing machine that has one goal, terminate. Arnold was a perfect role. He obviously has his accent and amazing physique and he probably has fifty lines in the movie and he is intimidating. The special effects done to his face when he is part human and part machine is done really well. The only flaw in the effects is the shots when the actual machine is walking on a green screen. In all honesty it looked awful and took me out of the experience but for its time it was acceptable. The character terminator itself was scary and godlike to say the least and the only reason this movie wasn't a ridiculous robot going on a killing rampage was the story behind it. In the year 2029, or something close to it, a man named John Connor is the leader of the human revolution and he gets word of a terminator going back in time to kill Sarah Connor, John's mother, to prevent John from being born. OK, so let's start with the idea of time travel. Brilliant, I love it. It makes me think and wonder what happens next. I could go on a rant and rave about time travel and how it messes on my mind but that's for another day. John Connor has a counter and sends one of his best men, Kyle Reece, to the past to protect Sarah Connor. Throughout the movie Reece gives bits and pieces as to what happens in the future and how the machines take over humanity. The bits and pieces were awesome, it didn't overwhelm me with information and it kept me invested in the story. The back story is incredible and the universe James Cameron created is commendable. The only real downside to the story is the lack of characters. Reece is a good character but I wasn't a huge fan. His acting was a little flat and I wasn't fully invested n his character. There was something about him that rubbed me the wrong way. The action in the move was really cool. The Terminator is basically invincible so seeing Arnold get shot rapidity and watching him throw people through windows was awesome. The car chases were done well and the best scene was easily when the terminator tears through the police station and says the famous line, 'I'll be back.' Nobody realized it then but that quote is imitated by everybody at least once in their life, even if they haven't seen the movie. Arnold's voice and the way he acts on screen is so unusual but effective. This thing clearly isn't human and Arnold does it perfectly. People may disagree with me on this but I'm saying it now, Arnold as the first Terminator is better than the T-1000. I really liked the character Sarah Connor. She is the most important character and she is portrayed really well. She is a normal girl with a normal life just trying to get by. She is a waitress and a lot of people can relate to that. As 'm writing this now I am a waiter so I know. Sarah Connor is a character people sympathize with so nice work, Cameron; you know how to write a main character. The relationship between Reece and Sarah is cute to say the least. The way their relationship builds is very believable. If you have seen enough movies you can figure out the end of the movie and what happens to each character but when I first saw it I had no idea what was going to happen. Looking back I should have figured it out but that's the magic of movies. Overall, The Terminator is a classic in my opinion. I loved the movie and the depth behind the story. Arnold was born to play this role and James Cameron was born to make brilliant movies. The two of them together is a powerhouse that couldn't possibly fail. The Terminator without a doubt gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",8,0,1,11 July 2013
We Were Soldiers," War Movie with Emotion and Story
","I can honestly say I was surprised by the movie We Were Soldiers. We Were Soldiers stars Mel Gibson as a military man leading a group of platoons in the Vietnam War. The movie focuses on the combat of Vietnam and delivers some really good action scenes, but also brings emotion and love to the table. Mel Gibson brings an average performance, compared to other roles he has played, but still gets the job done, but who stole the show in my opinion was the wives of the soldiers. They played a huge role and they were as close as the soldiers were and that shows a lot. They delivered each other's telegrams when they had to find out their husbands were dead. It is just loyalty and friendship the audience should appreciate.The beginning on the movie shows the soldiers in training and with their families. This gave the audience time to know the soldiers and fall in love with their characters. One soldier had a newborn baby then left to fight. Character development was strong in the beginning while action and battle carried out till the end. The character that Mel Gibson played was certainly interesting with his devotion to the army and God. After seeing Passion of The Christ I did think it was weird seeing Mel Gibson praise the man he would later slaughter in one of his movies, but that's just a side note. Gibson's character is a leader and he motivates his squad giving a great speech before they deploy. He promises no man will be left behind and as I'm sure that promise cannot be kept it would still make me feel batter as a soldier. He talks about how soldiers are family and Gibson just naturally plays the role. The only problem I had with him was he showed little emotion and seemed like a statue, even during battle. It didn't seem human, how can a man just not react? He always kept his composer. I'm sure some people thought it was a god thing but I did not like it.I also loved Gibson's second hand man, forgive me for not knowing characters names because there are so many of them and I only saw the movie once. Anyway, the old guy with the pistol, he was great. While he showed little emotion his seriousness brought a laugh here and there, intimidation, and a veteran presence. He was an old school guy who preferred the old school way. I liked how the movie had little Easter eggs, for example, he says he prefers the pistol to the new M16 and Gibson says something like, 'how do you know the enemy will be that close.' Then later in the movie he shoots people down with his pistol from close range. There were definitely many problems with this movie, the main one being the length. This movie was two hours and twenty minutes. After about an hour and a half I thought the movie would be wrapping up but instead it introduced a new character and kept on going. The new character was the camera man and he took pictures of the carnage of Vietnam, His character was definitely important and needed, but he came in too late. He had such a presence and brought a different attitude and tone to the movie it just got under used. Other problems were too much use of slow motion and too many jumps and surprises with deaths. A soldier would be walking and then he would be dead. That effect to start a battle isn't bad but it was overused. Final seconds of a soldier's life were cheesy with their last words and their reactions. 'Tell my wife I love her' works but it didn't work where it was used. I give the movie credit for sticking really well to the time period. Introducing the M16 rifle and the use of Napalm are small parts of the movie with an impact. People who love history and the military would appreciate that and the movie does a good job of knowing its facts and doing the research.Overall, We Were Soldiers was not a bad movie, but it was not fantastic either. I have seen better war movies and I have seen worse. Acting was a little shaky but strong overall; the story dragged a little bit and was too long but still memorable. I would watch it again and buy it to see again. Watch it with a bunch of your guy friends to enjoy a manly movie that women can still enjoy and maybe even cry to. We Were Soldiers is a good time but does not get the WillyT Seal of Approval.",6,1,1,12 September 2012
Crash," Way Too Much Going on
","I surf Netflix all the time and put them in my instant queue and I finally go around to watching Crash and it reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction. That is, if Pulp Fiction made no sense had stupid characters and was a little less racist. Yes, that's right, less racist. Crash has a huge list of actors from William Fichtner to Brendan Frasier and even Ludicrous. Oh boy, do I have a lot to say about this movie.Where do I start? OK, this movie has little to no plot, way too many characters I don't care about, and it is a knock off of one of the best movies ever, Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was so great because there were a few characters whose lives intertwined perfectly. These characters lives intertwine but when it happens I just didn't care. I was thinking throughout the movie where and when it would end and when it did it felt like nothing even happened. This movie literally could have ended anywhere. The first scene is of a crime scene and you would think it ends there but it doesn't. It ends in possibly the worst way imaginable. I have a 1000 word limit but that isn't enough to explain the disgrace that is, Crash.Movies have had race problems all the time but this movie is kind of built around it. That isn't really a problem if it works and here it doesn't work. Everybody is racist in this movie. I do like how racism is shown and life can be like this, but this is extremely exaggerated. The police are racist. The Middle Eastern store owner is racist. The poor, black gangsters are racist. The rich, black people are racist. I have seen racism in movie but this was crazy. The first scene with Ludicrous is him and his friend walking out if a restaurant and he is talking about race. This was a really interesting conversation early on in the movie and it really sucked me in. It got me excited to watch the rest of the movie. It reminded me of the diner scene in Pulp Fiction, but it blew it. The movie pushed onto more and more characters and destroyed the potential. There were flashes of brilliance in the movie. Characters stories intertwine and in one of the most disgusting people I have seen on screen has a moment where he is human and I liked that. Crash wasn't a complete disaster but I expected better. Towards the end of the movie there is one scene that caught my attention once again and I thought the movie would improve, but once again I was disappointed. I wanted the disaster to be true because the movie would have been realistic and a stronger message would have been sent. As a new generation emerges, a generation I am a part of, race, sexual preference, hate, is in a decline. I feel the new generation will be more accepting of people and it is people of the older generation that still hangs onto racial tensions. Prejudice and stereotypes will always exist but they will be less offensive and people won't care as much. Anyway, I digress, this movie sends a message of racism and how it can destroy lives and how it affects society. The message and deeper meaning of this movie is good, it was the presentation and delivery that was a disaster. I can't tell you who the main character was, I can't tell you the plot, and I can't tell you why somebody would enjoy this movie. Overall, Crash had potential to be a good movie. It was too disorganized and messy. Each character had good stories but there was too many of them. Ludicrous' story was good. Fichtner's story was good. The rich black family's story was good. The emotional music was good. All these things were good on their own but when you put them all together it is a mess and hard to follow. I almost would have preferred ten different movies diving deep into these characters and having their stories intertwine. Have the racist cop save the woman he abused just the night before in a car accident but maybe have him involved in Ludicrous' story more. Stories need to be cut and intertwined closer and it would have been a lot better. I would like to see this remade in a different style, but I have to give Crash the WillyT Seal of DISapproval. It's a shame because I wanted to enjoy this movie, but the only thing I enjoyed was hating it and awaiting the time I had to write and rant about it. You're welcome.",3,5,6,4 April 2013
The Expendables," This Made Me Feel Like a Man, Man.
","What do you get when you put almost every action star from the past 20 years in the same movie? You get The Expendables and you feel like a complete man watching it. The cast includes Stallone, Statham, Li, Austin, Crews, Couture, Rourke, Willis, Schwarzenegger, and my personal favorite Lundgren. In case you don't know who he is he is Drago from Rocky 4. I heard some people complain that the movie was stupid and had no story and point. To that I say, duh, that's not the point. This is a once in a lifetime franchise and for what it's worth it was fine. This is a straight up action movie and has no other point then to see your favorite stars blow things up and kill people. The story is crazy, but who cares. I did not go see this movie for deep characters and an in-depth storyline. I saw this for the action and special effects. For an action movie, I loved it, for a movie in general, it was one of the worst I have ever seen. Stallone leads a group of mercenaries and he gets too attached to a job and he wants to return to rescue a girl. I guess the first rule of being a mercenary is not to get attached to the job. It's get in, get out, and get paid. For what it is it wasn't a terrible idea. If it had to be a story I'm glad it was this one. A major flaw with the move itself is the fact that it tries too hard to be a movie that it isn't. After an action packed opener they go back home and try to dig into characters and that's not necessarily a bad thing but they tried too hard. Stallone has his internal conflict and talks it over with Rourke, and that's OK, but the whole story with Statham and his girlfriend could have been cut out and replaced with him snapping necks. I don't want to see Bruce Li complain about his family that doesn't exist or Mickey Rourke being completely useless throughout the entire movie. I hated his character. All he does is ride in, be a sad old man, and give tattoos. He tells this story about an old job and how he got attached to it and I was just turned off. I wanted him out of the movie. He is an action star and should have been that. Instead he was a has-been and drags the movie along. Even Stallone looked like he was getting bored. Bruce Willis' character was OK, I wanted to see him kill people too but instead he plays the guy who assigns the job and that's it. Anybody could have played that role and he was wasted as a name to promote the movie. I was OK with Schwarzenegger's character because he was governor at the time so it made sense. I guess I should praise the real point of the movie, the action. Nothing made me happier than seeing Terry Crews mow people down with a shotgun. The car chase with Stallone, Li, and Lundgren was impressive. It had the stupid one liner but cars flipping and bullets flying are what I wanted to see. Some of these actors are getting old but the gritty hand to hand combat still held up. The explosions in the beginning were just as good as the ones at the end. Stone Cold Steve Austin is in the movie as a bad guy and he fit in surprisingly well. He played a bad guy in the WWF so he knows what he is doing. His scenes were fun to watch and he was a good addition. Overall, The Expendables was exactly what I expected. It was a battle of men and a movie for a man. If you took your girlfriend to see this movie, I hope she broke up with you on the spot. The acting was gross, he story was choppy and stupid, but that wasn't the point. When people tell me this movie was bad I laugh and ask what they expected. I expected the bloodbath that I got so I was happy. As a movie it is terrible, but as an action movie it is top notch. The Expendables gets the WillyT Bloodbath Badge. That basically means it was a good action movie. If I had to give it a real WillyT Rating it gets the WillyT Recommendation because it is a movie every man needs to see to consider himself a man.",6,0,0,6 May 2013
Shutter Island," Scorsese blows my mind
","Shutter Island was a mind blowing experience to say the least. Twists and turns in the story kept me guessing and this film had a lot of strengths like the story, directing, acting, character development, plot twists, and music. Yes, music. Music is the most underrated part of a movie. Music can make a movie and in Shutter Island the music was scary and it fit perfectly. It was suspenseful and appropriate. Leo DiCaprio did his usual fantastic job acting but his character was one a member of the audience could love and rout for. I felt sorry for his character and thought his experience was tragic. His acting was commendable starting as a skeptic marshal. His witty comments towards patients and psychology fit his character. Eventually he became obsessed and crazier as the film went on. Leo played a crazy man perfectly with the shaking and paranoia. Scorsese did an awesome job keeping the audience guessing and a little puzzled as to what was going on. That is a positive and a negative. Confused viewers are never good and could turn them away from the movie but it made me more curious to see what was going to happen. After seeing the movie twice you notice hints and clues to the ending result and that is brilliant. Little Easter eggs that make you feel foolish for not noticing the first time. The 1st dream is probably the most important scene in the film. It gives everything away but portrays it so you think what the director wants you to think and it works perfectly. That was the best part of the movie. You thought you knew what was going on and you thought you figured it out then it turned around and you are back at the beginning. The ending to the movie is very open-ended and I usually hate open ended movies but this worked very well. I like for a director to pick an ending and stick to it but this move allows the audience to kind of choose their own ending. Is Teddy Daniels real? Is Dr. Cowley right and he is really Andrew Laeddis and criminally insane? These are questions the viewer can answer themselves. Anyone can think of an ending and be happy. Me personally, I think he did kill his wife and she did drown her children. Andrew Laeddis is real and he was on Shutter Island for two years as a patient. Did Teddy Daniels believe he was Teddy Daniels at the end? I don't think so. I think he didn't want to live with the fact that he killed his wife and live as a 'monster' so he decided to die as Teddy Daniels, or a 'good man.' Rachel Solando was not a patient but I do believe the lady in the cave did exist and she was a doctor and everything she said was true. That's my opinion and I love the fact that I can put my own spin on the movie. Shutter Island was also realistic. This movie didn't literally happen but the ideas are true. Your mind can really shut out negative thoughts and drive u mentally insane. It is possible to think you are not in prison and are at home with your children. That is what made the story believable. Lobotomies actually happened and 'ghosts' actually existed. The idea of medicine for the time period, new methods, and the power of the mind, all made this movie even better. Scorsese clearly did his homework for this movie nailing every detail. To fully understand this movie I had to watch it two or three times and fully pay attention. This is not a movie you casually watch, you have to commit to it to enjoy it and that hurts the movie. Overall I lived it and could watch it again and again and still be surprised what I find. I give this movie 8 out of 10.",8,1,4,30 July 2012
Pacific Rim," A Summer Sensation
","Don't judge a movie by other movies. That basically sums up what I have to say about Pacific Rim. In all honesty when I first heard about this movie I had no intention of seeing it. I immediately thought of a Michael Bay wannabe try to do what he does with a million explosions and no story. I thought giant robots mindlessly fighting Godzilla Cloverfield monsters were stupid. After actually seeing it I can gladly say I was wrong. Was Pacific Rim a mindless violent movie perfect for summer? Kind of, the action in this movie was state of the art. Let me get that out of the way. Seeing a giant robot punching a monster in the ocean was fun. The destruction wasn't over the top either. I was also concerned about the frequency of the action and surprisingly it mixed in well with the story. There was a very good balance between the fighting and the story with the humans and understanding the monsters. There were three of four real fight scenes with monsters and robots and the four scenes were so worth it. They were also really well placed and spread out. There wasn't action scene after action scene. There is one in the beginning, another smaller one or two in the middle, and then the incredible ending.The major concern was the story for me. The acting didn't have to be superb and it wasn't but it was better than I expected. Jax form Sons of Anarchy is the main character and he does a good job but I can't help but think he plays the same guy in everything. There was a scene or two where I saw Jax on screen and not the actual guy. The story itself if basic and is explained in a prologue in the first few minutes and that was probably the best part of the movie. I was glad the movie started in the middle of the war. It was a smart movie in my opinion because the beginning if the war wasn't as important. There was still enough time do dive into the characters and fall in love with them.Charlie Day is in this movie and although I don't think he fit the movie he was a strong addition. He plays an entertaining scientist who studies the monsters and trues to understand them. This was another interesting part of the story I found interesting. This was strength and the biggest weakness. The story was a lot better than I expected but it was rushed. His character and his story were really rushed. He does a few things and meets Ron Pearlman, and he is also awesome in this movie, then he does something else, and then he figures out the big question, thin the movie ends. I wish there was more time spent on the story but then again that would have taken away from the action that drew the audience in. The most interesting part of the story was the robots themselves. In the beginning we learn they were created solely to fight the monsters. The fact that all the world leaders came together and with the technology built these robots quickly. I didn't really buy that 100% but it was something I had to look past but these things are operated by two humans and their better the relationship between the two people, the better the robot it and the better it fights. Wow, awesome, did not see that coming and I loved that. If somebody tried to pilot the robot by themselves their mind basically explodes. It is too much to handle so touché to the movie, I enjoyed it. It adds complexity to these robots and it was awesome. This brought in the aspect of character relationships which is super important in any movie.The relationship between Jax and the Asian girl is strong and necessary. I wrote this review long after I saw the movie so I can't remember names. Anyway, their backstory is really cool something I enjoyed. The flashback with her as a little girl with the monsters attacking was emotional and impactful. The main relationship was between the girl and the general. The general is the best actor in this movie and he does the best job out of anybody. Every leader has a memorable speech before the final battle. I loved Bill Pullman's in Independence Day and in this movie it was good in the moment but by now I can't even remember what he said to make everybody cheer. Overall, Pacific Rim is a good movie with a fair balance of action and story. I saw this movie because people raved and were so excited for it so I had to give it a shot. I went in wanting anything but Transformers and I left with a big smile on my face. It is a great summer blockbuster and is a popcorn movie. It is a good way to spend the day. When it comes out on blu ray I will buy it and watch it with my friends and enjoy it. Other than that it will sit in my cabinet and be watched every now and then. The movie did its job so I give it the WillyT Honorable Mention.",7,2,8,19 July 2013
Glory," Three Cheers for Glory
","Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the 'N' word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair.Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to Déjà vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well.With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.",9,1,1,1 August 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Simply a Masterpiece
","Now I'm aware the Lord of The Rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. They next one also picks up right where the other left off. Here we go the review of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, The Lord of The Rings. Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by J.R.R. Tolkien and it is the most cliché story of good vs. evil. The story is stereotypical, but it works. Tolkien created his own world of Middle-Earth and it is filled with different races and languages. In the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil, 'one ring to rule them all.' The maker of this ring was named Sauron and long story short, he was defeated but survived through the ring. The ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. He has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of Sauron destroy Middle-Earth. The storyline is very cliché. It is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. If you think you have seen this before, you have, but this is completely different. The little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord.One of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. Gandalf's relationship with Frodo and the ring. Frodo's relationship with Sam, Gollum, and the Ring. Gollum's relationship with the ring. Merry's relationship with Pippin. All of these relationships drive this movie. Nothing is more powerful then the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Samwise Gamgee is more than Frodo's best friend, he is basically his protector. Sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. Frodo could not have survived without Sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Sauron has all the power of persuasion, power of armies, fear, and all the power in the world. The only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power.Coming in second with relationships is between Gollum and the Ring. Think about it, Gollum spent more time with the Ring than anybody else, excluding its master Sauron. Gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. It literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you can't help but pity. He is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isn't his fault that he is the way he is. He is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. Any fan of these movies knows what I'm talking about.Over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. Gimli and Legolas didn't like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. 'I never thought I'd die side by side with an elf,' Gimli says in the final battle. 'How about side by side with a friend?' Legolas answers. These two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. You also see Merry and Pippin evolve into something I know I did not expect. In the first movie they were silly and naïve but in the second movie Merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. Pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters.These three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. From Hobbiton to Rivendell to Helms Deep and all the way to the Crack of Doom, every place in Middle-Earth comes to life. The designers of these sets and CGI went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. You learn how Hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in New Zealand. My favorite battle has to be the battle of Helms Deep. It was 10,000 Uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of Rohan for centuries. Aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie.These movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. Peter Jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in New Zealand and filmed this masterpiece. Costumes were made and WETA Workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of Middle-Earth come alive. Actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. The only real problem with these movies is that if you don't know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. I saw the first movie when I was really young and I had no idea what it was about and I had to see the movies many, many times before I knew what was going on. As soon as I did, I was hooked and now I know almost everything there is to know about these movies.Overall, The Lord of the Rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. The way the filmmakers dove into the world of Middle-Earth with such detail is commendable. This movie won so many awards, made a bunch of money, and it deserves everything it got. These are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you don't, go in, pay attention, and join the experience. Lord of The Rings is my favorite movie, next to Titanic, and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",10,1,2,5 February 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Hasta La Vista to this Franchise
","With the brilliance in Terminator one and two there is no way Terminator three can be a disaster, right? It has such a strong foundation it is literally impossible to screw up. Or so I thought, then Terminator Rise of the Machines was made and oh how I wish it never was shown to the public or even to deaf and/or blind children.There are probably 10-15,000 problems with this movie. I heard it was bad but I went in with low expectations and the first thing I see is the producer and director's names. I couldn't believe it wasn't James Cameron. I thought if James Cameron was involved then it couldn't possibly be that bad but from the title screen I lost a lot of hope. James Cameron is the main reason these movies were a success. He created this story, the characters, and through his vision these movies came to life. Now somebody else is ripping off his work to make a buck and he destroyed this franchise.Problem number two, the beginning. It is cookie cutter by now to have Arnold appear, naked, and look for clothes and throw some bodies, but now the evil Terminator is a woman. I saw her and I was devastated. I'm not being sexist and saying a female can't be in this role but this a man's movie. An action packed man experience and seeing a girl follow up to the T-1000 was impossible for anybody. She does the exact same thing as the first two with the emotionless stares and few lines. The intimidation factor was down and she wasn't too special or more advanced from the previous model. In the third installment we revisit the character of John Connor and the way this man turned out was so disappointing. The kid in the second movie was ten times better than this clown. This guy stopped Judgment Day, or so he thought, and he is a coward. He runs and runs in fear. I hated his character and the way he was written. His lines were weak, his acting was weak, and everything about his character was stupid. I thought Sarah Connor would have still taught him to be an intimidating beast, or at least a man. This guy is embarrassing to the supposed to be hero of humanity. On a side note I hate what happens to Sarah. I won't say what happens because I think it is supposed to be a surprise but I was so angry. A character as awesome and dedicated to the story as her deserved better for this film. The main problem with this story is that it probably should never have been made. I was perfectly happy with the ending if Terminator two. If anything this movie takes away the impact of the previous movie. 'You didn't stop Judgment Day, you delayed it.' That one line ruined everything. Everything done in the second movie was basically for nothing. I would have probably been happier if Arnold was not in this movie. He and John had a strong bond as a kid and when John sees the new Terminator he acts really odd. The chemistry they built up in the previous movie was also for nothing. 'I guess I have to re-teach you everything.' So many things disappointed me in this movie it was hard for me to find any positives. If I had to say at least one good thing I guess t could be the climax leading to the ending. Skynet is back and we learn a lot more about the beginning of the end. We see the end begin with the fatal mistake and the idea of the impossibility to change the future is still interesting. The last ten minutes or so I had mixed feelings about. They build it up to be something epic and it turns out to be something unexpected. At that point I didn't really care about the ending and I accepted it for what it was. It left off with the strong possibility of another movie, and there is a review will be here soon. Finally I will touch upon the special effects. Well, they weren't that good. In the beginning there is another crazy car chase with cars flying everywhere and way too much destruction. A car crashes into a wall at high speeds and it somehow explodes. Just because a car crashes into something doesn't mean it has explode. The shots with a Terminator being lit up by round after round of ammunition by cops get old. Every action scene in this movie has been used in a similar or exact same way in one of the previous two films. If I have to play devil's advocate I will say I did love the giant robot inside Skynet tearing apart person after person and everything in its path that was awesome. Overall, Terminator Rise of the Machines did the impossible. It was almost impossible for this movie to fail and it did on almost every single aspect of a film to fail. There was poor writing, awful characters, and ridiculous action. If the story had to continue anything else would have been better. I am glad I saw this movie at least once just to say I saw the entire franchise to date, I obviously had to watch this before Salvation and Salvation has also been seen, but I will probably never watch it ever again. Before I give it the WillyT rating I hope you noticed I didn't mention the girl in the story. That is probably because I just remembered her. She is awful, adds nothing to the story, also poorly written, and I hated almost everything about her. There that should be enough ranting for one day. This disgrace of a Terminator movie gets the WillyT Seal of DISapproval.",2,0,3,13 July 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," They Say Sequels Can't Be Better Than Thor Original, They're Wrong
","The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part Two are two sequels that many could argue are better than the originals. I think you can add Terminator 2 Judgment Day to that list. The Terminator was a blockbuster film and a sequel needed to be made. The story was too deep and detailed not to be made. The first movie mentioned John Connor a lot but obviously he wasn't born yet. This movie we see him as a kid and one of the most intense villains in movie history is out to kill him. Another version of the original Terminator also goes back in time to protect John Connor. We got an indestructible cyborg fighting another indestructible cyborg, yes please.Once again the movie starts out with Arnold and the T-1000 going back in time, getting clothes and going after John Connor. The movie followed the same formula but Arnold is now the good guy, which I think is great. Arnold is given more material to work with and in the first one I said he was great as an emotionless robot and that was perfect because there was only one. Now there are two and his relationship with the kid is great. John's father is obviously dead and the Terminator plays the role as his father. Great, it worked, and I love how they even addressed is. I was a little worried about the kid because child actors can destroy a movie. I'm sorry but it's almost a proved fact but this kid worked. I didn't want to jump through the screen and kill him myself so there is a plus. The way he tried to make the cyborg 'human' and gave him some personality was great because that is probably what would have done. He gives Arnold the idea of another memorable line that millions of people around the globe impersonate. 'Hasta la vista, baby.'The T-1000, this guy is awesome. The first time he kills somebody with his metallic arm sword I almost pooped my pants, really. This guy knows how to kill somebody and he is stronger than Arnold was in the first movie, and more deadly. The only reason I think he wasn't as good s because he basically acted the exact same as the first one. He played the emotionless bad guy and is the heartless robot, cool, but it's been done. I'm glad he was the way he was but I like the original better. When we first see John he lives with his foster parents making the audience ask the big question, where is Sarah Connor? Well, she is in a mental institution and her character has been completely transformed into a crazy killing machine. She is crazy. Perfect. I did not expect that but the road they went down worked perfectly. The end of the world and the fact that her son is the only hope of the human race gets to her and she lost it. Props to the actress too for bringing this character to life. She is delusional with her seeing Reece and her dreams of the actual end of the world. The scene where she is at the park behind the fence and the bombs go off is actually scary. The first time I saw it I was scared. One of the best moments in the movie she tries to escape, the lights go out, Arnold walks through the door in slow motion, and Sarah flips out. That entire scene was suspenseful and turned into an action packed car chase with guns blazing. I really liked Sarah in this movie and is my favorite character. I really liked the kid, Arnold was a lot better, but Sarah takes the cake. Her relationship with John is a little weak and is lacking but it's understandable because she is off her rocker. There are great characters and the action is better than ever but how is the story? Hmmmm, better than ever. The story in the first one was so good because of the back story and learning what happens in the future so how can they top that? How about preventing the future? Yes! In T2 we learn all more about Skynet and how the end of the world happens so the whole point of the movie is to prevent Judgment Day. The idea alone is hard to wrap my brain around. I am a sucker for a mind blow and nothing blows my mind more than time and time travel. Finally, we come to the action. The first movie had great action and special effects for the 80s and this tops that by a lot. The T-1000 takes a shotgun shell and looks like a soda can that got shot and he morphs back together like a jellyfish. I can imagine the 1991 audience with their jaws dropped, mine almost did. The Terminator is in its skin a lot more, meaning Arnold gets more screen time and the cyborg skeleton isn't fully shown. I liked that that and seeing one real eye any the creepy red eye is really cool. The car chases are better than ever and the explosions are great to. I understand John didn't want Arnold to kill people but there is one scene where Arnold is blowing up cars and using a minigun and there is no way he didn't kill anybody. Overall, Terminator 2 Judgment Day is a goldmine. Almost everything worked and it is one of my favorite movies. James Cameron is one of those directors who can mesh action and story really well. In most, if not all of his movies he can have great characters and special effects to back it up. It is very rare a sequel can be better than the original movie but there is no question about T2 and there is no question that Terminator 2 gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",10,0,2,12 July 2013
We're the Millers," Cliché but Still Very Funny
","I love surprises for the most part and We're the Millers was a pleasant surprise. I saw trailers for this movie and it seemed like a typical summer comedy that would have a few laughs in far-fetched situations. Basically this is a typical summer comedy with a few laughs in many far-fetched situations. The only difference is the interesting premise. The movie starts out very cleverly. Jason Sudeikis plays a drug dealer who gets robbed so he has to make up for it by smuggling drugs from Mexico. He figures it will be easier if he has a fake family to ease the suspicion. That is very interesting and almost brilliant. It takes the family road trip cliché that has been done before and adds a twist.The twist was there but the clichés were also there and I really hoped they wouldn't have been. The drug dealer dad and stripper mom was great. It is something different and worked really well for the story but the cliché children were a little annoying. The tough and rugged sister was everything you expected with her adult humor and attitude. The brother was a sissy and added his own form of comedy that was also expected, but he was so funny. The brother stole the show and the family was believable. The clichés were there and the story was one that has been done time and time again. The family starts as opposites and they hate each other but slowly start to grow on each other comedically. Is this movie funny? Yes, the movie is very funny at moments. It isn't constant laughter but each scene brings out at least a chuckle. There are parts where the story slows down and it gets a little ridiculous with an obvious solution but it plays out in a way it probably should have. The cliché of all clichés in this movie is the other family.Why? Why does every movie with an RV involved have a crazy family in another RV in which the family constantly crisscrosses with? The other family was funny and probably necessary for the movie but they were so cliché. Some clever writing should have been in place instead of a story we have seen time and time again. This family took the good twist in the premise and diminished it. It was like the Purge. The clever premise disappears with the same old cliché. The family didn't destroy the entire movie but I sat in my chair and couldn't believe that I was watching a dirtier version of the Robin Williams movie RV.Sure a few things annoyed me with the characters and the story, but let's be honest; I went to see this movie to laugh. I laughed a lot during this movie a lot more than I thought I would to be honest. Will Poulter stole the show as the son of the family. Every scene is funny because of him. The best scene is when he sings Waterfall by TLC. He sings the one verse and I was rolling in my seat laughing. Then he is being taught how to kiss from Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts. Come on, that is hysterical and I was hoping there was a scene like that. This kid had no career before this movie but this will put him on the map. This kid has a bright future, mark my words. A major flaw in the movie was the marketing. A lot of the funny moments were shown in the trailers. This isn't the movies fault but I would have laughed more if I didn't see so much in the trailers. OK, this isn't going to be popular but I didn't think Jennifer Aniston was that sexy. That scene shown time and time again in every trailer did nothing for me. That is the scene where she is in her bra and panties but I didn't like it. It was over the top, forced, and I expected it to be later in the movie. This happens and then there is like another 45 minutes left. Don't get me wrong, Aniston was the perfect choice for the role and she did a great job but that one scene was too much. If I wrote this movie I would have done a thing or two differently. With the idea of sneaking in and out of Mexico I was looking forward to some chaos in Mexico with a lot of buildup to actually crossing the border. That didn't happen. They make it over and back over the border before any chaos even happens. It was a missed opportunity. This movie could have went in many different directions but again played into the clichés. Luckily they worked and it was still very entertaining. Was this movie how I wanted it to be? No. Was it funny enough for me to enjoy? Yes. Would I see it again? Probably not. Once was enough and I'm content. Don't expect me to buy it on blu ray or go out of my way to see it. It was good the first time but if it's on TV I'll give it another go. Other than that I'm done with the Millers. Overall, We're the Millers was a good time. I have no 'ragrets' about seeing this movie and if you see it you should enjoy it. It had its obvious flaws but I was able to loom past them and enjoy a fun summer comedy. This movie is nothing more or less than a solid WillyT Recommendation. I give it a high recommendation. I liked more than I didn't like in this movie and the Millers were an entertaining bunch. They basically did their job.",6,2,9,12 August 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Din Not Expect This
","He goes from a terrible hangover twice, to being a freak out of jail, to a bipolar man fighting for the love of his wife, way to go Bradley Cooper. Silver Linings Playbook is an Oscar nominated film for best picture for many things. Bradley Cooper for best actor, Robert DeNiro for best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best director, Jennifer Lawrence won for best Actress, and it was also nominated for best picture. This film deserved most of its nominations, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely deserved her Oscar win. Silver Linings Playbook was not something I expected to be good, good thing I was wrong.I didn't think Bradley Cooper could do this well in a lead role. His performance blew me away. His mood swings, his charisma, and his charm gave him an Oscar nomination. He went from a drinking problem to a mood disorder. He caught his wife cheating on him and he lost it. With a combination of that and his wedding song playing at the time, he beat him within an inch of his life. He was then rehabilitated in a medical facility for mood disorders and the movie kicks off with his release. In the very opening scene with his mother we see the comedic charm he brings to the movie. He helps his friend escape and they play it off like he was released as well and just needed a ride. This is a gag they play throughout the movie and the character himself is a nice touch to the movie. From the first scene to the last Cooper gives it his all. My favorite scene is when it is late at night and he is reading A Farewell to Arms and he is angered by the ending. He goes ballistic and throws the book through the window, waking up the whole neighborhood. We see him go from happy to angry to sad to sorry and it was a really well acted scene. He goes nuts, his father panics, the mother cries, and it ends with a touching moment. We also see conflict between him and his father. Robert DeNiro plays the father who has obsessions with football rituals. He is much like his son and DeNiro did do a really good job in the role but I don't think he deserved an Oscar nomination. I expected a little more from his character and I was a little disappointed. He likes to have his son there watching the game, he has three remotes a certain was, all because he believes it will help the Eagles win the game. It is little moments like these that drive the movie forward and lead to the rest of the film. Then we meet Tiffany. Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany and right when you see her on screen everybody knows that the story will instantly turn to the relationship between Pat and Tiffany. It did, it was a little cheesy, but it worked. Cooper and Lawrence had this natural chemistry and you could tell they liked being together and acting together. They have similar problems and similar personalities and they bounce off each other in the most entertaining way possible. At first they don't like each other. Another scene was when they are in the diner and they are both taking shots at each other and Tiffany goes nuts. It is scenes like that which got her the Oscar nomination, and she well deserved the win. Overall, Silver Linings Playbook really had it all, humor, romance, touching moments, and scenes I could watch again and again. I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did, and that is never a bad thing. With strong acting led by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, funny humor, a strong supporting cast, and a fantastic script Silver Linings was one of the best films of 2012 and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. It is a movie you don't judge by the cover and really need to get into. If you have a girlfriend or boyfriend, watch it with them because it is a good movie for couples. Watch it again and again and appreciate how Bradley Cooper made this transition from comedy to a film that was mainly drama. Look past the cheesy moments and the easily predictable ending and just embrace the magic of film.",9,0,2,15 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry Potter 3 was Good Enough for Me
","Part two of my Harry Potter reviews is a single review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. This movie is very different from the previous two and also from the next five films. We have the same actors from the other two, the only real difference is the director. The director for this film is Alfonso Cuarón and he put his own directing style into the movie. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not. He really is the major strength and weakness of the movie itself.Here we are, year three, and another year at Hogwarts is on the way, but a mass murderer named Sirius Black has escaped. Sirius Black is built as an evil character down to the core. You even see it in his name 'Black.' Black is a color that literally means evil and bad. He is accused of selling out the Potters to Voldemort. Now he is after Harry so Hogwarts is sort of on lockdown. That's our story but I think it was one of the most well written stories. In this movie we are introduced to a lot of new characters and animals. It is a different view of the magic world. There is a little less physical magic such as spells and potions and more of an abstract magic. We have Dementors, Buckbeak, the boggart, werewolves, and animagus' , and many other ways the magic world blows our minds. I like most of them but I have a few problems with the Dementors. First off, they are a complete rip off of the Ringwraiths from Lord of the Rings. Rowling likes to take ideas from Tolkien and make a tiny difference. I don't like that and seeing it on screen just made me think of Frodo and the ring. Dementors are beings that wear all black and have a skeleton like appearance under the cloaks. They are really terrifying and symbolize fear and death. People feel cold when they are near and they suck the happy memories from people. It is a really good idea and it fits well with the film but the appearance could have been done differently. This is twice that Rowling rips off Tolkien and there are more on the way. Its frustrating to fans of movies and books. We are also introduced to Professor Lupin and he is one of my favorite characters throughout. He is a great character and a role model in Harry so in turn he is a role model to the audience. He was a childhood friend of the Potters and he teaches Harry how to fight the Dementors. He has a weird feeling and throughout the film I got the sense he was hiding something and he wasn't all he was showing. I knew this by following the pattern. All Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers have a major flaw and Lupin seemed too good to be true. This is the first movie not directed by Chris Columbus and this is almost a completely different movie. The color scheme is really different. It is very dark and most scenes are dark. He decides to have the kids wear regular street clothes a lot rather than the Hogwarts robes. He tries to be fun and funny a lot in the movie and most of the time it doesn't work. From the opening title sequence when Harry is trying to light up his wand and Uncle Vernon comes in and out of the room. It is supposed to be funny and I think he made too much of an effort to be comical in a simple title screen. We see it again with the shrunken head. Let's set the scene. Harry just made his aunt Marge into a balloon floating up in the sky, OK that was funny and I enjoyed it so touché, but Harry is emotionally torn and upset. He runs away from home and sees the creepy dog so he is sad, scared, and angry. Then the Knight Bus shows up and we hear about Sirius Black and how he is a murderer. All these negative emotions and feelings and it instantly turns to comedy with his one liners and unfunny comments to Ernie. The whole Knight Bus scene was a disaster and I wish it was done differently. Not all was a fail. I liked the scene when Marge was blown up and the buttons flew off and hit Dudley. It was funny and it worked. Same with Harry in the invisibility cloak and hitting Draco with snowballs and messing with Hermione and Ron. Little things like that made the movie better and added a nice touch to a very depressing and sad story arch. A big question in making the movie is how they will handle the big twist at the end and how mind bending the writing is. I think it was done brilliantly. Walking out it made me think how it actually happened. It was a different type of magic and the director nailed it perfectly. It had a plot hole or two but it makes the audience think and try to make sense of it so that's a good thing. The third book and movie is very significant in my opinion. It is different from all the rest mainly because Voldemort isn't that important. He is only mentioned a few times but he isn't a real threat. Sirius Black is the primary focus as the bad guy. I loved that. I like that there was another sense of evil in the world other than Voldemort. There was something else to fear and it made the world more real and believable. Overall, Harry Potter 3 is not a bad movie but it has a few flaws. The directing style is really well done but has a few things I did not like so Harry Potter 3 gets the WillyT Honorable Mention.",8,1,2,7 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," OK, but the original was better
",Pros: Acton scenes were fantastic. I saw it in IMAX so the 3d was awesome. The effects were amazing and the lizard looked real. The web didn't look like fishing line and the Spiderman suit looked a lot better. Martin sheen made a good Uncle Ben but Toby McGuire made a better peter parker. Overall it was an OK movie but the original was a lot better. Cons: acting was mediocre. Peter Parker had a lot of cheesy 1 liner and was less of a nerd. Peter parker is a nerd not a skateboarder. The character of Uncle Ben was less of a hero and more of a random guy. He and aunt may were less important. The main difference is character development...or lack thereof. Luckily I didn't have 2 stare at Kirsten Dunce 4 2 hours. The new girl was hot but their love story was not as epic. The story was more about action and less about Spiderman. I didn't like that. I like character development and more about the story. Characters were mentioned and forgotten. The guy who kills Uncle Ben is seen 1 time and never seen again. Loose ends. The main villain doesn't die. He lives. Retarded. The entire movie was predictable. Not because I knew Uncle Ben was going to die. I knew what was going in the climax and the end 30 minutes before it happened. Overall it was an OK movie with really good and really bad. It can't compare to the original but as its own movie it was decent. I would recommend it but i will not buy it or see it again. The fact that they r going to make 2 more is a big mistake.,6,3,7,14 July 2012
Independence Day," Well, It Could Have Been Worse
","Welcome to WillyT Reviews. Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, and aliens. Now that's a recipe for success. Independence day takes place over a three day period and between those three days the world's population is reduced to basically nothing after a wave of aliens attack. Bill Pullman plays the President and he is probably my favorite portrayal of a US president on film. Jeff Goldblum knocks it out of the park again as the smartest man on Earth. Then there is Will Smith who matures from The Fresh Prince to a pilot in the army and even though he is playing a role with more seriousness but still has his wit and comedic charm. There is a lot to talk about with this movie but my limit is 1000 words, here we go.The opening scene, if you have followed my reviews recently I talk a lot about the opening scenes and other than the cliché REM song 'It's The End of the World as We Know It' the movie zoned me in right away. It starts on the moon and the spaceships just hover over and descend towards Earth. I feel like the movie kind of jumped into it and had very little character development in the beginning but they made up for it in the middle and end. The ships fly over major cities all over the world and the first act concludes with the destruction of cities and the death of millions. Like I said earlier I love the characters and how they develop in the film, especially the president. Bill Pullman starts out as an unpopular President who has made poor decisions in the past. As disaster strikes he grows a backbone and becomes a strong leader. His little speech about Independence Day was really inspirational. It was a little cheesy but it did its job and I liked it. Jeff Goldblum learns how to love again and he becomes a stronger person and a better man. Will Smith grows up in a way and his dream comes true. It's a little weird but the destruction of Earth and the almost extinction of humanity was kind of a good thing for these people. In a way it makes the world stronger and one can assume what happens after the credits roll and my imagination went wild, which is never a bad thing.My favorite character is David's Jewish uncle. I forget his name but he is hilarious and steals every scene he is a part of. Was his acting memorable or amazing, no, but I feel like the actor was just being himself and he did such a fluent job that reflected on screen. His lines fit well and are smart at the same time witty. Towards the end he is praying in a circle. He invites a man to join him, 'I'm not Jewish' he says 'Nobody's perfect.' He responds. In the time of disaster and fear he still cracks a joke and made me smile. He was a perfect blend to the movie. Let's talk about the aliens. Now I have a few problems with them. They look OK, a little unrealistic and silly but it could have been worse. I like how they use technology and communicate with each other but they have shields around their ships. That's cheating and makes it almost impossible to stop them. I thought it was lame and the movie could have worked without them, maybe even better. Finally, they have no reason for the attack. They literally go from planet to planet and kill everything. 'They're like locusts.' The President says after he actually communicates with them in my favorite scene. I wanted a better reason. After the buildup in the first act and half of the second act it made me think, wow that's it. That makes no sense. The aliens are so smart and are basically invulnerable but they make so many stupid mistakes. Watching the movie conclude I didn't really buy it. I was OK with the ending and I enjoyed it but it was not as good as I expected. I won't spoil the ending but it's not like War of The Worlds where they just die from the parasites and particles in the air. My feelings on that is for another time. When it comes to alien movies I have been let down so many times by the ending. Signs, War of the Worlds, and now Independence Day, out of those three movies this one had the best ending but I don't think it was enough because it wasn't realistic. Overall, Independence Day was a good movie with really good special effects. I could watch historic buildings all over the country being blown up and the wall of fire tearing cities apart all day long. The lead characters were strong, the acting wasn't terrific but it worked and they developed well. Side characters were fun and fit nicely, specifically the General and David's Uncle. The aliens were OK, foolish but still scary. The story was really good and presented well but had a disappointing ending. I see this movie on TV all the time and whenever it's on I can hop right in and watch it while still being entertained. It is a good movie to watch alone or with a group, it can be a background movie so I give Independence Day the Willyt Honorable Mention for its characters and their development, the awesome special effects and its entertainment value.

No Country for Old Men," Confusing Title, Amazing Movie
","People complain about endings way too often. I sat down and watched No Country for Old Men tonight and the entire movie blew me away but the ending is something I will not touch upon in this review but something I am willing to discuss. Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones star in a fight for two million dollars. The Coen Brothers directed this masterpiece and it was all over the Oscars. Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin, stumbles on a drug deal gone badly in the middle of the desert in west Texas. He also stumbles upon two million dollars. Anton, Javier Bardem, is on a rampage as he wants to find the money. Ed Tom Bell, Tommy Lee Jones, is following the two of them in a battle for the cash.Movie making is an art form and any good director does everything on purpose. The Coen brothers did everything right in this movie. All three main characters are never seen on screen but are so much alike and connected. If you dig deep into the details in this movie you will notice so many similarities between the three. The directing the two of the brothers do is one of the best I have ever seen in any movie. They choose to have very little music in their movie. That is a very bold and risky move in my opinion, but one that worked out beautifully. Most of the time you hear wind of the desert of a train in the distance. Dogs and children are constantly heard. Its music that makes the movie but also the little things.Javier Bardem scared me. There I said it and I don't regret it. He is straight up evil in this movie. He is evil but he also has a code of ethics or morals. He is the antagonist, the killer, the bad guy, but he is 'fair'. There are a few scenes where he confronts people. Sometimes he kills them and sometimes he does not. The idea of the coin flip and the person gets to make the call and if he/she is right, they get to live. That idea is terrifying and you can see it on the face of a gas station owner. I was on the edge of my seat as he was on the edge of his life. Josh Brolin does a great job in this movie but I hated Llewelyn. First of all I can't spell or say his name and I know that's not a good reason not to like somebody, but hey, it's my opinion. Llewelyn is supposed to be the protagonist but the actions he takes and how he acts I didn't really care if he lived or died. Not because his character was boring or unimportant, but because I knew I was supposed to cheer him on but he was a scumbag. His greed got to him as he became a nutcase with the money. He mistreated his wife, in my opinion, and just wasn't that great a guy to begin with. I hated his character but I loved the role he played in the movie. His end result in the movie wasn't disappointing, meaning I was happy with it, but I would have liked to see a little bit more out of it. There was a scene I needed to see with him in it, but it wasn't there.Tommy Lee Jones is one of those actors who rarely flops and this is not one of them. Ed Tom is the cop trailing behind the two madmen fighting over the money. He has to put the pieces together. His role isn't too major and he kind of pops in and out of the movie, but he is magnificent. I lived his character; he was the real only pure character. This movie needed a guy like Ed Tom. He brought wit and charm to the character and as dark and exciting this movie was, it was also funny. There is a scene I need to talk about. Llewelyn is at the Mexico border, covered in blood, and he runs into three guys. He tells the guy he will give him $500 for his shirt. The guy asks to see the money first. The other guy asks if he had been in a car accident, twice. Llewelyn gives him the money and then asks the other guy for his beer. The third guy asks how much for the beer. Now earlier I said how the three characters are connected. I mentioned this scene in particular; I'll let you figure out the rest. Think about it. It is the pure brilliance in this movie. If I want to talk a flaw in this movie I would say its Woody Harrelson's character. I don't understand why he was there, I didn't find him important and he was a petty minor character. I probably didn't understand his importance because I couldn't understand a word he said. When I watch any movie I throw on subtitles but I watched this for a film class and there were no subtitles. The Texan accent annoyed me to pieces and parts of the movie were hard to understand. I give a pass to Tommy Lee Jones because he is like that and every movie. Overall, No Country for Old Men is an amazing movie. If you are a fan of movies and like a high detailed story than this is for you. If you like good acting and relatable characters than this is for you. If you like wild goose chases tan this is the movie for you. If you like Oscar worthy movies than this is for you. If you like movies that get the WillyT Seal of Approval, than this is the movie for you.",9,2,4,19 November 2013
Batman Begins," Batman Begins
","I saw Batman Begins in theaters and I wasn't impressed. In fact, I really didn't like the movie at all. I was in 4th grade so that really doesn't mean much, but if I knew The Dark Knight was a sequel, I probably would not have seen it. Since I loved The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, I decided to watch the original once again, and of course it was in Blu-Ray.I had a few problems with this movie. There was no real villain. The Scarecrow, Ra's Al Ghul, and the mobster. There is a lot going on and it turns into am mess. The action isn't that great. Yes, the train sequence at the end is really cool and batman's fighting scenes are awesome but this movie just wasn't that good. It was sloppy with all the different villains and it got a bit confusing. Scarecrow has this gas that makes people afraid and they see it when he wears his mask. I don't even know, it makes no sense, and the mob boss just becomes unimportant when in the beginning he was the big deal in Gotham. I would have liked to see Ra's Al Ghul more. We see him train batman to become batman, they have their little standoff, and then he disappears and he is forgotten.Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Michael Craine were also in the movie, but they were not nearly as important as they were in the following movies. Alfred is more of a butler and less of a father figure or a mentor. Gordon is just a cop in this movie and he is even almost irrelevant. He has that one important scene when Bruce is a child but that's really it. Rachel is a different actress from The Dark Knight and she was just awful. Her character really seemed unnecessary in this movie as she didn't really connect with Bruce Wayne. They were childhood friends, best friends, and when Bruce comes back to Gotham after years of being away, she acts like nothing happened. She was bland and emotionless. She doesn't actually become important until the last act of the movie.This movie wasn't all bad. Christopher Nolan does a great job setting up the character Batman. Bruce Wayne's origin story is really interesting when he is in the well and his fear of bats. Watching him evolve into Batman was something fans can enjoy. I liked how Ra's Al Ghul became Batman's mentor and trained him to be Batman. His involvement and departure from the League of Shadows needed to be portrayed correctly for this movie to work, and Nolan knocked it out of the park. Hans Zimmer does an outstanding job with the score to this movie. Nothing feels more right than Batman standing of a rooftop, cape blowing in the wind, and the epic sound of low brass ringing out. Zimmer really knows how to make music come alive in a movie.Overall, Batman Begins was a disappointing show. I didn't like it when I was in 4th grade and I still don't like it now at the age of 18. The acting was below average, there was a confusion to who the villain was, the story was sloppy, and characters were irrelevant and boring. There were a few shines of light and that pushed into the next two movies and really exploded. There is a reason why Batman Begins came out in 2005 and The Dark Knight years later. Most people were surprised that The Dark Knight was a sequel so that really doesn't say much for Batman Begins. I give this movie the WillyT A For Effort.",6,1,2,15 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Not Lord of The Rings, but Who Cares Still Amazing
","Every great story has a beginning. That is what The Hobbit is to The Lord of The Rings. Before I actually start I want to acknowledge that a lot of critics are very hard on this movie. People need to realize that this is the beginning of three movies and the next two are sure to be a lot better but this isn't Lord of The Rings, it is a completely different story with a completely different goal. The book itself was made for kids and the movie is very by the book, and that is not a bad thing. I watched this movie and did not compare it because there is no comparison. As A huge fan of the series I could not do that. It is a separate movie from the others and should be viewed as an individual trilogy. The story for the Hobbit is one of revenge and adventure. Bilbo Baggins is a simple hobbit who lives in the Shire but one day is visited by the wizard, Gandalf who offers to go on an adventure. After a night with 13 dwarfs and the wizard himself Bilbo sets off the help the dwarfs reclaim their lost land of Erebor on the Lonely Mountain. Years before the dwarf city had struck a mine of gold in their city and it was attacked by the Dragon Smaug. It was overrun and for generations the dwarf kings have tried to get it back. Is this movie perfect, no but it wasn't as bad as people say. Radagast the Brown is the Hermit of Middle-Earth and has taken a lot of the brunt of the pickiness of this movie. I think he served his purpose and was fine in the movie as he was. The thirteen dwarfs are forgettable but they aren't all supposed to be relatable. The audience isn't supposed to remember all of them; they are just part of the story. You are supposed to connect with Thorin Oakenshield, Balin, and the two brothers, maybe even the really fat one. The rest are just fillers for the story and provide muscle and even comic relief. The beginning was a little slow and even a little boring and that made it a little tough to get into the world of Middle-Earth once again. At times I didn't feel like I was in Middle-Earth. There was a lot of CGI where as in the original trilogy there were extras in costume instead of CGI goblins. It was a little disappointing and some scenes were pointless. I could have done without the boxing mountains. I understand it was part of the book and Peter Jackson wanted it to be as much like the book as possible but there should be a limit. People also say the movie was too long. To that I say absolutely not. People were saying scenes should have been left out for the extended addition. Why wait? Put it all in one and save me some money later. My major problem was that I saw basically everything I was looking forward to so now I'm not as excited for the other two. That isn't really a problem as much as its me just being stupid. Also, I didn't like how Bilbo found the ring. In fellowship it seemed like the ring left Gollum while as in the Hobbit Bilbo found it by pure chance. Small things so let's talk about the positives. Middle-Earth itself looked amazing. The atmosphere was there, Middle- Earth was back once I felt like I was there. I loved seeing the three trolls and paying attention to how close it resembled the book. The wargs looked great. Gandalf didn't look ten years older and the character of Bilbo was very believable and relatable. The dwarfs were entertaining and the entire movie itself had a funny side to it. I found myself chuckling at times and it was a lighter side to the story I enjoyed. The little things made me really enjoy the movie. Especially seeing old characters even as cameos. I loved seeing Frodo, old Bilbo, Saruman, Galadrial, Elrond, and of course, Gollum. My favorite scene was with Gandalf, Elrond, Saruman, and Galadrial talking about the Necromancer and the morgal blade. It had so much information and foreshadow for the next two movies and the three that have already been made. The Necromancer is obviously going to be Sauron and Gandalf knows that there is a greater evil at work in Middle-Earth. It was odd seeing Saruman on the good side once again but it shows a lot of his character. It was also strange seeing Elrond and Galadrial speak as if nothing was wrong. Every time we saw them before they were talking about the end of the world and the destruction of men. Now they are happy and it's just a side I laughed at. Their so naive and it all changes just sixty years later. The Hobbit connected so much with the Lord of The Rings and even though it has its flaws it was still very enjoyable. Overall, this movie is not, and was not supposed to be, as good as the other three but it was still very good. Go see this movie if you were a fan of the original three. This movie was made for the die-hard fans like me. You have to know a lot about the story and Middle-Earth to enjoy the full experience. Maybe that is why critics did not enjoy the film as much as anticipated. This movie is doomed to comparison and for that it will not really be remembered as a classic or one of the best like Lord of The Rings. It will make a lot of money but will only be remembered by the true fans of Tolkien. I give The Hobbit the WillyT Honorable Mention because it had some obvious flaws, but I will surely buy it on Blu-Ray and enjoy it again and again.",7,4,14,19 December 2012
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A Worthy Sequel
","Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original.Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie.Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame.The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.",6,0,2,28 April 2013
Django Unchained," Tarantino At His Finest
","Going into a Tarantino film I expected a lot of blood and gore with a lot of action. I also expected an extremely unusual soundtrack. I didn't really have high hopes for a story line but Django Unchained didn't meet all of those expectations. What lacked in action, for the first 70% at least, thrived in rich characters and an amazing story. This movie completely blew me away. Django is a slave who was set free by a bounty hunter so he could get help on a bounty. The deal was for Django to help with the bounty in exchange for freedom. Now, I thought that was going to be the entire movie with one act dedicated to hunting down one brother. Instead the three brothers are all taken down at once and then I'm wondering where they go from there. Django then tells a story of how he was married and he and his wife were separated. The bounty hunter, Dr. Schultz is German and Django's wife was also German so they set on a quest to go save her. That is the real story. Find the wife and gain the freedom. Jamie Foxx kills it as Django. It was so much fun to watch his character develop from a shaky slave into a cold blooded killer. He is driven by revenge at first and then by love. He wants to find his wife. He and Dr. Schultz naturally get along and connect. Their relationship drives the movie for the first half. Christoph Waltz shows an Oscar caliber performance as Django's mentor. He teaches Django how to kill and be a bounty hunter. In essence, he really saved his life. He treats Django like a man and not a slave. He lets him ride a horse, take the kill, even dress how he wants. From the beginning he makes his appearance in this movie known and sets the tone for the entire movie. Django's wife is owned by one of the biggest slave owners in the South, Calvin Candie, who is played by Leo DiCaprio. Leo steals the show. He plays the villain and you can tell he enjoyed it and had so much fun with the role. The first scene he is in he is watching a brawl between slaves. It is a fight to the death and he is cheering on his slave. One problem with the movie I do have is that it can be very disturbing at times. Seeing blood everywhere from being beaten to a pulp is hard to watch. I think he ripped an eye out as well. Then he finished him off with a hammer to the skull. The blood and death isn't the problem, it's the idea of why he is killing him. It is for pure amusement and money of Candie. That was his first scene and the audience knows he means business and he is an evil man. I don't really know if anybody expected this movie to be as funny as it was but it was hilarious. From the first scene to the ending credits I was laughing constantly. Schultz provides a lot of the comic relief but a cameo by Jonah Hill made me lose it. Jonah hill was part of a gang that I think was supposed to be the KKK and the entire scene was just fun to watch. I saw him and my first thought was, Oh no, why is he going to ruin this movie. Thankfully it was just a cameo and it fit perfectly. The rest of the movie had its laughs and its moments that I won't soon forget. When you see a Tarintino film you can expect a strange soundtrack. Kill Bill had a great soundtrack that had a lot to do with culture and the scenes provided. The opening credits had a strange western song with the lyrics saying Django over and over again. I was pleased to see I was going to get what I wanted. I say it time and time again, music makes the movie and in Django Unchained, the music makes this a better movie. During the action sequences there was one or two times that rap music was playing and it kind of fit but I didn't like it. It took me out of the moment. I was so into this movie and I felt like I was really there but there was no rap music in the 1800s so it almost ruined the moment. People can find this movie really offensive. I really don't know why but I decided to count how many times they said the N word. I counted 101. Websites say 100+ or 110, but I counted 101 and I'm sticking to it. People are mad at Tarintino for doing this but it is the time period. It was how America was at the time. It isn't offensive, it's accurate. People also thought this movie was too long. Its 165 minutes, almost three hours, but in my opinion there is no such thing as too long a movie. I could have sat in that theatre for three more hours if t let me enjoy the masterpiece I was watching. I understand it s uncomfortable sitting n a movie theatre seat for a really long time but when I'm in the comfort of my own home I never want a movie to end. Overall, Django Unchained was a movie I'm not going to forget anytime soon. The action was scattered thorough out the movie but really exploded in the final act. The dialog was comical and clever. The music was mostly fantastic. The acting was Oscar worthy and it was highly entertaining. Go see this movie because it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",9,2,12,31 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Simply a Masterpiece
","Now I'm aware the Lord of The Rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. They next one also picks up right where the other left off. Here we go the review of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, The Lord of The Rings. Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by J.R.R. Tolkien and it is the most cliché story of good vs. evil. The story is stereotypical, but it works. Tolkien created his own world of Middle-Earth and it is filled with different races and languages. In the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil, 'one ring to rule them all.' The maker of this ring was named Sauron and long story short, he was defeated but survived through the ring. The ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. He has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of Sauron destroy Middle-Earth. The storyline is very cliché. It is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. If you think you have seen this before, you have, but this is completely different. The little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord.One of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. Gandalf's relationship with Frodo and the ring. Frodo's relationship with Sam, Gollum, and the Ring. Gollum's relationship with the ring. Merry's relationship with Pippin. All of these relationships drive this movie. Nothing is more powerful then the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Samwise Gamgee is more than Frodo's best friend, he is basically his protector. Sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. Frodo could not have survived without Sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Sauron has all the power of persuasion, power of armies, fear, and all the power in the world. The only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power.Coming in second with relationships is between Gollum and the Ring. Think about it, Gollum spent more time with the Ring than anybody else, excluding its master Sauron. Gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. It literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you can't help but pity. He is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isn't his fault that he is the way he is. He is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. Any fan of these movies knows what I'm talking about.Over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. Gimli and Legolas didn't like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. 'I never thought I'd die side by side with an elf,' Gimli says in the final battle. 'How about side by side with a friend?' Legolas answers. These two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. You also see Merry and Pippin evolve into something I know I did not expect. In the first movie they were silly and naïve but in the second movie Merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. Pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters.These three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. From Hobbiton to Rivendell to Helms Deep and all the way to the Crack of Doom, every place in Middle-Earth comes to life. The designers of these sets and CGI went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. You learn how Hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in New Zealand. My favorite battle has to be the battle of Helms Deep. It was 10,000 Uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of Rohan for centuries. Aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie.These movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. Peter Jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in New Zealand and filmed this masterpiece. Costumes were made and WETA Workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of Middle-Earth come alive. Actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. The only real problem with these movies is that if you don't know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. I saw the first movie when I was really young and I had no idea what it was about and I had to see the movies many, many times before I knew what was going on. As soon as I did, I was hooked and now I know almost everything there is to know about these movies.Overall, The Lord of the Rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. The way the filmmakers dove into the world of Middle-Earth with such detail is commendable. This movie won so many awards, made a bunch of money, and it deserves everything it got. These are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you don't, go in, pay attention, and join the experience. Lord of The Rings is my favorite movie, next to Titanic, and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",9,0,2,5 February 2013
I Am Legend," Will Smith Strikes Again
","Everyone you or I have ever known has seen this movie and will read this review. I am Legend was not really what I expected. Will Smith delivers another great performance as a scientist in a post disaster New York City. Once upon a time it was believed that a cure for cancer was discovered. It turned out that this cure turned into a virus and killed most of the world's population. Some survivors turned into infected zombie-like monsters. Then they started feeding on the living and leaving a small living population of humans left in the world. Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist who is looking for a cure. The search for a cure keeps him alive because he feels he can fix the mistake humanity made. He is at ground zero; it is 'his site.' He is alone in the entire city, but finds ways to keep his sanity. He exercises, talks to manikins, and is in love with his dog. He takes care of his dog Sam and she becomes a beloved character. Smith also watches old newscasts on TV. His brilliance in this movie is remarkable. He is in survival mode and he raids old houses and scavenges the city for supplies. Every night he puts his house in lockdown to keep out the infected. He has many weapons and has set explosives around is house, and sprays gas everywhere. How he has survived and the preparation he makes everyday just makes the movie different. There isn't a lot of dialogue or characters so the audience needs another way to be entertained, and it worked. This movie had chilling moments, funny moments, heart breaking moments, and memorable moments. Throughout the movie we see flashbacks of what happened during the evacuation of New York. We learn the story of his daughter and wife and what happened to them. His daughter, Marley, is an important character herself. She reveals symbols and is a symbol herself. She is named after Bob Marley and his music is heard throughout. In one flashback Marley talks about a butterfly. 'Look daddy, a butterfly.' This becomes important later towards the end of the film. It is little things like that which makes the movie interesting and something a real fan can enjoy.Now, New York is infested with former human beings but are now infected with the virus. They hate the sunlight but come out at night and wreak havoc. In blu ray these monsters are terrifying. Their screams sound real; you can see the detail of how their skin had burns and their veins pop out. Meanwhile, Neville catches one in a brilliant scheme and he puts it in his lab. Neville is immune to the virus so he cannot become infected but he tests the cure on rats and eventually the human sample. This angers the infected and they get back at him.The infected are smart themselves and set up a trap. They move a manikin into a position and Neville's insanity kicks in and he thinks the manikin is real and he shoots it. Then he goes over to it and gets caught in a wire. He passes out and wakes up at dusk. He cuts himself down and injures his leg, again brilliant by infected humans. What happens next is just epic. The infected let out their infected dogs to attack. Neville and Sam crawl back and there is a final ray of sunshine keeping the dogs from attacking. The inevitable attack commences and Sam, the dog, makes the ultimate sacrifice. Neville survives but Sam is hurt, really bad, and Neville has to choke out is dog and best friend. That scene was powerful and difficult to watch. We don't see the dog. We see Will Smith's face and his reaction as the claws of the dog scratch along the floor and eventually stop. This brings the introduction to two new characters Anna and Ethan. They save Neville's life when he basically tries to commit suicide and take down infected with him. Anna saves his life and brings him home. Smith shows more insanity and how he has no people skills anymore and the only good thing the kid does in the movie is pick up the knife when Neville flips out and tosses the plate. The kid really annoyed me and he was an unnecessary character. He didn't say one word in his thirty minutes on screen and was pointless.Other problems with the movie were small. In the beginning when Will Smith is driving the brand new car in a post apocalyptic world. Come on? That's just the car paying the movie to advertise their new product. Ethan was pointless, Anna was not in the movie enough and honestly at time I was a little board with the movie. There were very few characters, little development, and little action. It was still a fun movie and given the circumstances it was still a good movie.Overall, I Am Legend was a good time. I bought it on blu ray, so it was a good movie. I could watch it again and again and still be entertained. It had a great a great storyline, a fantastic lead actor, awesome special effects, and clever moments. Is this movie really memorable? Not really, it isn't a classic but it is a good activity to do on a rainy day. Watch it alone, with friends, whoever. Small children may be scared but no big deal. I am Legend gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",8,0,0,14 October 2012
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood may be old but he can still deliver a good movie
","When I heard a movie was named after a call I thought, 'How good can it be?' Of course I am talking about Grand Torino. Grand Torino is about an old man named Walt, Clint Eastwood, and he befriends his Asian neighbor named Thao after he tries to steal Walt's Grand Torino as an initiation to join his cousin's gang. He didn't want to steal the car but he has to work to pay off the debt and Walt teaches him how to be a man and Thao also teaches Walt how to coexist. Walt gets mixed up in gang warfare and has to make difficult decisions along the way. Clint Eastwood's racism and devotion towards his Asian neighbors makes this movie mix well. The story itself was greatly written but there were no surprises or unexpected turns. The story was very basic but it worked. If something happened terrible happened to a character, which it does, you feel sorry and mad even. People care about these characters and by the end you see how each and every single character developed and changed. Not all movies have that affect and this movie did it differently. Thao became a man, Walt learned to care and be a different man, and the priest learned life lessons. Clint Eastwood is certainly getting old and can't do much of what he used to do in Dirty Harry or his other classics. He plays an old man who just lost his wife, he is a Korean war veteran, which he struggles with, he barely knows or gets along with his two sons and their families. The war really damaged this man. He could not get attached to his kids or relate to them. He developed a racist attitude towards every race and color. At the party that man reads into his whole life and that scene basically sums up the struggles in his life. He also confesses to the priest but it isn't as strong. The only thing he ever loved was his 1972 Grand Torino. Eastwood was a perfect pick for the part but wouldn't win any award for his acting. At his age what can you expect? He did his best and he did pretty damn good.Stereotypes are used in everyday life but this movie crosses some lines, but necessary line crossing. This movie may be offensive but it offends everybody. Mainly Asians but it also touches on blacks, Mexicans, and even white people. Clint Eastwood makes a remark towards Asians intelligence. People who get offended towards movies and remarks made in movies are just stupid. It's a movie and that is how parts of the world really work. Sometimes in the movie, and for comic relief and there is nothing wrong with it.Problems with the movie are that it can get boring. For a long time nothing really happens and it's more talking and character development. Character development and relationships between characters is very important but it has to be done correctly. There were also loose ends. Walt's kids weren't really important. One tries to move Walt to a retirement home and he tries to get along with him it just doesn't work. The kids could have had potential for a bigger part in the story but it failed. Walt's illness or disease was a big deal but it didn't really matter. It could have been why he made his decision in the end, or so I think. Thao likes that girl but we never see what happens. A big part of the movie was him becoming a man and his own person and a working relationship and showing the success would really express that. Maybe it would be a little cliché but it's a risk that could have been taken. Culture, I haven't seen a movie that shows so much culture. The Hmong culture is so complex and this movie does a great job of showing it. Not touching the head, don't look in the eye, smile when yelled at, the food, the music, the rituals, all important examples that gave the movie a unique edge. It also touches on black culture and gang culture. Life in the gang is terrible but that is how it works. This movie was accurate and precise with the aspect of culture.Overall this movie was a little boring at times but the story was still fantastic. It was very close but Gran Torino does get the WillyT seal of approval. It's a movie that should probably be seen alone but can be seen with friends and have a good time. It's a good movie, I've seen better, I've seen worse, but still a movie I can easily watch and will watch again. If you haven't seen Gran Torino it's a movie you can buy without seeing, you won't be disappointed.",7,2,3,10 August 2012
Lincoln," A New Look on One of Our Greatest Presidents
","Daniel Day Lewis is Abraham Lincoln. The amazing actor makes history as he wins his third Oscar for best actor in a leading role. Lewis gives possibly his best performance to date as he plays the aging Lincoln as he enters his second term and tries to pass the 13th amendment which would abolish slavery. This best picture nomination had a strong cast in Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and of course, Daniel Day Lewis. In my opinion this movie deserved the best picture over Argo, but this was still an excellent film, easily the best I have seen in a while. I always pictured Abraham Lincoln as a tall strong man with a deep and powerful voice. Steven Spielberg teaches me a history lesson with how Lincoln was. Lewis portrays him as a gentle and kind human being with a soft and subtle voice. He is charming and smart and the way he talks gets people excited. He provides humor and charm when he talks and it is factors like these which could possibly make him the greatest president this country has ever seen. The most amazing part of this movie is Lincoln himself and how it was an uphill battle to abolish slavery. He knew in his heart that it was wrong. He believed in the idea that all men are created equal and he also knew the only way to end the Civil War and unite the country once again was to end slavery. He gave countless speeches and monologues throughout the film and every time I would stop and just listen to his voice. Not so much what he was saying but how he said it. His delivery was perfect and I felt like I wasn't watching a move but I was actually there. It is rare that a movie actually does that for anybody. During that time some people considered Lincoln to be a tyrant. A tyrant is easily the wrong word but he was a larger than life character. He can be a little arrogant at times saying he is the most powerful man in the world and the leader of the United States, or something to that extent. He was a larger than life character but Sally Field keeps him in check as she plays Lincolns wife almost too well. I love Sally Field because she tries so hard in every role from Mrs. Doubtfire to Forrest Gump. She goes into a role and feels the character and nails it. She always gives it her all, but in Lincoln she gives a little more. She makes Lincoln more human. She does not want her son, Joseph Gordon Levitt, going to fight the war. This brings a small conflict that fits really well in the movie overall. Lincoln has enough on his plate and now he has to deal with his crazy family. My favorite scene is when Lincoln tells his wife that their son will be going into war but he will be safe. Mrs. Lincoln just loses it and Sally Field pours all of this emotion out and Lincoln reacts and gets angry, and even starts to yell. This scene is my favorite because it shows that Abraham Lincoln was a human being with emotions and flaws. This scene shows his flaw and that he cannot always keep himself in line and he can lose his temper. We dig into the past history as he says he should have sent his wife to the crazy house. Mrs. Lincoln just snaps back with a perfect comment saying if he wanted to he would have just done it. This scene shows some of the best acting in the entire movie with the emotion and humanity shown in the larger than life characters in American history. Steven Spielberg spent years researching Abraham Lincoln and the time when the 13th Amendment was struggling to be passed. He wanted this movie to be as accurate as possible and he delivers once again. Everything this man touches to gold. He is such a dedicated director and he deserved his nomination for best director at the Oscars, but I'm not surprised he didn't win. He makes sure his actors portray his vision in the best way possible and the years of hard work paid off. He presents another amazing movie about American history to the world and brings a fresh and new aspect to this time period. This movie needs to be seen by the American people. It surely isn't for everybody because it can be boring and drag but people need to know what this movie is about. This movie has no action scenes, no battles, all the actions is done n the acting and the words. Even the music was almost nonexistent. John Williams does the score but some scenes have very little music in them. This is rare for a movie but knowing Spielberg he wants the music to relate with the time period, as any director should, but it's hard to find out the types of music that was playing during that time period so no music works. Overall, Lincoln was the best movie I have seen in a long time. Everything works. I saw this twice in the past few days and I'm tried to find flaws but there really were none. The only thing I can think of is that it can be boring at parts but the audience needs to know what they are getting into. Any student who loves history or a movie with incredible acting and dialog will love this movie. Any scrub who wants a Michael Bay explosion-fest will be disappointed. This movie needs to be seen, it is very educational and real. Show it in schools, force kids to watch this movie because it shows the darkest part of our history. I'm reaching my 1000 word limit so Lincoln gets the WillyT Seal of approval. See you next time!",8,0,2,10 March 2013
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Touching and Powerful, but Lacking
","If you want the definition of ironic, it would be the plot to The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. Everybody knows the story of Hitler and 1940's Germany. A military man moves his family out into the country so he can work at a concentration camp. His eight year old boy wanders off and finds the camp and befriends a Jewish kid from the other side of the fence. A combination of the child's naivety, strong story, and somber music makes this movie very powerful and brings a new insight to WW2.The main force behind this movie and what really keeps it going is Bruno. He is the eight year old boy and the main character. He is forced to move away from his friends in Berlin and is looking for a new friend. He meets a Jewish boy in the concentration camp and he has no idea what is going on. He is young and knows little of the war and the terrible things his father and countryman are doing. There are moments in the movie where he asks stupid questions and it makes the audience just go, 'oh, no. I know the answer, how can you be so blind?' Then I remembered he was eight years old and has no business knowing what is going on. His older sister is twelve and she gets it. She talks about joining the Hitler youth and she becomes war driven. She is being brainwashed and corrupted by the adults around her. Her whole existence is the show the vile works of the Germans in that time. It's odd how each character in the family is completely different, obviously it is on purpose. We have Bruno, the main character who is completely blind and innocent. It is his blindness and innocents which makes the movie. Then we have the father, Ralph, who is also Professor Lupin in Harry Potter, just a side note. He is the definition of evil. He works at the camps. My favorite scene is when they are all at dinner and he basically interrogates one of his officers and finds out his father was Jewish. On the spot he has the man taken into the other room, beaten, and killed. It is a powerful scene and shows the reality of the situation. One could argue that it's not his fault because he is just following orders and Germany was corrupt by one insane tyrant, but that's not the point. This movie isn't about the war or Hitler or even the Jews. It is about the relationship between the two young children battling the odds Then there is my favorite character in the entire movie, and that is the mother. She is special so she gets her own paragraph.Elsa is the mother of this family and she is protective of her children. She knows the danger bit is also blinded by her surroundings. She knows what her country is doing with the Jewish people but she has no idea that they are dying. She finds out that they are being gassed and burned and she flips out. This says a lot about her character and how she did not approve of her countries actions. This is a bold move by the director because he disproves the stereotype that everybody in Germany hated the Jews and approved of Hitler. She is a strong character an gives the movie a different edge.The movie is a little slow at first and it takes a while for the backbone of the plot to kick in. This movie is 94 minutes and it takes a while before the two boys even meet and build their friendship. Another problem is the little screen time the little Jewish boy is in the movie. The title of the movie is about him and he isn't really seen as much. When he is on screen he tries to tell the truth to young Bruno. He is eight years old and he knows and understands everything that has happened to him. There is one point in the movie where Bruno messes up and it almost costs him his life. I like Bruno as a character but he was a coward and he made foolish mistakes. As the movie progressed I began to realize there were only two outcomes to this story and both are very sad. Pacing problems, limited time with a main character and my major problem is the lack of character development. Every character with the exception of the mother is the exact same from the opening credits to the end credits. The father is a jerk. The boy is foolish and his sister is corrupted. This made the movie a little boring and even though it was a short film it felt really long. I wanted to see more but I can't think what else could have been seen. The strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses but the weaknesses are still substantial.Overall, I did enjoy The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. The music added an emotional touch throughout and one thing you need to understand is that the main character is a kid and you need to think like a kid to understand what he does. By no means is this a happy movie, but more tragic with a few glimpses that would make any parent proud. Watch this movie but be warned, it is not for the faint of heart. The acting isn't anything remarkable, the characters are strong but have little development, but overall enjoyable. This movie gets the WillyT Honorable Mention.",7,1,1,8 March 2013
Evil Dead," Gore > Scare?
","Kids in their twenties in a cabin in the middle of the woods to help their friend get through heroine withdrawals. There is the obvious stoner, the dumb girl, the hot girl, the troubled girl, and the strong, older brother. Here we go, this is the review for Cabin in the Woods, oh wait I already reviewed Cabin in the Woods, oh wait this is Evil Dead, oh wait, their almost the same movie. Evil Dead is a remake and Ii starts out like every horror movie ever. I hate horror movies today because they follow the exact same formula but at least the second half was mainly different and changed it up a bit. Evil Dead has a basic storyline, isn't scary at all, but it very disturbing with a lot of blood and gore, but it was enjoyable.It's obvious that a evil spirit or demon is present in a house, or in this case cabin, the obvious answer is to leave. I give Evil Dead the benefit of the dead because they stay for the main character who is struggling with heroine withdrawals so when she acts nuts it makes sense that they stay. How would they know she was possessed by a demon? Then when they finally realize what they have done it's too late, so touché Evil Dead. This still follows the stereotypical cliché horror movie. They find an evil book and of course they read it even though it says not to read it in blood on one of the pages. That's our story to the movie, basic, you know who will live and who will die, but at least it's still entertaining to see how.I was hoping that the atmosphere of a movie theatre would boost the scare factor while saw this movie, but it didn't. I cringed at the gore and jumped at most of the jump scares but that's not scary. Jump scares are the worst form of a scare in a movie, especially in horror movies because you expect it. So if you are concerned about being scared then you have nothing to lose with this one. However, if you have a weak stomach and don't like blood and gore you may want to reconsider. The gore is intense with arms being cut off, chainsaws, it rains blood, ya real blood, and I laughed, nail guns, shotguns, crowbars, third degree burns, and the poor girl even gets raped by a tree, I did not laugh. That probably crossed a line. There is a few things a movie should never do, one is murder kids, that's just a no no. The second is definitely getting raped by a tree, that's beyond unnecessary. Other than the tree the most disturbing image was when the girl licks the knife and cuts her tongue in half. It was hard to watch.Other than that the gore was awesome and made the movie that much better. There was one character, whose name I'm forgetting because the characters were so forgettable, but he suffered the most. He got a needle in the eyelid, nails in the arm, he got stabbed, anything bad really happened to him. He was probably my favorite character because well I don't even know why, but he was. He made me laugh along with the gore. I'm not sure why but there were a lot of scenes where I just laughed and laughed. Especially when she talks with a weird whisper to her brother saying they need to leave because there was a demon or something there with them. I couldn't help it, I just laughed. The scene when they discover the cats hanging in the basement, laughed. The chainsaw, laughed. I probably laughed too much for a horror movie but I was entertained.The acting is usually awful in these types of movies but Evil Dead wasn't as bad as I expected. Characters are usually irrelevant and are just there to look pretty, be dumb, or die in a sadistic way. Now these characters existed but the relationship between the brother and the possessed sister was interesting. They have a dark and troubled past and it shows a little characterization in them and I liked it. It sucked me into the story a little bit and I even felt a little sympathy for them, but only a little. The character I hated the most was the black girl, no not because she was black, but because she was so obnoxious. I hated everything about her character and I was counting the minutes until she died. I could not wait until the demon tore her to shreds. When it happened, I could not have been happier. The demon was interesting because it possessed the body and made them kill themselves which I thought was neat. I don't want to spoil it but when it's all said and done you will probably clap because it was so awesome and fulfilling. Overall, Evil Dead was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. It wasn't as scary as I wanted it to be but I didn't feel like I wasted my money either. I loved the gore, loved the demon, and thought the deaths were sadistic but fun to watch. I laughed more than I should have but that's not a bad thing either. I thought it was funnier than most of Adam Sandler's movies recently. I hated the acting, but I had low expectations, didn't really get into the characters, the story was bland and predictable, but it's a horror movie and for a horror movie it was good. For a movie overall it wasn't but I can't compare a horror to a comedy or to a drama. All movies should be judged based on their genre and for this genre it passes. Evil Dead gets The WillyT Recommendation. Go see and be disturbed by all the blood in this movie.",6,0,10,19 April 2013
8 Mile," Lose Yourself in 8 Mile
","I guess anybody could act in a movie about their own life but Eminem still did do a good job. 8 mile is a neighborhood in Detroit where young Eminem tried to become known. 8 Mile is a story of Bunny Rabbit, Eminem, struggling to make it in the rap industry and life in general. He attempts a rap battle and fails. He draws a blank and completely embarrassed himself. Rabbit then decides to put his life on track and focus on his actual job and less on his friends, the 313rd gang if you will. He stays loyal to his friends and still tries to rap but he struggles throughout the movie with love, work, rap, his mother, friends, enemies, and life in general. As a rapper Eminem is fantastic, my favorite even so I'm a little biased towards the movie to be honest. His acting was sub-par but I had very little expectations. The character Rabbit was very interesting. He flipped his priorities a lot between his family, his job, his friends, and his musical career. He was unsure of what he really wanted and he tried to do everything at once. He is a great character. He is smart, talented, funny, and even relatable. Everyone has been through tough times and everything seems to go from bad to worse. This is basically what happens. The movie starts with Rabbit breaking up with his girlfriend, embarrassing himself at the rap battle, he is poor, he hates his job, frustrated with his life, himself, his friend, and everything else in general. He goes home to his mother and daughter and she is having sex with a gross man who is just a few years older than him. His life is just pure hell and it was based off of his real life so I really hope it wasn't that bad.It is based on a true story, it isn't the real story. Rabbit is Eminem. Lily is his daughter Haley. His mother resembles his actual mother. His girlfriend who cheats on him and he has problems with is Kim, the 313rd is the rap group D12 and Future is his lifelong friend Proof. True Eminem fans like me pick up on little details that are from his real life and are appreciated. This movie also shows the culture of Detroit and the projects. African Americans struggling and their only way out is rap. The story is brilliant and I'm a sucker for rags to riches story lines. Sure it's cheesy but it does work here.Problems with the movie were few but they do exist. The movie is so depressing and there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. In the end Rabbit wins the rap battle and gets back at his enemies but he is still poor, he still has a poor job, he still lives with his mom, and his life is still horrible. All the ending brings is hope, but sometimes hope is enough. During the rap battles I could not understand a thing they were saying. They spoke too fast but subtitles easily fix that problem. This is no Oscar wining movie but it was a lot bigger than it was supposed to be. 8 Mile was incredibly popular and it deserves the credit. Many rappers were in this movie which was interesting. People who don't normally act were thrown into a movie and acted. Granted they were just being themselves so it was more of an extreme documentary than a movie but I loved it.Overall 8 Mile is great. It won't go down in history as one of the best, Eminem should never be on the big screen as a major role again, but he was entertaining. The movie was entertaining bringing many memorable scenes and moments true fans will never forget. This movie definitely gets the WillyT seal of approval. Being a loyal fan of Eminem and this work I do enjoy hearing about his struggles and how he was inspired to write his music. There are many faces to Eminem and he portrays them well in 8 Mile. I was entertained; I can watch it casually or with friends and I can see it again and again. I actually watched it twice in the past week. Once with friends and once alone and I loved it just the same both times. 8 Mile is a great movie for what it is. It exceeded expectations and deserves to be known in the movie world.",8,0,0,4 September 2012
The Hangover Part II," Don't Fix What Ain't Broke
","Alright, here is the review for The Hangover, oh but wait, I already reviewed The Hangover. Is this the Hangover 2? I don't know, maybe because they are the exact same movie. After the success the original Hangover made obviously Hollywood milks the cash cow with a sequel. I'm not going to lie but when I first saw this movie I hated it. I hated how it was exactly the same as the first but after watching it again I started to appreciate it. Call me crazy but I am part of a minority that enjoyed it.Sure the movie was very similar. It opens with Phil on the phone after a day or two of crazy antics, which is the same. Instead of Stu losing a tooth he gets a face tattoo. Instead of a baby it is an awesome monkey. Teddy becomes lost instead of Doug, and it takes place in Bangkok instead of Las Vegas. Stu is getting married and I kind of expected to marry the girl from the first movie but they needed to go to Bangkok so for the story it made sense. It is his wedding and of course they have a bachelor party and they get drugged, again, they wake up in a mess, again, and similar antics return. Chow returns and when he comes in the movie slows down for me. I really don't like his character and he was a tad overused in the movie. His comedy was a little less forced but his crazy antics were too much for me and I didn't like them.The old saying 'don't fix what ain't broke' probably works best here. I'm perfectly fine with them getting hung over again and finding a missing person again. I was fine with it because it worked and it was still funny. Scene after scene was still funny. Characters did little to change but frequently reminded us of the past adventure. This movie knew what was funny and they stuck to it. Allan was still the lovable idiot who said and did stupid things. Come on, you can't say you didn't laugh when he made his speech at his wedding. Sure the connection he had with the baby is the exact same as it was with the monkey but that monkey kicked ass. My favorite part of the movie was the monkey and it was funny. The movie was actually funnier the second time then it was the first. People complain and complain that the two movies were the exact same and yes it was but it still worked.I do agree to a degree with what fans were saying. I was OK with the overall story being the same and characters' being very similar but it was the small details that were the same that annoyed me. The opening scene should not have opened with almost the exact same lines as the ones in the first movie. Stu figured out where Teddy was in a very similar way he did in the first. There were some scenes you could take from Hangover 1 and put into Hangover 2. Lines could be interchanged and in the end this movie really is lazy filmmaking for a quick buck. I didn't like Mike Tysons unnecessary cameo and there were pictures during the credits again. The little things that made the two movies too similar. The problem with Hangover 2 is that it doesn't stick out as its own movie. It's basically called The Hangover.again.I understand where people are coming from. They wanted to see something new and different. In a way, this movie did do that. There are transgender people, monks, missing fingers, Allan is shaved, and many more things that raise the bar in craziness. Hangover 2 is a lot more crazy then the first. Meaning the night they had in the second was a lot more intense then the first. The movies are very similar and are no different in the end but it was still a good time. I still laughed and I want to laugh when I see these movies. It was very similar but most people I talked to about this movie said it was funny bit too similar to the first. I respond with the simple question, 'Was it funny?' when they answer yes then it is mission accomplished for the filmmakers. I realize this is more of a defense then a review for this movie but it is worth talking about. Unfortunately, this movie is doomed to judgment. As a movie itself it is hysterical but since it follows up the first it is unpopular. It is doomed to comparison to its predecessor. If The Hangover never existed and The Hangover 2 was released instead, I guarantee everybody would have loved it even more then the first. This was a funny movie but I still agree that the first was better.Overall, The Hangover 2 followed the same recipe to the first. Not much changed and if the Hangover 2 never existed nothing would really happen. This movie doesn't push the story forward in the trilogy. This movie is literally useless but it was still incredibly funny. For what it is it is a good movie but since it follows up the first movie it is a bad movie. I still liked it because I was still interested in the story and every scene made sense. I was still able to piece together the crazy night with the characters and enjoy the experience. The whole gimmick was reused but it still worked. I still had fun. I would have liked if it wasn't a copy and paste replica form the original but it was still good enough to get the WillyT Honorable Mention award. That is really saying something. The first got the seal of approval and that is only one step above the honorable mention.",7,0,0,29 May 2013
The Dark Knight," One of A Kind
","Most people had no idea that The Dark Knight was a sequel, I know I didn't. Thank god this movie exists. It is well known that I was not a huge fan of Batman Begins but every problem I had with the original no longer exists. Bruce Wayne was a much better character, Rachel Dawes was portrayed perfectly, Harvey Dent added a new twist, Alfred was inspirational and lovable, Gordon found his comfort zone, and Heath Ledger portrayed the best Joker the world has ever seen, god rest his soul. This movie was Christopher Nolan's masterpiece and is a movie I can watch again and again. The Joker. That is really all I need to say to make this movie what it is. Without the joker, this movie is nothing. The opening scene we see the madman at his finest. We see how all he cares about is chaos and how he really has little to no motive towards anything. The physical and psychological attacks on Gotham keep the audience wanting more. We never get a background story on the joker, which is annoying, but perfect. We are supposed to know nothing about this man. He has no fingerprints, no ID, no home, nothing. He is a rogue madman who likes to bring out the worst in people and he is right. My favorite scene is when he is being interrogated by Batman and he talks about chaos theory and how people will turn on each other. And he is right and we see his plan come together in the third movie. Heath Ledger prepared well for this role, a little too well as it cost him his life, but he left behind one of the best performances I have ever seen in any movie, ever. It's up there. If there was ever a role to go out on.This movie basically picks up shortly after Batman Begins left off. Batman is still fighting the mob and crime but Gotham also had Harvey Dent. Dent is the 'White Knight' and he does wonder for Gotham. 'You rather die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.' He says this early on in the film and that foreshadows him becoming Two-Face. It shows more brilliance on the part of The Joker. He took Gotham's hero and turned him into a villain, just to prove his point. Harvey's story is really kind of tragic but was also so powerful and caused conflict.Rachel and Bruce had their one moment at the end of Batman Begins, but she has since been in a relationship with Dent. But, she told Bruce she would be there when there he didn't need Batman anymore. This has strong inner conflict with herself. She loves Bruce, but she also loves Harvey. Her character was so much more developed and she had such a strong impact on Bruce, Dent, and even Gotham. She found her place in this trilogy. She is a stronger character and Maggie Gyllenhaal did a lot better than I expected.More characters were simply more relevant in this movie. Gary Oldman kills it as Gordon and Alfred just steals the show in every scene he is in. He has a way of explaining the world to Bruce that just makes sense. 'Some men just want to watch the world burn.' Alfred just gets what is going on and understands what is going on in Gotham. Gordon tries to understand but he is too much of a cop and tries to find motive behind the Joker. That is what I think is his weakness. He tries to think like the Joker, but he can't. He wants to be one step ahead but it's impossible. Alfred understands that one cannot try and understand the Joker to defeat him. It's genius really and there are little subtleties like that in which make this move what it is.Is this movie perfect? No, far from it. The ending to this movie is highly flawed with characters not getting proper endings. Granted nobody expected Heath Ledger to kick the bucket and one could argue that Harvey Dent got screwed. Let's be honest, the ending wasn't great but it was how it had to end. I may not have enjoyed all parts but given the circumstances and assuming Christopher Nolan wanted the Joker in the third movie, the ending worked. Gary Oldman saves it with the monologue he gives before it cuts to credits. The man just speaks the truth in that monologue. Other characters, like the lawyer who tied to blackmail Wayne was never heard from again, one of the mobsters was questioned to be alive. Just little things die-hard fans can nitpick at. I'm not sure how accurate these movies are to comic books, but who cares.Overall, The Dark Knight was a summer blockbuster that deserved every cent it made. Honestly, I think Christopher Nolan deserved an Oscar nomination, but that's just me. I know a lot of people agree with that but the Academy is weird like that. Hans Zimmer returns and nails it with the music once again. Music makes the movie, I say it again and again and that is a big reason why The Dark Knight gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. Go and see this movie and enjoy. It has an effect on your mind as well as incredibly entertaining. It's movie like this that inspire people to want to make movies and join the experience. So see this movie, get inspired, make a movie, and get approved.",9,0,4,3 March 2013
Toy Story," Instant Classic
","Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever.Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real 'space ranger.' He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous 'laser' which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a 'cool toy.' He is 'Andy's toy.' Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship.We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who 'terrorizes toys, just for fun.' One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies.",10,0,0,23 October 2012
Reservoir Dogs," A Must See!
","I said in my Pulp Fiction review that it was Tarintino at his best. I ever thought I would see him do better, but then I saw Reservoir Dogs. It's true that Res-Dogs came out before Pulp Fiction but I saw Res-Dogs after I saw Pulp Fiction. It was something I don't see in many movies, and that is that the storyline is very short and not much happens but the dialog is the force behind the story. Reservoir Dogs is an interesting movie and when I saw it the first time I almost watched it again, but it was 3am and I was tired. I actually started because I loved the first scene so much.As I said, the dialog was outstanding in this movie. Tarantino knows how to write a script. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Joe, and Nice Guy Eddie are sitting in a restaurant in the opening scene. These men are all of the main characters and they are what the movie is built around. In the opening scene we come in mid conversation and they are talking about the meaning behind the song Like a Virgin, and it was interesting. The fact that anybody can come in mid conversation to start a movie and be entertained is impressive and isn't seen that often. Then it gets even better. Mr. Pink refuses to tip the waitress and an argument about tipping and if it's the right thing to do is funny and it fit so well. It made me rethink the idea of tipping but I still do it anyway. Finally the opening scene is ended with all the Reservoir Dogs walking in slow motion the strangest song but again, it works. That shot where they introduce credits of the actors and the title screen comes up is a classic.My favorite character is easily Mr. Pink. Steve Buscemi blew me away with his performance. He is one of the most important characters and he is makes some of the greatest impacts. The basic story behind Res-Dogs is that Joe gets a group of people together to pull off the perfect robbery, but the plan fails when they find out a cop is undercover. Mr. Pink brings up the possibility of a rat and the ball starts rolling from there. Mr. Pink is the only character with a lot of mystery surrounding him. We don't get his origin story like we did with White, Blonde, and Orange and we don't know for sure what happens to him in the end. All of the characters get endings except for Mr. Pink and that makes me angry, but I love it at the same time. I wanted more of Mr. Pink but I also love how I don't know a lot about him.The only flaw I see with Res-Dogs is the lack of chemistry between Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. The movie slows down and the conversation they have isn't that believable. What I mean is, you can tell they are acting and it took me out of the experience. They are talking about the possibility of a rat and even though the ending of the scene picked up I left it wanting a little more effort. Other than that the movie is incredibly predictable. I knew the basic premise of the movie was to find out who the rat was and when I saw who the actors were I knew who it was. After the opening scene in the restaurant and the opening credits I knew who it was. I predicted the big plot twist and surprise at the end and I knew who would live and who would die. I wasn't 100% accurate, but I basically nailed the movie before I saw it. Even though I predicted it I still wanted to see it happen and the fact that I still loved it says something. I like to talk about my favorite scene in my reviews and my favorite is when Mr. Blonde goes nuts and tortures the cop. Mr. Blonde is an interesting character and his actions are disturbing but at the same time funny. He tortures a cop just because he is a cop and he doesn't care about what the cop knows. That is disturbing. However, he tortures him while the catchiest song is playing on the radio. There is a radio station that plays 70s music all day and it's mentioned a lot by other characters. The music in Res-Dogs is unlike any other movie, most Tarantino movie are, but this is different. In this scene with Mr. Blonde, the radio is playing but he goes out to his car and the music stops. It is supposed to mean the radio is out of hearing range and when he comes back in the building we can hear it again. Little things like that make this movie what it is. Overall, Reservoir Dogs is a Tarantino movie so that means it is something special. Let's go down the WillyT Checklist. Awesome character. Check. Awesome Music. Check. Interesting story. Check. Strong opening that got me hooked. Check. Res-Dogs is blueprint Tarantino and got his name out there. It didn't necessarily put him on the map but it got enough publicity and made enough of an impact to make Pulp Fiction. Tarantino does what he wants, when he wants, and thank god for his films. Reservoir Dogs proudly gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. I loved the movie, I think I liked it better than Pulp Fiction. I watched it again a week after I saw it the first time and it was just as good if not better. In fact, I might go and watch it again right now. So, for right now, WillyT OUT!",9,0,0,5 May 2013
Limitless," Solid but Forgettable.
","Imagine if there was a drug that could make you do anything you want. Now imagine if they made a movie about it. Limitless start Bradley Cooper and is a thoroughly entertaining. The story was very interesting but it was obvious the drug would be too good to be true. Characters paths were easily predicted but I was able to sit through the entire thing, which is always a plus.Bradley Cooper has done a great job in launching his career past The Hangover. This isn't his best performance but he has natural charisma on screen and this was proof that he could handle a serious role. I will say this right now; if Limitless did not have Bradley Cooper then Silver linings Playbook would not have been as great as it was. I feel that Limitless was less of a movie but more of a test for Bradley Cooper, and in my opinion, he passed with flying colors.Cooper plays a struggling writer looking for his big break. I expected his life to go from bad to worse before he got the pill but it didn't. The movie jumped right into it and got down to business. I liked that but there still left the questions with obvious answers. Once he has the drug it is obvious he needs a large supply and fast. The plot builds up the character who supplies the drug then he gets written off. Spoiler alert, he dies, its not a big deal and any idiot with half a brain could have figured it out. The last time we see him alive his apartment is a mess and he has a bump on his head. The movie foreshadows his death and Cooper inheriting his problems that come with the drug. These problems are the Russian gangsters he gets in association with. It never made sense to me why he got involved with them, but he did and after he became a millionaire, got his girl back, had job after job opportunities, they give him a reality check and prove to be the 'bad guys' in the movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the Russians in general, I feel like they were unnecessary. The focus on them was weird because I expected the movie to focus more on Robert De Niro. When he made his first appearance I paid extra attention because I expected the movie to get real and more intense. I was hoping it would be way more intense than camping, but it proved to be highly disappointing. The big flaw with Limitless was the lack focus on a primary antagonist. There were the Russian and De Niro, but they were both on the same level. One should have been above the other in terms of deviance and importance. There were plot holes with these characters and the movie failed to impress. The story took a few turns I did not expect but a problem in the story was solved too easily. The pill almost killed Cooper but his solution isn't to not take it anymore, it's to take it on a lesser dosage and not abuse it. That made no sense to me. How does a big problem like that just disappear? This drug had a major impact and seemed so strong and t was became regulated within a few minutes. People died from this drug and Cooper learns how to control it with a snap of the fingers? I don't think so. That is lazy writing. I don't know what I liked better, the wit of Bradley Cooper, or the way the camera works and how I felt when the drug was taking effect of Cooper. The visuals and the way the camera moves when the drug is being used made me feel like I was on it myself. The speeding thru time and sideways view on everything and the flashes were fantastic. It took me on a trip. On the other hand the pill made Cooper talk with such confidence and tenacity that only he can pull off as an actor. Overall, Limitless was a movie that is incredibly difficult to pull off. Bradley Cooper was the right choice as the lead, a few mishaps in the writing and lack of other characters hurt the movie as a whole, but it was still enjoyable. Cooper was great and he built up chemistry with De Niro and that was another big part of the success of Silver Linings Playbook. I suggest you see this movie at least once. Don't jump from your couch do see it immediately. You can see it whenever and it will gave the same impact. No matter when you see it you will forget it within a week. Limitless gets the WillyT Recommendation.",6,0,1,11 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," Simply a Masterpiece
","A movie in which really has no main characters, a crazy plot, and insane dialogue. That is basically what sums up Pulp Fiction. Quentin Tarantino wasn't really known before Pulp Fiction, but after this movie he became one of the best directors in recent memory. I can't even tell you what the movie is about. Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis all have their stories and they all somehow intertwine, that's really it. The plot makes no sense and the entire movie is confusing from the opening to ending credits. After the credits roll your mind starts piecing together and then you will realize that this movie is unique and brilliant.From the first scene of the movie I was hooked. The audience is introduced to Pulp Fiction in the middle of a conversation at a diner. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are talking and my attention was drawn to my TV. I intended on multitasking on the internet while watching but instantly I was drawn into their conversation. I recognized Tim Roth from Lie to Me and was curious what he was doing in this movie. The entire scene was just brilliant starting with a simple conversation and ending with a robbery of the diner. Then it was the next scene. I put the laptop down because I knew this movie deserved my full attention. Pulp Fiction is simply classic Tarantino. The original story, similar actors, creative dialogue, and an amazing score push the story along and make it what it is. Other than Travolta, there really is no 'main character'. I consider the script and the words the characters say as a character. If you break the movie down, very little actually happens. Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson have a solid 10-15 minute conversation about cheeseburgers and a foot massage. I don't know how they did it but they made a conversation about a foot massage very entertaining. A script like Pulp Fiction's does not come around lightly. This was one of the most interesting and captivating screenplays I have ever seen on film. There is not one boring scene in this movie because of the interesting conversations. This movie has a very long list of big actors, my favorite being Christopher Walken. He is only in the movie for one scene, but it is my favorite scene. Young Butch is watching TV and incomes Walken playing his father's POW friend. His father fought and died in the war and Walken had something to give him. Walken goes on a speech about a gold watch his father and himself hid from the Vietnamese. The delivery and presentation in this scene is hysterical. The camera never moves, all we see is Walken holding the watch and telling his story. It is a scene like this where you feel the words and their impact. I will say it all throughout this review; the words are what make this movie. As far as plot, there really is none. There are stories of individuals whose lives intertwine. What makes this movie special is that the scenes are out of order. I loved that it had this effect. The movie starts in the diner and then we never see them again, until the end. It's brilliant. After the movie I took a piece of paper and drew out the Pulp Fiction timeline. If a movie makes you think then it does its job, but this went above and beyond. I wanted to re-watch the movie in the correct sequence, but honestly, if I did, the movie is awful. If this movie was in the order of events it would be pointless and meaningless. It would be a ridiculous movie with weird dialogue. Instead, the audience is left wondering what is going on and we get sucked into the universe that is, Quentin Tarantino. Do I like that the movie is out of order? Well, yes and no. My really only problem is that all of the actors are seen once and most of them are never seen again. In the first opening scenes Samuel L. Jackson was so entertaining but then he left and we don t see him again for a very long time. The movie skips ahead to Travolta and Uma Thurman's night on the town. I missed seeing Samuel L. Jackson on screen. Then we get sucked into Bruce Willis' story and I missed Travolta and Uma Thurman, but I was so interested with Bruce Willis, I didn't even care. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I loved these characters and wanted to see all of them at once, which I realize isn't possible. I wanted them to have more interaction with each other, but then again, that would have probably made the movie a lot worse. Another problem with the scene jumping is the irrelevance of events. Once scene one character gets blown away and killed by another. At that time it was a huge deal because one of the characters died, but in the next sequence he was alive again walking around being awesome. It took away from his death and almost made it pointless. If you pay attention towards the end we see why he dies but it almost seemed unnecessary and random that he died. Tarantino made this movie not intending to make a sequel, but he never reveals what is in the briefcase that Jules carries around. Why not? What is in it? I want to know. Overall, Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece of writing. The screenplay and how the actors acted out the words on the page is what made this movie a classic. I didn't want to see this movie because people said it deserved Best Picture over Forrest Gump in 1994. I didn't want to believe there was a better movie then that, but I liked this movie more. I think Forrest Gump deserved the Oscar but Pulp Fiction still gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",10,0,2,20 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Best in the Series
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite Harry Potter movie. There I said it. The reason is simple; it is the transition from a light magical adventure to a dark and serious fight. The first two were colorful and adventurous with a touch of evil. The third was different and a fresh twist to the plot. The fourth is the middle man and most important in the series. It is the first movie rated PG-13 in the series and you can tell it gets serious. This is The Goblet of Fire.By the release of the 4th movie Harry Potter had exploded into a phenomenon. Every man women and child knows the story and the series continued to get better and better. It is another year at Hogwarts and it is a special one. The Triwizard Tournament is occurring at Hogwarts and three champions from three different schools compete for the grand prize. Of course Harry gets involved and becomes the fourth member and what starts as a dangerous competition turns into a tournament filled with questions and conspiracy. Harry is now 14 and he understands the magical world but at the same time he has a lot more to learn. It was nice seeing him know a lot but still not be an expert. He is introduced to the port key, the three unforgivable curses, and of course the dark mark. I loved the Quidditch World Cup. I loved reading it in the book. It introduced Viktor Krum's character really well and it was Quidditch, which is awesome. In the movie it cuts it short and as disappointed as I was I understood it took away from the story. The point of the Cup was to introduce the Death Eaters and the dark mark. This scene was intense and it set a tone for the rest of the movie. This is no longer a little kid's movie. Harry is growing up and he deals with new problems that every teen manages to struggle with. Every director put his own spin onto the movie and this one was the teenage problems Harry struggles with. Harry is 14 and he has an interest in girls and you would think it would be easy for him giving his reputation, but he doesn't and that makes him more human. I liked how he was scared to ask a girl to the Yule Ball and I loved the idea of the Ball. I liked his love interest in Cho Chang. In this movie it worked because he showed his awkwardness and a weakness in a way. I also loved the idea of the Yule Ball and it meshed well with the tournament. Let's take a moment to discuss the tournament itself. I love the idea of the tournament and I love how we are introduced to different cultures of the wizarding world. I like how it's not just Hogwarts and there are other things out there. So we have Fleur and Krum representing their schools. Then we have Cedric Diggory and Harry form Hogwarts. Each character is unique and brings different personalities to the stage. The tournament itself has three challenges each different and more dangerous from the last. It lasts the entire year and I think the second was my favorite because it took mental strength along with physical. Besides the tournament we have many things happening. There is this dark force lingering and something not right in the world. There is a different attitude in year four so in a way the tournament is a major and minor factor to the story. We are also introduced to Mad-Eye Moody and he is a character you will never forget. He is also a man surrounded with questions. I mean he is the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher so he is obviously not what he seems to be. The difference is the big question and confusion isn't as obvious. The director and writers did a fantastic job in making this character come to life. He is really important but does a really good job at hiding his intentions. If you have seen the movie you will know what I mean.Easily the best part of this movie is the ending. I don't know why but I didn't see it coming whatsoever. I won't spoil it but if you haven't seen the movies then why are you reading this? Go see the movie and come back. Nevertheless, this movie changes the world of Harry Potter forever. It gets real and it gets serious. The entire movie is kind of like heave clouds starting to block out the sun and by the end of the climax scene there is no sun and the storm is coming. It blew me away, it is epic, and I remember sitting in the theater amazed by what I had just seen. Overall, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best book and movie in the series. I loved everything about it from the directing to the acting to the lighting. Yes I said the lighting. I will go deeper into detail in the next review as it turns more relevant. This movie sets up the rest of the series and the tone for the rest of the movies. It is a small taste of what is to come and is a great tease. I love how relatable the characters continue to be. I love how they develop and we dive deep into their emotions and get another small taste of the rest of the series. I was getting a little bored with the series but this movie tuned me in and got me so excited for the end. Harry Potter 4 proudly gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",9,0,1,10 June 2013
Thor," Thor the thunder god?
","Thor was overall a good movie with fantastic special effects and really good costume design. All the characters looked great. Thor looked like a strong confident hero while the humans just looked human. Thor's red cape and his shinny armor looked real the city of Asgod looked amazing. The special effects blew me away. The frost trolls looked terrifying and the presentation was almost perfect. Thor's friend's costumes looked great and the giant robot that blew things up was cool too. The movie focused more on the story and less on action scenes and blowing stuff up. That was my favorite part.Thor is one of my favorite superheroes and I loved how the director showed his flaws. He is strong but foolish and the development of the character was done really well. He isn't perfect even though he is a hero. He struggles with being human and he feels guilt that his brother lays upon him. The character of Thor was portrayed really well. A strong hotheaded hero with little wisdom but grows as he goes along. He evolves into a stronger wiser hero by the end.Thor's relationship with Jane was cute. A little predictable but still necessary but their story made sense and it wasn't exaggerated. I thought the kiss before the final battle was pushing it a little bit. The kiss on the hand and the parting line would have been perfect. Jane as a character was really good for the story. She is smart and she believes in Thor's story and that is important to push the story along. Her superior, the male, his character was also necessary. He obviously shows importance because of the little teaser at the end of the credits. I hated that the movie had to tell us that Thor would return in The Avengers. That was obvious and completely unnecessary. Her other friend, I don't even know her name was completely unnecessary. She played no importance and the movie could have survived without her. Her cheesy one-liners were just silly.One big problem with the movie was the predictability of Loki. It was obvious that he would be the jealous brother, come up with a plan to banish Thor and take the throne for himself. That's been done many times and made the movie less enjoyable. He was the villain but then did a U-turn and became a hero when he saved his father. Then he turned again and became the villain again and fought Thor and wanted to destroy the race of frost trolls. Then he turns lets go and falls into darkness and looks like a hero and he shows up on Earth after the credits, at least it looked like him. His character is unknown and his motives are not clear. That bugged me and made me a little angry.Loki as a character was confusing and his motives were not clear. All he had to do was say one thing about Jane and Thor attacked him. That was the wrong thing to say for Thor to attack. Thor met her just a short time prior and I feel something about his home or destiny would have been a better thing to tick him off. The movie is called Thor but for 80% of the movie he wasn't Thor, he was a human. That was a problem, Thor could have easily still been Thor on Earth, had a few more action scenes, still focus on the relationship, and still be a great movie. I feel making Thor human made the movie have less potential. Overall I give Thor 7 out of 10 for its presentation, action, and story.",6,0,2,28 July 2012
Zombieland," Zombieland minus the Zombies
","I have never disliked a zombie movie. They have either always made me laugh or made me thoroughly entertained. Zombieland has done neither of those things. I have to be honest, I didn't really like it. It was sloppy, a little boring, poor characters, and Jessie Eisenberg. I heard this movie was awesome and was a combination of Superbad and Shaun of the Dead. They have both been reviewed and were amazing. To say this movie is like those two combined, that is a bold statement, but one I looked forward to. Without further ado, here we go.It isn't a secret. I don't like Michael Cera but he is good in almost every role. Wait, he isn't in this movie? It's Jessie Eisenberg? Well, he is a wannabe Michael Cera so I don't see a difference. This guy is a photo copy of Michael Cera but not nearly as good. I never thought I would say this but I wanted Michael Cera in this movie. He would have been so much better. The awkwardness and his ugliness would have fit so much better than Eisenberg's mug ruining this movie. Throughout the movie all I could think about was Michael Cera and that's never a good thing. It made me sick I almost had to turn the movie off. This movie is called Zombieland and there are little to no zombies. The opening scene is great as it introduces how Zombieland came to be out of the gate it was so far so good. I really liked how there were rules and they popped up on screen all the time. That was really all I liked about the movie. None of the characters had real names and that is cool but the reasoning was dumb. There are very few people left and they don't want to give away their real identity. Why? What's the point? Why should I care? Hearing the names Columbia and Tallahassee wasn't bad but it was unnecessary and not that funny. Clever, but not funny. Bill F'n Murray is in this movie and hands down the best cameo I have ever seen, but that's the problem, it's only a cameo. I would have loved him in this movie as a star or supporting role. I'll give him credit for his role and his comedy. His time on screen was funny and the highlight of the movie but it wasn't enough. In the middle of the movie the characters bunker down in Murrays house and they were safe. Then they leave to go to an amusement park. That is the entire point of the movie. Emma Stone wants to bring her sister to an amusement park in California. That infuriated me. This movie had no point or direction.The story, well there is no story. The characters are weak, the performances are terrible. Emma Stone can be a great actress but she just looks like Megan Fox in this movie and we all know that is never a good person to be compared to. Don't get me wrong, Emma Stone is one of the sexiest women who walks this Earth and seeing her in this movie is jaw dropping. She is hot, but that's about it. She is 100% cliché and only there to bring in teenage guys and perverts. Her character has some depth and personality but its basic and poor. Her job as an older sister is underwhelming and her as a love interest to Jessie Eisenberg is dumb. This is a zombie movie but there is a big lack of zombies. They are here and there but they really don't kick in until the end. The end to this movie was awesome and exciting now why couldn't that have been the entire movie? The zombies looked great but they weren't used. This movie had a few signs of brilliance but is ruined by everything else that is so awful. Bill Murray was great but only for like five minutes. The zombies were great but only for like ten minutes. The rules popping up on screen was funny and creative but you can't build a movie around that. Overall, Zombieland was a disaster. The story is dumb, the characters are dumb, Jessie Eisenberg should never be in a movie for the rest of his life, and I never want to see this movie again. I hated this movie. I bought it on blu ray without ever seeing it and I don't think I will ever do that again. I expected to fall in love with this movie. I expected to get a mixture of Shaun of the Dead and Superbad. Instead I got a disappointment. I got an hour and a half of hatred. I got a WillyT Seal of DISapproval. It really hates me to say that but it's the truth and that's my job, to spread the truth.",3,5,11,27 August 2013
The Departed," I Hope Boston isn't Really Like This
","If there was ever a cast created by the hands of God himself it would have Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg. What's that you say, The Departed has a cast like that and to add to it it's directed by Martin Scorsese. Well, this is the definition of perfect. Scorsese tends to stick with mobster movies like Goodfellas but he makes them so well. The writing and acting drive this story and the Boston setting is the icing on the cake. Nicholson plays Frank Costello, a Boston mobster who uses Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, as a cop on the inside. Billy, played by DiCaprio, is an undercover cop sent by Sheen and Wahlberg to work for Costello and help bring him down. Rats on rats on rats. First off, the story is one of the best I have ever seen. The sneaking around and the lying and the deception on all ways possible in amazing to see on screen. Bill lies to Costello about his life to get on the inside and Sullivan is working to bring Costello down while secretly working for him. It's a little hard to wrap the brain around but that makes me fall in love with the movie more. Word gets around that there is a rat in the police unit and Costello thinks there is a rat in his crew. Bottom line, Sullivan has to find himself and Billy has to be careful. The writing behind this is incredible and a few twists and turns are around every corner. Living in Boston I know a few things or two about the language. The Departed may be a bit exaggerated but for the most part people do talk like that. The famous Boston accent can be that extreme but it's really extreme in this movie. Some of the actors are not from the Boston area and it shows as they try to force the accent. The cursing is also very extreme. One time I sat down and counted how many times they fay the F word and it was close to 400. Parents be aware, this is not a movie for the kids. Take notice of the R rating. Damon, DiCaprio, and Nicholson were the stars of this movie but Mark Wahlberg snuck in the backdoor and was amazing. The first scene with him is my favorite in the entire movie. He and Sheen are offering Billy the job and Wahlberg goes off. You can tell Wahlberg had a lot of fun with this role because he plays a scumbag, but he is great. His lines are clever and snarky and when he acts it is entertaining. He stole the show every time he was on screen. He was a jerk but his intentions were positive. A character like this was needed for this movie and again, perfect casting choice and the character was written beautifully. His one flaw is his lack of screen time. There is a big gap in the movie where he isn't there and not involved and I was left wanting more. No movie is flawless and I think the one weakness is Madolyn. She's the shrink for cops and criminals. She gets in a relationship with Damon but it's not really touched upon. They get together in the beginning but it's forgotten and overshadowed by everything else going on. She also works with Billy and they develop a relationship. A love triangle develops but it works for a little while but it becomes very two sided if you know what I mean. I don't really like her character as she is just as much of a snake as everybody else and at the end there is a huge plot hole with her. There is a big question that isn't fully answered and every time I watch the movie it drives me mad. Her character could have been so important but she turns out to be a loose end. I wish she could have been written better and given more screen time with Sullivan to make their relationship more believable.From top to bottom each and every single character worked. Besides the start the supporting cast was amazing. Alec Baldwin and Anthony Anderson are in this movie and they are big name guys taking a smaller role like this. They make the best of their material and they are both fantastic. As for the guys on Costello's crew, they are awesome two. Mr. French is a beast and Fitzy is a riot as well. They are characters you don't necessarily know by name but you know their faces and love what they do in the movie. The last thirty minutes or so were awesome. Everything unravels and there is one final twist at the end I didn't see coming. Characters get justice, some get screwed, and some get revenge. There are very few plot holes and the end is satisfying. Some characters have confrontations that are very intense. The ending made the movie and every time the credits role I smile and embrace the brilliance.Overall, The Departed is an amazing film and Scorsese delivers again. There is a lot of violence, swearing, and the movie is long but it is worth every second. DiCaprio deserved an Oscar for his performance but we all know the academy hates him. It did win Best Picture and Best Director. Wahlberg also got nominated for best actor in a supporting role and he probably deserved it but it's not a shock he didn't win. What was good about this movie? Everything, there is no such thing as a perfect movie but in my opinion, this and Titanic are the two closest movies I can think of. WillyT Seal of Approval? Well, yes, obviously.",9,0,0,17 August 2013
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Amazing and Unforgettable
","Would you go to a mental hospital to avoid a prison sentence? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story of patients in a mental hospital and how their life was changed by R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, arrived in the ward to avoid going to prison or working on a work farm and he made an impact. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a memorable story that goes down in history as one of the best. Let's start with the characters. Nicholson plays R.P. McMurphy, a criminal who has history of violence and aggression. He was sent to the asylum after acting erratic on the work farms. He isn't really mentally insane, but he fakes it to avoid going to prison. He thinks he can serve his sentence in the asylum and life will be easy. In the asylum we have Billy Bibbit, a nervous stuttering man with depression and anxiety. Cheswick is a nervous man who also struggles with anxiety. The actor who portrays him did a great job in playing the part. Danny Devito, yes little Danny Devito before he really went nuts, plays Martini, a lovable character. Then there's the Chief. Chief is a 6'5' mute who everyone thinks is dumb as a rock. He turns out to be one of the most important and influential characters. McMurphy originally goes into the ward to avoid prison but he eventually helps the patients in there. He thinks some of them could survive in the real world and he ends up giving the other patients confidence and a type of therapy. Billy eventually stops stuttering for a little bit. Harding has more self control and Cheswick learns to stick up for what he believes in. An example of McMurphy's 'therapy' is the fishing trip. McMurphy climbs over the fence and steals a bus with the patients from his ward. He takes them to a fishing boat and takes them fishing. McMurphy had his own agenda but he also helps the patients. He gives them an experience a normal man would have and they have fun. One of the best aspects of this movie is the accuracy to the time period. Men with mental illnesses were put in asylums like the one we see in the film. They experienced the different types of therapy. They took drugs such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti- depressants. Any means to help them relax and make them acceptable for society. They experienced group therapy, which we see often throughout, and something I've never seen before in hydrotherapy. Unfortunately, during this time period there were a lot of problems. If people were overly aggressive or considered dangerous they would undergo electroshock therapy. Basically, doctors tie you down and put conducting gel on your temples and a rubber mouth guard in your mouth so you don't bite your tongue. Then they literally send a shock through your temples into your brain. The idea was to reset the brain and make you more relaxed and in control. The audience witness's electroshock therapy in the film and it is a little disturbing to watch. You can see the suffering on their faces. Finally there is the lobotomy, where doctors drill into the skull or go through the nose to scrape out a piece of your brain. This turns a man into a vegetable who can barely survive on their own. It is illegal today but back then it was common. Character relationships are important for a successful movie and not many compare to the relationship McMurphy had with the vile Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was the head nurse in the ward. She controlled the groups and she was in charge. Her character is difficult because I couldn't ever really tell what her intentions were. Sometimes she tried hard to help the patients and other times she acted like she wanted to make them worse. A prime example is the one therapy group when Cheswick wants his cigarettes and Nurse Ratched just ignores him. Cheswick grows a backbone and stands up for himself and Ratched tries to put him back in his place and treat him like a dog. That scene really changes the movie and the major events of the movie unfold from there. McMurphy and Ratched would clash all the time. McMurphy would get under her skin and she under his. It made the movie really entertaining and a little comedic at times. Now no movie is perfect and I did have a few problems with it. Mainly it was the ending. It was a fine ending but I feel like it was a little too drastic. I don't want to give it away but it was one of those moments where you smack your forehead and go, 'you idiot.' When you see the movie you will know what I mean. Also what happens to one of the patients is completely unnecessary. I understand he was upset but he didn't have to do what he did. It was a little ridiculous and I can't see it really happening. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a great movie with excellent characters, a well written script, an interesting, and entertaining storyline. It deserves all the credit it got and will go down as a career making movie for Jack Nicholson. He did a fantastic job and deserved the Oscar he won. This is not what I would call a 'background movie.' Meaning, it is not something you can watch casually. You need to sit down and watch it and pay full attention. That's my advice and without a shadow of a doubt, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and is something I can watch again and again and enjoy every time.",8,8,12,28 November 2012
The Wolf of Wall Street," And the Oscar Goes to....
","One of these days Leonardo DiCaprio will get an Oscar. If he does not get one for Wolf of Wall Street than I think he may as well quit. Martin Scorsese and DiCaprio team up again and produce another Oscar worthy film. This duo has worked a lot in the past and they bring greatness on the big screen. Wolf of Wall Street follows Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who rose from very little to become a multimillionaire. Through all the illegal work and illegal drugs Belfort becomes a huge success but has struggles with the law. Jonah Hill delivers his best performance to date and once again proves to Hollywood that he is a talented actor. This movie has a lot of hype and for once I think it added up.Leonardo DiCaprio once again proves why he deserves a million Oscars and why he is my favorite actor. He puts all the effort he can muster into this role. He was so good he made a three hour long movie feel like it went by like a breeze. I did not get tired of this movie, I could have watched for a few more hours. I wanted to watch for a few more hours. I forgot I was sitting in a movie theater. That is how into this movie I was. It was funny too. I did not expect this movie to be as funny and as raunchy as it was. It was amazing but I'm surprised it got away with as much as it did.I knew DiCaprio had range but it takes a lot of talent to play this role. I couldn't think of a better man to play this role than DiCaprio. I think it was meant for him and I think this is finally the time he gets recognized by The Academy. The character himself was very complex and had a wide range. Jordan could make you laugh, cry, sympathize with him or somebody else, make you want to hit him in the face, or even motivate you to do something better. His character starts out as a normal guy starting out and he has respect for the job and the people in it, in a matter of scenes we see his transformation into the snarky businessman he is. He turns into a jerk but you still root for him and want him to succeed. This movie does have a flaw and I think that is the beginning. The movie starts with Jordan already being a huge success and then going back to his beginning. The only thing that saved the entire segment was Matthew McConaughey. He was hysterical and the fist bumps to the chest was brilliant. He teaches Jordan everything but then it ends and then he starts his own company. I don't really think it was necessary. It did introduce the minor characters and have the great diner scene but it took away from the character Jordan. He is shown as this big shot at first and then he is normal. It was weird to see and I personally felt it hurt the movie just a little bit. The whole cast worked their asses off, especially DiCaprio and Hill. Jonah Hill is a fantastic actor, and he is fat again. I love fat Jonah Hill. Thin Jonah Hill could not have pulled this off. Every scene he was in was great. He is one of those actors that can be funny in one scene, like his first scene in the diner. He can be serious, like the scenes in Switzerland. He can also be both, like the scene when he and Jordan take way too much drugs. That scene was the best acting I have seen on a long time. Both Jordan and Jonah Hill's character have a pill addiction and they take too much of a stronger version and they were higher than anyone I have ever seen. The crawling around and attacking on the phone was supposed to be a serious moment but it was so funny. The seriousness of the situation was there but it was still funny. I almost wish I worked in that office. These guys looked like they had a blast at work. If Jordan was my boss I would buy and believe everything he said. When he was at the microphone giving his motivational speeches I felt like I could be a stock broker. I honestly thought about stopping WillyT Reviews forever and going to Wall Street, well not really but it was that believable. Overall, Wolf of Wall Street was a damn good movie. I don't think it was an instant classic but it will do good come Oscar Season. I think DiCaprio gets the win for best actor. The movie itself gets at least a nomination for best picture. Scorsese gets the nod for best director and Jonah Hill for best supporting role. I don't think they will win but what do I know? In a few years this movie will probably be forgotten or overshadowed by another great movie but for now it is a gem and a masterpiece. This wasn't just a good movie for the comedy or the sex or the drugs. All of those things mixed in well to a good story with fantastic characters. Add the direction of Martin Scorsese and you get The WillyT Seal of Approval.",10,1,7,4 January 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," If Fox News was like This I Would Watch It
","Halloween came and went and I was Ron Burgundy, and then I realized I haven't reviewed one of the funniest movies ever made, Anchorman. With the second movie just around the corner there is no better time to review this movie. Anchorman launched Will Ferrell's career and basically jump started Steve Carell's career. Anchorman is the story of a 1960s Anchorman, Ron Burgundy who struggles with the changing times and the threat of a female anchor. This movie is hysterical from beginning to end and is brilliant in its writing and performances. Will Ferrell was on SNL but when he left Anchorman took Hollywood by storm. The witty lines and catchphrases of Ron Burgundy made him a pop culture icon. Ron is a brilliant character who is played perfectly by Will Ferrell. His relationships with all other characters are unique and funny in different ways. His main relationship is his with Veronica Corningstone but my favorite is his relationship with Baxter. Baxter is Ron's dog and the very first scene we see with him he barks and Ron apparently speaks dogs and its very funny. Then the shot with Baxter in the pajamas is my favorite in the entire movie. Baxter is the greatest dog in any movie, there I said it. I would name my dog Baxter if I had one.A comedy has to be memorable and quotable. This movie is one of the most quotable movies I have ever seen. I know scenes word for word just because they are funny. The sky rocket in flight scene to when Ron yells 'cannonball' I could go off on every funny quote but then it wouldn't be a review. The writing in this movie was fantastic. The scenes were well put together and you can tell when Ferrell is improvising. Her says things like 'by the beard of Zeus.' Nobody wrote that, it was on the top of his head, but it works. Ferrell has a talent for improve, witty comments. He is the clear star of the movie but there is just enough room for the spotlight to be shared. Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Fred Willard are also very funny but Steve Carell shines bright in this movie. Fred Willard is a lot of weird people in a lot of weird movies but his running gag with his phone calls about his son never gets old. Carell plays Brick, just from his name you know he is funny. In his opening scene he says 'years later a doctor will tell me I'm mentally retarded.' Perfect. His comedy is well placed and more subtle than anything. 'Brick where did you get the hand grenade?' 'I don't know.' He says, need I say more. We all know that scene. It's the best scene.The best scene in this movie is one I see on TV all the time. It's the battle of the news teams. Basically, its complete anarchy and nonstop laughs. There are a million cameos in this movie, including Ben Stiller, Seth Rogan, Vince Vaughn, Fred Armisen, Jack Black, and even Danny Trejo. I like it when comedies have cameos, especially with big name stars, because they can be so effective in such a small time. Stiller has one or two lines but it adds so much to the scene and makes it that much funnier. Comedies tend to drag on a little bit in the middle to get a hold of the story and build up to a hilarious climax and ending. This movie kind of does that after Ron's interaction with Jack Black. The movie takes a dive and isn't as funny as the rest but the movie can't be 100% funny. The story was ridiculous but it had a meaning. It showed the change in American society and how women were becoming a bigger part of it. The movie did need to portray that message and it did. I usually don't like that in comedies, but I can look past it for this movie. Overall, Anchorman was a riot of laughs. Every time I watch this movie, I laugh. I laugh at the same things I've laughed at millions of times before. If this movie is on TV I sit and watch it. I can jump in at any moment and enjoy it. I can watch this movie over and over. I watched it twice in a month and still enjoyed it. I can watch it alone but its better with other people. For that, Anchorman gets the WillyT Comedic Crest and the WillyT Seal of Approval. Go see this movie if you haven't, and you stay classy.",8,4,4,5 November 2013
The Green Mile," 3 Hours of Brilliance
","In honor of Michael Clarke Duncan, may his soul rest in peace. The Green Mile is based off the novel by the one and only Stephen King so I knew the movie was going to be interesting to say the least. It is about a death row guard from 1935 who gets his life changed forever when he meets John Coffey. Duncan plays a massive, black, man on death row. He is sentenced to death because he savagely murdered two young girls. Coffey has explained powers which adds twists and turns to this story. This movie had very unexpected parts and by the end I was satisfied and definitely surprised. John Coffey's first lines are him asking if they leave the lights on at night because he is scared of the dark sometimes. The look on Paul's face made the entire scene. Here stands a large, black, man who could lift a truck asking to leave the lights on. Its little comic moments like that which makes this movie different and unexpected. There were little bits of comedy in one of the most depressing places on the planet. Mr. Jingles is very symbolic. The little mouse runs around, becomes a thorn in Percy's side, and befriends Del and Paul. He is more than a mouse and more of an actual character. Tom Hanks delivers another fantastic performance as the star in this film. He has a bladder disease or some disease which makes it hard to use the bathroom. I thought that would have been very important to the story but it was and was not at the same time. It was a problem that got solved quickly, possibly halfway into the movie. Paul is his name and he has to deal with many problems such as, inmates, Percy the spoiled guard, Mr. Jingles the rat, and sometimes John Coffey and what he believes is right. John Coffey has this special power that is never really explained. That really bugged me but how could one have explained it. Coffey claims he can see life and see who's a good man and a bad man. I don't even think he understands and it adds uniqueness to his character. He touches Paul right in the crotch and cures him of his bladder disease. That was fine but in the beginning it seemed like it was going to be a big problem throughout the movie and it was gone and forgotten in a matter of minutes. Coffey can resurrect the dead, extend life, control others, and cure illness. When Del got the electric chair he felt the electricity going through his body and he felt the same pain. It was strange but fascinating. Every movie has a villain; I'm talking about Percy of course. The rich, spoiled, spoon-fed brat who likes to bully prisoners around just because he can. He is small and annoying but he is crafty. He is the real rat, not Mr. Jingles. He is the nephew of the Governor and he can get away with anything he wants. I hated him and hope he gets put on the chair. Del made Percy wet his pants in fear and Percy was embarrassed. Percy got back at him by stepping on Mr. Jingles and killing him. Luckily Coffey was able to revive Mr. Jingles and save his life. Percy had the final word when he did not wet the sponge when Del was sentenced to death. The sponge needs to be wet so it acts as a conductor so the electricity goes to the brain. Instead he fries, and screams, and gets lit on fire. It was gruesome and almost hard to watch. His shrieks and screams and the reaction of the people in the execution room were terrible. He smelled and was burning, smoke was everywhere and they tried to escape. The electricity could not be stopped because he was still alive, so he suffered. No man deserves that and he suffered because of the little rat Percy. Luckily, that little slime ball got his in the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Throughout the movie Coffey uses his power but he was still sentenced to death. In a way he wanted to die, he didn't want to live with his gift anymore. He righted some wrongs and it was hard for him to be executed. The guards cared about him and did not want to see him die. Paul shook his hand before he gave the order. A mask is usually put over the face of the prisoner but Coffey wanted it to remain uncovered because he is afraid of the dark. That was so powerful, out of respect his last wished are granted and it was not fair but it was what needed to happen. The most significant part of his death was the reaction of the guards. In every other execution the camera was focused on the prisoner. When Coffey died the camera was not on him at all, it was on the guards who he impacted. A few were in tears and the biggest, toughest guard was fighting back tears. It was powerful, meaningful, symbolic, and important. Before he died he passes something to Paul and we go back to Paul as an old man. His wife he is with doesn't really believe his story but Paul shows her a little box, a box with Mr. Jingles inside of it. He lived all those years. John passed long life to both Mr. Jingles and Paul. The movie closes with Paul saying life is one long green mile. Overall, The Green Mile was three full hours of great cinema. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves Stephen King and Tom Hanks. You have to invest your time into it and pay attention. I would see it again, I bought it, not on Blu Ray but it really doesn't matter. The Green Mile gets the WillyT seal of approval.",8,0,1,20 September 2012
Jaws," Simply Amazing
","Sometimes things do not go as plans and turn out better than you ever could have hoped. Stephen Spielberg wanted to make a movie about a killer shark but it turned out to be one of the scariest movies of its generation. I'm talking, of course, about Jaws. This thriller has a very simple premise but turned out to be one of the best movies ever made. Filmed on Martha's Vineyard, this film was a pain to shoot, but the reward was well worth it.Jaws had a really strong cast with Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider, and Richard Dreyfuss. Chief Brody struggles to convince his summer town that there is a killer shark in their waters. The big problem is that it is 4th of July weekend and they need this weekend because tourists bring in all the money the town needs to survive. If word gets out of a killer shark that means no money which means no survival. Murray Hamilton plays the foolish mayor who won't listen to reason. The shark kills a few people and push comes to shove. Brody brings in Matt Hooper, a shark expert, and they figure out the shark is a great white. This thing is a cold blooded eating machine. 'All this fish does is eat, sleep, and make baby sharks, it's that simple.' Eventually, the town hires Quint, a local fisherman and Brody, Quint, and Hooper venture out to kill the shark. That is our story and it really is done so well.Jaws is based off a book and they are similar. The basic story is obviously the same, character relationships and development is very similar. The only difference is that Hooper and Brody's wife have an affair. In the movie itself we see them get along and build a relationship and its interesting how Spielberg threw a little tease n there for fans of the book. Also the endings were both different which I also find interesting. The movie ending was way more explosive and enjoyable.As I said this movie was terrifying when it was released in the 70s, but it was scary by accident. The mechanical shark they used was named Bruce, but the thing never worked. To make up for it they only showed parts of the shark. It takes a long time to see what the full shark looks like. Sometimes it's not what you see that is scary, it's what you don't see, and that is what worked so well. We see a girl screaming for her life and getting dragged around, but we don't see what is doing it. It is almost disturbing but it worked and films have copied this tactic time and time again. There were also a lot of problems filming on the open sea. I mention this because any real fan of film would appreciate to know how hard it was to make this movie and how dedicated the filmmakers were to deliver.Along with the scary images of a torn leg, a decaying face, and blood being spit out of a mouth while the jaws of the shark pierce into the abdomen are horrifying, John Williams makes it ten times worse with two notes. Everybody knows the Jaws theme and how it starts out slow and picks up. As it gets faster and faster the shark gets closer and closer, and finally strikes. Music makes the movie, I say it all the time, and John Williams proves it once again, and he did it with two notes. Towards the end of the movie all the focus is on Quint, Hooper, Brody, and the shark. Hooper and Quint's relationship is really hysterical. It is old school verses new school. Quint is the rugged fisherman who just makes it up as he goes along. Hooper is the rich college boy with a plan. They butt heads a lot and their sarcastic remarks back and forth are very entertaining. My favorite scene in the entire movie is towards the end when the three men are on the boat telling stories of how they got their scars from sharks or whatever. Then Quint tells a true story of the USS Indianapolis. The USS Indianapolis was a cruiser that sank and all the sailors were in the water and over a few days sharks attacked and killed mostly everyone. Quint was on that ship and he tells the story. Robert Shaw gives one of the best speeches I have ever seen in any movie. The way he tells the story. 'And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes.' He describes sharks really well and that story was not something I expected form the movie. The true story takes the audience out of the movie and you feel sadness. We dig into Quint's character and even the way the camera just focuses on Quint and how he tells the story. This is a scene I watch twice every time because I love the way he delivers the speech. The only problem I have with the movie itself is that there are two scenes that scare the daylights out of me and I still can't what, and it is impossible to understand what Quint is saying without subtitles.Overall, Jaws is a classic and I love the way it was made, the people in it, and the movie itself. The movie works and it is nearly flawless. Jaws is a movie everybody alive in this world needs to see at least once. I bought this on blu ray and it was the best up converted movie I have seen so far. The picture was perfect and the sound was amazing. Sometimes I find myself constantly changing the volume of my surround sound but not with Jaws. Jaws easily gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",10,3,7,15 March 2013
Shooter," This is Why Snipers are Awesome
","I always said Mark Wahlberg belonged in action movies. Well, Shooter proves my point. Don't get me wrong, Mark Wahlberg is a very talented human being from the Funky Bunch from action films to comedy films, this guy has done it all. In Shooter Wahlberg plays a talented sniper who is set up by Danny Glover to assassinate the president. Obviously Wahlberg is innocent so it becomes a story of vengeance, justice, and discovery of the truth. I expected a few things from this movie and what I got was different in a good way.Action movies such as these are one of two things, a reckless bloodbath, or a decent or even good story with a lot of awesome and unrealistic action scenes. When watching a movie like this you got to take reality out of the equation. If it isn't too unrealistic it works and in this movie, most of the action is believable. In fact, the action scenes in this movie were some of the coolest and best I have seen in a while. The acting itself even surprised me. Mark Wahlberg did a very good job playing the ex-marine. He talks with confidence and he clearly knows what he is talking about. His hand to hand combat is very impressive. He clearly did his homework for this role. Danny Glover is one of my favorite actors ever but he doesn't play the best villain. He is mostly all talk and by that I mean he doesn't really do much. When he is on screen he mostly just takes up space and rambles on about how dangerous and skilled Wahlberg is. In a way he is smarter than everybody else because he knows the reality of the situation and the fact that his plan is screwed. The Russian guy in the wheelchair was a better villain because he had interesting backstory and he put a cool twist to the story which was overall impressive.Let's talk about the good stuff, the action. I love snipers. The idea of the weapon and how you can kill somebody from so far away with precision is interesting to me. The wind factor and angel was cool as well. The best scene was the snow scene. The meeting in the snowy mountaintops was foolish and pointless to begin with but they made up for it with some awesome sniper shots. Wahlberg is in a snow suit so he can't be seen and he takes out three or four men within a minute or two. The entire scene was clever, well written, well shot, and exciting. I almost re-winded my Netflix to watch it again. It also set the plot towards an ending and it was an all-around great scene.There were a few characters in the movie that weren't that great like the girl that was supposed to be the love interest but couldn't really find time for and the FBI agent who had a strong beginning but faded off in the end. The FBI agent was convinced that Wahlberg was innocent and he was digging into it. Danny Glover and the rest of the people involved did not like that and after a fail attempt on his life Wahlberg takes him in as a student. The guy is useful and has a few awesome moments but in the end he is forgettable and unimportant which I think is sad because he was a good and string character.There is one scene I need to talk about and it is probably controversial. That scene is the raid on the house. It starts out great with a few stealthy kills that looked awesome. Wahlberg plants some pipe bombs for insurance and that obviously foreshadows a shootout with a lot of explosions. This is where I see the problem. I understand the situation. It is the middle of the movie and there was a good time since an action scene so it needed to be big. There is a fine line between big and unbelievable and a few times this scene flirts with it. It is entertaining but 20 on 1 I don't see how it was possible. I was hoping the pipe bombs would take out most of the guys but it really didn't and they had to e taken out by an endless clip of pistol and assault rifle. It was a good scene just too exaggerated for the sake of excitement.Overall, Shooter was a very fun and exciting movie. The story was good enough with a few good characters and a twist and turn or two. I would gladly watch Shooter again with some friends being as I think it is a great background movie. It is a very good time and Wahlberg did what he does best, and that is be an action star. He was right at home in the role and it was great for his career. Shooter proudly gets the WillyT Recommendation for being a fun action movie that was better than I had hoped.",5,0,1,28 July 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Possibly the Best of All Time
","I swear this movie was narrated by God, and by God I mean Morgan Freeman. When I found out Shawshank Redemption was a movie based off a Stephen King book, I expected a creepy horror movie, sort of like The Shinning. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast deliver in one of the greatest films ever made in history, at least according to IMDb, it was ranked number one. So how does one review possibly the best movie ever made?The first time I watched Shawshank Redemption I wasn't really impressed, but when I saw it ranked atop the leader board on IMDb, I watched it again, and I agreed with its place. This movie was absolutely fantastic. The story flows and connects really well. The characters are lovable and important to the overall story and by the end it made me just go, 'wow that was awesome.' This is a story of a man named Andy Dufresne who was convicted for the murder of his wife and the man who she had an affair with. When Dufresne arrives in Shawshank he keeps a low profile but struggles with what one would call normal prison problems. He then uses his intelligence of the business world to get on the good side of the guards and the warden. He makes the warden really wealthy and prison life becomes simpler. Then the story develops from there and it is rather complex, but I won't give too much away.I have to start with a few flaws I saw in this movie. The story was a bit slow with a lot of scenes or stories within the major story taking place. In the beginning Andy had problems with the perverts of the prison, or Andy playing the music over the speakers of the prison etc. A few of these stories were pointless and just made me think, 'Why?' Some were definitely amusing but it is only a small gripe. Maybe if I watch it again I will appreciate them more, but for now it just dragged the story if you ask me. A second problem, and this really bugged me, was the fact that Andy Dufresne entered the prison in 1947 and left in 1966. That is a 19 year period. For a story to last 19 years is not a problem at all, but the fact that the characters do not age annoyed me a lot. Morgan Freeman was supposed to be in his 40s at the start. Now it doesn't matter what decade it is in real life, Morgan Freeman always looks old and wise. And by the end, Freeman didn't really age at all. Sure maybe a gray hair or two, but that was it. Dufresne looked the exact same and so did the Warden. Now some might ask why 19 year storyline but it makes sense if you actually see the movie. The director could have easily added some wrinkles, white hair, something, but there was nothing and it didn't make the time span believable. When Freeman narrates it's 1966 I didn't really believe it. Little details like that are things I can overlook because it is such a fantastic movie but small things like that make an awesome movie a classic movie.The major strength of the movie, in my opinion, is the characters. Dufresne, Red, the warden are the main characters so obviously they will have complexity and lovability, but even smaller characters like Brooks are still important. Brooks showed the prisoner who spends his life in prison and knows nothing else. He is a minor character but he made me think of prison life and prisoners themselves. When he got out of prison he didn't know what to do, he even wanted to stay. He had a minor role with a big impact. Even when he is gone he is remembered and mentioned many times. I really don't remember his name but the character who was the stereotypical 60s man and resembled Elvis was possibly the most important character of all (I'm just going to call him Elvis.). To save spoilers I will only hit the tip of the iceberg. The main story connects with the minor stories told throughout the movie really well but the all seemed pointless until Elvis shows up in Shawshank. He gives Dufresne what he needs and makes the warden put on his evil pants. Basically, he is the turning point of the story and makes it relevant. If you saw the movie you will know exactly what I mean, and if you haven't then go see it so you aren't completely lost. Now the ending was absolutely phenomenal. Throughout the entire move I was thinking what the point was and where it was going, but by the end it is so surprising and personally I thought it was unexpected. It makes you appreciate the idea of storytelling and keeping an audience interested and when I watched it a second time it was one of those times when you think, 'Why didn't I see this coming?' I love it when movie do that because it makes me think and if a movie makes me think it means I am interested and it does its job of being a good movie.Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a classic, possibly one of the best of all time. Do I think it deserves number one on IMDb's list? No, absolutely not but it should be in the top 10. A bit of a slow start to an amazing story that connects really well, a cast of characters portrayed in depth and detail, and an ending that will possibly blow your mind all form together to form on of, but not the best, movie of all time and without a shadow of a doubt gets the WillyT seal of approval. See this movie ASAP.",10,0,0,18 November 2012
The Conjuring," Better Than Any Recent Horror Movie
","Hide and clap or clap and seek, whatever that game was it made me never want to play any version of hide and seek ever again. The Conjuring did something a horror movie hasn't been able to do in a long time. No, not scare the hell out of me but it didn't make me laugh. This movie was one of the scariest movies I have seen in a very long time. The jump scares were there but necessary and not as predictable. The story of the Warrens is one I have never heard about but the supernatural and demon possession is something I sort of believe in, and that made the movie feel more real. I really enjoyed this movie, let's see why.A family is struggling on money and buys a house in the country off a bank auction. Little do they know, this house is haunted and has an awful past. When they bought the house you would think they would do the research on the history of the house but that is just me. From the mysterious leg tugs to the creepy doll that moves on its own, this movie knows how to scare. The terror and horror in this movie is overwhelming and lives up to the hype. It takes a lot to scare me in a movie and I have seen scarier movie there were many different ways this movie had an edge. One of the first things I noticed was that all the characters looked pale. The opening scene is a side story with a few girls who are being terrorized by an old doll. Not only was the doll creepy but the poor girls looked terrible. There was no pigmentation in their face. In fact no character, even the Warrens had much color in their face. All the clothes the characters wore were dull colors and they were not vibrant. Almost every scene was dark. Even when the sun was out, it was cloudy and there were shadows everywhere. That was something I noticed early and it was the same throughout the entire movie and it made the movie scarier.The scariest scene is easily when the mother plays hide and clap or whatever that game was called. Yes, I was too scared to remember, okay, don't judge me. Everything in this scene worked. The scared mother made the scare more believable and the acting she did. The music blended in well. The idea of turning on the lights is used a lot but it always works. She is running around the house trying to find the ghost and the jumps and spooks were great. The theater jumped and screamed at the end of the scene which ended in darkness and terror.The major flaw in most horror movies is the acting. The acting in this movie, however, is actually pretty good. The family that is haunted has five kids and a few of them are stereotypical but they all do a good job. They each have a scene or two where they shine in their moment of terror. If they are scared then the audience is scared and the movie works. Seeing one of the youngest daughters sleep walk and bang her head against the closet was creepy and of course the entire movie starts with normal occurrences that are creepy and quickly elevate.Was this movie perfect? No, there were some scenes where the movie slowed down and got a little out of hand. There are scenes that are supposed to be scary but aren't and they were hard to believe. The key to a movie like this is the backstory and the 'based on a true story' gimmick. The Warrens are real people who were paranormal investigators but there were parts of this movie where this could not have possibly been real. There were times where I was taken out of the movie because a girl was being dragged by her hair because of a ghost or something. It is hard to make a scene like that work because it looks silly. The characters of the Warrens themselves were unexpected. The movie focused on them just as much as it did on the family that was being haunted. The Warren's have a daughter of their own which was unexpected and she gets involved in a creepy scene as well. They had really good chemistry but their acting was a little weak at times. The Conjuring was a good time and I had fun with the movie but I don't think I would see it again. I think it only has the real effect once. Overall The Conjuring is a very good horror movie. Is that really saying much? Well, you tell me. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies. They are usually poorly made and cheap, but this one was different. It didn't rely on jump scares and cheesy tricks, but rather clever movements with the camera and limited CGI. The presentation of this movie was great and the writing clever. The backstory to this movie interesting and I bought it. I believe things like this happen but the movie needs to exaggerate it to make money and a good movie. I usually hate horror movies and laugh at them but this one was different. I was legitimately scared and I had fun. The scare wasn't constant and it wasn't there long but it was there. Some movies the scare is always there but in this movie it was here in bursts. For being the scariest movie I have seen in a long time it gets the WillyT Scaredy Pants Award. That's my horror genre rating so it also gets the WillyT Recommendation.",9,69,136,24 July 2013
Platoon," They Fought Themselves more than the Vietnamese
","Before he was winning and before he was on his own drug, there was Platoon. Platoon stars Charlie Sheen and Willem DaFoe in the 80's. They are soldiers in the Vietnam War. They experience the full blown hell that war produced. Platoon was directed by Oliver Stone and most of his movies are very long and have extreme detail. Platoon is no exception having a deeper meaning than what is shown. Vietnam veterans suffered greatly during and after the war. Platoon shows the suffering during the war. I thought it was interesting how towards the end a soldier is talking the Sheen and he says if they survive the war they will go home heroes and life will be easy. In reality it was the exact opposite and I wonder if soldiers really thought that or if that was just for comic relief. Either way the story was basic, fight the war and survive, but it turned into something more. It turned into what is right and wrong in warfare and how or who to fight. Soldiers in Vietnam were exposed to drugs and Platoon shows how soldiers would relax by taking drugs and smoking cigarettes. The reactions to these drugs and the warfare itself drove soldiers insane and caused them to commit terrible acts that Platoon portrays. Platoon was historically accurate as well and that is very important. Situations the movie showed really happened. The scene where they raid the village and terrorize the farmers actually happened. It was a historically known massacre that really happened; I just can't remember the name. Soldiers didn't know who the real enemy was so they attacked everybody. Innocent people suffered because American soldiers could not control themselves and the pressures of the war got to them. They raped, murdered, and pillaged the village and that was just the beginning. They weren't only fighting the Vietnamese; they were also fighting each other. Barnes and Elias had their differences and they fought constantly but the betrayal of Barnes where he basically murdered Elias was just epic. That scene was just so bone chilling. Barnes chases him down and they stare each other down. It's a showdown and they look like they can read each other's minds. Barnes shoots and Elias falls down to the ground. Barnes tells Chris, Sheen, that he is already dead. Chris and Elias were good friends and shared similar opinions on the war. Barnes and Chris retreat to the helicopter but as they go up they see one of their own running towards the helicopter. It was Elias. He ate so many bullets and was bleeding everywhere. It was the ultimate betrayal. He was killed by his own squad and he raised his arms and looked up to the sky which became a classic pose from the movie. He falls over, dies and the helicopter flies away. Throughout the movie there is music from the Vietnam era but in every sad or serious scene the same tune of violins plays and makes the scene so much better. I always say the music can be the most important part of a movie. It sets tone and mood. It can make or break a scene and every time those violins played the audience knows the scene is important. Let me make one thing clear. I hate Charlie Sheen. I don't think he is funny; he is crazy, and a terrible actor. He should not be allowed to make anything else in the industry but that is just my opinion. Luckily this was before all of that garbage and he really did a good job. In parts of his acting I laughed and thought it was ridiculous but about an hour into the movie he stepped it up and did an amazing job. It made me respect the man more for his acting and what he had in his young career. It is a shame he let drugs ruin his life. My problems with the movie were that there were a lot of characters, possibly too many. Forrest Whitaker and Johnny Depp were in the movie but they disappeared. They were important for a scene and then I don't know what happened to them. Did they die? Did they leave the war? I don't know. Maybe somebody can let me know so please comment. For a war movie it wasn't the best I've seen but it wasn't really about the war between the Vietnamese but more about the war with themselves and the betrayal of soldiers. It was more emotional than physical and in a movie about Vietnam that should be portrayed so kudos to Platoon for that. Overall it was a fantastic movie that was more than a war movie but an emotional tale of soldiers in the Vietnam War. They suffered greatly and this movie probably most accurately portrays the devastation of the war. Action, acting, emotion, music, and overall performance were all good. Platoon easily gets the WillyT seal of approval but Charlie Sheen needs to just go away. I really just don't like the man or anything he is in, other than this movie. I could watch this movie again and again and can be viewed alone or with friends. Don't let young kids watch it obviously; listen to the rating on the movie because it will probably not end well but still a great film for mature audiences.",9,1,1,3 September 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Could it of gotten any better
","Ready for the best review of the summer, of course I'm talking about the Dark Knight Rises. This movie was just epic and flawless. No movie is perfect but this was close. Acting was fantastic, special effects kicked ass, and characters were relate able. The story is a madman named Bane tries to take over Gotham and Batman has to come back and save the day. The story is more complex than that with the cover up of the Harvey Dent affair. That's a strong point in the story; even though the Joker isn't in the movie he still has an impact with his actions from the previous movie. The twist in the movie wouldn't have been so surprising if the writers didn't try so hard to trick us. They told us Bane was the son of Liam Neeson. The audience was told a lie and everybody bought it. I get it because it caused a better movie but I still didn't like it. Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job not just with this movie but with the entire trilogy.My favorite character in the entire trilogy is easily Alfred the butler. He takes care of Bruce Wayne and he is a father figure. Everything he says is relevant. Weather it be comic relief or a life lesson to Master Wayne. He is right about everything as well. Batman stood no chance to take on Bane and Batman got the worst beating of his life. He was only in the movie for an hour, but he has an impact and he had every right to leave. He didn't want to see Bruce die. It would have been too much and he would not have fit in a chaotic Gotham. Nolan also introduced Cat Women and she was fantastic. She was smart, strong, and sexy. She blew me away with her performance. Her dialog was witty and clever but she had some cheesy lines that I just hated. Her character was just perfect for the movie and she pulled it off. I was a little worried when I heard Cat Women was going to be in the movie but I was not disappointed.The action and special effects were perfect and the fight scenes were breathtaking. The coolest part of the entire movie was when Gordon lit the flair and the bat symbol lit on the bridge. I just did not see that coming. Another part I always look for is the music. The soundtrack was very basic with the loud brass instruments for Batman, which is epic, and the chorus for Bane, which is also epic. The first fight scene between Bane and Batman, there was no music and that made the scene ten times better. The makers of this movie worked really hard and their hard work definitely paid off. The effects were great but some of them were just unrealistic and would never happen. In the beginning when the windows were shot out in the plane, wouldn't the suction suck everyone in the plane and kill them? That just didn't make sense. There was a nuclear bomb that was four megatons with a six mile radius that would have caused a much larger impact and caused more damage. It was a nuclear bomb and all the radiation could have destroyed the ecosystem and caused problems for a long time. There was also no shock wave, a bomb has a shock wave and that would have done something. Instead it just exploded and that was it. These were problems I'm willing to overlook because the movie was so awesome.The timing was also off. One day Bruch Wayne was in the pit and the next day he was in Gotham. How did he get in and how did he get there so fast? It was the same with getting there. Bane delivers him to the pit and he goes right back to Gotham, which would have taken a long time. The 3000 police officers were in the dark for months with little to no sunlight. Then they are in the sun fighting a battle and their eyes are just unaffected. People also dispute the ending and if it was right. How did Batman escape the ship and not die? Well the auto pilot was fixed and he escaped. The Batman is dead. It had to happen somehow because Bruce Wayne could not just give it up so easily, but now he is forced to. Everyone thinks he is dead and he is free of the responsibility. Batman is dead and he died a hero but Bruce Wayne lived on and moved on with Cat Women. She is also free and she got what she wanted and Alfred's dream came true. The ending was nearly perfect and it was how it should have been. There is also a dispute saying if Robin or Night Wing will take over responsibility of Gotham, but that's a debate for another time.Overall, The Dark Knight was nearly perfect. A few moments where it was just too unrealistic and some cheesy lines but the characters we all grown to know and love were there and they did their thing. Acting was commendable and action was top of the line. I saw the movie twice and it was better the second time. This movie obviously gets the WillyT seal of approval and can be watched alone but is a better time with friends.",7,6,12,9 August 2012
Iron Man," Iron Man was good, but not good enough
","You would think Iron Man by Black Sabbath would have been in Iron Man the movie with Robert Downey Jr. Thank god it was not. Now, this movie is about a millionaire, Tony Stark, who runs a weapon manufacturing company. He is in Afghanistan testing out his weapons and he gets captured by terrorists to make a missile for them. Stark barely survived being captured and he is alive because of a mechanism planted in his chest. Instead of designing a missile for the terrorists, he builds a suit and uses the energy from the device in his chest to escape, thus the idea of Iron Man.When Stark returns to the real world he designs and perfects the Iron Man suit. He seeks revenge on the terrorists and his business partner and good friend turns on him and tries to kill him, making him the main villain. So here we have our story. Was it a great movie? No, but it was a good movie that I did enjoy.The character of Tony Stark was great. He was funny, clever, cocky, and all around good for the movie. His lines and sarcastic attitude brought comic relief and made him a relatable and likable character. His character develops well and we get the Tony Stark story. Iron Man isn't really that important, the story is more about Tony and what he will do with the character of Iron Man. A lot of the movie was him testing out the suit but he did very little fighting. Some scenes were boring and the story dragged, but it was still interesting. The final fight scene was a little disappointing but not terrible. It was just and it fit well.The last scene really annoyed me. Tony calls a press conference to revel the truth. He had a cover up story and instead he confessed that he was the Iron Man. His secret identity is gone and everyone knows who he is. As a super hero I think your identity should never be public, it's too dangerous, but Tony Stark could be different. I'm interested to see how it will work in Iron Man 2. The Avengers has already been made but I still have not seen it as this is being written. In all Marvel superhero movies there are hints towards the Avengers with Nick Fury and SHIELD. I think it's great for the movie and it makes it more interesting. It draws the audiences' interest and makes them wonder what the Avengers are and it also draws them to other superhero movies, which brings in more money. Overall the story was OK, the character of Tony Stark was great, and the movie itself was nothing special. There was little action scenes but a lot of character development. It would have been nice to see a little more of a mixture and for that Iron Man does not get the WillyT seal of approval. It is still a good time, see it with your friends because you will be more entertained, and I would buy it in DVD and see it again and again,",6,0,3,20 August 2012
Flight," Denzel at His Best
","The main reason I don't like going on planes is because of movies like Flight. Flight is a surprising story about a drunken pilot, Denzel Washington, who makes an impossible move in landing his damaged aircraft with 102 souls onboard. Denzel delivers possibly his best performance of his career and giving him an Oscar nomination. The story starts about a plane crash, but turns into a man's emotional problems with drugs and alcohol. This should be interesting.I knew this movie was about alcohol addiction and not so much about the crash. In the very first scene, Denzel Washington wakes up in a hotel room with who I'm assuming is a prostitute. His room is a mess and he grabs a bottle and starts to slurp it down. His phone rings and he starts arguing with his ex-wife. While this is going on the woman is just walking around getting changed and he has to fly a plane in less than an hour. The scene ends with him doing a line of coke and then him leaving to fly the plane. That opening scene made such an impact I knew this movie was going to be good. This was the very first scene of the movie.The actual sequence of the crash itself was very interesting. Washington keeps his composure and knows exactly what he is doing. You would never know he was drunk but the scene looked and felt real. The danger was intense and the shot of the plane flying upside down was a thing of beauty. He lands the plane and then the controversy starts. The whole idea of the movie is to keep him out of jail and blame the crash on the faulty equipment. This movie had strong acting, emotional scenes, and very believable throughout.The drug and alcohol abuse may have been stretched a bit. They show how much he drinks all over the place. He gets into his car and takes out a handle of vodka and drinks straight from it like its water. I feel like if a man drank and did this much coke, he would be dead. He meets a girl who is a recovering alcoholic at the hospital and they create one of my favorite scenes I have ever seen.It is a few days after the crash and Denzel needs a cigarette so he goes in the stairwell to smoke one. Who does he see, but the recovering alcoholic and heroin addict. They start talking and a cancer patient comes up the stairs and joins the conversation. The conversation these three have lasts about 5-10 minutes but when it ended I remember thinking I could have watched that for another few hours. It was so entertaining and what6 they were talking about was so real and true.So Denzel and this woman have a thing and hook up. Her character is one I really don't enjoy. She serves her purpose in the story and shows how the alcohol pushes people away, but she is in the movie and then she leaves, and never comes back. She comes, she goes, and she is forgotten. I had a problem with that. It was a flaw in the movie. She was introduced as a major character with major importance, and then she leaves. I don't have a problem with leaving, but a problem, with not coming back. That is really my only problem, other than the ending of the movie is so predictable. There is really only one outcome and everybody knows it, even the characters in the movie.Denzel Washington is absolutely fantastic in this role. He plays a great drunk. All of his scenes are real and it is amazing how well he got into the character. I knew he had talent, but this was raising the bar to the next level. Although he did not win the Oscar, he definitely deserved the recognition and the nomination. You can see the struggles he faces through his acting throughput the entire movie. He wants to stop drinking and a few times he tries but he gets sucked in again and again. John Goodman is hilarious for the short times he is in the movie. He was good, as always.Overall, Flight was an amazing movie with some of the best acting in recent memory. Goodman is funny, Washington is powerful, and the supporting cast worked really well too. Most actors had good chemistry and we could see that on screen. The movie had a few holes and slowed down in the middle but it had a strong finish and an overall great story. Flight deserves the Oscar nomination for best picture. Denzel Washington deserves the nod for Best Actor in a leading role, and Flight gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",8,1,5,26 February 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Simple a Masterpiece
","Now I'm aware the Lord of The Rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. They next one also picks up right where the other left off. Here we go the review of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, The Lord of The Rings. Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by J.R.R. Tolkien and it is the most cliché story of good vs. evil. The story is stereotypical, but it works. Tolkien created his own world of Middle-Earth and it is filled with different races and languages. In the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil, 'one ring to rule them all.' The maker of this ring was named Sauron and long story short, he was defeated but survived through the ring. The ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. He has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of Sauron destroy Middle-Earth. The storyline is very cliché. It is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. If you think you have seen this before, you have, but this is completely different. The little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord.One of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. Gandalf's relationship with Frodo and the ring. Frodo's relationship with Sam, Gollum, and the Ring. Gollum's relationship with the ring. Merry's relationship with Pippin. All of these relationships drive this movie. Nothing is more powerful then the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Samwise Gamgee is more than Frodo's best friend, he is basically his protector. Sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. Frodo could not have survived without Sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Sauron has all the power of persuasion, power of armies, fear, and all the power in the world. The only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power.Coming in second with relationships is between Gollum and the Ring. Think about it, Gollum spent more time with the Ring than anybody else, excluding its master Sauron. Gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. It literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you can't help but pity. He is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isn't his fault that he is the way he is. He is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. Any fan of these movies knows what I'm talking about.Over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. Gimli and Legolas didn't like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. 'I never thought I'd die side by side with an elf,' Gimli says in the final battle. 'How about side by side with a friend?' Legolas answers. These two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. You also see Merry and Pippin evolve into something I know I did not expect. In the first movie they were silly and naïve but in the second movie Merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. Pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters.These three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. From Hobbiton to Rivendell to Helms Deep and all the way to the Crack of Doom, every place in Middle-Earth comes to life. The designers of these sets and CGI went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. You learn how Hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in New Zealand. My favorite battle has to be the battle of Helms Deep. It was 10,000 Uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of Rohan for centuries. Aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie.These movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. Peter Jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in New Zealand and filmed this masterpiece. Costumes were made and WETA Workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of Middle-Earth come alive. Actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. The only real problem with these movies is that if you don't know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. I saw the first movie when I was really young and I had no idea what it was about and I had to see the movies many, many times before I knew what was going on. As soon as I did, I was hooked and now I know almost everything there is to know about these movies.Overall, The Lord of the Rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. The way the filmmakers dove into the world of Middle-Earth with such detail is commendable. This movie won so many awards, made a bunch of money, and it deserves everything it got. These are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you don't, go in, pay attention, and join the experience. Lord of The Rings is my favorite movie, next to Titanic, and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",10,0,1,5 February 2013
The Purge," Way to Blow a Great Opportunity
","Once a year laws do not exist. Once a year you can do anything you want for twelve hours and not get in trouble. This is called The Purge and it is designed to let humans let out their frustration on the world. This apparently keeps society healthy, the economy up, and crime down. I'm here to tell you that The Purge is a waste of time. A Waste of money and should not be viewed by anyone with half a mind. I don't even know where to start with this mess. Let's start with the idea of the purge. In 2022 the idea is that if we let people go crazy for 12 hours they will be calm for 364.5 days. The logic and science behind this is beyond far-fetched and it is really laughable. The fact that anybody believes this works is out of their mind. Think about this. Somebody pitched this idea to a group of people and those people said, 'yeah I believe that, we could make millions.' Well I'm here to say shame on you people and how dare you try and convince audiences across the country of this crazy premise. To make it even worse scientists and other people try to say the purge is an excuse to kill the homeless and people who cannot defend themselves. It is an excuse to get rid of the weak and allow the strong to survive. I don't like the idea that this movie supported the idea of killing weak and poor people is OK. The first half of the movie really focuses on these crazy people trying to find this one particular homeless person. It allows them to cleanse society and themselves. It makes zero sense and this movie had potential and it was wasted on this piece of garbage.The story is basic. There is a family with a lot of money and they sell security systems for the purge. Their house is huge and I will say I would love to live there. So the purge is going on and their youngest son sees a man in the streets calling for help and of course he lets him in. Shortly after a radical group of lunatics come knocking at the door looking for him and if they don't get him in a certain amount of time then they will come in and get him. While they waste time at the house they could have been running wild and cleansing the world of more poor people. Instead they waste time on this one person.These people are completely out of their mind and it is impossible to believe they are normal for 99.9% of the year. There is no possible reason why they go nuts for 12 hours and go on a murdering rampage. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be funny or scary either. While they are outside they are dancing and prancing around being stupid with their stupid masks. One is on the others back running around. The masks are on and they pretend to make out with one another and it was really failed comedy or an even bigger failed scare. I just sat in my chair and laughed throughout the entire movie. I don't know if its horror movies or me but I find them really funny. I laughed more during this movie then I did during The Hangover 3.I will be honest, I did hate this movie but I don't regret seeing it because I did have a good time and enjoy myself. I sat in a full theater and listened to the crowd tear apart the movie. People hated the daughter's boyfriend and the son's stupidity and the craziness that was happening. Every time somebody died the crowd burst into cheers and applause so that was awesome. I liked ripping the movie apart in the theater. There was a scene where there is a giant glass bowl filled with dominos and for some reason I thought it was the funniest thing. Other than the crowd I was entertained through this disaster of a movie. The action scenes where bodies were flying and people were dying were cool to see and what the movie should have been about. The selling point of the movie was 12 hours of lawless mayhem. I wanted to see chaos and the world go to hell. Instead I got a stupid story about a family I didn't really care about being tormented by people out of their mind. This movie tried to touch on human nature and how they change in the heat of the moment and how they do things they won't normally do. It doesn't work. The movie gives the wrong message and the wrong counter argument to the message. Overall The Purge is a mess. The lame jump scares I saw coming thirty seconds before they happened were not scary. The lunatics were not scary or believable and reminded me of a silly version of The Strangers. That movie was scary and the stuff they did made me scared. The stuff these guys did made me laugh. I wanted something 100% different from this movie and I got boring characters, a terrible story, and a disappointment. This movie fails at almost everything it attempted. It doesn't get a recommendation, it doesn't even get and A for Effort. I haven't don't this in a while but The Purge gets The WillyT Seal of DISapproval. Don't waste your time. Take my advice, save your money, save your time, save the gas in your car. If you really have to see it, wait a few months and get it off the internet for free. You're welcome.",3,149,277,7 June 2013
The Matrix," What is The Matrix?
","Welcome to the real world of awesome reviews. Me personally, I would have taken the red pill. Obviously I am talking about the mind bending experience known as The Matrix. What is the Matrix? To be honest, after seeing the entire probably ten times I still probably can't even tell you. The Matrix is about a man named Thomas A. Anderson who lives a double life. He works for a company which he hates, but he is also a computer hacker by the alias of Neo. He is searching for the answer to the Matrix question. He is also looking for the legendary Morpheus, but Morpheus is also looking for him. Neo is destined to be 'the one.' Mr. Anderson gets sucked into 'the real world' and he experiences a whole new world.The first Matrix throws a lot of plot at the audience, especially in the beginning. We learn about The Matrix and the history of the real world. The human race is on the brink of destruction and they are at war with the machines. Neo is destined to be 'the one' the one to save humanity and end the war, but first he has to be sucked out of the Matrix and into the real world. Neo has lived in the Matrix his entire life and he got taken out. The plot is a little slow and confusing but if you stick with it, the story is very interesting and rewarding.The dialog in this movie was very clever. When Neo entered the real world he asked why his eyes hurt. Morpheus answered, 'You never used them before.' Neo is a full grown man and the idea of him using his eyes for the first time just makes you think. Morpheus says, 'Welcome to the real world.' That line was probably the most memorable line of the entire movie. My favorite line has to be when an agent is dodging Neo's bullets and when he fires back Neo dodges all but one of his bullets. The agent walks up to Neo and before he can pull the trigger Trinity comes out of nowhere, puts a pistol to his head and says, 'Dodge this.' Then she blows him away in slow motion fashion. That was awesome not cheesy at all.The villain in a movie has to stand out and be memorable. Hugo Weaving plays Agent Smith, and he is probably one of the greatest villains in a movie I have ever seen. The way he talks, the way he moves, the way he acts, everything about him is just bad. This guy does not play around, he is strictly business. One of the first scenes we meet him he is talking with Mr. Anderson and he makes Mr. Anderson's mouth disappear. He lets the audience know that this is his world, his playground, and everyone plays by his rules. He is intimidating because he is a leader, he rarely shows emotion, all he wears is a suit and shades, and he is plain scary. Every time he says, 'Mr. Anderson' it sends a chill down my spine. The special effects are in a league of their own, there phenomenal. The beginning of the movie may have been a little slow but once Neo gets into the real world there are plenty of fight scenes, gun fights, explosions, death, and fear. Somebody turns of the special effects switch and the movie goes off. The most famous of course is when Neo dodges bullets and basically does the limbo. That has been impersonated by everybody at least once. The last scene where Neo and Trinity go into the building with a bunch of guns and blow away the soldiers, that was awesome. There were bullets flying and punches were being thrown. The martial arts and slow motion effects were amazing. Actors must have worked really hard to master the technique, and it really did pay off. Sure some of the things that happened in the movie would never happen in real life, but think of the world they are in. Think of the story and how it doesn't matter if it would happen in real life or not. The Matrix technically isn't 'real.' Problems with the movie, there are a few. This movie is not for somebody with a short attention span. You need to pay attention during the first hour of the movie. It is all plot and explaining the world that is The Matrix. It drags a little bit but it is important. The audience could still have some questions at the end. What exactly is Zion? Is Neo the one? The oracle says he isn't but he does things no other person can do. Do the oracles prophesies even mean anything? She said one will live and one will die, meaning Neo or Morpheus. This story leaves some holes but that's why two more movies were made. A main problem I had was the rating of the movie. This was rated R violence and language. Sure it was violent and bad language was used but there was no blood and language wasn't as bad. This movie could have passed for a stretched PG-13 and it would have attracted more of a crowd.Overall, this movie was great and different. The technology used in this movie was awesome and used right. The slow motion wasn't overused or underused, the action scenes weren't crazy because they were worth waiting for and scenes I could watch again. This movie gets the WillyT seal of approval and can be watched more than once. It is also a movie that can be seen with friends or alone. If you have not seen this movie, check it out. It's a movie everybody should see.",8,0,0,16 August 2012
50_50," Cancer Isn't Funny, but it Can't Hurt to Laugh
","Dramatic Comedy is a tough genre. Sometimes they are too serious and not funny and sometimes they are too funny and it's too much of a comedy. The movie is called 50/50 but the drama to comedy ratio is more like 80/20. Joseph Gordon Levitt start as a 27 year old man who gets diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and is given a 50/50 shot of staying alive. Seth Rogan is his best friend and he is hilarious as always. Levitt goes to a treatment center and meets two older cancer patients and they are also very funny, but other than that this movie was straight up drama. Is 50/50 a good movie? Eh, yes, it has a lot of emotion and Joseph Gordon Levitt makes the character very believable. Cancer is a very hard thing to live with affecting so many people. He has a girlfriend and she eventually shows her true colors. A lot of the scenes in this movie felt real. The relationships between Levitt and other characters felt real and how he treats them was expected. He didn't want a therapist so he gives her attitude. He is sick of his overbearing mother so he ignores her. He and his girlfriend don't have the best relationship which in this situation can be expected. It was Rogan and Levitt that had the best relationship because we see Levitt's character smile and be normal. It was good for him and better for the movie. The comedy came in at the right and wrong time but it really lacked. This movie straight up wasn't that funny. Rogan is the center of all the comedy, as he should have been, but I wanted to laugh more in this movie. I expected to laugh more in this movie. When the comedy was there it was hysterical. Something happens between Levitt and his girlfriend and Rogan's character is right in the middle and you can tell this scene was written by Rogan himself or completely improve. I was laughing so hard in this moment and a few others but the core of the movie is a cancer story. The dramatic moments are really well done but the majority of the movie is predictable. You have seen this movie before time and time again but it is still entertaining. I expected something a little different than what I got but predictable does not always mean bad. There were a few moments and outcomes I did not see coming but the majority I could have written myself. At first Levitt hates his young therapist. He is 27 and she 24, and it is obvious they grow on each other and become a love interest in the least expected of ways. In the cancer treatment center Levitt meets these two old guys who also have cancer and they are a riot. The first scene with the three of them was great. One of them gives Levitt pot cookies and that whole scene is great and hysterical. When the three of them are together it is pure entertainment, but then the drama bug comes around and kills one of them and we never see Levitt interact with the remaining one again. That was a shame but it was a big reality punch in the face. I felt really sad when he died and it hit me as hard as it hit Levitt. This movie touched me as it probably touched most people because we all know somebody who has cancer or is affected by another family member who has cancer. In a more cheerful note Seth Rogan is in this movie. I love Seth Rogan, he may play the laid back pot head in every movie but he does it so well. There are few people who could pull off what he did. He made a terrible situation not as terrible. He isn't laughing at cancer or saying it isn't a big deal, but he is saying it isn't the end of the world. You may have less time than the rest of us and that is unfortunate but he tries to make the best of it for his friend. Yeah there is that one scene where they use it to get laid but come on that would probably work in real life. Overall 50/50 is a dramatic comedy and one of the better ones I have seen. I'm not crazy about this genre but I am crazy about any movie Seth Rogan is in. I had doubts going into this movie and as predictable and emotional as it was, I did enjoy it. I had fun with this movie through my laughs and fighting back of tears. The characters all felt real and the endgame of all of them felt real. Levitt's father in the movie has Alzheimer's disease but in all honestly I thought it was wasted. I think he was supposed to be used for comedic relief but he isn't really used. He says a few lines but other than that he stands around and looks stupid. There were a lot of things I liked and a lot I didn't but it is still a solid movie I found entertaining so it gets a very high WillyT Recommendation.",7,1,1,25 July 2013
The Hangover Part III," ....oh dear god
","The epic conclusion to one of the strangest trilogies wasn't as epic as I had hoped. The Hangover 3 opened and I was excited because the Hangover 2 was a giant disappointment due to the similar antics as the first movie. I got to say, this movie was different but different was far from better. The Hangover 3 was no better than the Hangover 2. It was less of a comedy and almost more of a B rated action movie. I hope you are ready for a rant because I got a good one. I can feel it in my fingertips, here we go. This movie is called THE HANGOVER. They don't get hangover. There is no drinking and all the changes made from the original didn't work. All of the actual funny parts were shown in the trailer. The only funny parts were the giraffe, the singing, and well that's really it. I can honestly say I laughed more during Evil Dead then I did in the Hangover. I don't know if that makes me a sick person. Somebody please comment and tell me they agree with me so I don't feel crazy. The main problem with this movie was Chow. I like the actor who plays Chow but I hate his character. I don't find him funny and he is over used. He is like a bottle of ketchup. You don't give up on that bottle until every last bit is out. You keep tapping on the bottom until you physically give up. He was perfectly used in the first movie but I didn't like him there either. He was at least funny in the original but I still thought he over did it. In this movie he is a main character and that drove me nuts. The focus on the movie was mainly on him when it should have been on the wolf- pack. Other than him all the comedic material was focused around Alan. Alan is supposed to be a lovable idiot who has witty jokes and makes you laugh. He pulled it off se well but in this movie he lost his edge and turned into a jerk. His jokes were flat and most of the time he just made fun of Stu. Stu is supposed to make fun of Alan, that is where his comedy originates from and he wasn't funny at all in the movie. All he does is complain and whine. Bradley Cooper was flat as well. He gave little to no effort in the role and you see it in his performance. He was boring and not funny either. Something was missing in the wolf pack and they tried to fill that with the silliness and over the top actions of chow and for me it didn't work what so ever. I knew the story would be crazy and overall it would not be a good movie but I didn't go in expecting a good movie. I went on to laugh. I was really hoping for a strong opening scene with a lot of laughs but it failed to impress. It was focused on Chow and it spoofed Shawshank Redemption, which I did not appreciate. When Chow wasn't on screen the movie wasn't that bad and it was decently funny. Most of the theater wasn't laughing either. I set myself up for the best chance possible for s good time and even the audience was flat. They were just as bored as I was. The occasional burst of laughter but it was a full theater and laughter usually builds off of others laughing. I know people and critics won't like this movie and that is a shame because the first one was so good and different. It is a shame a great title had to come to this. I hope and pray there is no Hangover 4, but knowing Hollywood there will be. John Goodman was in the movie and he was great. He wasn't funny but his addition to the movie saved me from hating it. Evert time he was on screen I was satisfied and happy. He made references to the first movie and little bits and pieces like that I liked. Black Doug comes back along with the stripper and baby from the first. There are a few cameos from the first movie any huge fan will appreciate. I liked that and it put a smile on my face. The best scene was when Alan reunites with Carlos and they have the cutest conversation. It was funny and adorable at the same time. It was a nice break from the crazy antics for some good ole fun. The main thing that aggravated me the most was the 90 second scene during the credits. It was hysterical and it showed a little glimpse of what the movie could have been. I won't spoil it but they wake up hangover, and it was another night they couldn't remember. That 90 seconds was funnier than the entire movie. I burst out into laughter the point where my sides hurt. It was funny but added to my frustration towards the fail this movie really was. Overall, The Hangover 3 blew it. This movie could have been really good and hilarious. The script was poor, the focus was messed up. Chow and Alan needed to be rewritten and it needed to be funny. This movie was not funny. The car chases and gunshots needed to be cut and added with witty comments from Alan and funny reactions from Stu and Phil. Should you see this movie? Sure, why not. It wasn't a disaster but it was close. If you saw the first two then go ahead but don't expect anything to great. The Hangover 3 gets the Willyt A for Effort, better luck next time. Mark my words, there will be a next time.",4,14,28,25 May 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," I EXpected So Much More
","I sat down and watched what was supposed to be one of the best movies of the year, and it's a horror film. Needles to say, 'Cabin in The Woods' was terribly disappointing. It is a horror movie and I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be. It was a horror movie that makes fun of the horror genre as a whole. I didn't like that and I felt like I was watching 'Scream' all over again. There were many problems with this movie so let's get started.The movie starts with your standard college kids going into a secluded place to party. However, this time is different. They are going into a controlled environment where a company controls how and when the die. This is the basic premise of the movie and it leaves the audience wondering why this company is doing this. Personally, I didn't like that. The idea was good but the ending to the movie became sort of obvious. This movie could have been a lot better if a few scenes were switched around. The company in control should have been the kicker and the huge surprise, instead the first scene shows them starting and telling you what is going to happen. This movie was supposed to be surprising and different with a mind blowing concept. Instead it became somewhat predictable and the 'shock' at the end was just ridiculous.This starts out as a basic and standard horror movie with Chris Hemsworth leading a group of mindless idiots into the woods. It was the typical jock, slut, genius, idiot stoner, and the innocent virgin. It is obvious who is going to die and when, and it is exactly what you would expect from a horror movie. The slut dies while having sex, which has been done so many times. The acting was just disturbing. Hemsworth plays the thunder god Thor in the movie 'Thor.' He did a good job in that movie and now he is seen with his terrible one-liners and bad acting. The slut does her job as the hot girl in the movie to draw teenage boys and perverted old men towards ticket sales. The only character I actually liked was Marty.Marty was the stoner idiot who kind of saw what was coming. His character was actually interesting and had meaning. He wasn't just a filler character to get killed. He noticed something was wrong with the house and hoe everybody was acting differently. He basically pointed out how he was in a horror movie and everybody was in trouble. The movie throws in a lame twist as to how the company cannot control him as a character and it was just stupid. It was something I did not see coming but I still was not impressed.I was also hoping the movie would focus more on the cabin itself. The movie is called a cabin in the woods and the characters spend very little time in the actual cabin. In the beginning the cabin is eerie and different and hints towards some importance. It turns into being just a simple cabin and is really disappointing. The two way mirror was cool and the elaborate paintings were interesting but after they were shown in their one scene, they were never seen again. There was so much potential wasted, and it is really a shame.This movie takes a complete turn in a few ways I did not see coming. The company control monsters in which to kill people but what was basically going to happen was totally obvious. The ending to this movie was far-fetched and definitely entertaining. Actually, I need to say this, the movie was entertaining. I was generally entertained, and I even found myself laughing a lot, and I didn't like that either. I wanted to be scared and wondering what was going to happen. An interesting story simply turned into mindless violence with a poor reason.Overall, 'Cabin in The Woods' was generally entertaining with wasted potential and a disappointing chain of events in the end. Acting was pathetic, which is expected from a horror movie, but I honestly expected better because I heard so many positives from this movie. I did like how Marty touched upon how he felt like he was in a horror movie and the film touched on the structure of horror movies in general, but the poor structure of this movie was just disappointing. I wanted to enjoy this movie but I did not get what I wanted. 'Cabin in The Woods' gets a WillyT A for Effort. I suggest you rent or borrow this movie and see it at least once, but only once.",4,10,17,29 January 2013
Gladiator," Finally Saw This Movie
","It took a long time but I finally saw Gladiator. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix star in a story I have seen plenty of times in movies. The story is simple. Guy in high power gets betrayed by a jealous brother and falls to the bottom and has to climb back up to gain his vengeance. How many times have I seen this? A lot. How many times does it work really well? A lot. In Gladiator it works really well. Everything from the acting to action worked in this movie.Like I said the plot is basic but it works. I have seen this movie before just with a different setting and characters. Russell Crowe is a general for the Roman Empire, Maximus, and his father who adopted him is dying wants him to take over the empire. Commodus, Phoenix, is the rightful heir to the throne because he is blood related but he takes his brother out of the picture anyway by betraying him and murdering his family. Maximus survives and becomes a Gladiator to get his revenge. I figured out the ending to this movie and most of the key plot points but it was still amazing.Russell Crowe gives an amazing performance in this movie, winning him an Oscar. Crowe has an amazing talent for acting and this was his best performance. Luckily he didn't sing. His best scene is when he finds his family dead. He has an emotional breakdown. Another when Commodus is tempting Maximus to fight and he keeps his composure. Any normal man would have broken down but he kept his cool. Maximus is a very interesting character and a natural leader. I don't know why Joaquin Phoenix's career went down the tubes but he comes through in the clutch in this movie. Commodus is one of the creepiest villains in any movie. He stalks his nephew and wants to sleep with his sister. His jealousy and anger towards Maximus drives his performance. When he is on screen its intense. His emotion escalates rather quickly. Phoenix got nominated for an Oscar and I think he deserved it. The fighting scenes in this movie were top of the line. My favorite being the one with the tigers. I saw the tiger come out and I went nuts. I was pumped and as unrealistic as it was, it was awesome. The Colosseum looked real and amazing. The lack of CGI shows and it makes the movie better. Watching this I pictured the making of the movie and the set. The sands of the Colosseum were probably real and the first section of seating was probably used with extras. The second two had to be CGI for budget common sense but the movie felt real. I watched the director's cut of this movie so it was really long. Honestly I got a little bored and most of the added in scenes I could spot out. There was a lot of filler that didn't need to be in there. I took that into account when thinking back on the movie. The regular version is probably a lot better and cleaned up but the backstory was still interesting. Character relationships are obviously very important and none was creepier than the one with Commodus and his sister. Many times in the movie he tries to kiss his sister. There comes a point where he demands she give birth to his future son. That's messed up. It shows how sick his character is. I understand power hungry but this guy was 110% crazy. Maximus is a great leader and has great relationships with his soldiers. There is the one huge guy and the other black guy he befriends and they are both incredible. Secondary characters like that are important and they do their part.Overall, Gladiator is a masterpiece and I don't know why I waited so long to see it. Hans Zimmer adds an excellent score and captures the emotional part of the movie. Ridley Scott directs this film in the right into the academy awards and he really let his stars shine. Crowe and Phoenix give it their all and help push this movie to get the WillyT Seal of Approval.",8,0,0,30 October 2013
Donnie Darko," A Satsfying Mind Blow
","A while ago I put Donnie Darko away on my Netflix to do list and before That was a long time ago and after seeing it I had no idea how to review it. I took a day or two to think about the ending and even went to the internet to see what actually happened and after I read a few things I decided I needed to see it again. I was fixed in this world and when I went to watch it again it was gone. I waited a few months and bought the director's cut on blu ray and I watched it again and the second time was so much more satisfying than the first.The story behind Donnie Darko is complicated to say the least. We follow Donnie, a troubled high scholar who just wants to be normal. It is hard to be normal when he is on psychotic medication and he hallucinates about a bunny rabbit named Frank telling him to do things in his sleep. Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, and Drew Barrymore each have their own short story lines that tie into the main plot so perfectly. The writing in this movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Personally, the idea of time travel is so interesting and the idea of a tangent universe was new to me and I was hooked immediately. After seeing this movie I wanted to write something like it and it inspired me to say the least. Each character did such an amazing job with the strangeness of Barrymore and the odd feeling with Swayze. Their individual stories are almost as good as the main one following Donnie and his love interest. Gyllenhaal delivers in this movie as Donnie. He is troubled and another strong interest of mine if psychology and the mind. Donnie is incredibly gifted, smart, and opinionated. His story is so vague enough to keep the audience interested in the story as well as crept out. Frank was a scary character with a strong voice and seeing the bubble trail thing was unexpected. Noah Wile and Drew Barrymore are the only two teachers Donnie connects with in the entire school and their relationships are remarkable. With Barrymore especially, Donnie connects with her and her teaching style. Her role is never fully clear but she is effective. Maybe if I go back and watch it I will notice something else. That is the thing with this movie which is very rare, it gets better and better the more your watch it over and over. Noah Wile is a science teacher of some sort and after Frank mentions time travel Donnie goes to him for answers and every scene with Wile and Darko are together, my mind was blown and I was so interested. The conversations about wormholes and tangent universes and whatnot were so fascinating and it only works in a movie. The main relationship is between Donnie and Gretchen. Their relationship is so weird and cute at the same time. From the introduction of Gretchen she had a strong connection with Donnie and their relationship builds slowly and unexpectedly. Donnie has so much going on and as his methods of picking up girls are far-fetched and unrealistic but it was good enough for me. I still can't figure out what Gretchen saw in Donnie, you know because he is crazy, but I think she related to him and that was fine for me. Their relationship was unrealistic but for the universe the movie takes place in I bought it. Their ending was, in my opinion, controversial so let's get into it.I want to spoil this ending so bad and dive deep into my own thoughts but I really shouldn't. The entire movie builds up to one date, October 30, 1988. The movie is broken up into chapters and as the date approaches the scenes get more intense. It is supposed to be the end of the world and Donnie is afraid of the date and anticipating it. The beginning of this movie is slow and confusing but it picks up quickly. The beginning may be the one flaw but it has that one scene to keep it alive to keep the audience invested in the rest. Most of the questions are answered with more questions but the answers we get are so satisfying and the ending is outstanding. The star of this movie is the writing and the ending saved this movie from disaster and I still think about it every now and then. I am still trying to wrap my head around it because it left an impact. Out of all the confusing movies with a big ending this was one of the best. I felt so lost for the entire movie it was hard to stay invested but there was always that one scene to draw me back in and the ending was the icing on the cake. A total mind blow, especially the last shot. It was sort of an Inception shot at the way end with the topOverall, Donnie Darko has a cult following of a fan base so consider me a member. The clever writing kept me thinking and the ending was shocking and amazing. This movie is probably one of my favorites ever. Probably in my top 20 of all time. I noticed so many little things like in the beginning the first shot with Donnie's mother, she is reading IT by Stephen King and I took that as a sign. Spencer from iCarley and Seth Rogan are also in the movie very briefly but of course I notice that. Even the lyrics of the sings tied into the scenes perfectly and when Mad World came on at the end I lost it. Need I even say it, WillyT Seal Approval.",10,0,2,31 July 2013
Jurassic Park," Rip Roaring Adventure with Brilliant Science
","Hold onto your butts, this is the review of the epic battle we see all the time of Science vs. Nature. In 1993 Steven Spielberg blew the world away with groundbreaking CGI dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Jurassic has intense moments with unforgettable characters and lines that are quoted time and time again. The basic premise is that a millionaire wants to open a theme park that features scientifically engineered dinosaurs, but before he can open it he needs to make sure it is safe so he brings a team to the island and it all goes to hell when the dinosaurs escape and run wild all over the park. This highly entertaining film is considered a classic and is up there in one of my favorites.I say a few things a lot when it comes to movies. 'Music makes the movie.' And 'The first few scenes are curtail.' If a movie an do that than its on a good start to getting the Seal of Approval. Jurassic Park didn't disappoint as the very first scene is a quick incident at the park involving the raptors but more on them later. It then kind of slows down with a lot of explanation but if you listen to the conversations then you should be sucked right in. The music is absolutely fantastic as well. Everybody knows the Jurassic Park theme and the very first shot of the island the theme kicks in and you know it's about to get real and the movie starts to get good. Then it gets even better. The very first shot of any dinosaur is the Brontosaurus and it looks fantastic. It looks beyond real and they shot on site. It's the same with all the dinosaurs; they look amazing and are still some of the best special effects I have ever seen to date. Now let's get into characters. Jurassic Park was originally a book written by my favorite author Michael Crichton, God rest his soul, so he already created the characters so the actors just had to play it properly. Ian Malcolm is one of my favorite characters ever. His wit and brilliance fit in perfectly and Jeff Goldblum plays him. He delivers memorable lines. 'Ah, life will find a way. God creates dinosaurs, God destroys dinosaurs, God creates man, Man creates dinosaurs, Man destroys God.' Malcolm has trouble speaking, literally, and I love everything about this character. Everything he says doesn't sound like it could happen but he is the only one with any sense. My favorite scene is when everybody is eating lunch discussing the park.This scene is just great conversation and is the reality of the situation. Sam Neil plays Dr. Allen Grant, the main character and hero and in this scene he says it best. I love remembering lines but I can't remember word for word, but basically he says that dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years and how can anybody know what to expect now that they are back in another time period. Personally everything scientific about this movie is fascinating and makes it that much better. When I was younger I found it boring and only wanted to see dinosaurs eat people but with a more mature look at the move I see the brilliance and wonder of Spielberg and Crichton.I read the book Jurassic Park and I loved it for what it was. Seeing it on the big screen was a lot different from the book. There were characters in the book that were a lot more important. The man who gives Newman the can to get the embryos off the island, Dogson, is so much more important in the books and the movie doesn't do him justice. One could make an argument for Muldoon but think his character was well represented even though he played a bigger role in the book. Also Dr. Wu is a significant side character and he is only in one scene and his name is only mentioned. Then there are the Compys which are the scavengers of the dinosaur world and they aren't even in the movie at all. Things like this really bugged me until I saw the credits the other day and found out that Crichton wrote the screen play or was involved with the writing so he chose what to cut out, so I was OK with it. At least he gave a lot of focus on the raptors in the movie. If you ask any kid before 1993 what their favorite dinosaur is, they are going to say the T-Rex. If you ask any kid in the 90s or maybe any kid today they will say the raptor. These things were so intelligent and fast, the perfect hunter. They establish themselves as the elite villain in the movie and everybody is afraid of them. If you say you didn't jump when the raptor scared Ellie in the basement thing, then you're just lying to yourself. Another great scene is early on when Dr. Grant scares the life out of the little kid about how the raptor feeds. The look on his face was priceless. After seeing this movie raptors are easily my favorite dinosaur because they are intense and they get approved.Overall, Jurassic Park is an amazing movie with special effects that still hold up today. The visuals look even better than most CGI movies we see today. For incredible characters, unforgettable dialogue, intense action sequences, a high re-watch value, and just because it has dinosaurs in general Jurassic Park gets the WillyT seal of approval. If you haven't seen this movie yet then I have nothing to say to you other than you haven't lived. See this movie, It is a great time alone or with friends. Let's be honest, nothing looks cooler than the T-Rex tearing through the electric fence. WillyT out!",8,0,1,15 April 2013
The Fighter," At Least it Wasn't A Comedy
","Thank God, Mark Wahlberg isn't trying to make me laugh; he did what he does best. The Fighter, based on a true story about these two boxer brothers from Lowell Massachusetts who struggle in the business of boxing. Mickey, Wahlberg is the younger boxer who is trying to make it big time and be like his older brother Dickey. Dickey, Christian Bale, is well past his prime and is a crack head. He has been in and out of jail and is tagged The Pride of Lowell. Dickey and his parents are the managers of Mickey. Mickey lives in his brother's shadow and he wants to be different. He struggles with his family, his career, his new girlfriend, and himself. Wahlberg did a great job acting in this movie. He knows how to act and he exceeded my expectations after some of the movies he did previously. His character is complex and sometimes the audience agrees with him, and sometimes he can be a bit selfish. He struggles with potential for greatness and loyalty to his family. Christian Bale stole the show however with his acting as the drug abuser and troubled older brother. I had no idea that the man who played Batman could take on a role like this. He blew me away with his performance. His character was a has-been whose career highlight was knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard. He is hogging the spotlight so to speak and that causes problems between him and his brother. At times I thought the story was slow and a little boring. Not much happened. It reminded me a lot of Rocky but more fighting. I would have liked to see more action but there were a lot of emotional scenes with important characters which I did like a lot. Sometimes I was a bit confused with the story and I wasn't sure what the point was or where the story was going. I even felt like how Mickey felt. Was the story more about Mickey or Dickey? Whose story was it? Who was the major focus on? I understand it could have been both but one needed to be the primary and another needed to be a secondary. They both tried to b e the primary and it confused the story. Mickey wants to be a successful fighter while Dickey is making a documentary about him and trying to make a comeback, but ends up in prison. There seemed to be too much going on with too many characters. Overall it was a good movie, it wasn't great but it wasn't awful. I heard it was fantastic before I saw it but it was not as good as I expected. Parts were really good, others were not. The fighting itself looked a lot better. It looked like blows were actually hitting and the punches sounded real. Actors had to do a lot of preparation for specific roles and the audience needs to appreciate that. Christian Bale definitely gets the WillyT seal of approval but the movie itself does not. It is a movie I'm glad I saw but I probably will not see it again. You can casually watch it, meaning you can do something on the internet or have distractions while it's on. Watch it with friends or alone, it doesn't really matter because you will get the same experience. The fact that it was based on a true story was cool and I did enjoy that the actually brothers were shown at the end credits.",6,1,2,2 September 2012
