The Avengers," Best Film Of 2012
","I am a huge fan of the previous Marvel films such as Thor, Captain America and my favourite of all Iron Man, but this film took it to a whole new level. There is nothing wrong about this film, the casting is perfect, the script is perfect, the film is just perfection. I went to see the film with my family and my mum isn't a huge fan of superhero film's but after watching this film she wanted to re-watch the other Marvel films as she loved this film so much, which goes to show the brilliant cast, director and writers have gone above and beyond to produce the perfect superhero films that even gets people who don't usual enjoy them into becoming a lover of the films. One of my favourite things about the film is the tension between the heroes at first and the bonds they end up having at the end of the film Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) develops a great bro-romance with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Hands down the best film I have seen in 2012, and best superhero film EVER, I'd love to see how they top this film as the expectations are running high. This film is lacking nothing, if you haven't seen it then you need to watch this film ASAP.",Null,3,7,3 September 2012
