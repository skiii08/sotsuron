The Avengers," super-powered self-indulgence
","When I was 10 years old, my brother and I discovered the world of Comic Books - adamantium claws, mutant chromosomes, capes, tights, unique abilities that we imagined what we would do, if only we possessed them. How great it would be if we didn't have to visualize these heroes in our minds, but watch them in a live-action movie?With this movie, the dreams of geeks and nerds have been fulfilled in some sick and twisted yet wonderful manner, like the wet fantasies of normal people but magnified by the Nth power. It feels almost wrong to see Iron Man argue with Captain America, each capturing the essence of who they are supposed to be, in the flesh. How wonderful it is.Once you get past the awesome visual reality that is the Avengers, assembled, it's a delightful pleasure that the director or the screenwriters implemented several 'laugh out loud' moments that were seamlessly woven into the flow of this movie. The Hulk, in particular, provides at least a couple of comic moments that had everyone in the theater roaring. It's not that we don't take this stuff seriously - we really do. It's great entertainment, and the box office results prove this. Yet, lest we forget, there is a bit of ridiculousness in this mish mash of a giant green monster, a man in red and blue tights, a modern-day bow and arrow archer, and so forth - and why confine entertainment to being one-dimensional spectacle and visual effects when you can select and choose from a true arsenal of gifts.",9,2,6,12 May 2012
Sleepy Hollow," Headless? Yes. Brainless? No.
","I first saw this movie back in my high school days, and watched it for the third time recently. It was every bit as wonderful now as it was then.I think this movie is escapism in its purest form. For those of us who love the idea of atmospheric, mysterious, dangerous and thrilling places, it's pure joy to look upon Sleepy Hollow - dark, Gothic and very real. So much of this movie is the look and feel of this world and its characters. When you see the headless horseman on his horse, riding in the dark night with the wind blowing wildly, it is visual ecstasy.The music, composed by Danny Elfman, is fantastical and reinforces the magical quality of Sleepy Hollow. His score is a wonderful, pulsating accompaniment that energizes the action and mystifies character scenes.I love this movie for what it is, and I am grateful that there are movie makers who love to create what seems outlandish and unrealistic to skeptics.",10,0,0,16 June 2012
Cold Mountain," not quite great
","The book Cold Mountain is a near-perfect example of what people mean when they say that certain books are extremely difficult to effectively transform into a movie. It seems as if certain scenes or plot elements were thrown into the movie purely out of obligation to remain (somewhat)faithful to the book. And even when some scenes were adapted fairly smoothly the literary elements such as irony did not really add anything to the movie [***SPOILER***: i'm referring to the scene in which Natalie Portman's baby is covered up by a soldier who has compassion for the child, and then the same soldier is subsequently shot in the back by Jude Law although Law's character could have allowed him to escape.]Also I agree with other comments saying that Jude Law and Nicole Kidman had only so-so chemistry. It seemed to me that Mr. Law and Natalie Portman had much more natural energy in their scenes than did the former pair. In general the acting performances well all quite adequate, but not spectacular- except perhaps Renee Zelwegger, whose down-and-dirty character is about as far from her celebrity image as can be, but her character had the effect of being distracting in an almost sideshow-like manner. Overall however the movie did have a number of strong points. The period atmosphere was done fairly well. The musical score was quite good, although I would have preferred if they didn't attempt to replicate the sounds of the locale+time period and stuck to the gentle piano medley backed by occasional orchestral strings (the heart of the movie was the romance, after all). As far as being a true movie experience the film did very well so if you're into period pieces with epic scopes go ahead and rent or buy this movie. In the end, however, although I liked this film I keep thinking about how much better it could have been.",Null,0,0,19 May 2004
Sin City," style over substance
","Bang. Boom. Blam.There you have a fine plot summary of this grossly overrated movie. If I were a teen, perhaps I wouldn't have minded watching scene after scene of testosterone-driven characters (including, seemingly, the females) spewing out line after line of instantly forgettable dialogue; however, since I much prefer movies that have interesting plots, I feel obligated to warn those expecting a lot from this movie because of it's high IMDb rating (8.4)to keep their eyes open and their ears closed.As the movie 'Sin City' is a comic book adaptation, the director and his team chose to infuse the movie's cinematography with a heavy comic book feel-- the use of black and white color contrast and Gothic lighting is particularly effective, in this respect. And not only does the movie look like a comic book, but it moves like one as well; the tempo is brisk, and the lead characters are constantly on the go. Yet none of it's dynamic imagery and pacing compensates fully for the bland one-dimensionality of the lead characters. In the Spider-man movies, the viewer likes and cares for Peter Parker, who possesses, at the same time, superhuman powers and a nice guy personality. It's easy to empathize with Parker, who is shy and insecure but possesses the potential to accomplish so much more. By contrast, the lead characters in Sin City seem cynical and somewhat stoic, even as they scramble frantically across the city and its outskirts to accomplish various tasks.",4,13,26,26 September 2005
