Saturday Night Fever," WOULD YOU JUST WATCH THE HAIIIR??!!
","SNF revolutionized disco and the style it brought. It also established Travolta as a star. SNF is indeed a wonderful film. Although it features gritty realism of young-man life in Brooklyn, it's true stuff. Travolta excels as the troubled Tony Manero, a 19-year old who works at a paint store in the day to party at the local disco at night (and he still lives with his parents). He is flocked by the women and nearly idolized by Annette. Then he meets Stephanie, who truly opens his eyes at life. After dancing with her in the big contest, Tony realizes that his cliched life is bringing him nowhere and he vows to change it. Travolta makes his character so deep you almost believe it's real. In general, the movie is a wonderful classic and it should be included in every moviegoer's collection. AAAAAAAAAL PACINO!!",Null,0,0,23 October 2002
Catch Me If You Can," NOT BAD
",Totally entertaining film (one of the better of the year) featuring amazing performances from all involved (including Walken). Every event moves at a good pace and the film never bores. I was quite shocked to see Brolin in a mainstream film for a change as well! 9/10,Null,0,1,20 January 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," WONDERFUL
","Possibly the greatest film ever made. One of the most moving and uplifting ones, too. I seen this movie in theaters in 1982 and I absolutely remember every moment of it. The overall look and feel of it is just so rich and refreshing and the performances are outstanding from all, especially Drew Barrymore. Spielberg is indeed the master of filmmaking. 10/10",Null,0,1,13 December 2002
The Thing," POOR BABY, YOU'RE STARTING TO LOSE IT, ARE YA???
","JOHN CARPENTER'S The Thing is my favorite movie ever. Hands down. John Carpenter's usually awesome direction is present and Kurt Russell delivers such a strong performance as MacReady, you almost assume the character is REAL. Many people have claimed the film is too heavy on effects and the storyline is totally absurd (if an intruder took over your body and soul, what would it matter?? You would practically be the same person...) I don't know about you, but me and MacReady want our individuality. It's a movie, folks...Movies are meant to entertain. And that is exactly what The Thing does. Fabulous fast-paced script by Bill Lancaster and outstanding performances all-around, especially from Russell, Clennon, and Brimley. The film professionally features suspense, horror, and even bits of humor (Russell's macho attitude features humor in it all-around) in it, showing us all that the filmmakers and actors were indeed all well-trained. Rob Bottin deserves a special award for his breathtaking effects and Ennio Morricone's score is absolutely eerie (overtones of Carpenter's scores are heard here, or i believe Carpenter uses overtones of Morricone). Overall, the film is a perfect 10 and you need to watch it on DVD. And remember: Man is the Warmest Place to Hide...",10,0,1,22 October 2002
The Shining," HOW'D YOU LIKE SOME ICE CREAM, DOC?
","THE SHINING is one of the creepiest horror films ever made. Though somewhat drawn out (made with near-perfection by perfectionist Kubrick), the film has eerie, atmospheric moments and great acting (though Duvall tends to hit a few of my nerves). Terrifying story of a legendary resort hotel that holds the spirits of its past in its present, and the family that caretakes it while it shuts down for the winter. This is one of my favorite Nicholson roles.",Null,0,0,22 November 2002
Rocky," THERE AIN'T GONNA BE NO REMATCH! DON'T WANT ONE...
","A winner by all means, this movie still bring tears to my eyes as Stallone so wonderfully portrays a down-on-his-luck boxer who gets a chance at the big time with champion Weathers, even if it means just proving to himself that he went the distance with him. Shire, Young, and Meredith provide real, heartfelt performances. The finale always puts a smile to my face and a tear to my eye.",Null,3,6,22 November 2002
Psycho," SHE WOULDN'T HARM A FLY...
","Clearly, the best horror film ever made. I have never seen a movie with so many tricks and surprises pulled off in a successful manner. I was so involved with Janet Leigh's character when I first watched this film. Yet I knew she was doing something wrong. Suddenly when her final destination is at hand, I was purely surprised. Then suddenly, I'm pulled into the world of a hermit-like motel owner who cares for his invalid mother. I see no mistakes or bad moves in this film, and the performances are excellent. 10/10",10,1,1,20 December 2002
Halloween," THE EVIL IS OUT!
","In 1978, John carpenter co-wrote and directed a film so terrifying, so eerie, and now, nearly 25 years later, it is one of the most classic films of all time. It is a horror movie, there is no doubt about that. Yet, it is so well-made, there is no pointless gore, and only $300,000 was spent on it!! Jamie Lee is splendid in her first film as the terrorized heroine Laurie Strode. Donald is wonderful as the doctor of the escaped Michael Myers. Nancy Loomis, PJ Soles, Charles Cyphers, and the rest of the cast provide good support. Carpenter's scary music and Dean Cundey's spooky, dark cinematography are also an added highlight to a film that should be owned by all film collectors. 10/10",10,0,0,24 October 2002
Carrie," THEY'RE ALL GONNA LAUGH AT YOU!
","CARRIE is one of the better Stephen King adaptations, fueled by dazzling performances from Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Brian DePalma (before his endless streak of big-budget productions) has managed to let us know the characters and each and everyone's motives before the suspense begins. In a weird way, the film isn't entirely 'horror' perse. We utterly care for Carrie; she does nothing wrong, she's just a reserved girl (sure, she has telekenesis, but it's not her fault) who is bound by her mother into a strict religious lifestyle. Her tormentors are utterly disgusting, we do not like them. So when the revenge hits, it's in a strange way because we care for the so-called bad guy. Nonetheless, CARRIE is a well-made (if somewhat corny) suspense drama. The new DVD is definitely worth purchasing as well.",Null,0,0,3 December 2002
The Deer Hunter," ONE SHOT...
","THE DEER HUNTER is the most powerful movies I have ever viewed. It is heartbreaking, emotional, and intense. Sound a bit overboard?? Well, it's the truth. Featuring wonderful performances by all, concentrated direction, a well-written script, awesome editing and cinematogrpahy, the film leaves you with a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye. The film basically shows us the lives of a small town group of friends, everyday America in a sense. A certain few (De Niro, Savage, and Walken) must leave to defend our nation. They do, face the horror of war, and are forever changed by their experience. De Niro cannot adapt back to his old life after going through what he did. Savage is handicapped and emotionally shattered. Walken is frightened to return home and face change, so he reverts to going AWOL upon the conclusion of the war and living a life as a Russian Roulette player in Saigon. Meryl Streep is totally convinving as the love of Walken's life (and eventually De Niro's). John Cazale is strongly effecting as drunken, immature Stan. Chuck Aspegren (in his only acting role ever) and George Dzundza are also strong (especially Dzundza in the final scene). Totally deserving of the Best Picture Oscar (and Walken's BSA Ocar), THE DEER HUNTER is a film that touches your heart and soul and makes you realize the meaning of friendship and the challenges of accepting change. A winner.",Null,0,0,24 October 2002
