Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You can feel the force again...
",It has been a long time since the first trilogy and when I came out of the cinema I could feel the force again. To be honest the film was more for teenager and kids with the new animated characters. However the battle in the universe of good (the Jedi's) against evil was the main theme of the film. Some very cool scenes which reminded me of games like Dune2000 were nice to watch as part of a film. Highly recommended for parents which want their kids to feel the force of being on the right side... (a must see for Science Fiction fans).,7,0,0,22 July 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Teenager film which is also suitable for audience in the twenties
",Was expecting a teenager film but was surprised by the good acting. Much better film than Cruel Intentions. Can definitely recommend it as a feel-good film where the acting is actually believable.,9,0,0,22 July 1999
