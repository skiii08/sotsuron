Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This movie was the worst!
","My husband and I saw this movie on Saturday night, opening weekend after just seeing Vol. 1 the previous week. This movie was like a root canal. Agonizing and never-ending! Three different times during the movie I asked my husband if we could please leave. This movie DOES NOT hold a candle to Vol. 1 - which was awesome! I tell anyone who hasn't seen it yet to please not waste their time and go and see a good comedy or something. I do not consider myself to be a judgemental person and I enjoy a really good movie and my taste is pretty broad. I tend to love a good action movie, but this movie had NO action. There was one kick-ass fighting scene between Uma and Daryl - and that was it! The whole rest of the movie was talk, talk, talk - it was awful! Please save you money people!",Null,3,6,19 April 2004
