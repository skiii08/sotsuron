Iron Man 3," What did you expect?
","Brilliant special effects and action sequences.Robert DJ did his usual Tony Stark act of ego and arrogance and had enough one liners to make the audience chuckle enough Sir Ben should have had a bigger part but probably wasn't allowed as he'd have stolen Robby DJ's thunder and the movie is called Iron Man...Weak on plot but then so were Iron Man's 1 & 2.Highly entertaining, but if you want a deep and introspective look at modern day society or something vaguely realistic then probably not your cup of tea. If you want action, one liners and you enjoyed Iron Mans 1 and or 2 then buckle in for another arcreactor fueled ride into the stratosphere",7,19,43,26 April 2013
The Lego Movie," Excellent
","I saw the trailer for this film months before it was released and was quivering with anticipation until I saw it on opening night. I was not disappointed. This film exceeded all my expectations.Although obviously aimed at children and acting as a superb marketing gimmick (I wanted to blow the dust off my old Lego sets the moment the film was over) the film held a coherent plot line, excellent cast of voice actors, a clever mix of stop-motion and smooth animation, a great score and enough laughs and adult pitched humour to keep everybody entertained from beginning to end.The creators ability to poke fun at themselves and the Lego universe in which they were operating belied the high level of planning and forethought that had been used to develop this film.I have watched The Lego Movie twice already and know that in a few months it will bear watching a third time.",10,0,2,2 August 2014
Mr. Nobody," Makes you think
","This is a French film in that nothing happens for 2.5 hours but it makes you think. It's filmed in English but the fact that it had a French director probably accounts for the style.The film is ultimately about happenstance, the choices we make and what they could lead too. There are elements in there about string theory, the beginning and end of the universe and therefore quantum mechanics. However rather than occurring at the particular level the events and interactions making up the film and possibilities take place between human beings. Rather than the few outcomes that could possibly occur from the entanglement of electrons or protons at the subatomic level this film deals with the truly infinite outcomes of what might be.There is some mention of life before birth and life after death but this is only touched upon and not explained in any fashion. There are also some scenes which appear to involve time travel, or something similar. I thought these elements didn't add much too the film yet didn't detract from them either. Their presence was mildly confusing or perhaps irritating but probably added just a little bit more of the unknown into the whirling mass of possibilities in life that 'Mr Nobody' attempts to present.I liked this film and will probably watch it again sometime. 8/10",8,8,11,6 July 2014
Hero," Can Chinese people fly?
","I was forced to watch this tripe for a film study paper at university. If you want to watch an 'art' film and pay attention to elements of mise-en-scene then 2 stars might be an unfair rating. However if you want to watch a film with a story or perchance acting then 2 stars could even be generous. I opted for the averageBefore the screening started the lecturer made sure we realised that the director had used as little CGI as possible. Every person seen in the film is a real person, on deployment from the Chinese Army. The glass still lakes are actually glass still and not CGIed, to the extent where a 4 minute scene on one took over 15 days to film as there was only 30minutes to 2hrs of glass stillness per day to film on. Another example is the scene in the forest with yellow leaves. The director used 100s of workers (probably from a local sweatshop) to collect and sort the leaves into different grades of yellow so that it looked perfect for this scene. Lots of Kudos for the director so far.After all this lack of CGI you'd expect a film to the standard of Ghandi. Unfortunately in every fight scene the combatants were able to leap to extraordinary heights and if they ever came close to the ground they only needed a menial action such as a glancing high five to the still glass lake before reascending. Another example is the 5000 real soldiers firing 50 million CGIed arrows at Jet Li and some other woman who then block said millions of arrows with fancy sword work.Thus all the Kudos gained by the director for not using CGI he lost for using CGI. Then he lost more through his film having no element of a plot. And terrible acting throughout. And considering all this it went on too long. Maybe if it was concentrated into a 30minute episode of anime it could appeal to Japanese youth but unfortunately in its current form it is nothing more than cinematic bilge.",2,1,5,10 March 2013
Raging Bull," Sorry everybody but I found Raging Bull dead boring
","Winning 2 Oscars and a placing high on several lists of the greatest films of all time or the decade etc this 2 hour epic was as dull as ditchwater. I know a lot of readers will criticise this opinion and cite the style of direction and raw performance of all players as reasons to love the film. However I was not engaged, didn't relate to the characters and despite usually abhorring people who perpetually play with their phone whilst watching movies spent the second hour catching up on my wiki reading.That de Niro gained 60lbs for the film impressed me yet not enough to like the movie",4,1,12,12 July 2014
