Airlift," Deftly done Film: Airlift
","Finally watched Airlift.... smile emoticon This is Akshay Kumar's best ever.... Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast paced gritting thrills and excitement. The last 20 minutes tell us, why we should feel proud as an Indian. This is a deftly done film, which slide a little in the second half, but never abandons its mission: to tell the story of unsung heroes. Akshay Kumar leads from the front, but shares space when it is needed: Nimrat Kaur, keeps pace with her co-star ; Inaamulhaq as Saddam's man-in-Kuwait, is suitably menacing, Belawadi (George) as the annoying refugee, Kohli is kohl-eyed and restrained and makes us feel for him, Kumud Mishra as the MoEA Babu, disinterested at first, then taking charge, fits right in. Sometimes, being human comes naturally to cinema. That's the moment we need to salute, celebrate and sanctify such movies so that we get to see more unsung heroes on screen. We didn't know Ranjit Katyal. It's Team Airlift has brought this unclaimed hero out of the rubble of history. For your money and time, Some previous movies of Akshay Kumar makes him, the most watchable star in Bollywood today. See Airlift, you will know why. ‪#‎Airlift‬ ‪#‎ProudIndian‬",10,2,3,26 January 2016
