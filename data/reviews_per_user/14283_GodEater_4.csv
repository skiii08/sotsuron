Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Bad Script & Solid Direction = A Good Movie?
","The Phantom Menace is a really good movie but the scripting is...ah...lacking. Lucas is still a good director, he hasn't lost his edge for action sequences but his writing could use some brushing up. His once reknown 'cardboard' characters which were interesting were now gone and discarded. One dimensional people are now no dimension. Good acting from everyone, esp. Portman and Neeson, but little Anakin has as much personality as a pet rock (sorry, kid, I tried hard to like ya!).Darth Maul was good, though, despite only three lines in the film.The editor IS of the Dark-side. I blame the morbidly bad first 45 minutes on his hacking...",7,0,1,20 May 1999
Cross of Iron," Fantastic
",Disturbingly haunting but can anyone tell me what the ending means? Coburn is great as well as Warner's quick appearances. Excellent editing and camera work. Anyone who likes this film should see 'Straw Dogs' & 'If....',9,1,2,28 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," BEHOLD!
","Kubrick is one of the greatest masterminds of film EVER. Heck, he may even be THE greatest (I think so). And anyone that didn't understand or (as I've heard) feel asleep during this, this...thing of brilliance and glory and GOD-LIKE IMPUNITY should be hanged. HANGED! KUBRICK IS THE WAY OF LIFE! HAIL HIM AS YOUR SAVIOR! HAIL! HAIL! HAIL HE WHO HAS DELIEVERED US FROM THE TERROR OF THE DEADITES! HAIL! HAIL!",10,0,1,2 May 2000
The Matrix," Trying too hard to Gibson the Gibson
","This film tries WAY, WAY, too hard to be a William Gibson story. Sure, the SFX kicked butt six-ways-till-Sunday but the story was far too into itself for it's own good. As Fishburn put it in the film: 'Some rules can bend; some rules broken.' If that's so, I think Neo and the gang could've done a bit more stunt work in the film if gravity could be ignored and walking up walls was so easy. Another thing that ticked me off was the constant REPETITIVE slow-motion dolly-shots. All right, so maybe Reeves is faster than any man possible...SHOW IT! Slow motion just makes the audience feel stupid (as they're forced to take in an huge amount of detail, forcing me to nod off in my seat in the middle of the gun fight in the lobby).Gun play in the film was...uh...alright, I guess but the hand-to-hand akido and 'kung-fu' (I KNOW that wasn't Kung-Fu) was excellent (full support to the stunt coordinator, who's name escapes me for now), so a little less on the Mac10s and a little more Mac-Truck punches, please.Direction was alright but the dialogue was a snooze. Over all the film was choking to be a good Johnny Mnemonic (Is that at all possible?) with good SFX and plot. It failed in the latter.",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
