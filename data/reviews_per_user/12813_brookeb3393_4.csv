Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Film Fans Will Adore
","If you're like me, a huge fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and an even bigger fan of Johnny Depp, you are very excited to see the latest installment. I had the honor of seeing On Stranger Tides last night and I am very pleased to say that it met every expectation that I had. The humor was definitely at it's highest point since the first movie. The new characters kept the story fresh and interesting. Although Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are missing from this film, there is no void that they left, and if you love the 'young love' aspect that they brought to the screen, two of the new characters will provide a different romance story that will keep you just as happy.Captain Jack Sparrow is, as always, the star. He shines in this latest movie in every way. He keeps things exciting and steals every scene that he's in. His relationship with Angelica is a great way to see a new side to our beloved character while still keeping his care-free, charming personality we all fell in love with.When I read critic reviews for this film, I was nervous. But fans, fear not. Critics seem to overlook the magic of these movies. If you loved the first three, the new one will be a movie you enjoy.CAPTAIN JACK IS BACK!",10,2,4,20 May 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," I enjoyed it
","I was very excited to see Prince of Persia just because of how great Jake Gyllenhaal looked in it. I honestly didn't know one thing about the movie at all. It turns out I actually really liked it. It was funny, there was romance and plenty of action. Never a dull moment, definitely. I think it will be the big summer movie this year because it wasn't like any other movie out there. If you're a fan of the films that Jerry Bruckheimer produces, chances are you will love this movie. I have to admit though, the group I was with didn't enjoy it. They felt there were too many characters, too many different things going on at once,a tad too long, and they didn't like how it ended. All of these are partially true but I still liked it. I suggest you go see it and find out for yourself! :)",8,6,10,29 May 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Very, Very Pleased.
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have done it again! This movie was one of the best I've seen in a while. Stunning set, beautiful artwork and graphics, memorable characters, fascinating stories. Each actor brought something new and different to their roles and managed to capture the attention of the audience in their own way. Johnny Depp was amazing, as per usual. He played the Mad Hatter wonderfully. Helena Bonham Carter stole the show as the Red Queen, in my opinion. The White Queen, Doormouse, White Rabbit and Cheshire cat were likable and played very well. The 3D made me feel as if I was down the rabbit hole myself. Excitement, comedy, adventure. Tim Burton is a genius! Saw it 3 times already and can't wait to go see it again. Definitely recommend :)",10,6,14,9 March 2010
Dark Shadows," Tim Burton does it again!
","I have been waiting for this movie for a very long time and I am pleased to say that it did not disappoint.I keep seeing reviews that say 'Tim Burton has lost it' or that he's outdated and what not. I would just like to clarify that this is in no way true. The man is brilliant. His creativity in this is magical. Going into the movie, everyone should expect some weirdness, that is Tim's style, which is why this dark vampire movie is perfect for him.Johnny Depp is in his zone as creepy, out-of-place Barnabas Collins. As always, he becomes the character and carries this movie nicely. All in all, Burton/Depp fans will enjoy this movie. Filled with humor, some scares, and a lot of oddness, this is a keeper.",10,13,33,11 May 2012
