The Ring," Not that good
","I don't know why people are so enthralled with this movie, it isn't that good. Before watching it, people told me how there were deeper meanings, it was about rings and circles and all sorts of gibberish. Nope, it's not that complex...-====Spoilers====-The movie is about a demonic child that is mysteriously adopted by a couple that raise horses. It is implied that perhaps they made a pact with the devil. The little girl makes everyone's life a living hell, especially her mothers, finally driving her mother to throw the little girl down a well and seal her in, leaving her to die. The little demonic girl exacts her revenge by leaving 'haunted' images on a video tape, anyone watching the tape will die 7 days later, presumably because that is how long the girl lived inside the well. Naturally there is a way to save yourself, but I won't tell how. The ending is way too long and you are left watching the clock wondering how much longer this movie is going to drag on.The movie overall isn't bad and I think it is the general lack of quality horror movies that makes people believe this one is so good. It is worth watching, just don't take it too seriously.",5,0,0,29 December 2002
Star Trek," Trek-ish but not Trek.
","Back from Star Trek. Interesting reboot. All the exciting stuff is in the trailers. It is pretty good space opera, not the best Trek movie, not even really Star Trek but Trekish, too much humor interrupts the suspense, some of the characters and events are cheesy, a few too many plot holes. Leonard Nimoy is ancient. Zachary Quinto did extremely well. Chris Pine is likable but lacks Shatner's charisma. Karl Urban, as expected, can't act. Eric Bana is terrific but is under so much make-up he looks like Joan Rivers. Bruce Greenwood and Zoe Saldana are also terrific. Simon Pegg flops, horribly. Anton Yelchin who plays Chekov was a welcome surprise, not only was the character improved over the original but the acting as well. John Cho was alright but a little too happy go lucky as Sulu. I didn't even recognize Winona Ryder. Thankfully they didn't destroy the Enterprise which has become the second most tired plot device after time travel in Trek movies.",4,5,8,16 May 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of the Remake!
","I watched the original Dawn of the Dead then trotted off to watch the remake and I must say the new version is better than expected. The movie is... tense, not quite scary; but I've seen hundreds of horror movies and I don't think I've been 'scared' since I was eleven years old. A moviegoer in the row behind me was trembling so hard he shook both rows of seats, eliciting comments from a number of others in the theater.Many have compared the opening sequences of the two movies, Dawn1's opening with a chaotic news show is the more disturbing of the two, Dawn2's opening is consistent with modern horror and is above average for the genre. Both movies remain consistent to the themes established in the opening sequences, Dawn1 is slower, has more substance and shock value; Dawn2 is fast paced and goes for the throat. The pace of Dawn2 continues to quicken until the end when it becomes a struggle to comprehend the staccoto of images hammering at your brain. I am still not sure how several events exactly happened, particularly the 'rescue' and the 'escape', only that they did happen.Several things were distracting in Dawn2, even annoying: The primal cat screams of the zombies for one. I found myself wincing just from the volume of the screaches and my dread of the zombies was more rooted in the sounds they made than their viciousness, which was also distracting. There is no doubt that in real life, the zombies of Dawn2 would be scarier and deadlier. Romero's zombies were a force of nature, chaotic and opportunistic; you could survive if you were quick enough and smart enough. Snyder's zombies are so vicious and fast, it is difficult to imagine surviving on wits and certainly not on speed, maybe with a tank. The one burr that really bucked my horse was the infection angle which seems directly lifted from 28 Days Later. All dead people came to life in the original (except maybe those with brain damage?), but in the remake zombification is spread via bites like rabies. If the zombies are infected with some disease, it makes the tagline, 'When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' seem superfluous.It is easy to nitpick, few movies survive close scrutiny. Overall the people in Dawn2 act within the normal range of human behavior, sometimes smart, sometimes stupid. There is the requisite moment when your mind is screaming 'DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR!', but if you've driven on a freeway you understand that people are sometimes inexplicably dumb. Darwin Rules!I would give it a 7/10 overall, 9/10 for the genre. The remake is a visceral experience. I highly recommend you go experience it.",9,0,0,22 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Low point of a excellent series.
","I am a big fan of the first two movies but the third is just a mess. The characters have been neutered, except for Elizabeth and the plot never really seems to know where it's going or even what it's doing in the present. Instead of high adventure we get a story that plays out like the actors all got together and wrote it by committee. The movie does have it's high points, most of which revolve around Jack Sparrow but unfortunately, Depp is lost in the maelstrom of the plot. The ending is silly and in my mind, Lord Beckett's behavior is contrary to his nature. If they do make a fourth film, hopefully they keep Jack and Barbosa and drop most of the rest.",6,1,2,10 February 2008
Resident Evil: Extinction," Lesser than the first but much improved over the second.
","Milla is back, and thanks to tight wife-beaters and airbrushing, is cuter than ever. Fans of the game hate these movies along with everyone else who has good taste but I don't have good taste and I'm not a fan of the video games so I could care less and I loved the first Resident Evil. The second was vile with a poor plot and terrible direction, jumping from action scene to action scene with little thought given to plot or character development. The third I'm happy to say is a significant improvement and nearly as entertaining as the first. I do wish that Alice had died just so we could stop the Alice is super weapon silliness that started in Apocalypse. What I would really like to see is a RE zombie movie about surviving the zombies and not about ten kinds of other foolishness like clones, satellites, and mutating bad guys. I mean what was the point of introducing the plot line of trekking to Alaska when everyone dies two minutes later and the idea is moot, unless they were planting the idea for a sequel.Ali Larter is also cute in the movie and does a good job as Claire Redfield. She played a good balance of leader and bad ass without coming off as bitchy like Sienna Guillory did playing Jill Valentine. Of course I haven't played the game so maybe Jill V is a bitch, I don't know. I won't go into the 'controversy' about whether Ali looks like the video game character because I think that's silly. What I will go into is that Ali seemed like a random addition to the movie, almost tacked on as an after thought. Her character certainly wasn't needed and didn't play any significant part in the plot. Again, I can only guess that maybe she was introduced with the hope she might play in a sequel.If you are a hardcore Milla fan or liked the first or second Resident Evil then give this one a go, you might enjoy it. If you hated the first two then I don't see anything here for you.",6,0,1,10 February 2008
Blade II," A predictable story but what action...
","A fairly predictable almost love story where a man (or vampire) comes face to face with what he is. At least that is the what the plot wants to be... but we don't see movies like this for the plot, do we. We see them for the action.Nearly every action hero has a weakness or a weak moment where they must face their inner demons; a point where their convictions flag -- not in Blade. Wesley Snipes delivers to us a hero that never questions himself; a hero that relentlessly pursues his enemy, takes the battle to them on their turf and wipes the floor with them. While watching this movie you will believe that Blade is the baddest of them all.",7,0,1,24 April 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," Not as good as the second.
",The series continues to deviate far and wide of the books but I don't it's a bad thing when the movies are this good. The middle movie is still my favorite but this one would be a close second. The camera seemed a little tighter on this one or maybe I am just noticing it more; for my tastes the tight camera and quick cuts are getting ridiculous and I still feel like it's to compensate for lazy choreography but it didn't detract too much from the fight scenes. Ultimatum picks up where Supremacy left off and leaves one important loose thread that makes a nice setup for yet another sequel. A nagging suspicion I've had about Nicky since the first film is confirmed. The ending is far fetched. I loved the books though and I love the films.,8,1,2,10 February 2008
28 Weeks Later," A total contrivance...
","I finally got around to watching this and I think it was built up too much in my head before I went to see it because I couldn't help but be disappointed. The movie is a contrivance and relies on fairly intelligent, career minded people doing really dumb and career ending things. In the real world, people are mostly cogs in the machine and keep their personal welfare and career in mind before taking an action that could end the first and certainly end the second. The kids I can understand as kids are ultimately selfish, adventurous and often don't recognize danger to themselves.I won't even go into all the military goofs as they are well documented on IMDb. But don't for one second expect me to believe the US military is repopulating Great Britain without a civilian administrative overwatch, most likely composed of members of the British government (they have emergency contingencies for government officials just like the US does) and US bureaucrats. It's also certain that British troops would be in command and only augmented by NATO troops. Even if every soldier on the island was killed (unlikely), Britain doesn't keep all of it's military at home. There would still be the Royal Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines abroad that would be recalled and put in charge of the homeland. The military aren't really made out to be the bad guys but it's certainly an easy conclusion and many people have made it. The military executes political decisions, they wouldn't have decided to repopulate the island, wouldn't have decided to allow children, wouldn't have been the ones to create a Code Red solution and wouldn't be the ones to make the decision to execute Code Red unless no civilian authorization was possible. All in all, while the movie didn't make the military the villains, it didn't exactly paint a nice picture of them.Speaking of Code Red... all contagious diseases spread quickest when people are in confined spaces. Emergency plans for small pox outbreaks, and whatnot, do not crowd everyone into a single building, they rely on keeping people at home. The civilians all lived in condos, the best, best possible thing you could do would be to send them to their apartments and have them lock the door. Those buildings could essentially be fortresses. Then the entrance could be defended and the military would have time to hunt down and exterminate the infected which would only number a few because people wouldn't be out roaming in masses. If an infected got inside the building, the number of victims would be very small and again the military could patrol the hallways and shoot down any infected.",4,9,18,10 June 2007
Disturbia," Cliché and formulaic thriller
","Kale was a very unlikeable main character who basically becomes a delinquent after his dad is killed in a car wreck. I've read excuses about how it's tough when a parent dies, well not to put too fine a point on it but everyone's parents die and this movie takes place a year later. There is no excuse for Kale's behavior. We get a glimpse of why Kale might be acting out so flagrantly as his mother only shows up when he gets in trouble. But suddenly Kale goes from rebellious knothead to first rate guy when a nice piece of tail moves in next door and Kale gets to spend his time ogling her tail (and so do we) as she does aerobics, swims and reads. The piece of tail, played by Sarah Roemer, inevitably falls for Kale, the badboy next door. We can only presume she likes being watched. Eventually Kale begins to believe his other neighbor is a serial killer and you can, and will, guess where it goes from there.Shia LaBeouf plays the same character as in Transformers. Sarah Roemer plays the same character as Megan Fox in Transformers. David Morse plays as David Morse. Carrie Ann Moss sleepwalks through her minor role.",5,1,3,22 September 2007
Evil Dead," Everything a good factory made horror film can be.
","Evil Dead has plentiful practical effects, a setting faithful to the original, and a halfway decent lead actress but completely fails on story and sound. I liken it to a TV dinner; corn, mash potatoes, and Salisbury steak with gravy... lots of gravy. Because even though the mash potatoes taste like Elmer's paste, splash some gravy on there and suddenly they go down fine. Maybe spoon that corn into your potatoes and mix it up, take a bite of Salisbury steak with potatoes and it's dandy; if you have plenty of gravy. Evil Dead has no gravy and by gravy I mean sound. The gravy ties the dinner together so even if the corn or potatoes are lacking, you don't mind as much. Sound (or silence) sets the mood and creates ambiance and is arguably the most important ingredient. Here they play generic music mixed with random noises and the dry instant potatoes just sit in your mouth waiting to be washed down. To summarize the movie: Character acts unreasonably stupid to set up gross out scene. Excellent disgusting effects ensue. Character waits until effects are finished then impotently reacts. Repeat ad nauseam. I hate this type of bad horror film more than any other because the filmmakers had resources, had talent available, and they chose to make a mediocre movie. If you programmed a robot to make a horror film, Evil Dead 2013 is what you would get.",4,3,5,15 October 2013
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Daniel Radcliffe front and center
","Another new director to the series, David Yates, takes the helm for this iteration of Potter. Less stylistically flared than it's predecessors, Phoenix is more even in tone. The visual richness of Hogwarts is lacking as all takes a backseat to Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are pushed farther from center stage and the spotlight narrows on Harry Potter. Some of which is worked into the plot and it may be the books work the same, I've only read the first so I can't say. Potter is once again in trouble for using magic outside the school only this time the consequences are more severe and he is expelled from Hogwarts. Overall, I think this may be my favorite of the series, perhaps because it is the least kiddish.",8,0,3,10 February 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Not up to snuff with the Evil Dead series but a good film
","Just got back and I love Raimi's dark sense of humor, I laughed all the way through the film. Even when people around me were jumping or cringing I was giggling, except during some of the gross out stuff. The boo scares were too predictable to be scary and the sounds were very bright, painful at times like the sound of a dentist's drill, there was no bass to speak of in my viewing. Very well constructed, well shot. Lohman's acting was the film's weakness, she couldn't sell it. I kept thinking Rachel Miner would have been better, same face, same qualities, better actress. Justin Long (stereotypically) was underused. Lorna Raver was perfectly cast. Dileep Rao was interesting although the role wasn't stretching his abilities. Highly recommended to horror fans and especially Raimi fans.",7,1,4,29 May 2009
All Quiet on the Western Front," A realistic portrayal of the horrors of war from a soldiers perspective
","My all time favorite war (or anti-war) book. It has been some years since I read the book and there are some details I believe are missing from the movie but that is common enough and certainly doesn't hamper the anti-war message of the film. All Quiet on the Western Front won four Oscars in 1930 and it's no less brilliant or relevant today. In many ways I believe it could be considered the grand-daddy of war movies and many of its elements will be familiar to fans of the genre. Modern war classics such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon have nothing on All Quiet on the Western Front which is a brutal and shocking film despite the lack of explicit gore. The first scenes of trench warfare are as violent and terrifying as the Omaha Beach scene in Saving Private Ryan. Director Lewis Milestone shows us the despair and and the fear that at times overwhelm the soldiers. When new recruit Paul Baumer cries and hides his face in shame during his first bombardment, veteran soldier, Corporal 'Kat' Katczinsky grabs him and tells him it's happened to better men and it's happened to him (Kat). After returning from their first mission, the chow sergeant won't feed the men until the rest of the company shows up. Upon learning there are no more men, the chow sergeant is angry he cooked for 150 men but only 80 showed up to eat. Hunger is their constant companion and what little food they can scavenge must be protected from gangs of rats that patrol the trenches. Wounded soldiers seem to have little more chance at the hospital than they do on the battlefield.After being injured and earning a bit of leave, Paul goes home and faces the pro-war sentiment of his town who have no idea of the horror of war. Paul discovers that he is a stranger there, that he can no longer relate to people he's known all his life and it's impossible to explain his experiences to them. So Paul does the only thing he can do, he goes back to the front lines, to the only place where people understand.",8,3,5,10 February 2008
Ice Age," Much better than the reviews would lead you to believe...
","Three misfit animals, mammoth, sloth & sabertooth tiger; decide to return a man baby to his oddly all male tribe. The mammoth and sloth have a relationship that will be familiar to fans of Shrek. The sabertooth joins the quest for his own stionable] reasons.Most of the reviews were very poor. The primary complaint being a lack of coherent storyline. Look, if you can't follow the storyline here then you shouldn't operate toasters without supervision. It's a kid's movie, not quite as deep as Shrek and not as funny, but it's a good way to spend an hour and a half.",6,0,0,18 March 2002
Scream," The little parody that could.
","I recently watched this again for the first time since it hit theaters. Scream has been parodied and copied so many times the film itself is now a cliché but that doesn't change the brilliance of the original. In some ways Scream is an end cap to the modern slasher sub-genre beginning with Halloween on one end and culminating in Scream. Sure, there have been a number of slashers since but the genre hasn't dominated horror as they did in the two decades following Halloween. Scream isn't terribly original but by capitalizing on that it serves to masterfully sum up the genre and two decades of films before it. Wes Craven, where are you now? Deliver us from Eli Roth and Uwe Boll!",7,8,8,10 February 2008
