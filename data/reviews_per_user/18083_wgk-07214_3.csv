Blade Runner 2049," I am not convinced
",Mainly because I fell asleep. Why is this film so boring? I mean aside from a menage a trois scene where the girlfriends are actually worth looking at everything else not only transpired so slowly it made little sense as well.Why anything on screen is happening boggles the mind. Ask yourself why any of the narrative is of consequence and there is a blank page as an answer. That is saying much in a film that tries to be profound.,Null,370,638,22 December 2018
Your Name.," Worthy Of The Hype
","An orgasm for the mind and of course the eyes.This animation is an instant classic. I recommend watching it whether an adolescent or an adult...By the way, Hollywood has commissioned Mr. Rip Off Jar Jar Abrams to remake it. OH HELL NO!!! BOYCOTT THAT!!!!!!!!!!",Null,187,199,22 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Be A Person With Class And Taste: Stop Watching These Retarded Movies
","I watched it (do not worry I finally watched it for free). I cringed. It is sad and pathetic. It has nothing to do with Star Wars. 'laser swords'???? These films are for 8-year-olds who don't know any better. They are not just not good. This film was insultingly rubbish. It made no sense, had no continuity and shows you Disney Star Wars is like licking a toilet bowl. Wow it was stupid. Disney makes a billion from Star Wars and still needs to bring in Chevron as a sponsor. The video calling portion was sponsored by Skype/Line/Blackberry Messenger/FaceTime.",Null,16,23,22 December 2018
