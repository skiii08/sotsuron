Minority Report," First instance of a movie being better than the book!
","I read a lot of sci-fi literature, and I consider myself a fan of Phillip K. Dick.  I admire his sophistication and political/social sensibilities. He was an ingenious satirist and prophetic writer.Although strong in concept, Minority Report is not the greatest execution of Dick's writing ability.  I'd go as far as saying that it is the poorest of his works that I've read thus far.The screenwriters for this movie did one incredible job in transforming this rushed piece of writing into a film that stands on its own.Tom Cruise gave a performance that for once did not rely so heavily on his dashing good looks; although it was Samantha Morton as Agatha who stole the show with a haunting and convincing portrayal as an anguished soul.The special effects were used sparingly, allowing the story-telling to do most of the work.My only wish is that Iris, the eccentric woman who designed the pre-cogs had more screentime. Her performance set the tone for the films unexpected twists and turns.",8,2,4,4 July 2003
City of God," without doubt, one of the best movies I've ever seen..
","The cinematography, score, story-telling & casting were all done to perfection.Finally, a movie that uses editing after-effects in support of the film, as opposed to style without substance.And this was based on a TRUE story, too? The poverty, class gap, racism, violence and police corruption---- you'd think the implications would be huge. A POWERFUL film.Highly recommend watching the documentary found in the Special Features section.Best Foreign Film I've seen to date.",10,2,5,24 June 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," this movie taps into repressed female rage like no other!!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie..enough to see it twice in one week!! As expected, Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, & Vivica Fox, put on great performances!Tarantino gives us fully fleshed out female protagonists/antagonists playing up their femininity without patronizing them in their physical abilities.The audience's intelligence is never insulted.The anime sequence was well integrated-it was a brilliant addition--Those who never considered the artform as mature enough for adults may have been pleasantly surprised.I could go on forever about the cinematography, costume design,&...The score, which is tight...thanks to the black male genius RZA.I can't wait to cop the DVD!!!",9,0,1,20 October 2003
