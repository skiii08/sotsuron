","the problem about the movie is it is THE SAME AS THE FIRST PART ... but the 'bad guy' this time don't want the gold , he wants 'GLORY' of finding the treasure which is stealing both ways :D .... in part 1 he stole the declaration of independence as if it was a piece of cake and now he kidnapped the president of the united states just to prove his family innocence ...Nicolas cage lost his efficiency , he totally lost it .... after the rock, conair, faceoff, 8mm, snake eyes, adaptation, lord of war and national treasure 1 .... then BANG he went down through next , wickerman, ghost rider, weatherman and finally national treasure 2 ...",5,1,2,31 December 2007

","the Real Question Here ... are you ready to LIKE this Movie or Not ??? it is different than any other movie runs under this category of mysteriousness...don't get disappointed from hearing all the bad reviews , watch the movie , imagine your self there , be Jim Carey , feel the pain , run after a crazy number , ruin your life with your own hands, it is all WOUNDERFULL ...i am sure that a punch of us had experienced some weired coincidences in their life with a number , dog , name , cloth , days of the week , special clock during the day ... it is all based on how hanging too much in something may ruin everything else ...Sparrow had a decent life , a good family & a nice job :) ... that number managed his life nearly destroying it ... is he going to let it all go for the craziness OR he finds a way to vanquish the situation ... you will find this a real good movie ...",10,3,5,24 November 2007
American Gangster," Oscar Worthy
","this is how they end 2007 by a new Masterpiece ... i don't care what others might comment upon this movie , but the way i see it , it is one of the best Gangster's movie i had ever seen . it is not easy to get something good to this level without that special cast ... the music , the cameras, the cast , the writing ... WOW the chemistry between denzil and crowe was the key to success here... About the Story: i am not a great story teller but it can be summarized in that it was a symphony played with denzil and crowe was just listening , but crowe got enough and it was the time to learn from the master , crowe played his symphony too , then both are on stage doing the ending together .... it is a wonderful STORY ... 10/10 Guaranteed",10,0,2,2 December 2007

V for Vendetta," Simply beautiful
","Another Masked Hero Movie ??? so what's new ??? what makes it so good , so different in the same category ??? My personal Opinion : That we never get to contact with the real person visually , that keeps the idea of being the masked hero in our minds for the full duration of the movie Secondly we get in his personal life, his history, his plans his love life , his culture and his sickness only through the mask not through a crying eye or a laughing mouth There was the creation , his VOICE was the only way to touch the people. His attitude is new being V and the well known speech in the beginning to introduce himself as the punisher of the corrupted or departed people it makes us expecting Madness as what we saw , so when he says '' Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin van-guarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V '' What will you expect from that crazy speech teller ??? Blowing the god damn city ??? I myself thought it will be another Count of Mounte Cristo and I was right , Evey Hamond described him at the end by '' Edmond Dantes '' he is the main character at the Count of Mounte Cristo so what we stand in front of here today is a new combination between a masked hero fighting for good against evil and the undertaker of his revenge list.. so itsZorro + Count of Mounte Cristo = V for Vendetta",10,3,8,25 May 2007
