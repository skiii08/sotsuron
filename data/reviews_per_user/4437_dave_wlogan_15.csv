Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not lacking in action but great character development
","I thought Kill Bill Vol. 2 would be just like Vol. 1 but i was wrong. Despite the first film being a classic, this is what Vol. 2 needed. Tarantino films are all meant to provide something different to audiences with each film. Vol. 1 gave us the great blood bath Tarantino film, in truth like all his films its a homage film, and Vol. 2 gives us a chance to see inside the minds of the masochistic characters. The best of which I think is Budd (Madsen) who portrays a remorseful assassin who has given up the high paying world of killing to live alone and work at a titty bar. Bill (Caradine) is a killer with only one regret, shooting the Bride (Thurman). But the more interesting thing about Bill is that he accepts who he is and tells others to accept who they are. Elle Driver (Hannah) gives us the most bad-ass female to grace the screen ever. Elle is completely cold to all but Bill which makes for some interesting altercations with other characters. The Bride's character is explained and some others are introduced such as Pai Mei (Lu) who is the one of the Brides most influential mentors. This film isn't deprived of action. Elle vs the Bride has plenty of that but there is no denying that this film is a homage to revenge movies and even spaghetti westerns to a degree. An exceptional and more dialogue/character orientated sequel.",10,0,1,17 July 2008
Vertigo," What a Ride!
","This movie is One of the greatest movies ever made. In my mind it's certainly Hitchcock's best. To bear that title is showing real merit. This is a director who has many of cinema's classics in his CV. The 39 Steps, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, North by Northwest, Rear window and Psycho. Yet Vertigo is by far his most intricate, deep and intriguing film.The plot appears simple. Scottie (James Stewart) is hired to follow Madeline (Kim Novak) who is supposedly insane. They fall in love after Scottie saves her from drowning and then the story turns. She appears to have killed herself, Scottie unable to save her due to his acrophobia. Yet Scottie believes he sees her in a bar and follows this look a like, eventually getting her to dress like Madeline. Then Scottie takes her to the scene of the death with one of Hitchcock's darkest scenes ever.One of the impressive things about Vertigo is that the point of view that the film has changes three times. It starts off being told from Scottie's perspective, before moving to the Kim Novak character and back to Scottie at the end. This makes the film deep and surprisingly fluid. We see Scottie's mental and emotional state deteriorate through the eyes of someone who loves him. This makes the film deeply moving.The film would not be what it is without Bernard Herman's score. And what a score. It emphasises each emotion Hitch is putting the audience through. The excitement of a chase scene, the curiosity while Scottie trails Madeline or the highly intimate scenes between Scottie and Madeline. This is a pure collaboration between Hitch and Herman.Vertigo continues to amaze. It shows he audience one direction down a long highway and then BAM we're in another continent going who knows where. Then it takes audiences where they least expect. A pure example of true art.",10,2,5,3 February 2009
Fight Club," Classic, entertaining and gruesome
","This is a film everyone has to see. I cant believe the Academy didn't throw Oscars its way upon viewing it, they gave 'Return of the King' 13 for Christ's sake. This film is wonderfully intellectual, thrilling and immensely funny. The only bad thing i can say about it is that the theme is a little fore fed through the dialogue but hey, you're thinking about the plot so much that it's almost necessary. Norton gives the us the performance of his career and Pitt delivers, with awe inspiring calm, one of the coolest characters (the coolest imaginary one) ever to smash onto the screen. This movie really does have it all. Great plot, fantastic characters and a clever theme. If you haven't seen it, watch it. If you have seen it, watch it again.",10,0,2,17 July 2008
The Terminator," Dark, demonic and deadly
","This is the most groundbreaking action film of all time. Dirty Harry and Die Hard deserve some credit but this is just phenomenal. The exposition is great. The story develops quickly and each character is different. Unlike most action films we aren't given a character who goes nowhere, Sarah Connor (Hamilton) develops into the strong woman we see in the second film during the course of this film. The T-101 is acted well by Schwarzenegger, and before you say anyone can act like a robot know this; Schwarzenegger came up with most of the ways the T-101 moved. When he is searching for Kyle Reese (Biehn) and Sarah he moves his eyes and then his head giving him the resemblance of a surveillance camera. It's little things like that which gives his performance a little bit of extra weight. Michael Biehn is believable as Kyle Reese and takes the part very seriously and it paid off for the film. The special effects are excellent for such a low budget film and the dark look adds to the intensity that the film already carries. The music isn't typical Hollywood either it is always complimenting the danger the characters are facing. This is a fantastic film, a must see movie for everyone. Only one flaw and which is that in one scene the stop-motion isn't very good, but other than that perfect.",9,1,2,21 July 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Visual Masterpiece
","This film is the perfect Sci-Fi/action film. The special effects are brilliant and the action sequences are done to perfection. I could go on and on listing every artistically done special effect but that would take away one of the great aspects of the film. Schwarzenegger returns to his defining role and Robert Patrick plays the T-1000 to perfection. Linda Hamilton provides another decent performance as Sarah Connor and Edward Furlong plays John Connor brilliantly to provide some comic relief and Dr. Silberman returns , played by Earl Boen again. The story is basically the same as the previous film. Keep John Connor alive so he can save mankind. James Cameron shows once again how well he can direct action films and shows us how movies should be made. This film is in a league of its own, another classic, must see film from this director.",10,1,2,21 July 2008
No Country for Old Men," Classy, Visual and Brilliant
","This film is the kind of movie I want to win the Best Picture Oscar. It carries great acting, strong visuals, great script, excitement and above all a series of themes. I believe 2007 was a very strong year for film and this movie is the best of the lot.Firstly the acting in this movie is spot on. Brolin, Bardem and Jones with truly phenomenal performances. Bardem is the epitome of the psychopathic killer and completely sells it. Right from the start he is great. The first kill and then the second he just has such a menace about him. Brolin also shines here. But Tommy Lee Jones is just a wee bit better than Brolin. They achieve this brilliance through under-acting. In some films over acting is required but in this they brilliantly chose to go for the under statement.The way the film is shot captures the isolation and emptiness of the landscape but also come across as aesthetically pleasing. Shot length isn't rushed and that is important to the suspense and action aspects of the film. Overall this film had a hell of a lot more visual presence than all the films of 2007. By Presence I mean that the shots look like they could be still photos or they convey a lot of information about the characters or the world in which the film is set.This film's script is one of true class. Each character has been thoroughly written to perfection. All, even minor characters, have their personalities conveyed through the dialogue and plot, the acting as well but this is a pretty good script. The script got me the first time with the charm that Sheriff Bell has. His lines like, 'true story? I couldn't swear to every detail but it is true that it's a story' add a sense of comfort that a grandparent would give. Even if it is a disheartening confession. As it is this is a colossal script.It's the slow yet gripping pace set by the rest of the film which give the action scenes such force. By themselves they are brilliantly captured on film and epitomised by the suspenseful yet not climactic showdown between Moss and Chigurh. The brilliance of it is down to Chigurh taking away Moss' hope of ambush then Moss taking away Chigurh's hope for execution yet it ends in stalemate. In a formulaic movie this would have been followed by an end showdown bu the Coens brilliantly chose not to let the audience see Moss' demise.This movie has several themes. The strongest being the nature of violence. This is shown through Chigurh's persona and Bells' contemplations. Chigurh commits violent acts for no reason and doesn't understand that he could just leave the situation alone. Bell acknowledges this fact and tries to understand why someone could be like this. In the end he finds there is no reason, its just the way the world is. The second idea comes in at the end when Bell discusses his second dream. He tells of how he and his father rode into a canyon and his father covered his face with his hood with no conversation between the two. On this I have read many different views, none of which are wrong. It's very open ended. But I tied it back to the beginning and how he talks about how he thought his father was proud that he was a sheriff at the same time as Bell. Yet in the dream there is no warmth between them, this could mean that Bells' father is not proud of him or that Bell has been a better man than his father. But Bell has always compared himself to the 'old timers' who died or were crippled before retirement and it could be that he feels that he is now an outcast.Anyway you look at it this film is very entertaining and provides food for thought. A MUST SEE!",10,2,6,21 September 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," Genius
","This is a movie that I had heard about and was told that it was something special. To be honest I was a little skeptical. I've seen to many Robert De Niro films and can almost predict how hes gonna handle the role after seeing a few minutes of him in character. Im never exactly right but I'm usually pretty close. Ask my stepdad. But he did this in a way that I didn't expect. This performance is Immortal. And I don;t want to ruin it for anyone so I'll say no more on it.Now the film itself is a film that could be great with the worst cast. But because each cast member gives a sublime performance, the film is all the better for it. I was especially impressed with James Hayden who I thought was the best actor during the ruthless scenes but you never thought he was overly ruthless as a character out of those scenes.The film is like a long visual poem. Each segment is beautiful, sometimes haunting and seamless. The lighting captures the emotion perfectly, sometime appearing contradictory to the mood but that bolsters the audience's unease. Overall the camera-work is stunning.Forget every great script you've read or heard in film. This one is terse, occasionally taciturn and highly entertaining. Words cannot describe something full of them.This is a masterpiece. No Godfather comparisons please. Different types of gangster films which are incomparable.",10,2,5,3 February 2009
Reservoir Dogs," This is the classic indie film
","Tarantino's first film is perhaps the best. The dialogue is just people talking about normal stuff like music, TV, movies and random stories. The action has a realistic brutality to it which causes audiences to cringe and it has the best soundtrack a film has ever had. The cast is the stuff of indie film legend. Keitel, Madsen, Buscemi and Roth. Madsen shines above all these others due to his performance and the actions of his character. This film has been called overly violent but I didn't find it shocking to watch, entertaining but I grew up on Braveheart, Terminator and Pulp Fiction, three films I saw before I saw 'Reservoir Dogs'. This film is truly great, an instant classic and a must see film.",10,4,8,21 July 2008
Pulp Fiction," Comebacks, confirmations and class
","OK the first thing one can say about this film is brilliant. 2nd thing is Tarantino is one of the great filmmakers. 3rd thing is Travolta is fantastic.Pulp Fiction is a film where he linked stories intensely intriguing and each one offers a different kind of entertainment. The syringe, the bible passage (Ezeikiel 25;17) and the Gimp. How does one single mind think of these ideas let alone link them in a screenplay and then transfer this onto film. Each shot is cleverly composed and the shots used appropriately. The only thing that annoyed me about Tarantinos effort was how he knew he was good but wasn't sure we knew. By that I mean the use of some techniques like the steady-cam shot at Jack Rabbit Slims, i felt it was unnecessary but i got over it.Travolta and Jackson give of so much charisma and energy its unbelievable. It's a shame Jackson never achieved this level of form again. But this performance shows what the two are capable of. Travolta acted so well he has become known as 'the Comeback Kid' (got that from Empire) and it's true that Pulp Fiction has reinvented what kind of actor he is. Thurman gives a decent effort and Bruce Willis performed better than expected, and Ving Rhames was so believable as Marcellus Wallace. Tim Roth gave a fantastic little performance, he's one of my favourite actors in all of Tarantinos works. So the cast was at its best.The soundtrack is phenomenal but what do you expect from a Tarantino film. Each song is chosen for a different purpose and interestingly during the more dramatic sequences he didn't use music like he did in the ear cutting scene during Reservoir Dogs. Which brings us to the script. Similar to Dogs but in its own way it is both better and equal. For instance before they are let into the apartment to pick up the case the conversation between Jules and Vincent is immensely funny.This is THE film of the 90s. Also catch Fight Club, Trainspotting and Lock, Sotck and Two Smoking Barrels for other classics.",9,1,4,17 July 2008
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Incompetence, weed, air rifles, half a million dollars and 2 antique shotguns, What could be better?
","This film is one that contains what every low budget film should have. Great dialogue, fantastic plot and colourful characters make this one of the greatest films of the 90s. The dialogue has the nice sharp, to-the-point edge that only British films can give the audience. The local language is used to give audiences a sense of realism. This is the way these people would talk about this stuff. This is an important film as well. It can be likened to Reservoir Dogs in its' effect. Filmmakers see this as a relatively cheap way to make films and achieve career boosting success. But the films biggest credit goes to its use of genre. It takes British gangster films and combines them with a little black comedy to create a beast of a film which will slam all of what you know about movies in a car door.",8,1,2,17 July 2008
The Departed," Nothing but quality
","This film is one of the best films I have ever seen. It has made multiple top 10 list sand has won 4 Academy Awards, but this is not why I was drawn to this film. Scorsese directed it but thats not why I wanted 2 see it. I went to see this film because I wanted to see the cast. Di Caprio, Damon, M. Sheen, Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and of course Jack Nicholson made me think that even a shoddy script that has been rendered from a Chinese classic would make for a decent and worthy film.The film surprised me as it was more than decent. 20 minutes in and i was on the edge my seat. i was completely immersed in the film. The film was fantastic to watch. The cast was fantastic, the direction was stunning and the script was top drawer quality.The film successfully shows the effect of being a mole in some sort of organization on different people. Billy Costigan, the undercover cop, is constantly in a battle of wits with a criminal genius. He respects his foe, this is shown by his multiple acknowledgments of his abilities. An example of this is the scene at the bar in which Costello tries to figure out whether Billy is the rat. Billy shows a sign of fear which gives the audience a sense that he knows that Costello is on to him. Colin is different he isn't battling peoples wits he is simply manipulating peoples actions and ideas on criminals, often he is following Costello's orders. Where these two show their biggest difference is their goals. Billy is all about bringing Costello down despite the bonds which seem to grow between them. However Colin gets agitated with Costello and changes his goal from aiding Costello to bringing him down. This is one of the reasons I fell in love with this film.Another reason is the direction Scorsese uses slow motion, shadows and steady-cam sequences for dramatic effect brilliantly. The shot of Capt. Queenen (M. Sheen) being thrown off the building is heart stopping, this effect is achieved bu the slow motion. I don't think anyone in the cinema didn't say 'oh my God' at that moment. much kudos to his director of photography for composing the shots so well.Overall this is one of the best films ever made. A worthy remake of Infernal, in my opinion, despite what has been said on these boards. The film is as good as Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, what I consider to be Scorsese's best films.",10,1,5,17 July 2008
American Gangster," Entertaining and almost great
","First things first. Great Movie. It had great acting from Denzel and Crowe plus all the minor roles as well. It had a decent concept,true story of an astonishing man and his astonishing downfall. But sadly this wasn't a Ridley Scott victory.Some have said this film was better than the Departed but I disagree. The Departed is no way near as good as Goodfellas and shouldn't be compared with American Gangster. American Gangster and Goodfelas is a good comparison though, simply because they are crime biopics. Goodfellas is still better though because Scorsese did what I thought Scott would do and that is utilise the cinematography to every extent. The Departed had all round good performances from cast and crew. This didn't.Scott was clever in some places but this was more like a Tony Scott film than a Ridley Scott film. He has once again recreated a world for the audiences but you don't notice it enough for it to be as effective as it was in Blade Runner or Gladiator. When I watched this a second time I noticed the Harlem of poverty, despair and chaos. Its run down look is meant to achieve what Los Angeles 2019 did in Blade Runner but it falls short of the high set Ridley Scott mark. The scene Detective Trupo knocks over his coffee cup before killing himself was the scene I felt spoke the most volumes visually. It's just so symbolic. Maybe the only problem I have with it is that I expect too much from Scott. I just feel that the Harlem of the 1960s and 1970s could have been made more visible without compromising the brilliant story.Crowe acts at his best in this film but as one would expect Denzel is just superb. Brolin is good as wheel and the rest of the cast is just above able.Unlike the Departed this crime story doesn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar simply because it could've been better and there are better films for 2007. Denzel is great but no way does he beat Day-Lewis' performance. Not a must see but a good film and worth a look at.",8,1,2,21 September 2008
Beowulf," Not fantastic but enjoyable
","This is by no means a classic, but it was a very entertaining piece of cinema. About 4 years ago I was given a copy of the poem, I'm not big on books but I did find it more interesting than doing nothing in my cheap motel room. Last year I saw Beowulf and Grendel (2005) and was not disappointed but slightly annoyed at how it didn't feel like the people were Vikings. With that said Stellan Skarsgard was brilliant in it.This movie I enjoyed more. The characters seemed more like I had imagined when I read the book even though the story was different. I can break it down into 3 reasons why I liked this film.1. Ray Winstone is one of my favourite actors and he gave Beowulf's voice real power. By that I mean Beowulf sounded tough.2. The characters were slightly more like Vikings, everyone wanted to be a hero, lots of boasting and the lust of women was there.3. The story is epic and compared to Beowulf and Grendel this is a real epic.In the end I would only buy this film when it was on special, but if you like historical action films, know the story or are interested in getting to know the story then you should rent it.",8,0,1,20 July 2008
300," An epic but not quite Gladiator
","This movie is entertaining but not enlightening. It carries the weak themes of glory and duty and has a very simple plot line. To be fair to the movie it has subplots but it never really has anything deep. The characters are almost satirically muscular yet the film is meant to be a very serious one. The societies which the film glorifies are horribly flawed. Children are taught to use violence as a means of getting something they want and dieing in battle is the ultimate glory they can achieve. However the adults are never shown to use violence without reason which is completely contradictory of what we are told the society is like at the beginning of the film. The over the top violent people are the Persians and especially the antagonist Xerses. The Persians were a much more developed society than the Spartans which means the film is historically inaccurate as well as contradicting itself. However all these flaws are made up for with the John woo esquire battle scenes (instead of bullet time its spear time) and the epic like dialogue, like 'Tonight we dine in Hell!' Many have called this a shallow film, which is as unfair to the director as it is fair. The Spartan society was a shallow society and to portray them as your average Joe wouldn't do them credit. But that being said Zack Snyder could have gone to more of an effort to demonise them.The cast is as good as you can expect from this movie, just above mediocre. Butler and co. didn't seem to give their best performances ever but the acting isn't totally crap either. The CG effects are pretty good and combined with the action make for a worth while watch.",7,0,0,20 July 2008
The Social Network," Not quite the movie of the year, but...
","This is the true story film of the year. The big problem with it is that the story is so good, it would be brilliant in any narrative medium. Personally the most cinematic elements of the film were the rowing race and the inter-cutting of the court cases. The former being superfluous to the film in many ways.The rest of the movie only works great as a movie because of the acting, which is top class. Other than that I'd happily read the story in a book or see it as a play (probably the medium where it would seem it's most profound). There are standout scenes, but nothing struck me as anything exclusive to film. This is why I rate it a seven. The story and acting make the movie worth the watch.",7,1,2,24 November 2010
