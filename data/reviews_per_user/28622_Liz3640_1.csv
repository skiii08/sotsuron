The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely Shocking!
","I am a horror movie buff. Nothing scared me, until now. I just got back from see The Blair Witch Project just a few hours ago and I am still too scared to sleep. This movie was just too real. I don't even like calling it a movie. The only thing that made it a movie is that you had to pay to see it on a screen. It's the documentation of four terrifying days that these 3 students had to endure before disappearing forever. I honestly don't even know what to say. I'm still shaky from watching it. I think those who don't find this movie frightening are either really sick people or just didn't understand it. I know many didn't understand the ending, but just think of what one of the legends that the townspeople mentioned and perhaps you'll make the connection. I could go on forever, but I won't. Yes, I'm glad I saw this movie, don't get me wrong. But, like I said, it was too real. I felt as though I was with them which made it all the more horrifying. I recommend this movie, just don't watch it alone.",10,1,2,2 August 1999
