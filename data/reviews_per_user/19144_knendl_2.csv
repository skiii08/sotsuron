Sucker Punch," A truly powerful movie that will stick with you, both visual and plot-wise.
","Before you thumb down my review for praising it to much, let me say that, even though I'm 15, Im not an average 15 year old when it comes in the way of film. I hated the Hangover, (everybody else I know loves it,) my favorite movie is American history X, and I've seen somewhere between 100-200 movies, many being classics or movies in the top 250. With that being said, I LOVED this movie.If you haven't seen the ads or looked it up yet, Sucker punch is, according to Warner Brothers, 'An action fantasy set in the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls -- the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the fiercely loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and the reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) -- to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm). Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn), their unbelievable journey -- if they succeed -- will set them free.'-quoted from Warner brothers Summary.So, you're probably already saying one of two things. 1. 'This movie sounds awesome!' or 2. 'This movie sounds really dumb and written by a horny scriptwriter.' Honestly, when I first saw the trailer to this movie, I thought the second thing. However, 2 weeks before the movie came out for me, I saw a TV spot for the movie. I got curious again. I looked at the trailer from a different point of view, and I saw something that many movies lack today. Pure Entertainment. Just, pure unadulterated entertainment. As the days grew closer, I was growing in anticipation to see this movie. On March 25th, opening day, a friend and I went to see it. We both were blown away.Not only was this movie full of action, but the storyline was, surprisingly, great. As was the acting, music, sets, etc. Probably the most haunting performance was Oscar Issac as Blue, the main antagonist. He is an absolute prick on screen, not like most villains in movies today, who are more funny then scary. The best song used in this movie was sweet dreams by Emily Browning, right in the beginning in the movie. I could go on and on about why I loved this movie, but I must stress one thing. DON'T READ ANY REVIEWS FROM MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPER CRITICS! While they do bring up good points, I think they saw the movie as something different then what it was supposed to be. Just see it for yourself. Im glad I did.(P.S. If you go into this movie expecting as much from the story as you do from the action, the movie will become 5 times better. And, If its watched right, a couple theories will be forming into your head that could, possibly, rival the theories that form when watching Inception. Don't believe me? Go see it.)",Null,6,15,26 March 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," A surprisingly funny and heartwarming movie
","When I was readying to watch this movie, I was not in an excited mood to watch it. It was on the free movies, the complete unrated version, which never happens unless the film is very poor. Very Pleasantly, I was surprisingly, I was hooked within the first minute. Which was weird, because I HATED Superbad. But, I LOVED this film.The film stars John C. Reiley as Dewey Cox, who instantly becomes a likable character. Even when he's a kid, he's likable. One day, he and his over-achieving brother, Nate, played by Chip Horness, have a machete fight. Things turn bad, and Nate is cut in half. This starts a separation between Dewey and His father, Pa Cox, played by Raymond J. Berry. By the age of 14, he's tired of being bossed around by his folks, and shunned by the town. So, he packs up, and the rock star life comes at him, FULL FORCE! Honestly, if you're going to see this movie, see the unrated version. Yes, it's more shocking, but, it's also funnier, and it has more heart then the rated version. Honestly, this film quite shocked me. It's hilarious, thought-provoking and heartwarming all in one. Definite recommendation.",9,1,1,31 May 2010
