The Expendables 2," even worse than the first
","there isn't much good to say about this unwanted, unwarranted, unnecessary sequel. The first one was a huge letdown and this is just a bigger stupider version of the first.there are those who insist that these films are a throwback to the action movies of the 70s and 80s. Maybe that is true. The fact remains that movies have progressed and movies in this style look stupidly dated nowadays like safari suits, kipper ties, afros and discos. there is a reason people stopped making movies like this. The reason is that they were unwatchable.Like the concept and the genre the stars look well past their sell by date.Stallone looks terrible nowadays and his toupee is pretty obvious. Chuck Norris has been wearing a terrible toupee for so long that I suppose people don't care any more. Worst of all Arnie looks like a grotesque caricature of his former self.Bodybuilders don't age gracefully.The plot is so thin that I'd forgotten it by the time I came to write these comments, he acting is as awful as you would expect from these hasbeens. I wouldn't recommend paying to watch this.",Null,19,145,14 August 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," far too long
","A bizarre movie to open at Xmas TGWTDT is an overlong adaptation of the novel. Unfortunately it follows a very successful recent Swedish adaptation which seems to have satisfied the fanbase.However given that this is a depressing and relentlessly bleak tale involving graphic non consentual sexual acts I'm not sure who that fanbase would be,Fincher is the most overrated director ion the World ( the game and alien3 are cinematic masterpieces?really??) and I had begun to resent the fact that this monstrosity has been promoted as a work of genius for over a year.The movie is painful to watch- but not in a good way. It doesn't feel like a cathartic attempt to relieve a tortured soul, more a pretentious director throwing in all sorts to live up to his own hype.The cast do their best with Mara towering above everyone else. Astonishingly this is Daniel Craig's fourth big budget flop of 2011 ( and how did this cost so much anyway?) Avoid like the plague.",Null,18,41,28 December 2011
Paranormal Activity," saw this at frightfest
","I can't understand the hype about this cheap, boring movie.The whole 'cinema of realism' thing has run its course and got boring long before this lame effort appeared.There is a good idea in the middle of this movie but it is realised very badly..I don't identify with, like or care about anyone of the characters.I don't care what happens to them.The problem is made worse by the effects which are not special. They look as though they were done by a student in 5 minutes.This is a better movie than wrong turn 3 but its not as much fun.Wrong turn 3 knows its rubbish and doesn't expect to be taken seriously..Paranormal Activity thinks its a gripping drama.The movie seemed to divide the Frightfest audience.. liked it, some hated it. I can't sum up the effort to hate this but its not worth watching",Null,2,3,11 November 2009
Elysium," Copley should have been the leading character
","Once again Sharlto Copley steals another movie. He brings the kind of energy, intensity and focus that is totally captivating when he is on the screen. He absolutely should have been the main character in this. he would have been far more watchable than Matt Damon, who, quite honestly, is out of his depth with films like this. Jodie Foster is good as the villainess but should have had more screen time. Alice Braga is...on screen. I think that's all that can be said.Production design is excellent and the hardware is beautifully designed.The same cannot be said of the script which is underdeveloped. It feels like a first draft.Pacing is poor, some parts drag, but there are some impressive action sequences. Shaky camera work reduces their effectiveness at times but still some moments of excitement.",Null,8,17,9 August 2013
