Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not half as good as the hype suggests
","If you go into Star Wars: Episode One with high expectations, don't expect to come out without being disappointed, as the movie isn't nearly as good as all the hype claims it is. In fact the entire thing is just like a 133 minute trailer, with no stops, just constant, somewhat disjointed action.	Even so it is still a lot of fun to watch, very entertaining with breathtaking fx, but ignore the advertising, and you'll do just fine.",Null,1,2,8 April 2000
Amistad," Suspiciously distant and un-engaging, though the film has more than enough redeeming values
","Steven Spielberg's Amistad is more of a lesson in history and the brutalities of mankind than an effective narrative, but as one, it's not only informative, but often entertaining. Though the length is ridiculously long (don't get me wrong, I enjoy long films, though not when the story itself is this poorly developed) and the scenes rarely make as much of an impact as they should, the acting is absolutely mesmerizing. Throw in fabulous cinematography and a heartbreaking flashback (the films best scene), and you have the makings of a great film, though it isn't quite there as it is.",Null,6,13,16 July 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Good, mindless entertainment
","The whole theatre was laughing all through the movie at the preview screening I attended, so I can sense how much this movie is going to gross. A lot.The writing is excellent and the characters are so much more broad than the TV series, even though the movie is still only 76 minutes long. One surprising thing; Scott Rudin, who did A Civil Action and The Firm, produced this. It's obvious that critics are going to bash South Park, but ignore them and see it anyway, it's an excellent way to blow an hour fifteen minutes (and $5)+ (GOOD THINGS) 1.) The writing 2.) Parker and Stone's voice work 3.) How it insults everything, no one feels left out 4.) Marc Shaiman's score 5.) The terrible animation<ul><li>(BAD THINGS) 1.) Nonstop swearing 2.) Short runtime</li></ul>

Face_Off," Dark, grimy, bears little resemblance to most action films
","Going into 'Face/Off' I was expecting something along the lines of 'Speed' (my favourite action film), and because of this I felt a little cheated coming out. The movie is unlike most of today's high-tech big budget action movies, it feels more like a Hong Kong kung fu movie without the kung fu than anything else I've ever seen. In 'Broken Arrow', John Woo's previous outing (also starring John Travolta), the characters are big, larger than life, even a little cartoonish, and that's what made the movie so enjoyable. Here there is absolutely none of that, almost no humor in the script (Travolta- who was a great over the top villain in the previous film, seems to have no fun here). Even so, the movie is still well worth seeing, especially for the brilliantly executed action sequences	One thing that really got to me after a while lies in the sound and script. Even other sound heard in the movie is either a gunshot, or a character saying the name 'Sean'. You'd think that after a couple dozen times we'd get the point that the main character's name is Sean. God. That and Castor, a name that was uttered at least thirty times.	Much of the movie was dark and grungy, harder to sit through thaan the warm and sunny 'Broken Arrow' or 'Speed'. It was very different from most of today's movies, and that can be both a good thing and a bad thing. Thankfully the movie features powerhouse performances from both Travolta, and especially Nicolas Cage, in his best performance since 'Leaving Las Vegas'.	It's easy to see where the hugely massive budget went, since it obviously didn't go to the supporting cast, which is littered with names no one has ever or will ever hear(d) of. Instead it went towards the action sequences, which, as I've already mentioned, are the best part of the movie.	One odd thing is that for the last five minutes, the movie quickly changes tone, which is actually quite effective, and just reinforces the fact that Travolta's comeback wasn't a fluke	See it only if you're a fan of Travolta, Cage or Woo, otherwise you're likely to be disappointed.6/10",Null,0,0,21 May 2000
Independence Day," Big, loud entertainment.
","Independence Day, or ID4, is a great example of 'the-summer- blockbuster-we-are-required-to-see-every-year-and-comes-up-at-every-conversation' genre. In 1993 it was Cliffhanger and The Fugitive. In '94 it was Speed. Crimson Tide in '95, ConAir in '97, Enemy of the State and Armageddon in '98, and Star Wars and Deep Blue Sea in '99. For 1996 ID4 shared the honors with The Rock. Every year. No more than two, no less than one. Somehow audiences never get sick of these often brainless, mega-budget, never believable for a second blockbusters.	Of the eleven since 1993, Independence Day ranks with the better ones. The fx and sound editing is excellent, breaking new ground, and the film manages to be so immensely entertaining that it doesn't allow audiences to think about how thin it actually is. The characters are all one (and sometimes two) dimensional, and the plot line is so implausible that you find yourself laughing. At times it looks like it doesn't even rank with those ten other mega hits, but instead with the star-studded disaster epics of the '70's.	But we don't tune in for those times, instead we watch for the edge of your seat action sequences, or plentiful one-liners. Randy Quaid is hilarious in one of the film's supporting roles, and Will Smith and Bill Pullman are likeable in the leads.6.5/10",Null,1,2,21 April 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Pales in comparison to the original
","'The Lost World' is nowhere near as fun, impressive, or as well done as it's ground breaking predecessor, 1993's Jurassic Park, but on it's own terms, it is still an okay time passer. To watch it at home, especially on VHS with a limited sound system (it isn't even out on DVD yet), is an absolute waste, to fully appreciate what there is to appreciate, you must see it in theaters.	The characters are paper-thin, and the dialog they are given is often very unrealistic. In the first movie the script was witty, and fun, in this it is an absolute bore. Jeff Goldblum isn't the best lead, Sam Neill would've been better, but he does a good job with the extremely limited material. As Goldblum's daughter, Vanessa Lee Chester is likely one of the worst actresses to appear in a Spielberg film. Even so, it isn't all her fault, it's mostly the script. The producers made a horrible choice when they decided to ignore Michael Crichton's bestselling novel of the same name, and come up with their own story line, as the one featured in this movie is a small step above horrid.	Likely the film's best quality, John Williams somehow created an all-new soundtrack featuring excellent music, similar to the original and just as good.	This is probably Spielberg's worst film, and it actually might be a good thing that he bowed out of the third film, at least as far as directing goes.	On it's own, 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is an okay film, not very deep, but quite flashy on the surface with the wonderful dinosaur special effects. Don't rent it on video, even on DVD, once it comes out on it, instead (only if you haven't seen the movie, and live in a city of 1,000,000+) wait for it to be brought back to the theaters, it was a big enough hit to be resurrected for a showing or two.5/10",Null,1,1,23 April 2000
Event Horizon," A few good scenes redeem an otherwise so-so movie
","The first time I saw this was at midnight in the middle of the woods. I was so scared I couldn't sleep all night. The next year I saw it on sale, so I bought it. I was actually disappointed because  I remembered it being really good. Don't get me wrong, there are a few good scenes.+ (GOOD THINGS) 1.) Sam Neill's performance as a mad doctor 2.) Impressive special effects  3.) Messed up script which makes no sense whatsoever<ul><li>(BAD THINGS)   1.) How dumb the crew are sometimes   2.)

Mission: Impossible II," If you miss it in theaters don't bother renting it, it's not worth the effort
","I haven't seen the original Mission: Impossible film, so I don't know how this one stacks up to it, but if you compare M:I-2 to other action films such as 'The Fugitive', 'Speed', or even most of the James Bond movies, it is greatly inferior.	Thankfully there are no plot holes, or any problems with the plot whatsoever. The reason for this is that the producers apparently didn't find it necessary to even include a plot. No plot, but a lot of action sequences, explosions, chases, stunts, and even some unnecessary coversation. Mostly because of this the movie is extremely shallow and contrived, but rarely boring.	Much of the acting is pretty standard. Thandie Newton, who I've heard is excellent in 1998's 'Beloved', is nothing more than another pretty face here. Cruise is no match for Pierce Brosnan, and Dougray Scott is lacking any of the charisma required for an effective villain. Anthony Hopkins makes the most out of his limited screen time, and is likely the most interesting character to watch in the entire 140 minute movie.	Most of the action sequences are good, except for the climactic fight scene, which is way too long, and ends up getting repetitive after a few minutes. John Woo brings his trademark Hong Kong edge to the movie, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. In my opinion, leave these movies to directors like Andrew Davis, and give Woo the Jackie Chan type martial arts movies.	Watch it if you're a fan of the original, but if you are a die hard Bond fan, don't jump ship, and stay with your superior MGM series. Don't expect to see any nominations for M:I-2 come Oscar time.5/10",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
Halloween," Arguably the greatest horror movie of all time
","'Halloween' isn't just the best true horror film of all time, it's the definitive example of how to make a movie for less than a third of a million dollars and still be infinitely better than the latest $150 million dollar blockbuster. And all that for a movie that's nearly a quarter century old. It has fared the test of time remarkably better than nearly any movie ever has, and will likely remain on the top of everyone's chart for years to come.	The film is easily the only slasher movie that actually succeeds at scaring the audience. Friday the 13th, Child's Play, Leprechaun, ect., they never were suprising or even the least bit frightening, and piled endless buckets of gore instead of chills. Halloween is never derivative, never annoying, never boring.	John Carpenter's haunting musical score captures the atmosphere perfectly, and his writing and direction show a seemingly never ending tap of talent not utilized in his post-Halloween movies.	The story is by no means complex, but is still solid and very scary. Fifteen years after murdering his sister at the age of six, a soulless maniac returns to his home town to seek revenge.	A perfect ten, in reality the movie has no faults, and the only thing it is guilty of is launching an epidemic of third rate clones.",Null,0,0,12 May 2000
Speed," Tremendously entertaining, never slows down, even for a second
","An excellent (though simplistic) set of opening credits kick start this fast-paced action flick directed by ex-cinematographer Jan DeBont.	Speed is possibly the best action movie of the decade, at least of 1994, followed by a disappointing sequel. The film opens with LAPD cops Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) attempting to save several hostages trapped in an elevator ringed with explosives. A money obsessed madman (Dennis Hopper) set it up, and demands $3.5 million dollars or he will blow the elevator and kill the hostages, so it's up to Jack and Harry to stop him. Of course they kill the madman (or at least they think they do), and the film is over on a happy note.	Well, that would be rather disappointing, wouldn't it. The next day an empty bus blows up right in front of unsuspecting Jack, and the pay phone next to him starts ringing. It's the madman, telling Jack that he has planted a bomb on a bus, that is set when the bus goes over fifty. From there on it's a rush of thrills and suspense as the bus weaves around Los Angeles, no one able to get off.	That little summary probably makes the film sound terrible, but don't let that discourage you from seeing it if you haven't already. Mark Mancini's music score helps create the perfect mood, and the film has a strange sense of openness (for lack of a better word). Almost every shot shows blue sky in the background, a quality rarely seen in any movie.	The movie is funny, never taking itself too seriously, not the least bit claustrophobic, and a lot more fun to watch than almost any other movie in a long, long time.	For the most part the acting is good. The cast is littered with distinguished actors, most notably Alan Ruck, Jeff Daniels, and Joe Morton (The Astronaut's Wife). Bullock is given a star making role, and Hopper is given a chance to recusitate his sinking career (if you don't believe me about that, just watch the tepid 'Nails'). There is a lot of controversy regarding Keanu Reeve's acting skills, and, though there's no doubt he's not very talented, he's perfectly cast here and does his best to further the movie into a memorable classic.",Null,0,1,9 April 2000
The Sixth Sense," Haunting, beautiful, ultimately unforgettable. A masterpiece
","It's unlikely many people will be reading this review, as there are so many user comments rushing in that this is likely to just be passed by.	I haven't seen The Sixth Sense since November (the first time I saw it was on opening night), yet I think about every day, play it back in my mind constantly. I recently bought it on DVD, but I haven't watched it, as it is very hard to start, and nearly impossible to stop.	The acting, especially by Haley Joel Osment (the only child actor in Hollywood history to deserve this much attention) is excellent, and to say this is my favorite film is an extreme understatement.",Null,0,0,6 April 2000
Final Destination," Better than average horror flick
","'Final Destination' gets off to an absolutely excellent beginning, one of the best in recent memory, and goes slowly downhill from there. The climax doesn't really fit into the rest of the plot and seems sort of tacked on, not very entertaining or realistic. Still, the first twenty minutes manage create a lasting first impression and the acting helps things somewhat.	The writers managed to keep the story flowing perfectly, and at the same time capture realistic dialog, same goes for the direction, which is also above the norm.	Devon Sawa does well with a pretty generic character, but it is the almost unknown supporting cast which keep everything together. The musical score also captures the flavor of the events, helping to make 'Final Destination' better than most of the other 'teen horror' movies.	It easily could've gotten lost in the big box office winter of 1999/2000 if it wasn't for the good reviews and presumably a lot of positive word-of-mouth. It has become quite the runaway hit, still going strong months after opening weekend.",Null,0,0,22 April 2000
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Billed as a comedy, but more like a fantasy in that it isn't very funny
","When I was at the video store I mentioned that I hadn't seen either of the Bill & Ted movies, and the employee seriously recommended them, so I went into 'Excellent Adventure' with high expectations, yet I was somewhat disappointed at the end. The characters are interesting and Reeves/Winter are a good pair, but the film as a whole is not funny and often tedious to sit through.	I know it's supposed to be that way, but I found the plot highly far fetched, even unoriginal, and the historical figures that the title characters meet seem vastly unrealistic.	Still, it was entertaining during stretches, and nearly everyone else seemed to enjoy it, so you could do worse.",Null,2,4,19 April 2000
Gladiator," A historical epic of such proportions unseen since Spielberg's 'Amistad'
","Gladiator is an extremely well done, though flawed, epic that is very deserving of it's box office success. Ridley Scott's best film since Alien is a terrific blend of action, drama, and worldwide appeal that is sure to make Russell Crowe a star.	Much of the film is wonderfully entertaining, one of the best films yet this year, but somehow I don't think it lived up to the praise it's getting from critics and audiences alike. Nearly every scene in 'Gladiator' is overly stylized, with Scott going way too far overboard with the camera effects, fast cuts, camera movement, and over baked atmospheres. Still, in the era of technology this is becoming more and more common, especially in films made by Dreamworks. Because of this the film is strangely devoid of any sort of emotion, even with the deaths being one of the main aspects of the story.	The other problem I had with 'Gladiator' was the opening scene, which had Maximus (Crowe) and his army fighting a group that opposed the Roman rule. The scene (though it set a good pace for the rest to follow) had absolutely nothing to do with the central story, and was never explained or even referred to later on.	Still, it commands first rate performances from Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (Return to Paradise), and Scott handles it quite well. The music by Hans Zimmer is also outstanding, though it ends up sounding a lot like his score for the recent 'The Thin Red Line'. The movie should not be missed, and the giant budget allows it to rise above the mediocrity that plagued several recent epics attempting to emulate 'Titanic'. Dreamworks deserves a hit, and they're getting one here.7.5/10",Null,0,0,13 May 2000
High Fidelity," Pretty good for having a plot line I wasn't very interested in
","All of the elements of a good film are present and very evident here. The writing is good, the scenes flow into each other nicely, the acting is good, especially from Cusack, and the direction is also remarkable.	Still, something seems to be missing... Could it be (flash) the music? No, it wasn't bad at all. Could it be (flash) the story? No, it was also good. I said good, not that I personally liked it, but still appealing to most people and original.	Actually no one thing is particular is weak. It's a mixture of several smaller aspects that are average that almost cause it to fall apart.	But all the major aspects are in place, preventing it from actually disintegrating, so the movie still is enjoyable (maybe a tad long), and a must-see for any music fans.6.5/10",Null,0,0,11 April 2000
