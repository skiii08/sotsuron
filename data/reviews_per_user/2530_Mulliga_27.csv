Alien 3," This one blows chunks...
","I rented AlienÂ³ in an old Albertson's grocery store. I knew that it was by far the least of the series, but how bad could it be? The answer: REALLY bad. There are almost no moments of actual suspense or even horror. The decision to see through the alien's eyes like in 'Predator' is such a huge mistake; it drains away every bit of interest you could have since you know where the alien is at all times. Sigourney Weaver goes a bit darker and more cynical in this film, and, by golly, it works. Everyone else, even returning veteran Lance Henrikson, is pretty much window dressing. See 'Jaws', 'Robocop', 'The Silence of the Lambs', and save yourself 2 hours of your life.",Null,395,422,30 January 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Lots of flash, little substance (minor spoilers)
","Most people are enamored with 'Requiem for a Dream' - they are taken aback by its gimmicky direction and its undeniably strong cast. This is a good movie - but not a great one. Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans do give great performances, however.Unforunately, there is little story here. The movie, when all is said and done, is jarringly predictable, and simply goes nowhere, much like the addicts and drug dealers it depicts. The implication, of course, is that substance abuse is a downward spiral, but it makes for a messy movie with little or no plot, and more importantly, little incentive to watch again.Split-screens and time-lapse photography are fun little tricks, but they are ultimately overused by Aronofsky. They eventually take the viewer out of the movie's reality, or, at the very least, become a bit dull through repetition. Some of the plot turns in the film are eyebrow-raising - Connelly's character, for example, goes from a fairly normal person with a drug problem to a total junkie almost overnight.'Requiem' is a flawed movie, but a good film. I only wish the screenplay was as strong as the actors' performances.8/10",8,0,1,28 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as everyone seems to think...
","I can remember the first time I saw Episode 1, years ago when I was still in high school. I recall coming out of the theater, mostly pleased. I had a sweet lightsaber duel with my cousin (my cousin pretended to be Darth Maul). I thought it was a fairly good movie and that was that.Then the talk came the next day in school. People on the net were really blasting Episode 1 - was my memory really THAT faulty? Yes, the movie was pretty bad compared to Empire Strikes Back, but so is 95% of the stuff that passes for sci-fi these days. Why weren't they comparing Episode 1 to modern sci-fi like Event Horizon or Virus? Surely Episode 1 was better than those movies.People seem to have some kind of huge attachment to the Star Wars franchise. I mean, when you have movies with entirely different casts (save for Frank Oz as Yoda), you're going to have entirely different levels of quality. Let's face it, Ewan McGregor is no Alec Guiness, Liam Neeson is no Harrison Ford, and Jake Lloyd is certainly no Mark Hamill. Lucas was dealing with inferior actors...of course the acting would be inferior.Then there's Jar Jar. Well, slap my tail and call me crazy, but I don't think Lucas meant Jar Jar as a racist character. I think he wanted a fanciful alien companion for Anakin, and he went too far. Edit the movie a bit, and Jar Jar becomes a non-factor. C3PO and R2 did some pretty stupid stuff in their day, too.I think Episode 1 is a decent movie. Nothing particularly good, but nothing to justify a 1/10 score. It has one of the best, if not THE best lightsaber fights in the series, it has a nifty pod-racing sequence, and it has Natalie Portman. And for me, that's enough.",7,1,3,5 November 2003
Se7en," A good solid effort, and a lot better than 'Panic Room'
","Fincher seems to do one kind of movie - the bad movie. There's the laughably cheesy 'Panic Room' and the pretentious 'Fight Club,' not to mention the execrable 'Alien 3' and 'The Game.''Se7en' is a lot better than these movies. Morgan Freeman gives the film class as per usual, but Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey stink up the screen pretty badly (I must admit I feel an intense dislike of certain actors, and Kevin Spacey is one of them). Thankfully, the plot is interesting, and the ending is very un-Hollywood.",8,1,3,24 January 2003
Dawn of the Dead," A very good, but not classic, remake of the original (spoilers)
","Some horror movie remakes are as good or even better than the source material - the '78 version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' John Carpenter's 'The Thing,' and Cronenberg's 'The Fly' spring to mind.The 'Dawn' remake, though a very good movie that all involved should be proud of, doesn't quite pull it off. It's quite entertaining and even has the trademark bleak, ambiguous ending of the series, but it just doesn't have the teeth or the soul of the original.I don't know what to say about the remake. It certainly wasn't scarier than the original - zombie movies are hardly ever scary anyway. It was more 'intense,' if intensity can be measured by the volume of the sound effects in the movie and the speed of the zombies. The visual effects, set design, and score were all pretty much spot-on and, dare I say, better than the original.Why didn't I walk away with the same 'Whoa!' feeling I had when I first watched 'Dawn' '78 on VHS?Is the acting and characterization better than '78? Rhames and Polley are very good, and some of the other characters really stand out - C.J., Michael, and Andy. Everyone else seems to be window dressing, unfortunately. The original had four wonderfully drawn, complex characters - this one still has about four strong characters, but it also includes half a dozen people to be zombie chow. Too many people are introduced too fast for my taste - some of them literally only have one or two lines before getting munched by one of the new uber-zombies.Ah, yes, the fast zombies. These guys can sprint as fast as when they were alive, they can punch through car windows and doors, and they can jump like spiders. They can crawl through dog doors like a snake, and they scale fences and climb buses arguably faster than living humans could. They are definitely more like 'Return' or 28DL zombies, but with arguably less intelligence. They work pretty well IMHO, but the zombies aren't the problem.The problem is the mall. Or, more specifically, the non-use of the mall. The original Dawn had that one half hour section in it (if you're a fan, you know the part) that will live on forever - the section where they live, hunkered down in the mall, for months, enjoying all its spoils, and realize that it's all meaningless, and that material things can't provide happiness. I LOVED this part - more than the gut-muching, more than the headshots, more than the rock-em-sock-em action - because it actually made me sad. I mean, how many horror movies make you sad and feel the bleakness that the characters feel? The original Dawn did this. The new one basically has people all bunched up in a coffee shop.The social commentary is gone, as expected, and it has been replaced by dozens of gunshots. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I find myself wishing for classic lines like 'When there's no more room in Hell...' There are quite a few homages and cameos for fans (I definitely cracked a smile when I saw 'Gaylen Ross' as a store name).All in all, a worthy remake that is better than I thought it would be, but I still wish Romero was involved.3 out of 4 stars",8,0,1,26 March 2004
Finding Nemo," More focused than 'Monsters, Inc.' and 'A Bug's Life,' but less meaningful than 'Toy Story 2' (very minor spoilers)
","'Finding Nemo' is an enjoyable, compelling effort from the Pixar team. The story is simple, the plot is breezy, and Ellen DeGeneres as Dori provides quite a few laughs. Unlike the clever-but-meandering 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar used the simple journey archetype for its story, and the movie is better off for it. The characters are more engaging and memorable than in 'A Bug's Life.'Unfortunately, the movie doesn't ever come close to 'Toy Story 2' levels of brilliance. There is no real core or deeper meaning to the story, and the characters are less rounded and fairly two dimensional. The climax and the payoff of actually finding Nemo are underwhelming.3 out of 4 stars",9,0,1,8 July 2003
Blade II," Decent fun, but ultimately hollower than the first
","'Blade II' definitely suffers from the sequel syndrome. It's not quite good enough to stand up on its own, and it's not bad enough to end the series. When the inevitable 'Blade III' and/or 'Blade IV/V/VI/etc.' come out, this movie will probably get lost in the shuffle.A bit too much CG, too few fight scenes (they got Donny, they shoulda used him!), and a slightly predictable plot (though there was foreshadowing, however) mar an otherwise decent horror/action flick.",7,1,3,21 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Magic for any Tolkien fan...
","Okay, so it may not be accessible to the general public, but WHO CARES? There are millions of Tolkien fans, and they love Peter Jackson. This movie had the whole, packed theater laughing, gasping, and quiet at all the right moments. Great acting (Sean Bean made me LIKE Boromir), great effects, great story, great movie. The trilogy will beat even 'Star Wars,' I think. There was applause and a standing ovation at the end, and half the audience stayed in their seats through the credits with the magnificent Enya singing in the background. Fans said things like 'I've been waiting twenty years for this,' and 'Holy moly! That was fantastic!'#1 for a reason.",10,1,1,15 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," So much more than I expected... (spoilers)
","I loved 'The Matrix.' I even liked 'Reloaded,' though the flaws of the Wachowski brothers' filmmaking were becoming more apparent. I thought 'Reloaded' took a lot of courage to make, and I liked the new direction for the series, since it made the conclusion that much harder to predict. Less appealing to me (and everyone else it seems) were the Zion rave and the CGI parts of the Burly Brawl.I then heard lots and lots of negative reviews for 'Revolutions.' And I mean EVERYWHERE - in newspapers, on the net, and on IMDB. I was scared - had the Wachowskis finally failed? I went in with just a single hope: please be decent...please be decent...These thoughts were dispelled fairly early on. In Mobil Ave., Neo has a classic Matrix moment: he runs into a tunnel, and, like Pac-Man, he comes out through the other side of the screen - the tunnel wraps around itself like a mobius strip. It's a nice comic touch, and put me at ease for the rest of the movie.The coat check fight at Club Hel was a bit of a let-down (very derivative of the lobby shootout, unfortunately), but the Mexican standoff with Mero's goons made up for it. 'I'll kill everybody in this room to get Neo back,' Trinity says, and Carrie-Anne Moss makes us believe it.The real-world action with Trinity, Bane/Smith, and Neo was pretty good, though I can't believe it took Neo THAT long to figure out Bane was Smith (maybe he was buying Trin time :P). It's nice to see that the people in the 'real world' retain all their kung-fu skills and such.Even the minor characters (like Mifune, the Kid, and Zee) received plenty of characterization. The 'Battle of Zion,' which I was concerned felt too fake in the trailers, came off beautifully. The whole desperation of it, the overwhleming feeling of inevitability - it was classic stuff. The streams of sentinels, the blaze of APU fire, the low-tech manner of resupply ('Reload!')...exciting and well done.The final 'Dragonball Z'-style fight was AMAZING. The water-sphere effect (especially the water falling down afterwards) was beautiful and impressive. Neo and Smith fly through the air in a ballet of kung-fu, and Neo actually loses(!). How many big-name sci-fi trilogies end with the main character biting the dust to save the world?Overall, the movie was a fitting and respectable end to a great trilogy. It's certainly flawed, but nothing too critical has been screwed up, and the parts that are good are great indeed. There is even more religious symbolism and philosophy, and the Wachowskis allow the speculation to continue (Is it MWAM? Is Neo _really_ dead? Where did his powers come from, anyway? Will the peace last?) without copping out and forcing an explanation on us.For the true believer in all of us...8/10",8,2,4,8 November 2003
The Thing," Much, much, much better than the original
","I saw 'The Thing from Another World' and was thoroughly unimpressed. The beginning and middle were fine, but the end just lacked any kind of coolness or suspense. It didn't help that the effects were cheesy, either.Carpenter's version of Campbell's 'Who Goes There?' is arguably better than the source material. The visuals, are, for the most part, stunning; it feels like you are in Antarctica. There are many classic scenes, and countless awesome effects. The acting is good, and the story isn't bad, either.A fine night of terror for anyone so inclined.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERI LOVE that part where the doc shoves his hands into the guys stomach - I jumped out of my seat so hard I almost stood up.The interrogation sequence, the final plan to blow up the whole place...the final scene ('We'll just wait...')...yeah.",Null,0,1,11 February 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," An incredibly disappointing and disgustingly commercial 3rd film - shame on everyone involved (SPOILERS, but a true T2 fan should never see this one)
","I was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (which have no movie theatres) during the opening weekend of July 4th. Like many fans, the trailers left me afraid that the franchise's third installment would turn into another Alien 3. I heard reviews saying the film wasn't bad, and even actually good. I went into the theatre expecting an above-average summer action flick and a decent continuation of the Terminator saga. What I got was a big, fat stinker of a movie.There is a scene VERY early on in T3 that signals the start of the end.Like most people, I watched T2 on DVD before seeing T3 to 'get in the mood.' It held up very well, of course, and I even felt compelled to watch the documentaries on the making of the movie. Cameron said, 'It's important not to go too far and make the Terminator a clown figure.' Cameron gave Arnold plenty of sombre, stoic scenes to emphasize the serious nature of this killing machine.In T3, Arnie gets a set of clothes from someone else like in the first two movies. Except, this time, the victim isn't a street tough or a biker: it's a gay stripper at a ladies' bar. When Arnold reaches into the coat for a pair of sunglasses, he pulls out ridiculous Elton John-esque shades. People in the audience chuckled, but I knew in my heart that they were making fun of one of the most memorable villains/heroes ever at the movie's expense.T3 plays like one of those movies shown on the brilliant cartoon 'The Critic' - cornball humor, overdone action, and little underlying meaning. Mostow, while obviously a fan of the material, doesn't have much in the way of execution. The trademark Terminator feel is gone; no more cold blues, gritty blacks, and warm colors. The pacing of the movie is okay, but the 'look' of the movie is all wrong and feels artificial.That brings me to the sad part of the review. CGI SHOULD BE BANNED FROM MOVIES FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. Why do the special effects of T2, a movie made more than a decade ago, look more realistic than T3? In a move that will inevitably be likened to 'The Phantom Menace,' Mostow overuses CGI almost from the very start. The TX is completely unbelievable as a deadly weapon - she looks more like a video game character. The nuclear holocaust of T2, one of the finest depictions of a nuclear blast ever put to film, is a computer-generated mess that looks really, really bad in T3. The future war scenes, once gritty and intense, are actually kind of boring. The stunts and fighting, once rooted in some of the best practical effects work in the business, are almost all obviously done on a blue screen or in a computer. I mean, THE 'BATTLE ACROSS TIME' SHOW AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS (also directed by Cameron) looks better than this movie! (and it was more satisfying...)Arnold and the cast do an okay job with the stuff written for them. Claire Danes and Nick Stahl worked well, but why couldn't they hire somebody that looked like Eddie Furlong? Leonardo DiCaprio (of all people) would've been a better choice, since he's a dead ringer for Edward and even worked with Claire Danes in 'Romeo + Juliet'. Kristanna Loken lacks the menace and presence of Robert Patrick, even though she says even fewer lines (she doesn't even talk for the last half of the movie!). Arnold still looks good, but (and this is partially the script's fault) you never feel like he's Terminator - he feels like Arnold. The bit players feel okay but slightly hackneyed. There's a cameo by Dr. Silberman for the fans, but Silberman doesn't feel like the Silberman in the past two movies.That brings the problem of continuity. The Terminator POV screens in this one look nothing like the first two. The music is all different - I long for Brad Fiedel's driving techno-industrial score, not Marco Beltrami's forgettable drivel. I am definitely not happy with the whole idea of Connor's 'lieutenants' - why the hell does Connor have to save the world, anyway? If he has more than half a dozen lieutenants, couldn't someone else take his place?Surprisingly, the story as a whole isn't bad. I'm kind of miffed that they threw out the whole 'the future's not set' angle, but the ending was decent. It's just that the silly, botched execution of an inexperienced, b-grade director brings down the film.2 out of four stars",7,0,0,12 July 2003
Resident Evil," How do you rate a rehash of a rehash?
","'Resident Evil,' truth be told, isn't good. It's not the worst videogame-to-movie adaptation ('Super Mario Brothers' and 'Street Fighter' share the title) around, but it WAS the one with the most potential.George Romero was slated to direct, bringing his zombie/monster horror sensibilities to what seemed like a movie destined for him. Unfortunately, the suits pulled the plug, and what you see now is a pale shell of what could have been.The problem with 'Resident Evil' is that it is basically an action movie masquerading as a horror movie. Anyone's who's played the game knows that RE is more about suspense and shock than blowing away/running away from armies of zombies. Add in the technoshlock/flashbacks/muted characterization typical in so many Hollywood movies and you've got a dud. A distracting, somewhat entertaining dud, but a dud nonetheless.2 out of 4 stars.",Null,0,0,7 July 2003
Independence Day," The ultimate popcorn flick - breezy, predictable, but fun (very minor spoilers)
","'Independence Day' is the epitome of the summer blockbuster. You have Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum cracking wise in an alien spaceship, major landmarks getting destroyed, and enough explosions and creature effects to please anyone. The story isn't that great (in fact, the whole movie is just a remake of 'The War of the Worlds,' right down to the plot twists), the characters are sort of stupid, the acting is just passable, but the movie isn't bad. It does miss the apocalyptic feel you get in other films, but obviously Mr. Emmerich isn't looking to bring anyone down on the Fourth of July weekend. The effects look good, there are some laughs, and everyone goes home happy. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough.7/10",7,3,5,15 November 2003
28 Days Later...," Great fun...until they get to Manchester... (SPOILERS)
","'28 Days Later' is not as good as 'Trainspotting,' but not as horrifically boring as 'The Beach.' 28DL is sort of a mishmash of the concepts of the three classic Romero 'Dead' films - 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead', and 'Day of the Dead'. That doesn't mean it's bad, but like the Dead trilogy, it falls flat in the third act.It has several scenes that echo Night's 'zombie siege' mentality.It uses Day and Dawn's post-apocalyptic feel (though, to be fair, lots of stuff is post-apocalyptic).The most blatant similarity, however, is the entire theme of Day's whole military-self-implosion thing. The soldiers were just like the soldiers under Captain Rhodes...perhaps _too_ obviously so. Like Day, it had an overly happy ending (a killer for any zombie apocalypse flick). If the movie ended with no soldiers and no base, and the gang continued into the countryside, fighting infected and learning about themselves on the way, the movie would have been a classic.",8,0,0,27 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not quite as good as 'Fellowship', but it's a wonderful continuation
","'The Two Towers', is, on balance, not as good as 'Fellowship'. It has parts that are much, much better, but as a whole film, it is a less-compelling experience. Perhaps I'm just spoiled from watching FotR over and over and over. I found myself saying, 'Oh dear, that's another incredible helicopter shot of New Zealand. It's the eighth one so far.'The Battle of Helm's Deep is nothing short of amazing. I felt tired, physically TIRED, after watching the whole sequence. The casting, as usual, is fantastic - Andy Serkis IS Gollum, Miranda Otto IS Eowyn, Brad Dourif IS Wormtongue, etc.Fans of the book be warned: TTT makes MAJOR changes in the plot, that, while logical, may shock the viewer. Specifically, the Frodo/Sam/Gollum story and their run-in with Faramir is changed considerably.SPOILERSI wish they worked on the Fangorn sequence a little more. Merry and Pippin certainly got the short end of the stick story-wise. The Ents, surprisingly, were very good, but their surroundings left much to be desired and looked very 'blue-screen'. The flooding of Isengard rocked.Gollum, while not photo-realistic, looks good. And Serkis gives the best reading of the character I have ever heard; he is, at turns, threatening, disgusting, pitiful, and innocent.",9,0,0,21 December 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," QT, why oh why couldn't you have made this one movie?
","I'm not entirely sure if the decision to split 'Kill Bill' up into two parts was artistic or financial, but whatever the cause, the fact that 'volume 1' is only half the story quickly demolishes any hope for an epic QT Asian trash-action film homage. Instead, viewers are left hanging until 2004(!), and that's not conducive to good cinema.What's here is mostly great. Uma Thurman turns in an inspired performance as an avenging angel of death, and the many fights are pleasing and gory as all hell, though not quite up to the standard of movies like 'The Hidden Fortress' or even QT's inspiration, 'Kage no Gundan'. The soundtrack and visual style ooze cool, but one senses QT has lost some of his creative steam somewhere after the gigantic 'Crazy 88' fight - after all, there's only so much that can be done with samurai swords. Give us some guns, Quentin!The anime sequence explaining O-Ren is beautiful and well done, but some of the other gore effects don't work quite as well. The problem here is that QT decided to put much of the main fight in black and white for the American release (reason is still unknown - perhaps U.S. audiences can't handle gore?). When gallons of blood are lovingly crafted to splatter onscreen, the viewer almost aches to see them in vivid color...The casting of Lucy Liu was a huge mistake, and the Charlie's Angel still hasn't learned how to act. Vivica Fox is basically tossed aside after the first sequence, though hopefully her snappy character will return in the second movie. The trademark time shifting works well, as do some original camera angle flourishes, but it's not enough to make 'Kill Bill' a classic. Overall, the first half of the fourth movie by QT ends up being an 8/10.",8,0,1,12 October 2003

Mission: Impossible II," WHERE'S THE ACTION?
","Don't believe the junk other people say about this one.The great, action-packed previews and the coolness of John Woo practically made me buy a ticket. I came into the theater expecting slam-bang action on par with 'The Killer' and 'A Better Tomorrow.' Instead, I got a lot of fluff best saved for a cheesy Meg Ryan romantic comedy, and action at the level of 'The Replacement Killers' (and less of it). Tom Cruise has longer hair but his character is inexplicably stupider. The whole script is predictable and lame, and even more far-fetched than the original (ANOTHER 'rogue agent'? With this many traitors, how does the IMF function?). The action scenes are good but painfully brief. They are also fairly derivative (Wow! A motorcycle chase! Two-fisted gunplay! Karate fighting!) The movie takes an hour just getting started. Very flat characters like Luther accentuate the fact that this is Cruise's movie.See some of John Woo's other films, see Sam Peckinpah, see 'True Lies'...Just avoid this movie.",1,1,2,15 January 2002
Black Hawk Down," Probably the grittiest depiction of modern war ever made
","While it certainly isn't perfectly accurate (what war movie is?), 'Black Hawk Down' does what few war movies ever do - it portrays a battle without endless prattle about how horrible and futile war is.Confused? Basically, it boils down to this: every acclaimed war movie has implicitly been anti-war. BHD is neither jingoistic or pacifist; the American soldiers and Somali militia being portrayed on screen are neither heroes nor villains. Rather, Ridley Scott lets the viewer interpret the actions of the people involved and make up their own mind.That being said, I have to confess I especially loved the part of the movie where Shughart and Gordon selflessly drop in to save that second helicopter crew. I'm certain their families and their comrades are proud of the bravery they displayed in the face of overwhelming, hopeless odds.",9,0,0,29 December 2003
Toy Story 2," Best. Sequel. Ever.
","Better than 'Godfather II', 'Terminator 2', or even 'Empire Strikes Back', 'Toy Story 2' is quite possibly the best sequel ever made. It takes the boundaries of the original movie and pushes them back as far as the eye can see. The characters are more rounded and more believable, their problems are incredibly mature and universal, and the heart that the first movie had is still preserved.I still remember watching this gem for the first time in the theater with my sister. We were nervous - could a sequel to 'Toy Story' possibly be any good? About an hour and a half later, we came out of the theater, grinning ear to ear.SPOILERSI mean, anyone who doesn't get teary-eyed at 'When She Loved Me' must not have a soul. It's that sad. There was one part of the movie, right before the gang got out of the apartment building, where I said to myself, 'If they chase Jessie all the way to the airport, this will officially be the most fun I've ever had watching a movie.' And you know what? They DID.",10,1,3,11 February 2003
The Fly," Good performances lift 'The Fly' - essentially required viewing for any Cronenberg fan
","(minor spoilers - that is, nothing you wouldn't get from the trailer)Canadian bio-horror director David Cronenberg has never played by the 'rules' of modern horror. Here is another standout piece; instead of being a gory special effects movie with a love story tacked on, 'The Fly' is exactly the opposite: the slow metamorphosis of Bruden with cues the audience readily picks up on makes for a tragic, almost inevitable outcome to the romance between Seth and Ronnie. David Goldblum and Geena Davis do some very good work here (they were a couple at the time).You probably already know the basic plot, but the movie never insults the viewer's intelligence. It's ultimately a strange mutated movie - romantic-scifi-biohorror tragedy, much like Cronenberg's creatures themselves. While it's certainly only a good movie, it's still worth watching.8/10",8,0,0,15 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Don't listen to the critics...'Reloaded' is, in some ways, better than the original (spoilers)
","If you saw 'The Matrix' one time and understood exactly what was going on (like I did), you'd know why I think 'Reloaded' is, in some ways, better than the first film.To put it bluntly, 'The Matrix' was predictable. It was basically a Judeo-Christian messiah story with guns and kung fu. The effects were ground-breaking, sure, but the story was essentially nothing more than Plato's 'The Cave' mixed with the Terminator movies. There were few plot twists, and after two viewings, one basically understood everything about the movie.Naturally, the Wachowski brothers could have simply rehashed this. You'd have Neo exploding/kung-fu fighting hundreds of agents as Trin and Morph lead a desperate last stand against the machines. Eventually Neo would win a hard-fought battle, bring down the Matrix, unplug everyone, and power down all the machines at the same time (all peppered with one-liners). Easy, right?The sequel turns this all around in a single scene, oft-criticized by the masses. When Neo gets to the Architect, according to the laws of the first movie, the story should end.But it doesn't.'Reloaded' turns the entire mythos on its head - the 'One' isn't much of a One at all, the machines have always been in control, Zion is about to be destroyed, the Oracle and the Keymaker really aren't Neo's allies, and the prophecy that pervaded the first movie is total junk. For these characters, it's the equivalent to the Second Coming being a sham. How's that for surprise?Don't like the talking in Zion? It's necessary to give some exposition. The first 'Matrix' was essentially exposition for half an hour, as well. The only difference was that Keanu and Larry were doing the talking, not some little known actors. People don't have patience with non-stars any more, I guess.Yes, the Zion rave is bad. Does it bring down the whole movie? Nah.Have problems with Neo and Trinity's sex scene? Grow up. That's what people in love do.Yes, that last part of the Burly Brawl looks fake (of course, no one ever talks about the first five minutes, which are absolutely enthralling). Can you think of any other way to film 100 identical Agent Smiths facing off against Neo? It would have been impractical and even dangerous to the people involved to have 100 people flailing around on a set, no matter how well-planned the choreography. The CGI solution was the ONLY way.I'm sick of the Matrix-bashing, just as I'm sick of the LOTR-bashing. Can you honestly say you've seen an action movie with the depth of 'Reloaded'? Certainly not one made this year. I'm certain we'll all laugh at the criticism after 'Revolutions' puts 'Reloaded''s dramatic twists in perspective.",8,0,0,20 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Horrific Zion scenes, fantastic otherwise
","A worthy successor to the (at first) underrated and then overrated first chapter.(minor spoilers)'The Matrix Reloaded' features some questionable editing. The Zion scenes - especially the infamous Zion rave - drag on for what seems like forever. I don't mind Neo and Trinity, but dozens of sweaty Zion extras bumping and grinding? Strange. The council scenes are incredibly dull - save for the scene of the machines powering Zion. 'What's the difference between these machines and the ones coming to kill us?' the head honcho guy asks. 'We can turn these off,' Neo says. 'Could we? Could we really?' the head honcho guy says.The fight scenes, though slower than the best martial arts flicks, are lavish and incredibly well-shot. There are plenty of them, with my personal favorite being the Chateau fight where Neo and some errant programs do battle with an assortment of weapons. The music is great, with plenty of continuity between film 1 and 2. The lauded special effects sometimes look fake (the 'burly brawl' is nearly spoiled because of this), but the overall ambition is amazing.There is more action, a lot more philosophy and epistemological stuff, and even more black leather.

","Wow, 'Signs' is easily one of the scariest alien movies I've ever seen. It's a good movie, of course, and it deserved to do well at the box office.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSStuff that made me jump:1. That dog barking ferociously at the kids2. The shadow on top of the barn3. The TV news feature that showed 'amateur home video'4. The whole locked-in-the-pantry thing5. The broken bulb6. The coal chute thing7. The reflection thingAny movie that shocks 7 times is worth the money.",Null,0,2,11 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Better than TTT, but not quite up to FOTR (spoilers)
","There's no pulling punches - ROTK feels rushed. It's certainly the best movie of 2003, and it makes the entire trilogy the best movie series ever, but as a third part and conclusion, it has some flaws.Most of these relate to the ending(s). Let's face it - the end of ROTK in the books wasn't the strongest part, either, and neither is the end of Jackson's film. It goes way overboard when Frodo leaves for the Grey Havens - the scene seems to take as long as Trinity's death in 'The Matrix Revolutions,' though it certainly works better.On the bright side, the battles are spectacular, the acting (especially Sean Astin, who deserves at the very least an Oscar nomination) is spot on, and the finale works well. I definitely liked how they changed the final encounter with Gollum in the Cracks of Doom - it's more dramatic, and it makes more sense than having Gollum simply fall off by himself. In this case, Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens improved on Tolkien IMHO.9/10",9,0,0,22 December 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Heather Langenkamp: A Tribute
","'Nightmare' is a classic horror film, and perhaps the scariest slasher ever made (aside from Halloween, that is). Much of that terror comes from the performance of Heather Langenkamp.Ms. Langenkamp imbues the role with intelligence and determination (no surprise - she earned a degree in English from Stanford University while working to pay for it herself!). Some have called her performance stilted and listless, but I disagree; Nancy reacts differently from the other characters because she IS different - like Jamie Lee Curtis in 'Halloween,' she dares to fight back against the monster. This idea of a heroine kicking butt, while certainly commonplace now with shows like Buffy, Xena, and Alias, was still quite novel in the 80s.The real Heather Langenkamp is a devoted wife and mother, as well as the head of a chewing gum business. Ironically, she married a special effects makeup artist (just like in 'New Nightmare'!). Inducted by Fangoria into the Horror Hall of Fame, Heather Langenkamp, just like the plot of 'New Nightmare' says, brought life to Nancy, turning her into one of cinema's most memorable scream queens.",Null,0,0,18 June 2003
The Thin Red Line," Should be called 'The LONG Red Line' - A great cure for insomnia
","Rented this one because of Sean Penn, who was good in 'Sweet and Lowdown' and okay in 'I Am Sam.'Think 'Apocalypse Now' with no memorable scenes and a less interesting premise, and you've got this one. Easily one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Three hours down the tubes - don't wars usually have the occasional BATTLE?Long stretches of inaction are fine if there's some kind of payoff at the end, or even some underlying message. This one's a lemon.1 Star Out of 4",Null,9,16,11 July 2003
