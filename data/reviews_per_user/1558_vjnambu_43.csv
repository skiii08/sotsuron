The Mask," Watch it for the mask
",The mask is only worth watching for the mask. Its such a hilarious and super energetic character which brings a life into this dull movie. Without mask it was difficult for me to watch this. How many times I dozed off while watching scenes without mask. Today i wish to be rebooted in a good way but Jim carrey is irreplaceable.,6,0,1,22 July 2019
Iron Man 3," Lack of fun
","Plus:
1. RDJ of course
2. Guy Pearce villain character is powerful
3. Few action scenesMinus:
1. Tony Stark's vulnerability
2. Makers ruined Mandarin character
3. No entertainment
4. No thrill
5. No funVerdict:
Many say iron man 3 is the best iron man film. But for me its the worst iron man film. Jon favreau should have been given one more chance to rectify the mistakes he made in iron man 2.",3,2,3,1 December 2018
Darkest Hour," Where was oldman?
","I heard that Gary oldman was playing Winston Churchill in darkest hour but where was he? Only I could see was Churchill. Kudos to the makeup artists for giving a replica of Churchill. Oldman truly got into the shoes of Churchill. Direction by Joe wright is terrific. On the whole, darkest hour is a powerful historical drama.",10,1,2,30 July 2019
Iron Man 2," Time pass entertainer
","I know iron man 2 is the most hated iron man film. Yes, it has its share of flaws. The first iron man was simple but powerful. Whereas in iron man 2 the story and screenplay was ordinary. Plus I didn't like the character of Pepper Potts in this film because she was very annoying and being insensitive towards Tony. I liked her in the first and third part. Also the ending could have been better. But if you ignore these shortcomings, iron man 2 is very enjoyable film.
It has RDJ who is as cool as ever. Then you have Mickey Rourke as villain whiplash who was also good but his character could have been better. Then there was Scarlett Johansson as black widow making her debut in MCU, who was hot as well as badass. And there is don cheadle who replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey. I don't know whether he was better than Terrence Howard but I liked him. Terrence Howard unfortunately missed the opportunity of wearing the war machine suit. But the scene was not appropriate were Rhodes wear the war machine suit for the first time. That birthday party scene was hilarious. And I loved the action scenes especially where tony wears his portable suit.
Like spiderman 3, iron man 2 also got messed up with studio interference. Jon favreau was pissed up for rewriting the script multiple times. He was forced to include shield characters as a buildup for the upcoming avengers film. But that was affecting the main story. That's why favreau refused to direct iron man 3. I am big fan of Jon favreau and I missed his work in iron man 3.
On the whole, if you want to watch a time pass popcorn flick, then iron man 2 would be the perfect one.",7,0,0,26 March 2019
Knives Out," First film I saw alone in theatre
","Knives out is the first film ever in my life which I was the only person in theatre. I knew there won't be crowd to watch this because it's a content driven film and not any comic book or franchise film. Why I wanted to see knives out was for Chris Evans. I am his fan since he played captain America. He made that character iconic. Usually Chris Evans non MCU films(whether lead or supporting roles) don't do well critically or commercially. But when knives out got critical acclaim, I got ready to book my ticket. I had to book my ticket in advance so that they don't cancel the show. I came for 5:30 show but film they were not playing after 5 minutes. I had to call the operator and make him play and he played it.
Now coming to the film, knives out is a murder mystery where Daniel Craig has come to investigate the death of a murder mystery novelist. I am used to watch mystery thrillers so I am familiar with its format. Knives out follows the exact format but suspense was revealed in the middle itself. It has a ensemble cast and everyone have performed well. Daniel Craig was enjoying a lot playing Benoit blanc. Ana de armas got a meaty role and has played well the sincere caretaker. Veterans Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Shannon kept their names. Now coming to the man for whom I had to sit in an empty theatre. When Evans appeared I was so happy. He made the film more enjoyable. It was good that he didn't get lost among all the stalwarts.
But, I had issue with the ending which could have been better. Many of the things done went in vain.
But I recommend knives out for murder mystery fans. Rian Johnson compensated for the hatred he received for last jedi with knives out.",9,0,12,1 December 2019
Aquaman," Visual extravaganza
","Following the marvel way and encouraged by the success of dark knight trilogy, DC established dceu in 2013 with man of steel which I found slow and boring but was a decent success. Then came another boring film dawn of justice and pathetic suicide squad. After that came the first female superhero film wonder woman which worked wonders for dceu. But those wonders didn't last after the release of justice league, a blatant copy of avengers.
And now, dceu comes with aquaman who we saw in justice league (but I was wondering where he was as only focus was on wonder woman flash and Superman).
Aquaman narrates the origin of Arthur curry half human half atlantean. In the first few minutes it captures your attention, with excellent action scene of Nicole Kidman. After then the film takes you to a visual treat. Jason momoa mass intro, underwater scenes, Atlanta kingdom, fight between Arthur and his half brother, escaping from Atlanta to get the golden trident, the superb action scene in Italy, Arthur getting the Trident and the final battle all these does not let you take off your eyes at the screen. Only drawback is story is not that great and slightly similar to Thor 1. Aquaman was my best 3d experience. On the whole, aquaman is an absolute visual treat which not even a marvel film provided me. DC must concentrate for the time being only on solo superhero films. Hats off to director James wan.",9,0,0,6 February 2019
Spider-Man 3," I don't care about haters
","When I first saw spiderman 3, I loved it and thought it to be a best Spidey film because for taking the franchise to next level. But years later, I found out critics and audience ranting about it because of its overload of villains. How much you spread negativity and hatred towards it I am not able to hate it. Because I still enjoy 3rd part like the first two. Only drawback I felt was the repetitiveness in ending where this time also mj is kidnapped by the villain in order to reach spiderman. Despite pressure from studios Sam raimi managed to keep it entertaining. Its so sad this franchise ends in a bad way. I love Sam raimi trilogy.",9,3,8,23 August 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Entertaining and best Thor movie
","Though I liked Chris hemsworth as Thor, I was not any fan of Thor standalone movies. While Thor 1 was strictly okay, Thor 2 was one of the most weakest films of MCU. But in Thor ragnarok Thor franchise gets completely revamped.
Ragnarok format is same like iron man 3. Like in iron man 3 we saw what tony can do without his suit, in Thor ragnarok we can see what Thor can do without his hammer. Despite all the worst things happening to Thor in this one(loses his father, hammer,eye and Asgard kingdom) there is a lot of humor in this one.
When a serious character does humor, his fan following increases like never before. Same has happened with Chris hemsworth whose fan following as Thor has increased leaps and bounds with ragnarok. Though he deliberately does not be funny, situations make it so. With film by film our love towards Loki increases only. So has happened in ragnarok. The bromance between hemsworth and tom Hiddleston is the highlight. Cate blanchett gives a menacing performance which makes hela one of the best villains in MCU. Tessa Thompson was badass as Valkyrie. And last but not the least, I never liked hulk before but with ragnarok I finally started loving him. Seriously the film becomes most entertaining with the entry of hulk.
The music is foot tapping. Only drawback I felt was some portions are dull when Thor is trapped in sakaar. But with the entry of hulk this becomes a hilarious entertainer. Full credit goes to director taika watiti for ressurecting the thor franchise.
On the whole Thor ragnarok may not be the best MCU film but is definitely the most funniest MCU film ever made.",9,2,5,14 March 2019
Zodiac," Lengthy thriller
","Zodiac is based on the famous zodiac killings during 60s and its investigation done by several people. Plus points of the film are its plot, initial thrill moments and artist performances. RDJ rocks as Paul Avery. Jake and mark ruffalo are good. Minus points are its length and lack of thrill moments (zodiac killings) in the second half. Just goes on like an investigation drama. But it somehow manages to keep your interest to know the zodiac killer.",8,0,0,2 December 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman under the shadow of ironman
","First things first, Tobey maguire will always be my favorite spidey and sam raimi's spiderman trilogy are my favorite superhero films. Due to which, I couldn't accept andrew garfield as spiderman. But I enjoyed tom holland's cameo in civil war, so I was looking forward for homecoming.
Homecoming is given a complete reboot. It doesn't focus on peter's origins and uncle ben stuff. Peter is a high school kid. Aunt may is a hot spinster and tony stark is his his mentor. After the airport battle in civil war, peter is waiting for tony stark's call on next mission. But tony instructs him to be only a friendly neighborhood spiderman. Adrian toomes known as the vulture is planning to steal essential weapons of stark tech. How peter stops him and impress stark is the rest of the film.
Tom holland fits perfectly as peter and spidey. In comics, peter was a high school kid and holland looks exactly like a teenager. His friendship with jacob battalon was a treat to watch. Michael keaton was impressive as vulture and his scene of threatening peter was worth mentioning. The typical humor in mcu films is abundant. Robert downey jr as usual was a treat in his extended cameo of tony stark. But we got to see less of action in him. The scene where peter tries to lift the wall rock gives goosebumps.
But i have three issues with the movie. First is peter's intentions. In original spiderman, peter's motive was with great power comes great responsibility. Whereas in homecoming, peter does stuff only to impress tony stark and join avengers. Second the film lacks emotions. Mcu films have comedy but also enough emotions too. Third is the unexciting action sequences which were mostly childish. Amazing spiderman series had much cool action scenes.
For 90s and early 2000s kids spiderman will be tobey maguire but for 2010s kids spiderman will be tom holland. In that case homecoming succeeds. But can't digest him being too dependent on stark.",7,0,1,26 March 2020
Alien," Amazing science fiction horror film
",I saw aliens before alien and I can say that Ridley Scott beats Cameron. Alien gets engaging after the aliens first attacks an astronaut. The thing I liked the most in alien is the production design especially of the aliens. Truly amazing. There is always a good amount of tension throughout alien which makes it a nail biting thriller. Hats off to Ridley Scott.,10,1,2,2 September 2019
Suicide Squad," Watch it for harley quinn
","The highlight of suicide squad is none other than margot robbie as harley quinn. She is funny, insane, badass and damn SEXY. She could even overshadow a big superstar like will smith (it won't be a surprise if you forget that there was will smith after watching the movie).
But thats it. The story has nothing new to offer, script was below average, there is no character development apart from deadshot and harley quinn, no chemistry among the team and jared leto's joker was nothing but a pain in your eyes but still he could be forgiven because his character wasn't really important in the story. Batman's cameo also doesn't make it any special.
Despite all these flaws, suicide squad was a passable entertainer which does not bore you at all. Just watch without expecting too much.",6,0,0,22 June 2020
Doctor Strange," Not strange at all
","Doctor strange follows the same template of ironman- a wealthy, successful but arrogant person turning into a selfless hero. There is lack of humor, no fun, weak villain(as usual) and zero chemistry between cumberbatch and McAdams. The scene where strange bids goodbye to Jean and she kissing him on his cheek instead of lips shows their lack of chemistry. On the other hand, good things of the film is the end where strange traps doramammu, graphics and tilda swintons performance. I rewatch many marvel films but not Dr strange. Still he was very good in infinity war.",5,1,1,3 February 2020
The Devil Wears Prada," I am now officially a Meryl streep fan
","This was my first film of Meryl streep I watched. Before that I didn't know much about her. But after watching the devil wears Prada, I have become her die hard fan. She's so captivating and what a perfect body language she carried of a boss like a boss. The character of Miranda priestly is completely bossy. There was also a vulnerable side of her shown. I didn't just become Meryl streep fan but also of Emily blunt. She was the second best performer of the film. I am now going to watch Meryl streep movies to just admire her performance.",10,0,1,12 October 2019
Forrest Gump," Best inspirational and motivational film
","Forrest gump was born as a slow witted child. He is rejected from various schools because of low IQ. But his mother is strong headed to give his son the best education which any normal child deserves. Forrest has some spine problem due to which he wears braces on his legs. He gets admitted to a normal school and in his first day to school nobody offers him a seat in the school bus except a girl Jenny who becomes his lifelong friend.

They marry and later Jenny dies. And, forrest lives happily with his son.
Forrest achieves everything in his life which even a normal person can't achieve. It is a very lovable character. Tom hanks gave his most memorable performance.",10,1,1,15 April 2019
Ant-Man," Only for Cassie

Captain America: The First Avenger," Average film but cap rocks
","Captain america the first avenger stars chris evans as steve rogers in his third superhero outing after fantastic four and push.
Set in 1940s, it narrates the story of steve rogers who is trying passionately to join the US army but is constantly rejected due to his poor physical condition. At this time, he's spotted by Dr. Erksine who at that time is working on a super soldier experimentation program and chooses steve for his experiment because of the latter's pure heart. Steve joins the army and falls in love with agent peggy carter. Steve is sent for the experiment and turns successful giving him super physical strength. But few minutes after the experiment erksine is shot by a hydra agent leading shield in dilemma because without erksine one cant successfully experiment with other soldiers. Hence, steve is reduced as a character actor for army plays. But steve proves his worth by saving american soldiers from hydra camp thus becoming captain america. He fights many wars along with his best friend bucky and lock horns with hydra leader red skull.
What I loved in the film is the character of steve rogers. Such an honest and sincere persons are rare to find. One could understanding his qualities in that fake grenade scene. The transformation of the short and skinny steve rogers to tall and muscular captain america was great. Hugo weaving played red skull very well. Though I didn't find the love track of peggy and steve intriguing but it managed to play an important part in future films of steve. Also his friendship with bucky. In civil war, steve didn't support bucky just because he was his friend but because he was always the one who gave him moral support in his bad times. That's what in one scene bucky says that I am not following captain america but that skinny guy who is so idiot enough to get beaten up. If you have seen chris evans off screen then you will be shocked to see how such a cool and fun loving guy can play a no-nonsense steve rogers.
But the film has some drawbacks too. First is the film's narration is slow which is not good for a superhero film. Second is film lacks humour because of which it becomes the least favorite mcu film. And the action scenes are not upto the mark.
Overall, captain america the first avenger lacks the popcorn entertainment of a regular mcu film but is watchable because of chris evans performance and good presentation of 1940s.",7,0,0,10 March 2020
Baby Driver," Good heist thriller
","I saw baby driver for my crush lily James but eventually got fascinated with its plot. A good story filled with car chase, peppy music and a roller coaster last act. My lily James didn't disappoint me. She is very beautiful and had a good chemistry with baby. The actual show stealer was Jamie fox. On the whole, baby driver is an enjoyable film.",10,0,2,4 October 2019
Justice League," #releasethesnydercut
","I saw the theatrical version of justice league and felt it as a blatant copy of avengers. After that I saw it's first trailer before Snyder's exit, I felt how awesome it would be if the original version released. One element whedon forgot to add which was one of the reasons for the success of avengers is chemistry between the actors. Avengers had memorable chemistry of tony-cap, tony-banner, thor-hulk, nat-cap, nat-banner and nat-clint. But here there is no chemistry between the leads at all. Batman, aquaman and cyborg were wasted.
Many hate Snyder's style but the fact is he does it with ðŸ’“. He had a clear vision about dceu with the 5 films (mos,bvs and JL trilogy) he had in mind. But after his exit the whole dceu is in mess. First, wb messed with bvs and now with JL. Please release the Snyder cut in hbo max.",1,21,35,11 February 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Best terminator film
","I felt the first terminator film pretty average as I found the plot very thin. In first terminator, arnie was a cyborg from future who comes to kill sarah connor.
In judgment day, arnie plays a cyborg from future who comes to protect sarah connor's son john connor from another evil cyborg this time.
When a negative character turns into a positive one then audience will love them like never before. That's the main reason why everyone loves judgment day so much. Arnie is perfect as terminator. Sarah connor this time is in a mental asylum due to the shocking events she had to face in the first terminator. In the first part, she was bit naive and confused but in judgment day she's badass. Edward furlong is quite over aged as john connor. He was a teenager at that time but the character demanded an 8 year old kid. Robert patrick was menacing as the villain.
My favorite scenes were terminator saving john connor in the beginning and terminator and john saving sarah from mental hospital.
But soon after the escape from mental hospital scene film gets slowed down and the ending drags a lot. Also due to the later sequels, the emotional climax reduces its impact.
On the whole, judgment day is a best sequel. The terminator theme from this I always hum around.",8,0,0,16 March 2020
Spider-Man," With great origin comes a great superhero
","I saw spiderman after watching 2 and 3. First part is my personal favourite because it very well sets the base for the characters. While 2 was the most loved spidey film, 3 was the most hated spidey film and 1 gets sandwiched between them. Director sam raimi doesn't waste much time and within 5 minutes of the film our lead peter parker gets injected by a radiogenetic spider and rest I don't need to tell. Initially, peter uses the powers for his personal gains. But uncle ben's death and his last words to him 'With great power comes great responsibility' inspires peter to use it for the people. Thus he becomes the friendly neighborhood spiderman and locks horns with green goblin aka norman osborn. Tobey maguire was best as peter parker. His innocence really wins our hearts especially the scene where he calls himself the human spider. As spiderman, he may not be witty but he was physically fit in those acrobatic moves. Kirsten dunst was the perfect eye candy and always played a pivotal role in the ending of all 3 films by getting kidnapped. William dafoe was terrific as green goblin and his voice gives us chills. Action scenes and graphics are very good. Only drawback I felt was in the end is when mj proposes to pete and they kiss but peter says her that I can only be your friend. Well if he wanted her only as a friend then why didn't he stop her from kissing? But ignoring those things I would say spiderman is my favourite spidey film and i love raimi trilogy.",10,1,1,5 December 2019
Dunkirk," A film with so many No's
","I am a huge fan of Nolan. I missed to watch Dunkirk on theatres so I checked its world television premiere and after watching it I felt disappointed. First let me talk about the good. Plot is superb, Hans zimmer music delivers the tension, cinematography is very good and art direction is brilliant. Now coming to negatives. There is no script at all. No character development. When the film ends you won't remember a single character except tom hardy that's just because he's the only familiar face. Despite having an intriguing plot you won't feel any thrill. Nor you feel emotional in any scene. And the worse part is it does not have violence and bloodshed. A war film without violence or bloodshed is like a food without salt. On the whole, Dunkirk had a very great idea but Nolan failed in execution. Even Michael bay could have made it thrilling.",4,7,10,17 December 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Avengers 3 excluding Thor and hulk
","In 2016, DC and marvel came up with their superhero vs superhero film. First DC came with dawn of justice which failed both critically and commercially. So eyes went on captain america civil war whether it meets their expectations or not. Does it meet?Plus:
1. Conflict point:
The biggest plus point of civil war is the conflict point shown between Steve rogers and Tony stark which would leave you confused to take sides unless you are a fanboy. If you have seen previous MCU movies you will understand the motive of the characters. If you have seen winter soldier you will know that cap was in a situation where he couldn't trust anyone other than himself. His insecurity towards the government forces him not to sign the accords. And if you have seen age of ultron and iron man 3 you understand that tony is regretting for his hasty creation of ultron which lead to several casualties and damage. Also he is upset with his temporary breakup with pepper for whom he destroyed all his suits and wanted to settle down with her. I was like in a position of black widow who is though in Tony's side still shows a soft corner towards cap.
2. Robert Downey Jr:
Among performances it's rdj who once again shines as tony stark. In this you get to see an entirely different tony stark who is not humorous and reckless but practical and emotional. Despite not being the main lead, RDJ leaves a mark with his performance.
3. Villain zemo:
Zemo is an underrated villain where audience don't realize that without any superpowers or extraordinary human strength successfully rip apart the avengers.
4. Airport battle:
The airport battle between team cap and team iron man is the main highlight of civil war. The interaction and action choreography was kickass.
5. Direction:
Though Russo brothers direction is not racy like winter soldier, it successfully helps in building the tension.
6. Climax fight:
The climax fight of civil war is very emotional which makes you divided. On one hand you can feel the rage of tony and on the other hand you can feel the desperation of cap to protect his friend from his teammate and friend. The climax fight makes both cap and iron man fans emotional. When I was watching I felt like shouting 'STOP FIGHTING'Minus:
1. The color tone of the film is dull at times. It is greyish which does not really suit the film.
2. When black panther came to know zemo's intention why he didn't stop cap and tony from fighting?Verdict:
Captain america civil war is more an avengers film than a cap film. It gives you everything which bvs failed to give you. It has emotions, friendship, tension, politics and loads of action. A successful rehearsal for infinity war.",10,0,0,18 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Goodbye avengers
","Endgame was the most hyped film of the season for three reasons. One is the shocking anti climax of infinity war which ends with a cliffhanger. Second it was rumored to be the last film of most of our favorite characters due to various reasons so fans were mentally preparing themselves to see them for the last time and say them goodbye. And last is that the makers remained tightlipped regarding the film which increased the curiosity level of the audience.
With all the hype, does endgame meet your expectations? Let's find out.Positives:
The film is divided into three acts. Though the first act is slow its very intense and emotional. The second act was the most entertaining where time travelling is done as it has many funny moments. And the third act was action packed which provide you goosebumps and in end makes you emotional.Now let's talk about our favorite characters.1. Iron man: With 3 standalone movies, main lead in all avengers films, second lead in civil war, a cameo in incredible hulk and an extended cameo in homecoming, RDJ kept on earning the love of audience making him the God of MCU. In endgame, he once again win your hearts. Your heartbreaks when you see him skinny and weak in the beginning. He had some heartwarming moments with his daughter and also when he hugs his father while time travelling. And in the end when he snaps saying his epic line 'I am iron man' and dies he nails a heroic image among audience. Don't know how MCU will be without him. We love you 3000.
2. Captain America: My favorite character in MCU. In 8 years cap's character was constant being a serious, mature and no nonsense Steve Rogers. In first avenger and the avengers everyone felt him as a boring character. But in winter soldier, he proved that he can be badass like James bond and Ethan hunt. In age of ultron he got a bit sidelined whereas though civil war was his film audience saw it as an avengers film. Plus, he earned the wrath of iron man fans for hiding Tony's parents murder and they mocked him saying that if bucky wasn't there then iron man would have killed him in the end. Later in infinity war he got less significance though he was given a great intro. In endgame, he plays a very crucial role who keeps on motivating his friends. And I thank Russo brothers for giving him the most epic scene where he lift Thor's mjolinir. That scene showed what cap is worthy of. And he gets a happy ending where he time travels and goes back to Peggy. Thank you Chris Evans for making Captain America my favorite character.
3. Black widow: though we miss her badass action in endgame she wins our hearts for sacrificing herself for the soul stone. Especially the fight between her and Clint to die for soul stone is tension packed.Negatives:
I can't believe how Russo brothers ruined the character of Thor whose fan following grew leaps and bounds with ragnarok and infinity war making him the second favorite avenger. I understand that he was depressed for not going for the head and it was fine showing him as a fat drunkard but in the end at least he could have given him some elevation. I liked professor hulk but we missed his smash. Also we wanted a rematch of him and thanos. Time travel concept is confusing and compared to infinity war, thanos character was less explored here.Verdict:
On the whole, endgame is a highly entertaining and engaging film despite being for 3 hours. But compared to infinity war it was not that satisfying. It will be a treat for iron man and cap fans. Thank you avengers for entertaining us for 7 years.",9,1,5,11 May 2019
No Country for Old Men," Watch it for Javier bardem
","No country for old men is watchable only for Javier bardem as a cold blooded serial killer who whenever appears on the screen sets a chill down your spine.

Before Sunset," An underwhelming reunion
","9 years after the events of before sunrise, Celine meets Jesse at his book launch in France. In the end of before sunrise they promised that they will meet in Vienna again after 6 months. But Celine doesn't show up because of her grandma's demise. So after they meet we find out that Jesse is married with a son and Celine is dating a photo journalist. They then travel around France sharing their past experiences until Jesse has to catch his return flight in evening.
I loved before sunrise as I feel its a best love story I have ever seen. In sunrise they spent a whole day together and part ways the next day. So as a audience we also feel like we have spent a memorable day with them. But in sunset we get a feeling of an unsatisfied one day picnic we have on Sundays because they spend very less time together. Another drawback I felt was with its abrupt ending without any proper conclusion. And last thing I felt disappointed was that Jesse and Celine don't have the same chemistry which they had in sunrise. But there are some great scenes. My favorite scene was in the cab where Celine shows her frustration of not being in a committed relationship and in return Jesse talks about his failing marriage and both wanting but unable to touch each other. On the whole, before sunset falls on those category of sequels which only partially captures the magic of its predecessor.",7,0,0,11 December 2019

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Interesting story
","The curious case of Benjamin button narrates the life story of Benjamin button who ageing is in reverse order. I was wondering whether reverse ageing is scientifically proven but no its fictional. The highlight of Benjamin button is definitely its different plot which makes you curious to watch till end. The make up, vfx, direction, cinematography, art direction is topnotch. Brad Pitt looked really handsome and dashing when Benjamin button is young. Care blanchett gave a brilliant performance. But like every fincher film, this too suffers from long runtime. Also you don't get emotionally attached to any character because Benjamin button is not any Forrest gump. On the whole, the curious case of Benjamin button can be tried for its interesting plot.",8,0,0,24 June 2019
Transformers," Absolute torture
","Transformers is the most atrocious and torturing experience of my life. Every moment, I was watching, i wished to end soon. But, NO. The great michael bay dragged it into a 150 minute torture. How cool you make the action scenes, but if there is no proper situation build up and right emotion in it, then its a total failure. There is no character development, no kind of relationship developed between shia and the transformers. Cheap jokes and uninteresting subplots tests my patience to the core. But the biggest culprit are the audience who made this crap successful and inspired bay to turn it into a franchise.",1,0,0,12 June 2020
Coco," Family comes first
",I have seen several Disney/Pixar films which are light hearted and feel good. I enjoy them but easily forget and not really bother to rewatch it. But that's not the case with coco. There is something in coco which I feel to watch again and again. A pretty good story with the backdrop of Mexican culture and has lots of adventures and music. A twist in the tale makes you realise the importance of family. Then follows a fun pre climax and emotional climax. On the whole coco is a must watch for families.,10,0,0,20 September 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Pretty good origin
","Sorcerer stone is a pretty good film which introduces us with harry potter and his friends. Just like the kids in Hogwarts, audience are also in awe with the magic. But I felt that this lacked a story which is only revealed towards end. But still this is my second most favorite harry potter film after chamber of secrets.",8,1,1,9 August 2019
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," My favorite harry potter movie
","Chamber of secrets is my favorite among the harry potter series. It has lots of fun,adventure, thrill and of course MAGIC. My favorite scene is where Ron spits worms.",9,0,0,24 July 2019
Wonder Woman," Wonderful woman
","Kudos for makers to cast the stunning gal gadot as Diana as by looking at her you will say what a wonder. Gadot deserves lot of appreciation as she performed during reshoot while being five months pregnant. Story is simple, direction is neat and action scenes are decent. Tone of the film is neither dark nor light. On the whole wonder woman gives wonders to dceu.",10,4,16,14 July 2019
Step Up," Dancing with romance
",Step up narrates the love story of street dancer Tyler and ballet dancer Nora. Loved the chemistry of Jenna dawan and Channing Tatum. Jenna dawan is very charming and great dancer. Tatum was good in hip hop but looked uncomfortable in ballet. Step up also gives us a message that crime never pays. Only drawback I felt its predictable. On the whole step up is decent dance film.,9,0,0,14 June 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," A decent conclusion to an epic trilogy
","Christopher Nolan who gave a new dimension to the caped crusader gives a decent conclusion to his Batman trilogy. Bale, Caine, oldman, freeman all shine in their roles for one last time. Hardy was terrific as bane though nowhere near joker. Anne Hathaway was badass as Catwoman. The twist in climax was pretty good. I liked the way batman escapes the cave.
But Nolan could not do anything to set the bar high for dark Knight in this. Its watchable but forgettable.",7,0,1,30 June 2019
Toy Story 3," Best toy story film ever
",The ending is enough to make toy story 3 the best film of the series. The climax can make anybody emotional. Toy story 3 has a very good story. It has all the elements intact you liked in the previous films. Best CGI animation film ever.,10,0,0,8 July 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Most forgettable mcu film
","When I first saw the dark world, I was not familiar with the mcu. So I felt it as a passable action film. But now I am somewhat a scholar in mcu. And now when I look back i feel dark world as the most forgettable one how much I ever try to rewatch. Only good things are tom hiddleston and some action spectacle. When you finish watching it one wouldn't remember any scene from it.",2,0,2,3 May 2020
The Sixth Sense," A very good thriller
","Sixth sense directed by NRI M night shyamalan is the story of Cole who can see dead people's spirit and how a psychologist helps him to overcome his paranoid. The whole movie belongs to Haley Joel who steals the show as the gifted Cole. Bruce Willis shed his action hero image and delivers a class performance. The best scene is the conversation between Cole and his mom which is so emotional. And the climax is another feather in its cap. On the whole, sixth sense is a must watch.",10,1,1,22 June 2019
Cinderella," Love you Cinderella
","Cinderella is a very lovely and feel good film. You will fall in love with the beauty,grace and innocence of Cinderella. The mice characters give some comic relief. Only drawback I felt was that her romance with the prince could have been well developed. Otherwise you will love Cinderella.",9,1,2,4 June 2019
Aladdin," A movie which turns me into a kid
","When I was a child, during eid holidays Disney channel was added in my TV for three days and in that I got to see Aladdin cartoon. I don't remember any story or scenes but the only thing I remembered was that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Years later, when I was watching TV I was checking the info of coming programmes in a movie channel and I saw there was Aladdin so I thought to check it out that time though I never had any idea of the 1992 film. And when I started watching I got surprised to see those same cartoon characters I saw in my childhood. Looked like my childhood came back.
The biggest plus point of Aladdin is its mesmerizing and fascinating hand drawn animation which transports you to another world. The next plus point is its humor and light hearted treatment. All the characters shown in this film I love a lot. Charming Aladdin, stunning Jasmine, cute like a Teddy bear Abubu, cunning Jafar and his idiotic sidekick iago, greedy but lovable Abu, helpful magic carpet and the wholesome entertainer Genie(thanks to the super energetic Robin Williams). Last but not the least to mention is the songs which goes well with the narrative. I love all the songs especially Arabian nights, friend like me, Prince Ali and whole new world.
Aladdin is the best animation movie in the world, and the best Disney film. I don't why today's Disney films don't have the magic of Aladdin.
On the whole, Aladdin is a film which nobody will hate unless you don't have a kid inside you.",10,1,1,4 March 2019
Rockstar," Good story and good heroine would have made this epic
","Plus:
1. Ranbir Kapoor performance
2. SongsMinus:
1. Story
2. Message
3. Worst heroine
4. Slow
5. Too long
6. No universal appealVerdict:
Rockstar would have been a heart touching love story if it had a good heroine and story. Also its message that a true artist comes with pain and suffering is wrong. A true artist comes with passion, hardwork and dedication",5,0,1,12 February 2019
Furious 7," The best film in the series
","Ff7 is a well packaged action entertainer. It has a racy narration which does not give you time to think. Though over the top, all of them are well choreographed be it rock Vs statham, walkers cliff jumping and Dubai fight scene. Ramsey is a new addition. And of course it's a perfect farewell for Paul walker. We will miss you Paul.",10,1,2,6 September 2019
