Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A Ripping Yarn, but more than that... 'it is exceptional' - one for the family
","You know... sometimes when you watch a film... in the first few minutes, it is clear that the film is going to be special.It doesn't have to be deeply significant, possessing social commentary. Every genre has the potential to be 'done well'... and this film meets those expectations.Holmes: portrayed so many times... yet here we have another great interpretation (along with his relationship with Watson), perfect for putting a smile on your face.This time, perhaps a more realistic approach... no excessive concentration on deduction, we see Holmes with all his weaknesses, but overall, a man of adventure. Perfectly matched to the gorgeously overcast portrayal of Victorian London, yet sublimely mixed with explosive action more typically associated with a Bond movie.No obnoxious violence, sex, or swearing... no need for any of that. It's just a great film for everybody in the family. Enjoy.",10,2,5,27 September 2013
Lone Survivor," Appalling - try and last through the first 40 minutes
","Is it a spoiler to say that a 'navy seals' film will show them training, in the opening credits (as per usual)?What about that.... we are forced to then listen to utterly ridiculous conversations? ... and then an utterly ridiculous first meeting with the new guy?The scenes that play out have no connection to the tough guy opening credits... the mandatory training scenes instead lead us to a bunch of guys acting like as if they are in a drama class..... think of something to talk about, and then run with it.While you may not throw up into the bucket that you've sensibly put beside you.... it comes close.I watched this with my 17 year old son, and we were groaning from the start, and groaned even more when we got to the obligatory argument.Can it be the case, that this is representative of the navy seals? I truly hope not.Who calls the shots on these movies? Was the Director Peter Berg, just a 'yes' man, or was it his own non-creative talent, that caused him to regurgitate what we've all seen before.The last Afghan war movie I watched was Kajaki (based upon a true story) - different, engrossing, and believable.Lone Survivor is meant also to be based upon a true story, with all the ingredients for a great film.What a shame that the audience is completely turned off in the first half hour.If you want to watch this movie, my strong advice would be to give it its best chance, and avoid completely the first 30 minutes.Otherwise, just give it a miss.",3,1,2,11 September 2015
