Requiem for a Dream," Ugh.
","Glad I saw this film.  Never want to see it again in my life. I'm not sure why Hubert Selby Jr. has taken it upon himself to present us these basically likable people and subject them to such nerve-ripping torture and misery.  Sadism, perhaps? This is not to say that there aren't beautiful elements in the film.  I could go for miles on the 'Summer' section.  Ellen Burstyn's speech on growing old and being alone is extraordinarily sad, and the friendship between Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans is a true joy.  Wayans' energy is simply wonderful.  And Jennifer Connelly?  Oh, my.  It truly is a shame that there aren't more women out there with her looks and her energy, and confidence and sexuality.  It's even more shameful that the ones who are are all spoken for. But I digress. I can understand the point this film makes:  addiction is bad.  (Boy, never heard THAT before!!)  But it also points out many of the legal addictions that many commentators seem to have forgotten:  chocolate, coffee, television, drink, food...longed-for letters in the mailbox, the desire for money, music, sex, love, hope... It would be nice to have some kind of light of hope to hang on to.  But it seems as thought Aronofsky just wants to subject his viewers to nausea, revulsion(do we really need to see a needle jamming into a festering purple sore?  or a sexual degradation done THAT explicitly?!?), and a depression so intense, you just want to jump out the nearest window. Ugh. Nice vision of 'Summer,' Darren.  And incredible artistry and editing.  Now, PLEASE, for the rest of us, give your sadism a rest and give us images of real beauty. I'll settle for ninety minutes of staring at Jennifer Connelly in that red dress at the edge of the pier, or just have her staring at me. But keep me away from movies like this one!",Null,1,1,22 October 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Lame, lame, LAME!!!
","What people see in this utter waste of time, I will never know, or want to know. The only worthwhile thing in this film is Bridget's opera-diva number, where she sings alone to a Celine Dion(?) number.  But since that happens during the opening credits, it sets a bad precedent for the rest of the film. Let's see...Bridget Jones is a vulgar alcoholic with an inferiority complex with a fixation on the wrong kind of man(seriously, do we have to buy this fiction that Hugh Grant is what women want?), turning herself into badly-used goods before our very eyes and she STILL wants our sympathy?  To all women seeing her as a role model, I say GROW THE HELL UP!!! What kind of world are we living in that a man is expected to love a living train wreck like Bridget instead of a REAL woman who has it together and is able to express love for the right kind of man...for once? A waste of time, and a waste of money. I am only glad I didn't read the book, and that after two hours, this rape of my sensibilities was over, and that I never have to be subjected to it again. A 2 out of 10.",Null,0,0,26 November 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Vapid, Tepid, Heartless and Lame
","The Emperor has no clothes on! This is all I have to say for all those who claim this piece of noisy trash is art. If your background involves musical theatre, which consists of barely anything but flash and facial mugging WITH NO HEART OR SUBSTANCE, this is the film for you. The film did exhibit some astounding visual tricks and stunts, to be sure. But just about any Hollywood big-budget production can boast as much.  Just answer me this: Did any of the stunts, tricks, set pieces, or musical numbers, make you feel anything for, or care for, ANY of the characters? My answer is:  NO, it did NOT! This film is the equivalent of that stunning beauty you see at the bar.  You walk up to her, start a conversation, and all that comes out of her mouth is ignorance and stupidity and conversation about her plastic surgery improvements.  Now, that does not bother a lot of people.  Me, it takes a whole lot more than a flashy look and HUZZAH!! facial expressions to impress me. What's left?  A vapid 'love story' with tepid characters, a heartless plot and a LAME movie. I'll say it again: The Emperor has no clothes on!",Null,0,2,6 March 2002
Rules of Engagement," Tell It To The Marines!
","I have a lot of mixed feelings about this film.  I agree with the side that hates it, and I agree, with reservations, with the right-wingers who love it. Let's start with what I don't like. Sure, Jackson and Jones are both strong, honest, and intense in their roles. But honestly, haven't we seen them in the same roles a few times too often already? The film is also very predictable and by the numbers.  There's really nothing in this story line that hasn't already been done a hundred times before in different movies of the week, paperback novels, stage plays, TV episodes... There are a couple of good performances in this film, though.  Ben Kingsley is compelling as always.  How he manages to save his work even in terrible films(remember 'Species?') is a reminder to actors that a bad film doesn't mean you have to do bad work.  Guy Pierce is also strong as the prosecution lawyer making his case against Jackson.  Even though you know he's going to lose(come on, is that really a spoiler? Did you really think Samuel L Jackson was going to go to jail by the end of the movie?), Pierce fights like hell to prove his point.  And it is a strong point. The trouble is, both those roles are underused.  And as the story between Jackson and Jones goes on, I really wanted to know more about Kingsley and Pierce, and what they were thinking.  I never found out, though. What tipped my thumb up on this film, then? The combat sequences and Captain Dale Dye, USMC. Dye is the leader of a movie-combat group called Warriors, Inc.  A Vietnam veteran himself, he choreographed the combat scenes in 'Platoon,' 'Forrest Gump' and 'Saving Private Ryan,' among others.  And his work in the massacre sequence made the whole movie work for me.  It's realistic and very frightening to watch, especially considering the times we live in, and that American troops in Afghanistan will be in situations just like this.  Or worse, horrible as that thought may be. Is it propaganda?  Yes.  But that's Hollywood. Is it mediocre?  Yes.  But again, that's Hollywood, mostly. Is it irrelevant?  No.  Watch the combat scene, take your problems with it, and tell it to the Marines.",Null,0,1,4 October 2001
