First Man," Masterpiece! Film-making at Its best!
","This film left an everlasting impression on me! Once I accomplished Watching this film, I cried literally! It occurs very seldom with me! But this film left me flabbergasted & spellbinded!
In fact I can say it emphatically that this is one of my top 5 films of all time!
My admiration for Ryan Gosling has reached to Zenith after watching this film! They way he portrayed Neil Armstrong with utmost conviction & comprehensiveness is commendable! That last bracelet scene was a poetic masterpiece, infact that scene is one the finest moments of cinema I have ever witnessed! MESMERIZING is the word! This film deserves all the awards & accolades! Ryan Gosling deserves an Oscar for it! The BEST FILM EVER!",10,1,2,8 January 2019
