The Blair Witch Project," A totally gripping creeper! Don't expect a cinematic experience, just a psychological chiller.
","I've read so many quibbles about this movie already. When I saw the actually movie tonight I was perplexed by what I'd read. I was completely and totally creeped out by this movie! It was 90 degrees outside the theater when I left, yet I was covered in goose bumps and shivering from chills up and down my spine. I guess if you think too much about the story you'll find things that don't make sense to you. I didn't even try. I suspended my disbelief and really let myself get absorbed by what was taking place. It felt real to me and when the film reached its climax, I was just blown away. The ending was so quick and left so many unanswered questions that my mind was reeling.
Very few movies truly scare me. With most scary films I'm ultimately quite aware of the cinematic process which occurs to create a movie. With The Blair Witch Project, I really felt as though this could have actually taken place to these actual 'film makers'. Now THAT'S truly frightening.",10,2,3,1 August 1999
