The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Love This Movie!
","This is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. The acting in this movie is sublime. One of my favorite parts of a movie is the music. This movie has, by far, one of the best soundtracks of any movie ever made. I have always thought that Logan Lerman was an exquisite actor, but he has reached a whole new level of genius with this movie. Emma Watson is one of those actresses that unfortunately has been type cast by her portrayal of Hermione Granger, but her acting is so new and refreshing in this film, that you completely forget about her even being affiliated with the Harry Potter franchise. I have watched this film several times looking for a flaw, and I'm happy to say, one does not exist. Everything, from the writing, cinematography, production, and acting in this movie is one of a kind. I was hesitant to watch this film for the first time, but this will go down in history as one of my favorite films of all time. Kudos to the entire crew!",10,0,1,13 July 2013
Minority Report," wonderful
","Well, it is now 2013, and I have finally watched this movie for the first time. I was surprised at how much i enjoyed it. Wonderful graphics, great imagery, and incredible editing. Spielberg did an excellent job directing this film. Not a huge fan of Cruise, but he did a wonderful job in this movie as well. I can honestly say, without a doubt, this movie was not at all what I expected, and I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it. I will definitely be watching this movie again very soon. If you haven't had the opportunity to view this film yet please do yourself a favor and watch it. I have learned recently not to let my displeasure of one or two cast members dissuade me from watching a film. This is something I have done in the past, and it has made me miss out on many good films.I give this movie 10 stars!",10,0,1,31 May 2013
The Book Thief," Flawless
","I cannot even begin to explain all the emotions I felt while watching this delightful movie. First and foremost, the cast is phenomenal. The casing director should win an award for the amazing casting of this movie....every role was cast with perfection.Movies like this such as The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, The Pianist, Angela's Ashes, etc. always fascinate me, but this movie stood out from them all, as far as I am concerned. Lets start with the cast. Geoffrey Rush will always be one of the best actors that ever lived (in my book), and I have never had the privilege of watching a movie he was in that I did not love. Sophie NÃ©lisse who plays Liesel (the lead character) was a breath of fresh air, and should definitely be nominated for her role in this film. Emily Watson, who plays Liesel's adopted mother, plays her role to perfection. Even Nico Liersch, who plays Rudy (Liesel's best friend) is one of the most amazing child actors I have ever seen.This film is a roller coaster ride of emotions from the beginning to the end. It has the ability to pull you in every direction then jerk you back to reality. Happiness, sadness, hope, fear, love, sorrow, sympathy, and hate are merely a few of the emotions you will have during this two hour extravaganza.I have to say the ending really caught me off guard, and I love the way they had 'Death' narrate it from his perspective. This is one of those movies that you watch, and it makes you want to be a better person. It is a wonderful movie for families to watch together, and should be mandatory material for all middle school students.On a scale of 1 - 10, I would give this movie 11 stars if I could!",10,0,1,29 March 2015
We're the Millers," Wow...Surprisingly great
","I have to say that I agree with every other reviewer on this film. I really went into this movie thinking that it was going to be another dumb comedy. One of those stupid comedies with stupid one liners and ridiculous antics. I expected to hate it, but boy was I wrong. Normally I can't stand movies like this, but this movie was surprisingly amazing. Jennifer Aniston has definitely redeemed herself in my eyes, and Jason Sudeikis was a breath of fresh air. I had no idea who Jason Sudeikis was coming into this show. I don't watch SNL ever because, as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been funny since the original cast of Belushi, Radner, Aykroyd, and Curtin. This guy was amazing and witty, and lead this entire movie to victory. You can just tell by watching him, that Jason Sudeikis is not only a great actor, but brilliant in real life. I am watching this movie again for a second time and felt compelled to write a review. I'm not going to go into any specifics because I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I urge you to watch this movie....especially if you (like me) go into it with very low hopes. You will be as surprised as I was how enjoyable it is.",8,4,9,24 November 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Loved It
","I have to say that I was completely surprised by this movie. This was a very fun movie, with great one-liners, and incredible costumes/make-up. I thought this was going to be your typical low budget thrasher film, boy was I wrong. I went into this movie with very low expectations, and came out feeling wonderful and thoroughly entertained. This is one film that I would love to see many sequels added. The acting was much better than I expected, and I found myself laughing several times throughout this movie. Don't pay any attention to the critics on this one....They are dead wrong. I thought that Jeremy Renner was great in this film, and Gemma Arterton made a fantastic Gretel. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go and see it. You will enjoy it as much as I did.",10,4,7,8 July 2013
