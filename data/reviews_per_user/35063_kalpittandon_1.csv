Men in Black 3," Movie Review : Men in Black III
","It has been a decade since the guys in black dazzled the cinema goers with slick action, dizzying aliens and tongue in cheek comedy. It was indeed fascinating to see whether the director, Barry Sonnenfeld with the same crew but a d√©butant screenwriter, Lowell Cunningham will be able to reignite a dormant franchise and make the cash counter running by delivering a blockbuster.Agent J (Will Smith) and agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) have been together since last 15 years. They account for the safety of our planet, throws in slapstick humor against each other and take care of the extraterrestrial activities happening in our realm. When a long lost enemy, Boris the Animal, played eccentrically by Jemaine Clement, goes back in time to kill Agent K, Agent J decides to take a trip down the same lane and stop the inevitable.The obsessively detailed aliens, enormous set pieces, spectacular action sequences and the eye popping 3D, the director and our duo has scored a home run. But the most enthralling of all the achievements is the balance between the technical aspects and the human heart. The two veterans shine with an electrifying chemistry all the way and are in top form.Where the movie falters is in its script. It leaves the viewer with a been-there-done-that kind of feeling. It never justifies its existence. It definitely is better than the limp sequel, MIB II (2002), but does not quite match up to the heights of the very first outing. A bit more creative climax would definitely have given more juice to the proceedings.Men in Black III works in parts. It will keep your popcorns churning, but will leave you wanting for more. And when the curtains go down, you definitely won't require neutralizing your memory. It deserves a watch!Rating- 3/5",5,3,7,26 May 2012
