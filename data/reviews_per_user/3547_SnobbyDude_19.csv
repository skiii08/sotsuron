Catch Me If You Can," An OK movie with an OK story
","My 'One line Summary' says it all.  It's based on a true story, but the problem is that the true story isn't interesting enough to make a movie out of.  I found myself checking my watch in this one. There are some moments that are charming, and I think the casting was good. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job and I thought Tom Hanks was also pretty good.  I do, however, think something is wrong when someone asks you how you liked a movie and all you can think of saying is 'well, it's cool that all that stuff really happened'.  There are a lot of interesting stories that make for great movies.  Goodfellas is a great example.",5,0,5,11 July 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," I'm torn over this one
","This is one of those movies that you really want to like.  It's unbelievably well-made and succeeds on many levels:-It looks great.-It sounds great.-It is well acted.-It has great special effects.-It has a great plot.-It has good action scenes.
Despite all of these good points, something just didn't work for me.  The pacing was off and I found it too long.  I think it would be a much better movie if it were 1/2 an hour shorter.  I found myself checking my watch several times-not a good thing.The length of the movie offset most of the good points for me and I gave the movie a 6/10.  It was really hard for me to submit the vote.  I could tell that someone really labored over this movie and tried to sweat the details. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how hard film makers work on their craft if it fails to deliver the goods, right?",6,0,2,30 July 2003
X-Men," Good movie, but could have been better
","I give this movie an 8.  I give it credit for being the first movie to get the public into comic book movies again.  What about Batman?  Batman was followed up by a string of such lousy sequels, I think it the whole franchise eventually annoyed people and it wound up hurting the genre rather than helping it.  X-men made these movies fun again.I think it was a good movie, but it was a little bit too short and I still wish they didn't have a generation gap between characters that isn't supposed to exist.  The whole concept of having a machine that makes mutants was a little silly too.The good points of this movie far outweigh the bad and there is a lot of great acting.  Hugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine.  I am looking forward to seeing more of these movies in the future and will be one of the first people in line for the 3rd x-men movie.",8,0,0,24 June 2003
Cloverfield," Cloverfield Lost Connection? That's really what is driving the hype.
","I believe the hype of this movie is being driven by some of the LOST mania. In an interview with JJ Abrams, before the premiere of the movie, he said there are a few LOST connections in there. That's all you really need to do to make anything a success - just say there is a lost connection. You don't even need to have a good product.'Eyes Wide Shut' was a movie produced by the late, great Stanley Kubrick. Like Abrams, he had a cult following and everyone went to see his movies based on the reputation he had in Hollywood of being a genius. Stanley Kubrick's last movie was terrible and if it was put out there by anyone else it would have been a huge flop. Because of the Kubrick name and the hype associated with it, EWS was much more of a success than it should have been.Similarly, Cloverfield isn't a good movie. There is really no plot, no character development, no ground breaking cinematography, no fine acting moments. The special effects were decent, but not really any better or worse than any other Hollywood flick out there. It's the first movie I've ever reviewed where I don't have to worry about spoilers because there is no plot to spoil. Everyone knows it's a film where you see a monster destroying a city and not much else.Another thing that adds to the frustration of watching Cloverfield is that the camera is so shaky it will make you physically ill. Everyone I was with got sick in the theater. I can recall at least three times where the motion sickness got so intense I had to close my eyes until the nausea passed. Then I would open my eyes and the nausea would set in again and I'd have to close my eyes again. Even though my eyes were closed for what seemed like a large portion of the movie, it didn't really make any difference because nothing happened to advance the plot because there wasn't one.If you really need a lost fix this badly, just spend the night re-watching a season of lost. You'll find some hints and clues you haven't seen before and you won't make yourself physically ill from motion sickness in the process.",1,24,68,20 January 2008
LÃ©on: The Professional," I thought the short version was better...
","My high rating is reserved for the 26-minute shorter US version.  I first watched the USA version and wanted to see the full, uncut version of the movie.  I now wish I had never satisfied my curiosity.  The international version of this movie has all sorts of scenes in it which made me a little uncomfortable and I found myself, at times, wanting to turn my head or cover my ears.  This is coming from someone who can watch one horror movie after another and not be the least bit disturbed.  In addition to the awkwardness I felt, I also found myself checking my watch.  It's almost like sitting down and eating your favorite meal and over eating.  You walk away feeling less satisfied than you would have with a smaller portion.  None of this means that the international version is a bad movie.  It's still magnificent, and probably the best action movie ever.  This is just one of those rare cases where less is more.",10,1,3,19 January 2003
The Italian Job," Slick movie
","This is a pretty slick movie.  The characters are great and the whole movie has an 'A-Team' feel to it.  It's well acted, filmed well, and the dialog and story is great.  The action scenes are exciting and clever and the action will have you at the edge of your seat.  Recommended.",8,0,0,14 June 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better than T2, almost as great as the first Terminator.
","I'm going to try to do my best to make it sound like I'm not on Arnold's payroll.  This was quite a remarkable movie. I liked it better then T2 because I thought the dialog was better in some places.  T2 has in inkling of cheesyness in some of the dialog, but nothing that reaches the heights of cheesyness we had to endure with Cameron's Titanic.  I also though it had more solid acting, for the most part. Kudos to Arnold for being able to whip himself into shape for this role! Does this man ever age? One thing I wondered about is why they never explained why this cyborg was female.  Also, isn't it a step backwards from the robot we saw in the last movie?  I thought the liquid metal guy was much more scary. Despite these niggles, it's still a great flick.",10,1,2,7 July 2003
American Beauty," Ouch! Someone has an ax to grind
","I'd hate for a foreigner to see this movie and say 'so, that's what suburban families are like in the USA'I think someone really has it in for Americans.  A completely inaccurate picture is painted of what is supposed to be a typical American family.  I feel like it's a bit of a cheap shot and wouldn't be surprised at all if a foreigner (obviously jealous of our standard of living) was responsible for this film.  Every character in this movie is a despicable sociopath with no morals whatsoever.  I've never met a family like this and am glad.I felt like I was at an impasse when rating this movie because it is so detached from reality and is a bit forceful in the 'America is bad' message. On the other hand, it is very well-acted and filmed.  I gave it an 8 for being such a well-made film, knocking a few points off for issues mentioned above.",8,0,1,2 April 2004
Spider-Man," Good, but not perfect
","This was a great movie.  I remember seeing it a couple of times in theaters and telling everyone to go see it.  The story is great-I thought the twist in the beginning was great where Peter Parker learns that ignoring his responsibility (with great power comes great responsibility) causes grief in his personal life.  I hear that this is similar to what happened to him in the comics as well, but I wouldn't know, having never read the comic.  I also loved the action scenes.  I understand that a lot of CGI was used, but I have no idea where it was used.  It's all transparent to me, so I think they did a pretty convincing job.  I'm glad that the action was fast and they didn't recycle that slow-motion action that was first seen in the matrix.  Watching someone leap in the air, have the camera stop, and pan is now a trick that has outstayed its welcome.  Fast action conveys a sense of urgency and excitement and is suits this movie.There are a few strikes against this movie.  One thing I wasn't crazy about was the sugar-coated feel of it.  There are a number of scenes that feel like they were tweaked to lure in the teenaged girls.  I found myself cringing at some scenes that were a little cheesy and I didn't feel that happening in some of the other, more recent superhero movies.  It doesn't reach the heights of cheesyness that Titanic does, but I would have liked a more serious spiderman.  It doesn't have to be as serious as the Hulk or Daredevil, but maybe something in between would feel right.  I would also like a more interesting villain, with a real motive for his behavior.  The costume was a little silly too...I just wasn't afraid of him.  A good villain should instill fear in your heart.  Maybe these issue will be addressed in Spiderman 2.I'd give this movie a 10 and subtract a point for some of the dialog and the power-ranger outfit of the goblin.",9,1,2,20 July 2003
American History X," Something didn't quite click....
","I'm all over the place in evaluating this movie because the movie is a mess also. It's got a lot of good qualities and just as many bad ones.When you read the reviews of this movie, many people get the feel that it is a technical mess. I agree, that it was a technical mess too. I did enjoy it overall, but I didn't find it as enjoyable as it should have been. I have been thinking about this for a few days now since I have seen it. What was missing? I think it tries to bite off more than it can chew and that is its biggest weakness. It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions. The film is considerably bogged down by trying to solve a lot issues and emotion is lost. The focus of the entire story is shifted. Then we wind up with a complicated mess of answers, which, for me, raised more questions, because I wasn't sure I was satisfied with the answers/solutions I was given. It is a good film with great performances, especially by Norton. This is usually the kind of movie I don't enjoy watching because I'm not usually big on films and filmmakers that have an ax to grind. I like to watch movies for entertainment, not to feel like I'm being taught/lectured to. Do I sound like I am having a hard time making up my mind about this movie?I am!I liked it, but I can't put it on my list of top movies because it was too predictable and not very believable. I predicted the ending in the about 10 minutes before it happened and knew what was going to happen in the flashbacks every step of the way. Another thing I was wondering about was realism....I don't live in CA, and have never been to the bad areas, but is it possible that black gang-members would ever play basketball in Venice (I think it was Venice) with Neo Nazi's? I didn't think that scene was realistic. Also, the movie makes it sound like Neo Nazis are a real threat to society, but how many skinheads are there? I've never met one before, let alone seen one... I think, these days, people think being unbiased and objective means looking at 2 groups of people and being equally harsh in judging both of them. Maybe I've lived a sheltered life, but I think in attempting to try to be 'fair', the movie makes with people out to be a much bigger threat to society than they are. Is there anyone in the USA that is afraid to go out at night because of Neo-Nazis? I think, in attempting to be be unbiased, the movie discredits itself and becomes unrealistic. This is a shame, but the bottom line is that this is a VERY complicated subject matter. I doubt anyone could really make a film of this nature without making lots of missteps.Rather than trying to find a solution, they should have let the audience decide what to think. I got annoyed when I was spoon fed the 'hate is baggage line.' Let me figure it out on my own! The best movies are the ones that make you think, not the ones that try to think for you.",6,1,3,28 March 2003
Independence Day," Not THAT awful when you think about it....
","Yes, this is a bad movie.  Yes, it was the start of several similar movies like it where there is no story and just a lot of special effects.  Yes, the 'plot' makes no sense and seems like something a 5 year old would come up with.  There is also cheesy dialog that only Titanic can match- another flashy dud.  I still can't bring myself to label this as 'the worst movie I have ever seen'.  Why not?  Because it is, in some ways, refreshingly different.  It also has, despite what everyone else says, some originality if you put the clothes-pin on your nose look closely enough at this stinker. If you see this after the World Trade Center attack, you'll see people coming together in the face of adversity...just like they do when they are faced with overwhelming odds against them.  I had seen this back in 1996 and thought that it was unrealistic that people of all different backgrounds and races/classes pull together and help each other in spite of their differences.  It turns out I was wrong because that is exactly what happened on 9/11/01.  The U.S. military are not the bad guys, for a change.  The main characters are not believable, but they are awesome role models for our young people.  I think that's great!  There is a minimum of profanity or sex either, which is a welcome change.I'm going to go out on a limb here and probably offend a lot of people, but I thought this movie came at just the right time for the USA.  We didn't have a good role model, IMHO, as a leader, so it was refreshing to see a too-good-to-be-true leader as a president in a movie.Despite these good points, it is still a mess of a movie with an awful plot and terrible dialog.  Still, there is a silver lining to every cloud...4/10",4,4,8,7 February 2003
Meet the Fockers," Nothing happened in this movie
","Meet the Parents was about funny events happening and Meet the Fockers was about funny things being said. If Meet the Fockers had a better script with a variety of different jokes, this wouldn't be much of a problem. I enjoyed the first 1/2 hour and was bored during the rest of the movie. I wanted some funny events to transpire, but nothing did. I was hungry for new, different material, but there was none to be found.Maybe I'm alone in feeling this way, but I have a lot more respect for comedians that can make people laugh without relying the sex jokes. I'm OK with a few sex jokes. When 99% of the jokes are sex jokes, it just shows a lack of imagination.",5,1,2,3 January 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," It MUST be great? I MUST be missing something, right?
","It MUST be great?  I MUST be missing something, right?  These are questions that you start asking yourself after seeing this movie.  All of Kubrick's other movies were great, so watching this movie is a bit of a shock to your system.  For a while, I was in denial mode, thinking it HAD to be good and I just didn't get it.  I saw it a few more times on cable and reality set in. This is an awful movie.  What a terrible way to end a legacy.  It's sort of like the sequel that you wish was never made.",2,1,3,30 June 2003
Titanic," Contrived, and in many ways, offensive
","Truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction, and this movie proves it.  Aspiring comedians that take courses on perfecting their art are always told that their real life is a much more interesting place to start than the imagination when writing material.  Why?  Truth is often more interesting than anything that you can come up with on your own.  I think this is the reason why this movie is so contrived and phony.  Rich girl, poor boy, snobby/evil/shallow rich people, noble/happy poor people...can you get any less original?  The stereotypes are offensive as well.  All the Irish people are drinking, partying, poor people, and the rich are all cold-hearted wasps.  Then there is the dialog.  I was cringing at every line and actually felt bad for the actors because they had such awful lines to work with. When I first saw this movie, I thought the lines sounded so bad, in part, because of some poor acting.  Since then, I have seen other movies with Leo in them and can see that he is a good actor, but just had some awful material to work with in Titanic.I wish that the creators of this film used the real story of the titanic as a source of their inspiration.  Instead, the main focus of the movie isn't the titanic or all the real people that lost their lives in this tragedy. The movie is really mostly about a fake love story that reaches new heights of cheesyness.  I think making a movie about two fake people (two fake annoying people) named Jack and Rose makes light of a very real event where many real people died.  I bet every single one of those real people had a more interesting life than Jack and Rose.The movie does, however, have one good thing going for it.  It does have good special effects.  This saves it from getting the lowest possible score. I gave it 2/10",2,3,8,15 January 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," The most disappointing movie I've ever seen
","Notice how I didn't say the worst movie? This is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen because I expected so much more and felt very let down. It isn't, however, the worst film I've seen, but it's pretty close.My last review got deleted by mistake, so I'm just going to give you a quick list of things that are wrong with the movie: -Poorly choreographed fight scenes.-The worst dialog I've ever seen in a film.-Poor acting across the board.-It's pretentious and uninvolving.-No plot.-Lots of characters are introduced that serve no purpose.-The characters all appear to be invincible, so fighting them is pointless, yet they are all always fighting.-There are many recycled gimmicks like bullet time, which was interesting the first time I saw it, but now it's very boring and it's overused shows a lack of imagination.-CGI is overused and not very convincing.-There is no chemistry between any of the characters, particularly the ones that are supposed to be in love.-None of the characters respond in ways that are appropriate, given the situations they face.",1,5,9,25 December 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Where are the risks?
","Many reviews talk about how they don't have words that can describe this movie.  I have the perfect word: vanilla This movie is the Toyota Camry of movies.  Pleasant, but bland.  It doesn't take any risks, just plays it safe and the result is a pleasant experience, but not a satisfying one. I would have liked to see more risks taken.  How about some ground-breaking cinematography?  What if some of the characters pushed the envelope a little further?  Far enough to be accused of overacting by some?  How about a parallel story?  How about SEVERAL parallel stories? What about moving the story at a faster pace?  The beginning of the movie was really quite slow...There is no reason this movie should be more than 2 hours.  I give it only a 7 out of 10 for breaking no new ground.  I think this movie fails to distinguish itself in my memory.",7,2,4,31 December 2002
Bruce Almighty," On par with Jim Carrey's other fun movies
","Ok, so it's not a masterpiece like the Godfather, but it doesn't have to be. The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times. If it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times, it has accomplished its purpose. I laughed out loud and left with a smile.  I feel like I got my money's worth.",7,0,0,27 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Almost perfect!
","This movie is really exciting and action packed.  The first movie laid all the groundwork down and this one picks up from there.  Since we all have seen the first x-men movie, and, for the most part, know and understand what these movies are about, things can and do start with a bang.  I don't know how they filmed the beginning but it is one of the best action sequences I have ever seen. There is a philosophical message here, but the movie leaves a lot of it open to interpretation and it's a better film for that reason.  You don't sit there and feel like you are watching a sermon like you do in Matrix Reloaded. So why is the film, as my summary says, almost perfect and not a perfect 10? I rated the film a 9 because Famke Janssen looked a little too old (or maybe James Marsden looks too young?), and I thought there were one or two lines of weak dialog.  Also, we are going to always be bothered by the 'why didn't he freeze the water?' question at the end. I feel like I'm being picky raising these issues because they are very minor niggles.  It's a pretty solid movie overall and I'm eagerly awaiting the 3rd part of the series.",9,0,0,24 June 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," I wish I walked out of the theater on this one.
","I wish I walked out of the theater on this one.  Silly me...I thought just when I left it would get good.  It never got good.  It was, hands-down, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  If I sat in the theater and left the projector off, I would have had a better time.  At least I wouldn't have had to listen to that awful 'music'.  The characters were so dimwitted...I felt like I was watching monkeys at the zoo.  Really dumb monkeys.Once I recovered from what the Coen brothers had subjected me to, I managed to get home to check the IMDB.  I wanted to see if the word was out on how awful this movie was.  I saw that it was CRIMINALLY over-rated by people that wrote reviews.  These reviews mean a lot.  I usually base my movie viewing decisions IMDB comments.I want to make it very clear that this movie is NOT for everyone.  The Coen brothers have a vocal minority that enjoys their movies.  These are the people that wrote the reviews for this movie.  This is a SMALL minority. This film did not make a lot of money.  When the awful soundtrack was disappearing off the shelves at your local music store, it was this small, vocal minority that was buying it.  If you can, try to listen to some of the songs.  The music does not have any mainstream appeal at all.  You could say the same thing about this entire movie.  I'm sure it's the perfect movie for someone on this planet, just not me, or anyone else I've ever met.",1,6,18,20 January 2003
