"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A lot of fun!
",Don't look for any great plot with this movie. It is just a lot of fun. The banter between the characters is hilarious. Great movie to see in a theatre with other people. Just see with a open mind and you will totally enjoy Pricilla.,Null,1,3,9 January 1999
The Mummy," A lot of fun!
","Ok, for those of you putting down the movie. May I say one thing, 'it's just a movie.' Most of us go to movies to escape and be entertained, The Mummy does just that! Don't overanalyze things. What did you think you were going to get? A remake of Casablanca?The Mummy was great. The story and characters were fun. I got my money's worth. My thanks to the cast and crew of The Mummy.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
Meet Joe Black," Excellent movie...what do the critics know?
","My friend and I really enjoyed this movie. I cannot understand why so many poeople did not care for it. A long movie, but went by far too fast. Brad Pitt and Sir Anthony Hopkins were magnificent. Two of the best actors on screen right now...and possibly ever. The looks Brad would get on his face were so entrancing but childlike. Great ending. A must see movie and purchase on video.",9,0,0,7 January 1999
