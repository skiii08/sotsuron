The Avengers," Amazing
","This movie is amazing. Coming in with all the hype and expectations that it had, and still managing to exceed them. I will never forget the awe I was in when I saw this movie on its opening weekend. The simple yet exciting story, the comedic relief, and the action sequences make this the golden standard for all super hero movies!",9,1,1,23 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Perfection
",This movie was perfect. I'm literally in shock and awe as to how this movie wrapped up 22 movies so perfectly and how all-encompassing it was. The greatest cinematic event of my time. All that's left to say is thank you for the ride MCU.,10,1,6,26 April 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," I just don't understand
","Maybe I just don't understand British humor... but this movie is not funny. In fact, it's not good in any way, shape, or form. The fact that this is an 8.3/10 literally blows my mind. If you've never seen this movie you aren't missing out on anything. I acknowledge that it's a classic, nostalgic for some, you have to understand the humor, etc. But it's a TERRIBLE movie. If you've never seen it, save yourself the 90 minutes and pass on this one.",1,8,22,5 February 2019
