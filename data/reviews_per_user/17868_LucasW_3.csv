Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Special.
","Let me start by explaining why I think Star Wars got such mixed reviews.-First, there was so much hype around the creation and release of a new Star Wars film, that I believe it scared the critics.  I think that many wanted to prove that they were above Star Wars fever, and that they could look at the new picture with a critical eye.  This led to my second point.<ul><li>I think that many critics were guilty focusing on and being overly critical when it came to otherwise insignificant things.  It seems as if many forgot that to see the movie as a whole.  For example, some focused in on Jar Jar Binks.  Sure the Gungan is rather silly and reminds you somewhat of the Ewoks, but if you're not focusing in on him, it takes nothing away from the film.</li></ul>-The third reason I thought Menace received its bad reviews was that many adults expected the movie to capture the same feeling that the original Star Wars did for them  back when they were ten years old.  Well unfortunately, one looks slightly different at movies as they get older.  People went into the theatre looking for the same thing they got as a kid, and the whole time they should have been looking for something new.  Even though Menace is part of a series, it is and individual movie with its own individual traits.-The fourth reason that I believe that we see so many bad reviews and/or votes on the IMDB is because of the bandwagon.  I sure many here have thought, 'Hey, the critics panned the movie, and I sure don't want to look like I'm unsophisticated/ignorant/an idiot or so on and so forth.  I better say I didn't like it.'  Unfortunately, many people here feel that they are in an elite group of movie buffs that can only like what the mass public hasn't seen or slam what the mass public likes.Now let me talk about why the Phantom Menace was great.-First and most importanatly, it was easily the most or one of the most visually stunning movies ever made.  After I finished the movie the first time, I felt like I had missed a lot going on on the screen.  So much time and effort was spent giving detail to things outside the main subject area that it is almost impossible to rest your eyes on a single person/alien/starship for much time. Have you ever seen a place as beautiful as Naboo, anywhere?-Secondly, the casting was very good.  Critics said that as Qui-Gon Jinn Liam Neeson was dull.  He is a Jedi people!!!  They are trained not to get emotional.  Until A New Hope, did Darth ever get emotional, he never even lost his temper.  What about Yoda?  I promise, if he was human, critics would call him boring too.  I think that they just like him because he is a little green guy who speaks funny.  Another casting triumph was Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala and Padme Naberrie.  She brought the elegance and beauty to the screenthat the part needed.-Third reason I liked this movie was the lightsaber fight.  Beautiful choreography and brilliant presentation.  I have never seen a fight this fast or this dazzeling.-Lastly, the set-up.  Man!  I can't wait for the next movie.This is a great movie that I feel was never given a cahnce by everbody. So if you have never seen it and if you don't cross it off the list before you do, I promise that you will find The Phantom Menace as spectacular as I did.",10,0,0,19 January 2000
The Fifth Element," Everyone should see this movie - Luc Besson is a genius
","Though I will admit that I'm not much of a fan of the whole science-fiction genre, I say this is one of the best movies at the video store right now. If you haven't seen it, rent it soon (and on DVD if possible).  Director Besson takes an okay idea and some relatively unexperienced actors/actresses (Johovich and Tucker) and creates a masterpiece.  Definite ten.",10,0,1,4 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Film with many surprises and a great twist - thought it was excellent
","Though I've always said Bruce Willis was a great actor, I must admit I was a little dubious about this film.  His role was a little out of character for John Mclane/Korben Dallas.  Anyway, when I saw the sneak of this movie, I thought it was very well done.  Willis was fine, Osment (Cole) was great, and The Sixth Sense delivered the thrills that other summer creepers, namely the Haunting, didn't.",9,0,0,4 August 1999
