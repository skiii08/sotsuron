50 First Dates," One of the better Sandler movies, and a great feel-good romantic comedy...
","Firstly, I'd like to say I really do enjoy a good feel-good film. If they weren't there, the movies wouldn't feel 'complete' and you wouldn't be able to just pick up a film that'll cheer you up or make you feel on top of the world. Nearly (and I say nearly) all of Adam Sandler's movies are the feel-good movies I'm talking about. Big Daddy, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and of course, The Wedding Singer. When they're over, you feel great. They give you a very subtle amount of hope, and hope is always a good thing.50 First Dates plays out in the same way as every romantic comedy does. Man meet woman, they have a great time, they have an argument, man does his best to fix problem, they live happily ever after. Sure, it's used all-the-time, but why not? It works and it never feels repeated, because you've always got new characters and a new concept.The basic plot revolves around one Henry Roth (Sandler). He's the ultimate guy, he's got it all; he lives in Hawaii, he's got a good job, good friends and all the skills to winning any girl he wants. Problem is, he's afraid of commitment. He meets a girl, scores and then makes an excuse to break up with them. Then, one day, he meets Lucy (Barrymore). She's different, and as Henry finds out, very special. They get along from the moment they meet, and Henry seems to have found he girl he can finally settle down with. One problem: she's got short-term memory loss and everyday she forgets she ever meet Henry. So, as love is, Henry has to win her over; every single day.The performances are great, especially from Adam and Drew. The cast was well selected and they two lead characters shine just like they did in The Wedding Singer. The old Sandler crew are back making great cameo entries and they really did make me laugh, as did the entire movie. The setting is beautiful, it's Hawaii after all! As for the musical selection, awesome! You really feel tropical and involved in the story. Seriously, check this one out, you won't be disappointed.(4/5)",8,0,0,7 August 2005
12 Monkeys," Powerful, clever and downright brilliant. Cinema perfection.
","Twelve Monkeys is the sort of film that not everybody has seen. You may of had the chance to see it sometime, but skipped it due to what you may have heard or read about the plot and such. Unfortunately, you've skipped something special; something very special indeed.Time travel has been depicted in various ways throughout cinematic history. The classic time travel theories in Back to the Future for instance, of the clever portrayal in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Whenever we see time travel, it's being used to save something, stop something or change something so that the future can be restored and everything will be fine and dandy. Twelve Monkeys shows us a world in which time travel cannot change events, they have already happened (similar to the Harry Potter time travel, yes). Thus, the objective of our man Bruce Willis is not to change the past, but to merely collect information to bring back to the present.Weeved together in a masterful way that only Gilliam could create, Twelve Monkeys gives us twist after twist, allowing us to progress along the path that the protagonist does at exactly the same rate; figuring out the story as we go. The performances are superb, especially from Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. They allow us to feel involved as we are plunged into a bleak, dark world which is probably one of the most realistic I've ever seen in cinema.I won't give any hints at all as to the plot; it's more enjoyable if you watch it without knowing anything at all. What I will say, is that Twelve Monkeys is one of the greatest movies out there. Watch it A.S.A.P, before something really bad happens and it's just too late...(5/5)",10,0,1,6 August 2005
The Thing," Left me wondering why I hadn't seen it sooner. Carpenter is a master film-maker.
","In the last couple of years, I've been watching as many John Carpenter movies as possible. I fell in love with Escape From New York, and practically worship Big Trouble in Little China. I love the energy that Carpenter directs his movies with, I always feel they're special and unlike anything else out there. It's no different with The Thing. My question is, how does Carpenter do it? The Thing is a horror masterpiece. The movie is based on a book called 'Who Goes There?', which is rather fitting considering the plot. In 1980's Antartica, a research team accidentally stumble upon an alien that can change it's appearance to look like anyone through cell-transformation. As it begins to wreak havoc and mayhem upon the research facility, it becomes clear that nobody can trust anybody else. Paranoia sets in, and a perfect horror mood forms. It's all very clever.Leading the campaign is MacReady, a brave and cool helicopter pilot played perfectly by the awesome Kurt Russell. Again, Russell and Carpenter craft and amazing character together, just like their previous legend; Snake Plissken. MacReady rounds the men together and attempts to destroy 'The Thing', but things do not go as planned.For a film made in 1982, the special effects are top-notch. They look realistic, which makes a change (the 80's was a big special effects testing zone, which wasn't necessarily a good thing). It's gory and violent too, and never did I find myself thinking, 'Oh God, why?' Ennio Morricone composed the music, influenced by Carpenter's classic synthesised tunes. I was impressed by the main theme, a sort of basic tense number; it succeeded in keeping me at the edge of my seat. This score however, was totally different from anything I'd heard Ennio do before, which made a refreshing change.Overall, The Thing is one of my favourite horror films (and one of my favourite films, to be frank). It kept me interested and tense, whilst thrilling me for the full running time. The acting is superb, as is the direction by one John Carpenter. Ennio Morricone's score was simple but effective, and the special effects just finish off this piece of perfection film-making. In one word, spectacular.(5/5)",10,0,1,14 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Good, really good, but not as good as the first two...
","Don't get me wrong, I do think this is a very good movie. It's well directed, the music is excellent, the acting is great; however, I don't feel as though it's got the same 'Harry Potter' feel as the first two, Columbus's two.For me, the first two Harry Potter movies 'felt' perfect, they felt right. To be frank, they felt like Harry Potter! I've read the books a dozen times each, and from what I read, I had my own vision of what Harry's world would be like. Chris captured it amazingly, exactly as I'd imagined it. Alfonso's was OK, but he seems to have changed an awful lot and tried too hard to get the movie into a 'new' style, his style. This, I feel, is why I'm opposed to his version to Chris's. However, despite all that, the movie is very good (excellent for the last 30 minutes). The acting is good, and the movie moves at a great pace; you really feel it has been a year at Hogwarts. There are a handful of 'cringe-worthy' moments, which really bug me. You'll know them when you see them, trust me.Anyway, definitely see this movie and form your own opinion. It's not all bad, seriously. I just wish Chris had directed it, I have the strange feeling it would of been better and 'fitted' in with the first two.(4/5)",8,0,1,6 August 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Stylishly perfect at the beginning; clichÃ© and disappointing towards the end...
","From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)Seth Gecko and his brother Richard are on the run after a bloody bank robbery in Texas. They escape across the border (with some 'new company') to Mexico and will be free the next morning, once they've paid off their contact. They just have to survive for a night at the rendezvous point, which turns out to be a bar on the brink of hell, populated with Vampires.When you first look at From Dusk Till Dawn, you already it's a horror film. However, when you actually watch it, it's very different. The first 70 minutes of the movie are horror-less, and develops what seems to be an interesting Tarantino-like crime story. As this theme continues for most of the film, you start to think, 'Wait a minute, this would be a great film without the horror.' It seems, whilst trying to write a horror-flick, Tarantino actually created another epic crime movie, and added a less-than-average horror plot to it at the end. However, for what's it worth, the movie is none-the-less, great. Clooney and Tarantino play the Gecko brothers. Two thief's and outlaws who are fresh from a bank robbery and on the run from the start. Clooney is Seth, a cool acting, fast talking and quick thinking thief who, along with his brother Richie, a sex offender-psycho-rapist (played by Quentin himself) kidnap a family and force them to carry them across the border to Mexico. Seth tells the father of the family, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) that he'll let him and his two kids go safely, after they wait peacefully at an organised rendezvous point for Seth's connection, Carlos. However, the club is a hell hole ran by a gang of ruthless Vampires.The plot is, actually, not that bad. The main problem I have with the film is how the Vampires were portrayed. They look more to me like Zombies. Each Vamp looks different, and random monster spurt up now and again which lowers the, well, coolness of the film. Even Quentin himself said they looked like Zombies. Apart from that, the script is awesome. In fact, the film looks like it was directed by Quentin himself. Robert Rodriguez did a good job in living up to his previous film, Desperdo.If you look hard enough, you'll also see many Tarantino trademarks and references to his other films. Sort of like an added bonus, really. Oh, and look out for the dance scene with Salma Hayek...Overall: A great film with a cast of talented and strong actors, an excellent script from Tarantino, and superb direction from Rodriguez. Not a masterpiece, but it could have been close without the zombie-styled-vampires and mindless horror fighting. Still, great. (4/5)",10,0,1,12 June 2005
Jaws," Could be my all-time favourite movie...
","I call myself a movie buff, but I'd never seen Jaws up until a few months ago. I'd always put myself off of seeing it and I'm not sure why, I just never found the right time to start watching it. Eventually, I thought I had to see it and I purchased the 30th Anniversary Edition DVD.I was literally 'blown out of the water.' Why had I waited so long to see this film? Everything about it is perfect - characters, dialogue, special effects, action, setting, everything! I hate myself for waiting to see Jaws, as I've seen thousands of movies and never considered that this could become my all-time favourite.Everybody knows the plot, so I won't get into it, but the entire story is told magically, thanks to Steven Spielberg and his crew. I am a traditionalist when it comes to film (classic stories, characters and endings) and Jaws delivers everything I could ever want from a film. The pacing is perfect and I cannot fault it at all.The music by John Williams is now legendary, but it really is much more than the classic 'Jaws' theme that people recognise today. The entire soundtrack is both thrilling and wonderful, especially towards the end as the final battle ensues. Williams establishes himself as the best composer of all time with his score, here.The acting is perfect. For the film that reeks 'Summer Blockbuster', you probably wouldn't expect the acting to be anything special, but everybody gives memorable performances (especially Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw) - and anyway, we shouldn't forget that this is the 'original' summer blockbuster.Overall, I cannot say anything bad about Jaws. It is a remarkable film with some of the greatest characters ever committed to film. The story is inventive and glorious, and keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout. I know what kind of film Jaws wanted to be, but it turned out to be so much more - Steven Spielberg really is the world's greatest director. His ability to turn (what could of been) quite a mundane story into an epic tale of good versus evil is simply amazing. Oh, and I can't forget the magnificent ending - seriously, it's the best ending ever committed to cinema.Jaws could be my all-time favourite movie, and even if it isn't, it's pretty darn close. See it - you won't be let down.(5/5)",10,1,2,25 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," George... let's be friends again.
","STAR WARS - EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITHAs a true Star Wars fan, I saw this movie at midnight on Wednesday the 18th of May (the exact moment it was allowed to be shown here in the UK). I'll tell you: I was excited. I'd seen a lot of stuff and read loads about it, and although I was not impressed by ATTACK OF THE CLONES, I was really excited about the final chapter: everything was to link up and become answered (at last)! So, there I was: seated in the cinema eating popcorn by the tonne. I waited excitedly for the ' A long time ago in galaxy far, far away....' and wham!STAR WARS moved across the screen and it began. I didn't move or speak the whole way through. I was amazed. STUNNED. It was awesome. But where did this 'whole' new type of movie come from? It was clearly something different. It seemed fresh, new, special. I questioned myself: did George Lucas direct this? Compared to the others, it was a star system away. I like PHANTOM MENACE. I hate ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Despite how I felt about both of them, before I saw REVENGE OF THE SITH, I would of preferred the prequels to have never been created......After I left the cinema, everything was better. I wanted to literally kiss Mr. Lucas. He done it. He had made an excellent and spectacular film. The beginning was gripping. The ending was supreme. It's been 5 days now (since I saw it), and I honestly can't stop thinking about it. I salute him.The acting was amazing. The CGI fitted in with the surroundings. The music was beyond good. The story was brilliant. The action was... well, the action was just a miracle in film....I honestly could go on for hours at how good it was. All questions were answered: nothing felt rushed: it was a dream come true.After the previously 'poor' prequels, what more could I expect other than another one? I was wrong. This movie makes everything George Lucas ever did wrong 'okay' again. As the last STAR WARS film of all: he has truly outdone himself and proved himself as the original and mindful director we all believed he was.See it now. You will not be disappointed.Overall: *****",10,1,6,22 May 2005
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Bogus? No way, dude!
","BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, I originally bought it because it was Â£3.99 during the New Year's Day sales, and, as a DVD collector, I meerly picked it up to add to my ever-expanding collection. Putting off watching it for over a month, I finally found the time to sit down and press play. Strangely (and almost instantly), I was totally hooked on something I imagined I'd never like...Bill and Ted are two dudes in 1988. Hoping to form their own band one day, they spend endless hours practising in their garage even though they have no idea how to even play the guitar! Also, they're both flunking History and unless they can get an A+ in their next history report, Ted's dad is sending him off to military school! They've got to figure something out, and fast! Along comes Rufus, an 'awesome dude' from the future who has been sent to make sure they pass their report with flying colours... using a time machine! So, Bill and Ted set off on one heck of an adventure through time, picking up a variety of characters from the different ages of the universe, including Billy the Kid, Joan of Arc and Beethoven himself! When you begin watching BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE you can instantly tell you're in for something different. Sure, the plot's a little crazy and thin, but it's a fun movie aimed at doing one thing: To Entertain.There's no use in taking this movie too seriously or you won't enjoy it at all. Watch it with an open mind and relax, maybe get a few friends around too. Seriously, it's totally fun and I recommend it to any film fans, whether it's to see something totally different or to see something totally awesome! BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE: Fun, original and laughable. (7/10)",7,5,9,2 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.... was the greatest movie of all time.
","Star Wars is the God of all movies. It is the greatest film to have ever been made, bar none. Nothing can be compared to it, nor should it be. It is definitive to our world, our society. It changed the way movies were made: for the better.In the 1970s, there was little unknown director named George Lucas. Little did he know (dispite a nightmarish shoot), that his galactic space opera would literally change the way people lived, worked, played and thought. The secret behind his success? His imagination.The script, the characters, the events, the locations, the humour, the opening, the ending... all perfect. Of course, it's not the most well-shot movie of all time, but there's no denying that nobody actually cares. Star Wars has become a cult and a religion, and earned it's place in my heart as the greatest film to have ever been made......Millions will agree.Whatever I say cannot reach the real truth behind Star Wars: just watch it and you'll know exactly what I mean.The force will be with us, always.Overall: A definitive masterpiece. Will never be forgotten, and will remain in the hearts of young and old for generations. Perfect. (10/10)",10,12,19,26 May 2005
Sin City," Masterful and stylish: Modern cinema at it's best.
","SIN CITY (2005) Sin City is a bit like Pulp Fiction fused with Kill Bill and tumbled around for a bit in a comic book universe. It's incredibly stylish for one: it's all in black and white and filmed in a way so that it even feels like you're reading Frank Miller's original graphic novels. Of course, the main question is......do they match up to the comics? The answer is yes, definitely. In fact, I may even go as far to say that the movie is better (although some may not agree). Frank's work has always had a different edge to it, and the film captivates that edge to it's peak and broadens our view on the hellish (and masterful) Basin City.Of course, it's not without it's flaws. A few here and there, but nothing to get too worked up about. I will say though; for somebody who hasn't read the novels, it's a little hard to follow first time through. The acting is superb, especially from Bruce Willis and the beautiful Jessica Alba. Their relationship on-screen seems heartfelt and 'meant.' The other actors don't sink either: everyone who appears in this movie(and there's a lot, I tell you) puts forth a memorable and well-orientated performance.Overall, Sin City is probably the greatest comic book to screen adaptation of all time. It's fast, cool, slick and holds true to it's purpose. This will forever remain as one of those 'cult' classics that people remember for years to come. Exceptional. (10/10)",8,0,2,4 June 2005
