Saturday Night Fever," Decent time capsule ruined by misogyny.
","Cutting right to the chase. The movie is alright if a tad boring in sections due to overly long dance scenes. Great atmosphere- I especially loved the scenes with Tony at home struggling to communicate with his family as tensions arise.
I would be willing to give this movie a light 7- were it not for the infamous ending.
Perhaps audiences in 1977 were more okay with seeing rape on the cinema screen- but it does not sit well in 2020.
Spoilers ahead:
Literally twenty minutes from the end, Tony attempts to rape Stephanie in the back of a car. Not two minutes later his friends bring a drugged girl named Annette to the backseat and rape her one at a time.
Both scenes are incredibly hard to watch- I found myself having to cover my ears so as not to hear the screams and cries of the women.
The scenes add absolutely nothing to the story, by the way.The worst part?
Tony meets with Stephanie the very next day and apologizes. For attempted rape.
And she accepts his apology.Watch the PG version, the movie's surely better without it.",3,1,3,15 June 2020
