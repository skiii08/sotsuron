The King's Speech," I can see how some liked the movie but...
","I thought it was boring. Wife dragged me to see it, because of all the Oscar buzz. The story does not interest me, as I am not into 'royality'. I can see how many thought it was a good move, but the story line is not interesting. It is a well made movie don't get me wrong. I just had problems with what it was 'about'. It seemed to drag on forever. Guys if your wife drags you to this movie. Go see, it does beat other 'chick flicks'. Yes, i put this in chick flick category, unless your a nerdy guy. Folks that like to show everyone they are smart. Will love this movie. They can then discuss all the issues he went through. King of hard for me to feel sorry for a King. Even though, the movie wants you too. If you want to be entertained. This is not your movie. If you want to learn something pick up a book or research the net.",5,12,25,1 February 2011
Trainspotting," Terrible movie, not my cup of tea
","This movie had no point. Really, I guess the point was to disgust and shock. Once, the baby scene happened, my friends and I said 'nope not anymore'. I know a lot of folks like the movie, including my wife. Sorry, those of you who got something out of it, but I am just not into this movie.I think you either love or hate it. It is funny because the friend that picked it out was going on word of month. Four of us watched and none of us were impressed. I would much rather sit through 6 hours straight of Sex and the City watch this movie again(not a fan of Sex and the City).You will not see it in my DVD collection. Anyway, if you really like this movie, please do not be offended. Different strokes for different folks. Peace.",Null,1,9,19 March 2004
