Lucas crammed so many images, motifs, myths and allegories into 2 hours and 15 minutes that anyone who has written a review after only one viewing might as well have not seen the movie at all, and you can summarily dismiss everything they have to say.If you study movies at all, it is irresponsible on your part to give this film a lukewarm (or bad) review after one viewing.
