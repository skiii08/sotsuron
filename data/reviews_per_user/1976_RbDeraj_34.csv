The Mask," Very Enjoyable and Funny Watch but Far From Perfectly Executed
","For all of the fans of The Mask comics from the early 90's, I don't think you will be exactly satisfied. While the storyline is a little different, the riotous out-of-control violence is missing making it 'kid friendly' and more of a family film. In other words you won't see The Mask shot full of holes and the graphic chaos similar to a Deadpool comic.This Stanley Ipkiss is not exactly the awkward shy fearful nerd that I expected but more like the typical goofy screwballish Jim Carrey. In his early movies especially Carrey very much seems like a one trick pony. He may be good or the best at his routine but it doesn't change the fact that he isn't very versatile.The look of this film was clearly a 90's sets and was reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? with its similar effects and visuals. The crazy style was perfect in some ways for instance the makeup for the mask and his big shiny choppers. Some of the effects were on the cheesy side and the stupid dancing scenes kind of brought the whole film down. It started out strongly but the train lost steam in the end as the movie became less interesting relying on a lot of fake-looking visual gags. That being said it was a very enjoyable and funny watch but far from perfectly executed.",6,2,4,18 August 2015
Source Code," Premise a Little Shaky, But Solidly Entertaining
","Well this is another film I watched just because of Gyllenhaal, and once again Jake didn't disappoint. The movie itself was just okay, nothing incredible but definitely not bad. It made an excellent use of a limited setting, uniquely using a plot with the 'Groundhog Day'-like scenario. It had a lot of different aspects, sometimes it was action packed, other times a serious drama, or a sci-fi mystery and was also occasionally funny but solidly entertaining all throughout. The premise of the entire movie was on shaky ground in my opinion. Their explanation for how the whole source code worked was vague and relied mostly on a cheap typical sci-fi scapegoat of 'quantum mechanics and calculus' which really doesn't tell us anything. Its kind of a hollow statement that sounds really fancy if you know absolutely nothing about the subjects. The film also tried to be clever, mind-blowing and trippy in the end but it didn't really seem to work. It came across as a little fuzzy and unclear of what really transpired which I think the unexplained process of the source code and the unbelievability of it contributed to.",6,1,1,6 June 2015
Catch Me If You Can," Incredible Story of a Fascinating Man
","First of all, one thing you need to realize is that this is a true story. Is it a little overdramatized with some of the details fudged? Of course, but from what I've found it comes pretty close to the real thing. The film is about Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (played by DiCaprio) a teen who started committing fraud when he was 15 and before he was 21 years old he had stolen millions, created alibis, worked as a doctor, a pilot, and a lawyer for extended periods of time even though he wasn't actually any of them. He eluded the authorities all around the world for years eventually getting caught but not before escaping from custody twice. Tom Hanks plays the F.B.I. agent trying to catch him in this wonderfully entertaining film.There were only a few problems I had with the film. Leonardo DiCaprio was around 27 when they filmed this and while he does look young for his age at one point they try to pass him off as a 12 or 13 year old which clearly does not work. Tom Hanks is not good with accents. In the movie I don't even know what he was trying to impersonate but it came out sounding more like a speech impediment like Elmer Fudd or Barry Kripke.I'd give it a 9/10 just because I think it deserves to be higher than the 8.0 that it is currently at.",8,1,3,9 February 2015
Monty Python's Life of Brian," I Expected More
","While I enjoy many of Monty Python's skits and love the Holy Grail, this film just didn't do it for me. There wasn't any non-stop laughter or extremely engaging or entertaining material. Their usual witty yet ridiculous arguments with genius thought processes were just not there. They had a lot of fun with speech impediments and nose jokes but they were really overdone and it grew tiresome after a while. They did a good job of not being too blasphemous or offensive (which surprised me given the subject matter) and focused most of their ridicule at large groups of people with terrible communication acting like lemmings while none of them have any idea of what is going on. It just wasn't very clever or intelligent as their other humor. The alien scene (which was completely unexpected) really brought the overall film and appearance down which had been good till that point with the impressive rugged ancient filming locations and sets. I thought the stoning scene was the best, with other good ones like the grammar Roman (like a grammar Nazi), price haggling, and the excellent argument against transgenders and their struggle against coping with reality. It wasn't bad but it was nothing to gloat over, not nearly Monty Python's best work, and nothing worthy of the top 250 list.",5,3,10,27 February 2015
Fury," Solid War Film But Nothing Magnificent
","While this was a descent action/historical fiction/war movie, it wasn't anything that great. It gave good performances from the main five actors, had good cinematography, but seemed unrealistic.The plot was not very well put together and in the end you were left wondering what the point of it all was. It goes through the motions at the beginning with not much happening and builds up to the final stand where it is 'do or die' but leaves the story without full closure of anything. It had many standard war movie cliché's especially with the small band of men taking on hundreds alone. While it did avoid the cliché of them all surviving, they included a different one with the rookie living in the end and being pardoned by an enemy troop. How exactly did he become an expert fighter in just two days when before he barely knew how to operate a firearm? Who knows.While most of the effects and visuals of the movie were raw gritty and incredibly realistic looking, there was one flaw that tainted the look of the entire film. The tracer rounds that the armies fired throughout looked like laser beams from from some sci-fi film with their long glowing neon green and red streaks flying throughout the air. It almost looked like a firefight in Star Wars Battlefront or something.A truly good historical fiction movie should look like it was shot in the time that the story takes place in. While most of this looked pretty good, some of the dialogue and personalities of the characters didn't fly. And what was with all the Macklemore haircuts??? I'm pretty positive undercuts were not a popular look back then especially if you were an enlisted man in the United States Military.The out of place romance was just plain ridiculous.Overall it did give us today a look on what it might have been like in the life of a tank crew during World War II, showing us the horrors of war, but also the little bit of goodness that shines through even in the most horrible of situations. It was a good film but nothing to be amazed over.",7,2,4,30 January 2015
Kickboxer," Not a Complete Flop, But Definitely a Dud.
","This movie was clearly a product of its time. It is a typical cheesy action movie from the one liners to the non-mood fitting 80's power ballads playing in the background. The plot was pretty predictable especially the very beginning how this was clearly going to become an underdog avenging his brother. The teacher student relationship and training was interesting, but nothing special compared to similar movie scenarios. Uncle Xian was funny sometimes but in general all of the dialogue was just plain corny. That dancing scene brought the quality level to its lowest. The whole movie lacked intrigue and it had nothing to keep your whole interest or attention. The fight scenes (which is why most people watch these types of movies) were not even that good. The final fight which should have been the pinnacle of the film, was quite a letdown with a low intensity level and mostly consisting of long drawn out yells and tacky moves. Not a complete flop, but definitely a dud.",4,2,6,3 March 2015
Interstellar," Seemed Like a Poor Attempt at Creating a Modern 2001: A Space Odyssey
","I'll start off by saying that this is the first Christopher Nolan movie that I did not thoroughly enjoy. The whole film seemed like an attempt to create a modern 2001: A Space Odyssey with a little mix of Mr. Nobody and Inception-like-structures at the end. It had robots with similar intelligence, voice, and aesthetics to HAL 9000, a bookshelf time warp zone that reminded me a lot of the server room in 2001, and they even went right down to the organ music playing the entire time (which really grinds on your nerves after 3 hours).Their efforts pointed towards trying to make something that will one day become a classic in the realm of Sci-Fi rather than making a good movie. It had a lot of lights and flash but not enough tangible substance. The script and material tried to be all scientific, but couldn't convey the theories (whether valid or not) to the audience. It all seemed like unexplainable 'scientific' bull crap and was not made believable. They liked to throw around the word data a lot, I guess to make it sound smart. I am not an astrophysicist or anything but it just seemed like a bash on all of the viewers' intelligence. Yes I know that it is 'Science Fiction,' but it is hard to see it that way when there is no fantasy element and it is all presented as realistic fact.Even the littlest things that most people probably missed bothered me. The poor understanding of agriculture ex: green corn in a drought and dust bowl? green corn burning? and other things like the convenience of an ankle deep ocean covering a entire planet.The makers seemed to know it was far fetched and nonsensical so they even went to the point of just adding explanations like 'the power of love saved them' or whatever that was. I guess for the mass populous the graphics or something (which I must have missed) covered up all of its flaws well enough for them to still consider it a good movie. But the visuals were not even that appealing to me. Some of it was cool and trippy (once again trying to be like 2001) but much of it was just like Gravity all over again.We had some seen before actors who have collaborated with Nolan in the past and some new faces like Matthew McConaughey who was quite exceptional. The acting was generally good and all passable, nothing too bad, but that is not what made the movie lacking. It was the storyline which is usually Nolan's strongest feature in his films. Even with all of its good characteristics, it is hard to like a movie that just doesn't make any sense. At one point in the film I believe that Cooper said something like: 'I want to know where we are and where we are going.' That was the question that I desperately wanted answered throughout the entire viewing.",4,6,10,20 February 2015
American Sniper," Could Have Been Far Better
","Having read Chris Kyle's autobiography and watched many interviews with him I was very disappointing in the inaccuracies in the story. It was a good homage to an incredible man and his fellow servicemen but why not just make it true? Wouldn't that just be more heartfelt and a better story? The writers were attempting to make a more flowing storyline with extra excitement and most of the details were somewhat right but jumbled around and mixed up to give a completely different plot. Bradley Cooper did a good job of getting Kyle's personality and physical appearance down pat. There were definitely a few directing errors that came from Clint Eastwood (easily not close to his best work), even down to a blatantly plastic baby doll that ruined an entire scene. It might have been better as a movie than an adaptation but my viewed was permanently skewed having read the book making it a disappointment for me.Book: solid 8/10 Movie Adaptation: 5/10",5,1,12,30 May 2015
Nightcrawler," Excellent Gyllenhaal Performance, Okay Movie.
","Lou Bloom will inspire you to look deeper inside of yourself and reach a little higher for the goals in your life. He is a committed lifetime learner, quick to catch on, neat, and organized man with a quiet, calm demeanor. Bloom maintains a high attention to detail and always carries himself in a professional manner, yet has a dark side hidden beneath it all, almost like an update of Patrick Batman, the American Psycho. After realizing his new career aspirations as a 'Nightcrawler' he uses his resourcefulness and skills as a master of manipulation to start up his own company, hire an employee, and get to the top of the game, but not without riding a line of what is moral versus what is 'legal.' The concept and plot line of the movie were very interesting, but not executed in the best way. Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Louis Bloom was convincing and, in my opinion, a job well done, but I did not think this was the case for most of the other actors. They didn't seem quite authentic, almost as if you could tell that they were acting, making it all come across as a little forced. I expected Lou Bloom to be a much more disturbed and tormented character, but they only scratched the surface. The audience knew there was a monster hiding inside of him but never really saw it come out in full force. The creature only emerged showing its teeth a few times, with the biggest being the memorable looking in the mirror scene. I think they should have delved deeper into his character showing more of his psychotic maniacal side, personal life, and background, as it would have helped to reinforce his actions in the main plot of the movie. The music of the film struck me as odd and distracting. It is something I usually don't notice in a film that much, but it was a strange choice and did not fit the tone or go with what was happening. A good score should add to the emotions that are being played out on screen and set the tone as well as the scenery and lighting are supposed to.Overall, I thought the film was just descent. If it was not for Gyllenhaal's performance I would have rated it sub-par. Would I say that this is a 'must see'? No. Would I say that you shouldn't waste your money or time? No. It is an interesting story that takes you through a non typical scenario that I don't think you will regret.",7,0,2,7 November 2014
The Thing," I Don't Get The Hype
","Simply put, I just don't get all the hype surrounding this movie. To me it seemed a lot like Alien (1979). The plot was similar with an seemingly dead alien species coming to life and killing off a crew. While the time period and setting were different they were still both in a harsh just as unrelenting environment. The movie wasn't bad but it just wasn't that great either. The creature effects weren't that impressive and seemed pretty typical of other films from in and around the era. It all looked a little aged and overdramatic but is better than most from the 80's. If you consider the drastic circumstances that the characters were in and their inability to trust a single solitary soul, they didn't seem as intense or rivaled as they should have been. It was slightly dull when the situation should have been full of excitement. I have seen a couple of John Carpenter directed films being Big Trouble in Little China (1986) and They Live (1988) and I think I enjoyed them more. The Thing was a much more well made movie and it wasn't as cheesy as the other two or full of stupid one-liners and laughable action. The serious mood to the movie was more fitting, but it failed to exhilarate or thrill me.",6,2,11,13 February 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Dark Mysterious Thrill
","As someone who has not read the book or seen the original Swede version, I felt like the film left some questions undisclosed. It had a lot of characters and even towards the end I felt a little overwhelmed with all of the story-lines just like Mikael at the beginning when he is learning the Vanger family tree. When Martin is finally caught and disposed of, they never really give an explanation of his motive only that he did not kill his sister. The writer seemed to think that that was enough, but I felt it lacked a believable reason.The ending was obviously a set up for a sequel and it almost seemed like a distraction. Was this film about Mikael Blomkvist? Or the girl with the dragon tattoo? Or the mystery of the disappearance of Harriet? It was almost as if they were telling three stories at once and didn't really focus enough on each one. The relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth was came out of no where and was just weird as it didn't seem fitting with her personality. The performances were all excellent especially Roony Mara. I would also applaud the makeup for their transformation of her character and also the special effects team for the wonderful opening credits. While it did have its faults, I found it thrilling, pretty well made, an interesting plot, and it would make me want to see a second film if they ever make one.",7,1,3,5 February 2015
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Really Plays to the Teen Generation of the New Millennium
","Michael Cera is an awkward genius as he has proved before in many of his other works with best example probably being Superbad. This movie was no exception and his and the others' acting was all something to be proud of. The story held very true to the comic. A few details were shifted around and a few minor ones omitted but it still worked well. The graphic novel had a little more depth and character development which would have been nice in the movie adaptation but it also would have extended it to an undesirable length. The whole video game feel worked much better in the film medium rather than the comic. The music and bands were pure brilliance with songs that I think could be actual catchy hits. Bryan Lee O'Malley definitely created a strange but fun type of story that plays a lot to the teen generation of the new millennium. It combines elements like hipsterism, 20-something unemployed slackers with their fates resting in the success of their band, the music scene, fads like veganism, making fun of pop culture, and is really aimed at a generation raised on video games and the drama that goes on with dating and young life. One thing I found unexplainable was that the characters were grounded in real life but when the insane fights happen they seem to be no big deal. Also the subspace highway was never really explained same as the book. It was a fun, laughable, and entertaining 112 minutes.",6,1,1,10 June 2015
Gone Girl," 'Basic Instinct' or 'Fatal Attraction' For a New Era
","Gone Girl seems to me like a 'Basic Instinct' or 'Fatal Attraction' for a new era. It has the same psychopathic woman using situations to keep a man under her thumb of control and also to get away with the evil she has done. It does slightly stray from this in the fact that she is committing these awful acts against her husband. To make things even more complicated, she seems justified in the beginning with her plan because of her husband's infidelity. The real story is revealed throughout so you know what is going on, but you never really know what the outcome could be.One of the problems I saw was that much of the plot working out the way it did relied on the presence of poor police work and our main character withholding information from the authorities about his wife. It ends with a cliffhanger, them staying together not knowing what they will do to each other. But why? In the end why is he still afraid to expose her? What control does she have over him? He feels responsible for their child? A good response there would be to prove the atrocities that she has done and get the child out of her reach.David Fincher is an excellent director as we have seen many times before and it is always nice to see an author adapt their own book for the screen. Gillian Flynn wrote an intense and all around screwed up story that is sure to mess with peoples emotions and moral responses. The acting was reasonable and even though the seriousness of the matters at hand, I found it surprisingly funny which was one of its strongest points in my opinion. In the end I thought it was a descent thriller about something we have kind of already seen before but it's not really what it is all cracked up to be.",7,4,8,6 February 2015
Get Out," Refreshingly-Original Descent Thriller/Horror Debut
","Get Out gets a lot of credit where it doesn't deserve and not enough credit where it's due. Many have labeled it as a comedic commentary on race in contemporary American society, but it's really far from that. Yes, LilRel Howery is quite hilarious for most of it but Get Out really aims to thrill not to get laughs or cause a larger discussion on racial politics. The topic of race relations from Jordan Peele should be no surprise considering his past comedy sketches and personal mixed-race background and marriage. But his use of this material is to mainly work as a vehicle for tension and a tool to twist audience perception of what is really going on at this estate visit. A blatant example of this is Peele's smart directorial decision to change the original ending to one that tampers with our expectations and keeps political implications as an underlying subplot rather than the crux of the film. This works very well, drives the plot, our imaginations, and always has us wondering if our protagonist is justified in his paranoia or simply overreacting and misjudging the situation. As a horror/thriller Get Out has a refreshingly original premise with a skillfully witty and tightly constructed narrative plot but failed to evoke enough necessary fear for its own good. Peele makes a decent debut as a director but predominantly (and rightfully so) shows off his creative storytelling chops and attention to detail. But just as Chris misinterprets many people's interactions with him, audiences seem to misinterpret the ultimate point of this film.",5,23,45,14 January 2018
Drive," A Visual Experience, But Could Have Used A Little More Kick
","This was without a doubt a visual experience. The cinematography was beautiful, everything from the sleek cars to beach scene at night to the character wardrobes. Even the over exaggerated stylized violence and gore was artistic in a dark and sinister sort of way. The shots were appealing and masterfully well made. I can't say the same for the plot though. The story was descent but even for being a relatively short film it moved along at a dragging pace. The emphasis was definitely on the visuals rather than the story which is what audiences are there to see. There should have been a better balance, with the two complimenting each other. Even though there was action it all came across as emotionally flat and dull without much excitement or intensity. Not a bad film by any means but could have used a little more kick.",7,4,6,7 March 2015
The Number 23," A Psychological Thrill
","This is a very underrated movie in my opinion. It had an excellent storyline, twists you didn't see coming, descent acting, and a nontraditional plot. The clever numerology and book were intriguing and kept you wondering what would happen next. I only had a few complaints, one being that in the beginning of the film I couldn't take Jim Carrey seriously. He had certain ticks and nuances about him that looked like he thought he was in another one of his goofy stupid comedies. Another one was that though the story was fascinating, it didn't seem believable for our world. The consequences and his feelings in the end did not seem realistic. But overall it was interesting, kept your attention and is definitely worth a watch.",8,1,1,22 January 2015
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Completely Lost My Interest
","Having seen three other Miyazaki animes and thoroughly enjoying them, I expected as much from this film but was ultimately let down. Like all the other Miyazaki works I have seen, this film was set in a beautiful, mysterious and exotic world along with cool creatures (like the fox-squirrel and the Ohms). The flying machines were also creative and a lot of the images reminded me of the incredible comic artist Moebius. But the animation of these fantastic elements was tacky, cheap looking, and not of the highest quality. The storyline was simply not up to par either. The script was poorly written and almost every line seemed cheesy, unintelligent, and dumb. Maybe part of the blame should rest upon the actors and their delivery, but either way it was not good. The music in most films typically goes unnoticed, but it was hard to miss here and not in a good way. Techno music from the 80's definitely did not fit the mood. It seemed to lack the emotional connection that I thought Miyazaki's other films excelled at. The ending seemed abrupt and unsatisfying but I had lost interest so long before that point that I simply ceased to care.",3,11,20,16 April 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," More Overrated Money-Making Garbage From Marvel
","After being disappointed by many of Marvels most popular films, I thought this one was going to be different and an improvement to their franchise, but sadly I was disappointed. It was the same old lemming attractor with a foundation in mindless action and awful special effects/cgi that the masses seem to be sucked into and infatuated with. One good note was that they brought some more obscure characters to the screen, and unless you are a comic book fan you've probably never heard of them. The soundtrack was also great and got a lot of attention. Obviously people have never heard good music before and maybe it will give them a little change in their tasteless ways. I was really rooting for the film the whole way, wanting to like it in the end, but it just didn't deliver. I enjoy Chris Pratt but most of it just wasn't very funny, had terrible fake-looking visuals, cheesy speeches, a typical Marvel slacker-playboy turned hero, and uninteresting villains. As a sequel is inevitable, maybe I will just hope for improvement though I don't really have a desire to see it after this flop.",3,2,6,2 June 2015
The Imitation Game," An Enjoyable Watch but Deeply Flawed at its Core
","This was a somewhat enjoyable watch but I thought the movie was deeply flawed in its core. First off, though the general story is true I doubted much of its historical accuracy. Also its characterization of Turing was quite unbelievable. Was he a genius? Of course, we can clearly see that. But was he a flawless machine of a human himself? No. His colleagues were even made out to be completely incompetent dunces as well. Turing's character was portrayed as a cocky self absorbed man which he may well have been, but a lot of the dialogue and humor in the movie seemed out of place and very unlikely. I'm sure a lot of this has been completely dramatized and romanticized, even down to the simple aesthetics of his creation. Cumberbatch is highly praised for his role which was a good performance but failed in some areas. One in particular that I saw was his awkwardness. He was supposed have extreme difficulty reading people which at times he tried to act like that yet at other times he was witty and socially connected which goes completely contrary to that personality.The film leaves the audience with some implied or outright stated conclusions that did not sit well with me at all. The first was that World War II can be diminished down to a conflict being run by 'a half a dozen crossword enthusiasts in Southern England.' The writers acted like these few people single-handedly ended the war. This is just utterly ridiculous. It was also claimed that Turing saved 14 million lives and ended the war early by two years. That is something that you cannot possibly put a number to. There is no doubt that they achieved something remarkable and were an immense help to the war effort, but think of everyone who was involved in this and especially the men who died on the battlefields (which they conveniently avoided throughout the film even the short scenes of the war they only showed machines, airplanes, tanks and no human lives). It was really a slap in the face and a disrespect to the honor of those who fought, not to mention countless others. Having all of the information from the Axis forces would do no good if there wasn't anyone to act on it.Another idea that they insinuated was that if you are incredibly talented at something you are above reproach or that no one can ever rightly cast judgement on you. Part of that I think was their small push of their own opinions on homosexuality. I think they were trying to implant their own views on the subject as a way of subtle under-the-radar propaganda. I am not saying that Turing wasn't unfairly treated in the end, but they make him out to be a flawless god-like man who could do no wrong just because of his intelligence. The film really avoided the subject of him and his inner demons, not to say that that should have been their main focus.His demise in the end was also very unclearly presented. A robbery, a forbidden relationship, and the other events surrounding it were spattered throughout with no real explicit telling of the facts. It was just another problem near the end that made this movie not nearly what it is cracked up to be.",4,15,19,8 May 2015
Prisoners," Incredibly Gripping
","Well, I wasn't sure what to think when the film opened up with a father and son hunt where they shoot a horrible animated fake deer. I thought Oh no this is a bad sign, but it quickly got better from that moment on. The plot is about two families whose two daughters are both abducted and the search to find them. It mainly focuses on Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) one of the fathers, and Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and both of their separate efforts to find the missing girls. The sense of distressed urgency made it the most gripping and tense movie I have ever experienced. All of the acting was incredibly believable, every single actor. That is quite rare and I applaud them all. The performances along with the plot, and shots throughout made the horrors of having a child kidnapped relatable to an audience who have never experience such a thing or who may not even have a child of their own. It delves into mystery, real life horror, and issues of morality which made it a very suspenseful thriller. The only downside was the ambiguous ending, that left you unsatisfied with a story that so desperately needed closure and hope.",9,1,2,31 January 2015
Men in Black," Enjoyable Extraterrestrial Experience!
","One of my friends was recently appalled that I had not seen Men In Black. So after a long time with the intention of seeing it, I finally watched it and was pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith's characters was great and is what really made the movie. It was almost like a 'buddy cop' film except in a sci-fi setting. The plot was unique and I especially loved all of the issued MiB gadgets. While it wasn't a masterpiece, it definitely kept me entertained with the humorous one-liners, alien creatures, and zany story. The complaints were few and somewhat expected from a sci-fi movie from the 90's. The effects and creatures were obviously aged and looked cheesier than I would have expected, but overall they weren't that awful. I also felt like the end was extremely rushed. It ended on a slightly sad note which didn't seem to fit, and they didn't really set up the final scene with J and his new partner very well. But in the end I would say it was an enjoyable experience.",7,1,1,21 February 2015
"McFarland, USA"," Not a Remember the Titans but a Solid Disney Sports Drama
","For those of you who are turned off at the thought of this movie because its about running, don't be. Although the formation of the cross country team is the driving force in the plot of the film, it really is a family drama with a diversity of elements.This was a relatively low budget film for Disney (only about $17 million) and they got some pretty well known actors like Kevin Costner who gave a strong yet not a stunningly mind-blowing performance.It is nice to hear a moving story based on real events (how accurate we will never known) and that made it more heartfelt and touching in the end.McFarland, USA has your standard sports films clichés but who wants to hear about losers or born winners? Where's the struggle and inspiration? Aside from the captions that showed the years of the events there was little to connect it to the 1980's. Some things were a little cheesy but it had humor and heart.Not a Remember the Titans but a Solid Disney Sports Drama.",7,1,3,26 June 2015
The Shape of Water," A Sweeping Flood That's Impossible to Resist
","While not necessarily perfect, Del Toro holds back his more primitive urges (though they bleed through), refines his most repeatedly practiced themes (fish man, violence, death scenes, magical realism, etc.), and makes a sweeping fractured fairy tale into a flood that's impossible to resist. With an alluring color pallet, fantastic period set design, a love for old Hollywood, and a flawlessly efficient use of music, he creates a world that might be his most grounded and magical at the same time.Like AmÃ©lie mixed with Pan's Labyrinth and Creature from the Black Lagoon.And if a slightly silly, out of place sex scene (with reactions that break the film's reality) between a human woman and a fish man tricks people to watch good cinema, well I guess I can't complain.",8,2,5,17 December 2018
Con Air," Implausible Action, Mediocre Story, Some Good Acting, and Somewhat Entertaining
","I will start off by saying that I found this movie entertaining despite its vast number of flaws. Stories of innocent wrongly convicted men always seem to interest me for some reason and this had a unique plot that hadn't been done before. The cast was very good, you can't get many more big names than that into one film. Steve Buscemi was perfect in his role of the psychotic yet likable serial killer. My complaints though are more than just a few. First off, the music throughout the entire movie was so out of place and quite comical at times. While I enjoyed the action much of it was completely implausible and most of it degraded into nonstop explosions. A lot of the dialogue seemed rushed in the beginning, and much of the latter was cheesy. Question: Has Nic Cage ever been to the South? I think not. He didn't make the accent believable whatsoever. He reminds me of Tom Hanks attempting to do the same thing, but they both end up sounding like people with slow mental ability. The scene in the end tried to leave the movie on a serious touching note, but it came off so awkwardly. I don't regret watching it but it isn't something that I'll probably ever watch again.",6,9,14,1 May 2015
Mary and Max," Depressingly Disappointing
","The concept of this film was without a doubt very unique. It explored a pen pal relationship between a lonely little girl from Australia and a mentally unstable man living in New York City. The story is narrated almost like a children's book, but it is quickly revealed that this is no movie for kids as it's subjects include very mature themes including a very serious main topic of mental health and Asperger syndrome. While I usually find stop-motion animation very impressive, I wasn't taken aback by the quality. Maybe it was the dull tones, or maybe it was simply an odd choice of medium for a movie about such subject matter. The beginning half, even though dark and gloomy, seemed whimsical and funny in a strange sort of way. As the story went along it became more lifeless and uninteresting, and as Mary grew up she became even more of a psycho than our deranged friend Max. The film seemed to reach too far for an emotion filled tale of gloom which made it lose a lot of its impact. Near the middle I was enjoying myself, but by the end it seemed like a drag and overrated disappointment.",3,8,22,1 March 2015
Fantastic Mr. Fox," A Pretty Fantastic Little Film
","To begin, I was a big fan of Roald Dahl as a kid, but this was his worst book by far. It was a dull simple bare bones story but the makers of this film really added the meat and interest to the plot. The characters were given unique personalities that were un-expounded upon in Dahl's book and extra events were added so that it could be made into a full feature. The writers definitely made this into an engaging story. From the beginning it was evident that Wes Anderson had a hand in making this (which was good in this instance) from the vintage artsy style to the panning cutaway room camera shots to his reoccurring all star cast. Stop motion has always fascinated me and the detail and quality of this work was incredible with only a few small hiccups when it came to the additional challenge of fur. The movie was all around funny, quirky, had enjoyable creative ticks, and pleasurable music. Only a few complaints remain in the end: that wolf scene made no sense and I hate cheesy dancing scenes at the end of movies that they typically include in kids movies or Bollywood Films. I find them utterly ridiculous, but even with that this is a gem of a film that achieves the rare accomplishment of outshining the book from which it originated.",8,0,1,19 June 2015
The Sixth Sense," Still a Good Movie Even Though I Knew the Twist
","The plot twist in this movie doesn't really come as a surprise nowadays. Who doesn't know it? It's kind of like Darth Vader being Luke Skywalker's father; an obvious known fact to everyone even those who haven't seen it. Was the plot twist spoiled and somewhat disappointing knowing it beforehand? Yes of course. But did it spoil the entire movie? No.The story was very unique with brilliant writing and an amazing performance by the child actor Haley Joel Osment. It was truly remarkable to see the skill and depth of talent from a 10 year old. The relationship between him and Bruce Willis's character just worked perfectly. The film was haunting and sentimentally touching, though it would have been better if it was mysterious too (because I already knew what was going to happen). Overall a combination of great acting with a captivating story.",8,3,5,19 April 2015
Unbroken," If You See It; Read the Book Afterwards
","As most people probably know or have heard Unbroken is the true story of Louis Zamperini, the son of poor Italian Americans who grew up as a delinquent, was steered into competitive track and field, became an Olympic athlete, and whose life changed direction with the beginning of World War II (as it did to so many during the time). He joined the United States military, fought heroically for his country, survived being stranded on the ocean after a crash landing and then in a Japanese Prisoner of War Camp till the end of WWII.The life of Louis Zamperini is incredible, but the movie failed to capture the whole story on so many levels. The main focus of the movie seemed to be on his suffering in PG-13 form. (I don't think that movies need to have excessive violence or filth, but what he actually when through was much more graphic and awful than the movie portrayed it to be.) It was very reminiscent of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ where all that was shown was the death of Jesus of Nazareth while his life was skipped over which is what made his death an important event. But even through Zamperini's suffering in the Japanese POW Camp for instance, it didn't at all show the comradery, brotherhood, or the love and friendship the prisoners had in their time of captivity. Was it a story of survival? Yes, but what was he surviving for? There is a distinct difference between surviving something and living through it. Louis Zamperini lived not survived. He lived his life to the fullest. While Angelina Jolie will probably get most of the blame if this movie doesn't do well, I think what lacked the most was not direction, but was the writing. The book Unbroken (written by Laura Hillenbrand) was excellent. It was historically accurate, rich in detail and background information, but also gave the heartfelt story straight from the mouth of the real man himself. The writers of this movie had the best material to start from yet I think they only got a glimpse of Zamperini's life story. The very end gives a brief look of what his life became after the events that occurred in the film, but I think this should have been a major part of the plot. Having read the book before-hand, my view of the movie is slightly skewed compared to those who have not, but here is my rating:The book: 10/10The movie in and of itself: 6.5/10The movie compared to the book: 3/10",6,3,8,26 December 2014
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Good Effects, Creative Villain, But A Poor Movie Overall
","I thought the premise of this story was an interesting and creative one: a serial killer who now stalks and kills his victims in their dreams. It turned out to be a flop in my opinion. I thought the effects were quite good for something from the mid 80's and hadn't really seemed to age. Some of the writing was poorly done especially that Kruger back story: 'Don't worry honey, Mommy killed him.' Talk about cheesy and stupid. The biggest beef I had with it was their choice for a main actress. She was horrible and had about zero talent. It is ironic that they gave Johnny Depp (a complete unknown) his debut in Hollywood in this film yet couldn't find a better girl for their main role. I wasn't a huge fan of that ambiguous ending either, it just seemed like a setup for a crappy money making franchise.",3,1,9,12 April 2015
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Not Bad, Dude.
","While I thought some parts of this movie were 'excellent,' other parts were complete 'bogus.' It was a creative storyline and the characters of Bill and Ted were original, entertaining, and comedic. Some of the dialogue, story, and situations were about as dumb as the duo's intellect. Historically inaccurate, of course but Napoleon and Genghis Khan were especially hilarious. Overall it was slightly entertaining, but it was no where near a masterpiece or even a good solid movie for that matter. Do I regret watching it? No, but I probably won't ever watch it again. It did have some good lines and morals to live by: 'Be excellent to each other, and party on dudes!'",5,1,5,10 April 2015
50_50," Artificial, Emotionally Unmoving, Simply Not Very Funny
","This was a disappointment of a movie. Everything good about it was shown in the trailer. It quickly lost my interest and attention as the acting was below par, artificial, and the emotion of the serious storyline was not delivered well. There was nothing extremely likable about any of the characters, in fact most of them were annoying. We had a jerk friend, a cheating girlfriend, an overbearing mother, and an incredibly stupid therapist who should never be allowed a license. There were a few funny parts but most of it was typical Seth Rogan humor. In other words 90% of what comes out of his mouth is about weed or getting laid, both of which get very old after a short time. It was a cliché ending with him being guaranteed to be okay and him going out with the therapist. This was almost an insult to the viewer's intelligence. It isn't like none of us saw that coming from the moment they met. Overall it was a waste of time. I would not recommend this, the trailer is all you need to see.",3,3,7,6 February 2015
Deadpool," A Hypocritical Albeit Comedic Critique on the Superhero Genre
","Was this really the meta parody that it's cracked up to be? Short answer: no. Deadpool is more of a hypocritical albeit comedic critique on the superhero genre.Don't get me wrong it was a good time; entertaining, funny, true to the source material, and an interesting enough origin story. Ryan Reynolds doesn't do a bad job as his somewhat recurring character and fits the part pretty well. He doesn't seem to always have the best comic timing or ability, but then again some jokes are only so funny when they come from an expressionless cgi head. The comedy at times was spot-on and at other times juvenile and forced. But considering the rapid fire pace of everything in this film you didn't really have time to get discouraged about it. T.J. Miller added even more comic relief but the person who really shone in that department was Leslie Uggams who played Deadpool's blind unlikely roommate. Every moment with the duo on screen was laughable from their exchange of snide remarks and insults or just the general situation.As funny as it was (which is really all it had going for it), in the end Deadpool is just another big-budgeted mindless action-packed explosion full of atrocious cgi. Its really just an R-rated version of what we've already seen. Sure it wasn't another Green Lantern experience but it wasn't a uniquely fresh spin on the genre like something we got with Kick-Ass. A film can't really be considered a parody if it becomes the tropes that it's satirizing. Deadpool is not much different than any other of the numerous superhero films coming out today, it just takes a different path to the same single-minded goal of box office success.",5,1,3,16 February 2018
Beetlejuice," Unique, Bizarre, and Fun, but Far From Perfect
","The plot of this movie is definitely a unique one that has never been done before, that is for sure. The Maitland couple dies and starts their afterlife but are confined the their house that they previously owned. But as they are just ghosts, a new family moves in which is made up of a money scheming father, a artistic greedy stepmother, and a lonely daughter. The ghost couple make friends with the daughter, but it is their goal to make this obnoxious nuisance of a family and their cronies to leave the premises and themselves in peace. While they attempt to go through with their plans and figure out this new strange existence, they run into and seek the help of a 'bio-exorcist' or scarer-of-the-living named Beetlejuice. He turns out to be crude unconventional rebel rouser and a real problem.With a story as zany and morbidly themed as this, Tim Burton was the only logical choice, naturally the man for the job. This film also brought us one of many wonderful collaborations with the musical genius Danny Elfman. A side to Michael Keaton that I had never seen before was revealed through his character, it added a new depth to his skill in acting. While I did enjoy the overall idea of the strange and unusual film, it was far from perfect. The makeup was exquisite which it deservingly won an Academy Award for, but some of the other effects looked straight out of fake looking theme park attraction. It had the meticulously detailed diorama and the up close version that was even more fascinating when they switch over to that world, yet they also had ridiculously cheesy characters that brought the overall appearance down. I thoroughly enjoy stop motion animation but it's presence in much of the film seemed out of place and unnecessary.To be honest, I am surprised that this film is so popular. It seems like a film that would appeal to very few, yet it draws people in. This movie made it on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Comedies. While I did find some parts amusing, a lot of the humor was really corny. The singing scenes were simply awful and I found Beetlejuice more offensive and annoying than comedic. The story also seemed to not be very focused. We had about seven main characters and no sense of direction. While I did love some aspects of it, I found more of it to just be disappointing.",4,6,15,7 February 2015
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Excellent Parody
","This was an excellent parody of the world of NASCAR with their corporate sponsorships, endorsements, beer, and trophy wives. It also takes big blows at middle class Americans, homosexuals and has a heavy emphasis on The South. Though this is in the spirit of fun, the critiquing of beliefs is definitely shown, especially being completely irreverent and blasphemous towards religion specifically the Christian population of the United States. The acting was good for the most part, and I was especially expressed with the child actors in the film. The storyline seemed reminiscent of another Will Ferrell movie Elf, with his shaky mental state and 'daddy issues.' 'With all due respect' it is somewhat cheesy, and some of the jokes get old like 'Shake and Bake' or are simply not funny like the scene with the long argument about crepes. It also seemed obvious even while watching all of the cutting in the film. This was definitely a negative, but overall the film was entertaining.",6,1,1,21 January 2015
