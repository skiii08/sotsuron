3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Oscar for Christian Bale-Screenplay
","Absolutely the best western since Clint Eastwood's 'The Unforgiven' !!This is a magnificent screenplay rewrite of Elmore Leonard's original 1953 short story , first screened with Glen Ford starring in the 1957 version. This 2007 edition demands consideration for 'Best Screenplay'. Christian Bale is superb as the down and out Evans, securing his place as one of the most versatile actors of this generation, besides Russell Crowe, who as Ben Wade personifies a mixed message of virtuous evil in this modern day great American relativist morality play. You somehow sense that when Evans tells about how he lost his leg on the Union Side, he is speaking in a more global sense ,addressing the pathos of a generation of Vietnam and Iraq veterans. The plot nuances between Evans and Ben Wade and Charlie Prince conjures up an existentialist dilemma, that blurs the lines between good and bad ,while at the same time delineating both. A multi-level masterpiece!'Pardner', you will miss a bunch if you don't catch this train before it pulls out of the station! -f.c.h.",10,2,5,11 September 2007

","This film elevates the f----word to mantra status for the urban economically disposessed of South Boston. If you can't take it------. I was delighted when I heard that Dennis Lehane's novel was being made into a film. I was utterly impressed with Ben and Casey Affleck's work. This one easily trumps Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River'. but is definitely not a movie for everyone. Prudes will be turned off by the language and the lifestyles portrayed. But all things considered, this flick is about as real can get. The earthiness of 'Southie' is palpable and Amy Ryan's performance makes you want to just reach out and slap Helene McCready across the kisser. Casey Affleck was born for the role of Patrick Kenzie and I hope to see him again in 'Darkness Take My Mind,' or some other vintage Le Hane thriller. Michelle Monoghan makes a delicate but perceptive Angie Gennaro and Ed Harris turns in one of, if not his very best as a burned out veteran detective. Amy Ryan gives an Oscar worthy performance as the 'Slut Supreme', Helene McCready. Morgan Freeman, though thoroughly admirable in the role of police captain, seems out of place in an environment historically not given to racial tolerance, despite the name Doyle. This film and, 'Hollywoodland', one of my favorites, marks Ben Affleck as a latter day John Huston- Actor-Writer-Director. He is bringing back substance to an otherwise corroded Silver Screen. Can't wait to see what he does next. - FCHOUSE",10,4,9,22 October 2007
