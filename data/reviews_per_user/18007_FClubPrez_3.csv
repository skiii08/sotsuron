Catch Me If You Can," A Let Down
","This is my first time posting as an IMDB member so I'll make it concise. This movie wasn't at all like I expected.  I logged on earlier and it was rated 8.0/10.0 by IMDB users so I thought, hey, must be some outstanding movie of the year or something.  Sadly, the only good part of the film were the opening credits.  A lot of the movie dragged on, but with humor placed in awkward spots in an attempt to keep the user going.  Easily one of Spielberg's worst.  Was this supposed to be a comedy?  Give me a break guys. At first walking out of the movie theatre, I didn't want to think it was THAT bad, after all, being directed by a star director.  However, now that I think back upon it, it is an average movie.  The thing that really got to me was how the heck Hanks was so nice???  He's a damn FBI agent that treats the guy he's chasing after like his own son! 6.5/10",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
The Italian Job," A spectacular robbery in a not so spectacular film
","With a promising opening scene of a great robbery, you would think this movie would have more potential like other robbery films such as The Score, which, ironically, also stars Edward Norton. However, as most other B rated movies, this movie falls short on many levels.The Italian Job is a remake of the original The Italian Job (1969). It's about revenge over the death of John Bridger (Sutherland) after a $35 million heist. Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) leads his team of men and long with Bridger's daughter, they take a vengeance on Steve Frezelli (Norton) who stole the money from them in the opening scene. The three mini-coopers seem to get a lot of attention in the movie (I wonder how much mini-cooper paid?). So much attention, in fact, that they had to show them from almost every angle for a good 3/4 of the movie. In fact, by the end of the movie, I myself was wanting one of the little powerful machines.Actually, that's unfair to say because in the original, mini-coopers were also used. In any case, these cars swerve in and out of traffic during car chase scenes like no other. But even with these small, manueverable cars, they never make the action feel complete. When you go into an action movie, you expect action. Though action is delivered (during the robbery scenes), the action during car chase scenes never holds up. It's what you've seen in just about any other car chase scene ever, nothing spectacular.There are a couple scenes though, which make you just laugh. Lyle(Seth Green) brings comedy to the screen and though the jokes are always on the same subject, they never get old. Norton, on the other hand, does not deliver. Not so surprising though, as he said in an interview that he did not look forward to making this movie.The worst thing about this movie was the fact that it cut too many scenes short and made too many scenes long which should have been shorter. This was probably done so that the pacing would be steady throughout the movie, but it never makes the viewer feel satisfied.6.5/10",Null,1,1,3 June 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," A Visual Feast
","If the oracle in the movie could fathom how visually appealing this movie was, then maybe she'd be a true prophet.  The Matrix Reloaded is an action packed visual feast: everything from a delicately filmed 100 agent fight scene to a climactic intense 15 minute freeway chase.  This movie will definitely satisfy most movie-goers and people who loved the Matrix.The plot continues from the first movie, with a darker feel to it. Neo(Keanu Reeves) shows himself to be the one with his amazing fighting abilities.  He gets a boost: he can fly.  Joined with his love, Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss,) the one who believes in him, Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), and the rest of freed mankind, they attempt to stop sentinels from reaching Zion, the last place on Earth.  Morpheus and a few others believe in the power of Neo, others are skeptics.  It naturally follows that there is a struggle between the character and others, namely the commander. Neo also struggles with himself as he tries to hide his awful dream (I won't reveal it here) from himself.  All this happens while the sentinels are digging for Zion and are a matter of days away from reaching the actual city.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie at all.  It's pretty good, just not great.  Where this movie falls short is in it's development.  The story is long and drawn out;  there are many unnecessary scenes, one which is the intimate setting between Reeves and Belluci.  At times it's sort of ludicrous the things Neo can do; you never feel he's in any real danger. But then of course, you're always intent to see what happens next.  Fast forward to the end, and you're left with the feel of Back to the Future. The ending is incomplete and unfulfilled, but most likely because the next in the series will be coming out in November.  If you're looking for character development or a movie that isn't glaring with plot-holes, then this movie isn't for you.  Otherwise, bust out the popcorn, bust out the coke, sit back, and enjoy your movie.8/10",Null,0,0,15 May 2003
