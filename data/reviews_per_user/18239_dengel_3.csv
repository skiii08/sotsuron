Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Same plot, rewarmed for the 3rd time.......
","Kill Jar Jar early, make the target audience over 12, and have more fight scenes with Darth Maul. Only then will this film move rapidly towards a 9. I hope Lucas listens to the critics this time.Lucas also gets negative quality points just because he will not release any Star Wars movies on DVD.",6,0,1,29 December 2000
Memento," Sucked
","After seeing how many people loved this flick, I am surprised.  I guess you should be wide awake and completely alert to watch it.  I was tired and I could not wait for this movie to end.  It left too many questions unanswered at the end.  I will admit that it was an interesting way to film a thriller.",4,4,6,18 May 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Great 1st half
","This movie rocked until they left boot camp.  Once they hit Vietnam, it became pure Kubrick, deep and slow...Sergeant Hartman still scares me to this day. I have friends who were marines during the Vietnam era and they tell me that the boot camp scenes were very accurate.",8,0,1,29 December 2000
