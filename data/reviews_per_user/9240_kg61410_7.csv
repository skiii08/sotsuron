Minority Report," Slight disappointment
","I found Steven Spielbergs Minority report to be a slight disappointment with it's predictable scenes and clishes. The plot itself was far from predictable, but each individual scene went along a path everyone is familiar with. The ending was cheesy with John Andertons (Cruise) wife pregnant and re-united with him. Should the film have ended when they put the headband on John it would have been somewhat better.The future society remained in the background and not much interesting was shown, apart from a few nice visions of how technology will develop in the future.Acting was of a standard level - nothing specially good nor bad.7/10 in my oppinion - the absolute universal truth being 7/10 as well..",7,0,0,14 August 2002
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Very predictable film that seems to just jump from a fight to the next one
","In overall enjoyment I rank this film on par with the last one, was it 'a force awakens' or what, who keeps track of this franchise that bloats like a pie in an oven.I think the story was actually pretty nice. Tell the story of the rebels who stole the plans to the death star and gave Luke and friends a chance in the original. Tie this up seamlessly (literally!) with the original film and it works out pretty well.Characters were a bit of a mix. The main hero and her companion make a good pair but the sidekicks are pretty much taken off the shelf which reads 'useful generic sidekicks'. The robot that tries to replace C3PO got the biggest laughs in our theater but it was all too predictable. It talked bad but turned out to have a big heart, just something we've seen all that often.The film is literally just one big chase, where the heroes are never in a moments peace or rest. I liked the scene in the original when they travel in Millennium falcon and play that game of theirs and just talk. This doesn't have any of that, just explosions. Rogue one also tries to milk in on every possibility to awaken some sense emotion, but obviously so transparently that a critical movie goer will just feel embarrassed.One thing of note is the VERY low level of CGI when they re-created some of the characters from the original movie. It was literally the same as watching a trailer of a new computer game, like Uncharted or something. Totally broke those scenes for me. What if they would have just showed these characters from the back and left the rest for imagination?The film is 100% what you would expect from a money making machine, doesn't inspire you and doesn't totally let you down.",6,26,51,14 December 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A very disappointing film
","A lot of people who talk down a movie start by convincing his audience that he actually likes this kind of movies, just not this one. I guess it's a trick used by the less talented writers. Anyway, I have no problem admitting I'm one of those less talented, so I'll simply write it down for you this way: I liked the original Pirates of the Caribbean and I like easy going brains off films as well. I still didn't like this one - not one bit.It's a film where the whole thing is played down by a few minor things, that just ruined it for me. Maybe you see it differently, but for me any lack of suspense or surprise is usually a sign of a bad film, especially when talking about a film such as Pirates of the caribbean.With lack of suspense I mean this: all the impossible and supposedly exiting scenes meant nothing to me because the heroes were such superhuman creatures that nothing really threatened them. Elisabeth Swan, the lead lady, singlehandedly cuts down.. well I don't know, would you believe fifty?... terrible monsters of the depths - the most feared creatures on earth. And she's just a high born lady, wait till you see the rest. The horrible sea monster is really no threat when Will (Orlando Bloom) takes command of the pirate ship! Harrr! Brace the main sail! Prepare the starboard guns! Argh. How the heck does he even know which way is starboard and whats a main sail, let alone a yard. I just had to laugh - why do you have to build these heroes so much, can't they just grow. Wouldn't it have been fun if Captain Jack would have stepped in front of the order yelling Will and said something like 'pardon me, but that would lead us to the reef which would lead us to sink which would lead us to die.. savvyyyyy?? now step back..' To me that just makes it so boring - anyone can do anything if they're on a just cause and you really don't need any clever plot twists or ideas to get the heroes out of trouble. All you need is Elisabeth or Will with a sword in hand and no trouble is too much. That's it. So with this there is no suspense and no surprises.This goes in the same bin with Godzilla, King Arthur, Indepence Day, Day of Tomorrow and the rest with ridiculous heroes that wouldn't even need any villains because there's no doubt they'd kick theirs butts even with an unsharpened pencil and with no working limbs.4/10 - Bad, but still barely viewable.",4,3,6,4 August 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Nothing near as good as the first one
","As the summary points out, I didn't find the two towers nearly as enjoyable as the first episode. Reasons for this are I believe quite obvious: The two towers is a mix of many things and tales and fails to grab the audience in the manner the first one did. In FOTR you felt enchanted as we were treated with beautiful images (and emotions in particular!) from the shire and from along the journey of the fellowship.In TTT there is really no single plot. The movie consists of the combined tales of different characters and groups and they fail to connect. Even Gandalf, who in the first was a loveable wise man has become more of an action oriented character. In FOTR for ex. you could see Gandlaf pondering matters of great importance, and then find out that his wise decicions were based on a better odor in this corridor than the others. This kind of subtle humor and intelligence is missing in the second film.Acting is excellent, as is everything else - technically. Soul and feeling is what is absent. And the ring. The ring is all but gone, it just hangs on Frodos neck.Having said all of the above, I still liked the film quite a bit. It's just not as good as the first one, which is obviously the only film you can really compare this to. I give this one 7/10, which is a good grade. (as a side note, I suggest users would learn to use the FULL range of votes, instead of always giving tens to movies they happened to like a bit).",7,1,3,16 January 2003
Enemy at the Gates," pure crap
","What most fascinates me here is the different tastes people have; I simply can't believe it when people praise this film. It must be a joke! It has to be...This movie had nothing good in it except the WWII setting, which I hope would be exploited more. The characters were shallow and acted idiotic, emotional outbursts just came out of clear blue sky and ended in a few cheering words like 'it'll be OK..' It was like watching a cheap soap opera.
Acting was terrible (apart from Ed Harris, who, BTW. didn't come across as a character who'd hang a little boy. Why did they have to put that there, wasn't there any other way of getting people interested in the outcome of the duel??? Why doesn't hollywood let us take our own sides instead of pushing us to a situation where there are no longer any options?). Jude Law, who I used to think as a good actor, landed on his butt in this one. He's SOOOO British, that it's kind of hard to accept him as a shepherd from the Urals!All in all, if you liked this movie then a) you're hot for either one of the lead actors and can not think clearly b) have a limited capability of understanding quality or c) you must be joking, which is probably the case.",3,41,71,10 April 2001
Windtalkers," Horrible!
","I know that this review won't be read by all that many visitors nor will it have a significant impact on anyones decicion to see or not to see this film. Writing here how bad a movie Windtalkers actually is, is more treating my own soul than writing an actual review. In a sense I was offended by this film. It's like a situation where a liquor store guy seriously goes 'hey buy this wine, it's really really good, like the best french wine of 1999!'. And if the wine tastes like shit, you feel hoaxed - just the case with this movie. All these people involved probably thought they were making a good product, but ended up with this crap. It's just like a video game with absolutely no sense. Casting is terrible. Cage is awful, as is Peter Stormare as the commander. The plot is laughable and the battle scenes completely out of this world. A bazooka a la Woo is, if not a strategic, then at least a tactical nuke. Tanks go out with hand grenades and no one ever aims of changes clips unless it's necessary for the 'suspense' of the film. And btw, why the hell would the Navajo be transmitting coordinates??? What's the strategic advantage of transmitting artillery coordinates by code? Oh yeah, the enemy will know that they're going to be shot, and take cover and pull their big guns to safety! The Navajo were used as HQ staff to code strategic transmissions, not operative. IMDB scale 3/10, still topping flicks like Godzilla, but not much. 1 point because I like war movies in general, another for good cinematography and the third for being kind enough to give me a fast forward option. So far the worst of 2002.",2,1,3,31 October 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Not worth the ticket nor the time if you're free riding
","I liked the first film. I didn't desperately love it, but I liked it. I thought that film had some heart and soul in it. I think this sums it up pretty well: I felt shivers down my bones (I get that easily) when the Autobots revealed themselves.The 3rd installment is just as bad as the second was. Don't pay much attention to those who say it's better - it's just as bad but in a different way. The 2nd was way too packed with action and mindless scenes where we were supposed to care. The 3rd has much less action, which should not be a bad thing. However, the lack of action is replaced by meaningless characters doing, well, pretty much nothing of any consequence.I'd just like films like these to have characters with some level of dignity. Why is John Malkovich such an ass? He's like crawling on the floor ranting something incomprehensibly stupid when seeing the Autobots. John: Walk in the room, have a look and have some dignity and grandeur about yourself.A very very poor film indeed. With this budget, what could you have made... oh my. I give it 3/10 - which 2 points more than some films have gotten from me, because at least I could watch this one to the end without falling asleep.",3,3,8,7 January 2012
