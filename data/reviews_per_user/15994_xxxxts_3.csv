The Incredible Hulk," Boring
","I will be the first to admit; I did not watch the television series, I did not read the comic books, I might of caught the last half of the 2003 Hulk on FX one night. However Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors. This movie made me yawn numerious times. It was so generic, thin plot, not much character development (besides a few bad guys?), seeing big green monsters box over and over again gets boring after around 2 minuets. Now I usually like Marvel movies, even though I do not read comic books - I liked X-Men, I Loved Iron Man, and Batman Returns was great. Saw the 12:00 showing of Hulk, and I was far from impressed. The action didn't even get my blood pumping, it had much more action then Iron Man yet it did not nearly have the same effect. I apologize for comparing the two but I would rather pay to see Iron Man for the fourth time then see The Incredible Hulk again. I am actually looking forward to seeing The Happening tomorrow.And a few notes:Tim Roth was excellent Brazilian Woman should of had much more screen time Despite how bad the 2003 Hulk was, not many women can beat Jennifer Connelly.Movies that were comparable/better: -Doom (Yes I am serious) -Godzilla (The newer one)",4,8,22,13 June 2008
I Am Legend," All recent zombie movies + Cast Away = I Am Legend
","I saw the first showing of this film at 11:59 PM. I have never read the book and do not know the premise of the book, so my review is going to circle completely around the movie. First of all the acting was pretty good, Will Smith did a great job (But I gotta say the dog was better). When I watched the previews I did not know what to expect from this film, was it a suspense film, horror, science fiction? The film revolves around a military scientist, who just so happens to be the only living immune person in it in all of New York City. He tries to live a normal life, renting films, talking to statues he set up, and his most important thing is his dog. He is working on a cure for this mutated virus in his basement.There is something lurking in the shadows, this virus has created zombie-vampires. They cannot go into sun or their flesh will melt (Anyone seen Buffy lately?) There jaws are able to open very wide to consume flesh. And the virus is transmitted by blood.Some people find him and he has a hard time with communication. Yeah that is the movie. I expected a little more. To be completely honest 28 Months later was a much better film with a much better premise. Much more believable.",6,10,29,18 December 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Awful Remake, Insane Wonka
","First off let me say I am a huge fan of the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. In 1st grade my teacher read the class the book. What made the first movie such a masterpiece was Gene Wilder's excellent performance. His version of Willy was smart, witty, extravagant, and clever. The whole movie was filled with extraordinary things that Wonka had something clever to say about. The classic also taught a moral lesson and showed what happened to spoiled, gluttonous, and TV addicted kids. The reason why I despised the remake is this; Willy Wonka was not any of the things listed above, he was insane and rude. He was just making rude comments to the children the whole movie and saying things that made no sense. Another thing that bothered me is that every time the words 'parents' or 'family' is mentioned Johnny Depp looks like he is going to vomit! The story is not about a candy maker's relationship with his father, it is about a fantasy candy land! I did not go into the theater expecting the remake to be better then the original but I was hoping for it to be good since it had Tim Burton directing it and Johnny Depp playing the role of Willy Wonka. Most remakes take away things from the original and add different things. In the case of this movie it was exactly like the original only missing the cleverness, the excellent music and dance scenes, good acting, a wonderful main character, and originality. On a scale form 1 Â– 10 if the original is 8, the remake scores a 2. I would suggest not seeing it.",2,18,33,18 July 2005
