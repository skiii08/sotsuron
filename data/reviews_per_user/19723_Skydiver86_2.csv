Skyfall," You've killed James Bond!
","Yes, you killed James Bond! I put 1 on this one just because this should be a JAMES BOND movie, not another typical thriller made these days full of FX & with a weak story. James Bond should be James Bond, not an part time alcoholic drug addict who didn't pass on the tests. I know that the original James Bond character is very much old school, but that's exactly how James Bond should be & stay .. Nothing against Daniel Craig, but he really isn't a character for a James Bond movie. It seems like that the director of this movie didn't see any of the previous James Bond's, I just can't understand that someone can step out of the character that far & make 'just another' thriller (the movie itself isn't bad, it's good, but has noting to do with James Bond).",1,4,10,9 October 2013
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Bad acting, good story told bad
","I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came into with his first lines, I thought he was just kidding. Cage as an Italian ?? I'm sorry, but very wrong actor who's acting is also BAD, not to mention his Italiano accent. The story is very loose, it might have been good, but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay. The camera is great, photography also but why the hell did you cast Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role. Please don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against Cage, he has some really great movies, but he obviously isn't for every role. It's really a pity that the cast wasn't better set, because the story has potential.",2,2,4,18 September 2009
