The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Huge differences from the previous two
","No more tough struggles to survive, complicated interpersonal relationships and difficult decisions for loved ones; just hurt, anger and worry over and over again. No more flamboyant capital, gloomy districts and brutal jungles; just repetitious ruins, same underground shelter, and similar propaganda commercials boring enough to doze off. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is basically a two-hour trailer for the final movie which advances almost nothing critical. I have to say it's the biggest disappointment in film series and I really don't want to score it. The idea of splitting the final story of a film series into two parts definitely spoils the film. I see nothing beneficial other than economic gain. The bland plot limits performances of actors and actresses. I can only wish to see more Josh Hutcherson in the next film.",3,12,16,8 February 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It's a pretty bad movie;yet it outperforms Avengers.
","Seriously, if you are not a fan of old comic books, the DC world, or awesome technical effects, do not put BvS on your movie list this week. Anyway, I am the all three, and i enjoy watching Ben Affleck and Amy Adams. So I give BvS a damn eight. It is a rather cool movie, I'd say.Unlike Avengers, which feels like collecting baseball cards or celebrities stickers during childhood, BvS does create a world that is similar to the one we live in: finance, crimes, politics, journalists, etc. At the same time, it carries out a deeper meaning-everyone has a dark side and how should we utilize our dark sides. Also, it discusses personal heroism, collateral damages, and democracy. In this sense, BvS is a movie that can intrigue thoughts for people from all areas.Another thing I can not forget to mention is the pleasure of silver screen time due to excellent visual and acoustic effects in this superhero movie. On the one hand, the fights, drives, explosions, conflict and emotional scenes are filmed beautifully, majestically and impressively. On the other, the 3D effects are pretty astonishing.Nonetheless, when you are standing from a neutral point, BvS is more a bad movie than good. The plot is truly unsatisfactory. Chacacters acts without further explanation on their personalities and sometimes they show conflict egos during the story. Let alone the key aspect-the stupid fight. I can not talk about it again why they get into a fight and make up so soon. Come on, your target audience are not teenagers! Please try harder next time. Anyway, if you like being a puzzle solver, it is fun to watch this fragmentary story and then fall in love with this movie series via multiple Internet searches.",8,2,5,26 March 2016
