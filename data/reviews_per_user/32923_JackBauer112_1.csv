Who Framed Roger Rabbit," One of my favorite movies when I was growing up.
","This movie started all of my interests in movies all together. Who Framed Roger Rabbit stars one of my favorite stars in the name of Bob Haskins as Eddie Valiant. It also stars Charles Flesher as Roger Rabbit as well as many characters in the movie. Christopher Lloyd plays the very evil Dr. Doom and really shows it for himself. At least R.K. Marroon shows how much interest of Roger Rabbit that he can show. But anyway, The film basically outlines how R.K. Marron was murdered and someone wanted to frame Roger Rabbit and also Eddie Valiant IMO is Roger's confidante. The baby, who actually smokes and has quite an attitude helps Eddie in nabbing the person responsible for murdering R.K. Marroon. Now Roger's wife Jessica Rabbit stops by Toontown and sees what type of conspiracy. At least when she finds out that Dr. Doom is responsible for all of the chaos, Eddie tries to shut him down, so at least along the way, Benny the Cab gets hit with the Toxic waste that kills all cartoons with the DIP! We see Mickey Mouse, Roger Rabbit as well as Porky Pig and many more cartoon cameos. But at least in the final showdown Dr. Doom tries to use the anti-cartoon dip to melt Jessica and Roger Rabbit, Dr. Doom turns into a cartoon and tries to see how much pain that he inflicted to Eddie's murdered brother that he killed and then afterward the dip turned into Dr. Doom and thus he melted and thankfully saved Roger and his wife from being a casualty. I have the DVD version of the movie and hopefully I wish everyone to get it because it will be real good to watch!",9,0,0,19 October 2005
