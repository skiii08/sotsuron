Mission: Impossible III," Best Of the Series And Best Of 2006 (So Far)
","Over The Top Might describe MI3. But not in the bad way like say, XXX 2. Which Was disgracefully over the top but still fun. Anyway MI3 is still a great film, this time we get to feel for Ethans character, we want him to succeed, you feel the need to cheer for him in stages. Which Wiorks to the films advantage. Although the story line sometimes doesn't feel fleshed out enough, you are to busy enjoying the action to care most of the time but you feel there could have been more. The stunts rival any other spy flick and the bridge sequence with the jet, Just AWESOME. All in All the film succeeds in what it wants to do, and that is to entertain, and it does spectacually. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, a knob, but a reliable knob at that. If you enjoy action films, and liked the previous two installments, then this one will blow you away.",9,4,8,3 May 2006
Batman Begins," 'Best Film of 2005'
","By Far the best film for 2005. Chris Nolan Has created something thought to be impossible, and that is bring the Bat back from campy disaster. while The original is considered the best, this film manages to topple over the competition in spades. Christian Bale Portrays the dark knight with enough sadness and anger needed for the character. While all the supporting cast turn in brilliant roles such as Michael Caine and Gary Oldman who is a spitting image of Gordon in the comics. In short, the film will appeal to action and superhero lovers but to people who also enjoy their intelligent thrillers. The darkest entry to the batman series yet, and all the better for it. One word to describe the Film, 'Brilliant'. Bring On The Sequels.10/10",10,1,1,3 May 2006
