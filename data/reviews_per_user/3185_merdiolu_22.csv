The Avengers," Superhero Pollution in Hollywood
","Actor John Cusack once said that there are no more big production studios anymore. There are just a bunch of banks which provide funding/credits for projects and approve which script would be produced according to box office profit it is projected to generate. ( because Hollywood mentality became like : more money , bigger stars , bigger budget , bigger marketing , bigger blockbuster , bigger box office income that's all it matters ) Since comicbook / superhero genre is the newest and biggest market to be milked in popular culture for Hollywood in these harsh economy ; is it surprising that The Avengers , a childish intake about a bunch of ridiculously costumed 'Superheroes' with one dimensional immature behavior getting together to repel an alien invasion ( AGAIN ! I think any actual alien seeing these alien invasion movies would not even close Earth ever again. Our 'always winning despite odds' thing would be silly to them ) ? Unfortunetely not. This is another shallow seasonal product , another 'leave your brain at theater door' movie aimed for Comic Con Convention fans. And I admit it is a BIG market.Just like most movies in this genre ( there are a few exceptions ) it has its own cliché's and tropes like they are coming out of a factory assembly line. At least director Joss Whedon ( a great TV writer/producer. I was a follower of Firefly and Dollhouse ) does not deny them and recognizing what they are , wears them at movie's sleeve. Bickering superheroes ( that's fine amusing with Whedonesque humor but humor got overwhelming and made 'superheroes' childlike not multi dimensional characters ) , threat from outer space from a sneering arrogant enemy with another comic book costume ( at least Tom Hiddleston performed as well as he could with material he was given , but what the hell was Loki's motivation in conquering Earth ? ) , his boss with a digital voice , super secret ( American as usual ) military spy agency ( I can never understand American film industry's fetish of military - for a nation devoid of conscription ) , national stereotypes ( Russians are evil you know ) , hot ass kicking super agent babes ( Scarlett , Scarlett are you so desperate ? ) , Aryan looking superheroes from WW2 era ( Thor , Captain America , blond blue eyed , with whom we were fighting with anyway in that time ? Did you realize that there were no other ethnicity among these heroes like Oriental or Latin ) , Tony Stark rich jerk , Hulk a Doctor Bruce Banner marked with tragedy ( Mark Ruffolo is the only actor with proper character material and performs admirably in this ) , Hawkeye with baby faced Jeremy Renner ( I never warmed to that guy as an actor ) , and Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury big boss of agency with an eye patch ( no fake protez in nowadays ? ) because it looks cool , a final battle with lots of laser rays and CGI explosions without casualties in another American urban area ( this year it is New York City's trashing time ) , good vs evil , government made the mistake of launching a nuclear missile , it is averted , heroes are victorious blah blah it is the end....After all this sequence of predictable events where no protagonist was harmed and good guys win , what do we have ? An empty blockbuster which will make a big Box Office hit , probably a franchise but at the end an empty film. I can not wait in 20-30 years our grandchildren asking 'Is this the stuff your generation was watching ? No wonder everything really mattered like environment , economy , politics or simple psyche of human or society condition all of them gone hell. Your visual arts stopped reflecting them !'",3,23,52,22 July 2012
Angels & Demons," Despite changes it is one of the better book adaptations
","I just came out of the movie. I didn't like movie adaptation of 'Da Vinci Code'. The book was fine , original material was there but the script and movie itself was too slow paced and full of long artificial explanations and dubious conversation scenes. Angels and Demons however had much more movie material to work with...From historical and beautiful Rome locations and replica of Vatican scenery to simpler explanations about Illumunati and their history with Catholic church the whole background was almost with novel. The thing that worked in both book and script of A&D was 'ticking time bomb' fact. It both keeps the pace faster and puts a sense of purpose to whole movie. Langdon and Vittoria who try to save cardinals and find the antimatter , Richter , Camerlengo , Strauss , Olivetti who try to control the situation before deadline , Assassin who kills cardinals one by one. There is not much scene to waste because time of the whole movie is also limited and there is lots of material which can or could be adapted....That is also my major complaint about whole movie. Because of time constraints there are lots of changes like editing the kidnappings of cardinals , origins of relations between Camerlengo and Pope or fight between Langdon , Vittoria and Assassin in Castle of Angels....This is an undeniable problem with book to movie adaptations I guess. Still it is a good movie and a much better adaptation than Da Vinci Code. For Robert Langdon fans we can even see his famous Mickey Mouse wrist watch briefly...",7,2,6,16 May 2009
Star Trek," That's what happens when you extend a franchise beyond its natural limits...
","I went to to this last Star Trek movie with a friend of mine. I am a trekie and watched every series and movie though I am not an overzeaolous fan of this franchise. In fact I am very critical and selective and I won't deny there are some moments of banality and low quality as well as brilliant episodes or movies in 43 years of Star Trek. My friend however never heard of Star Trek and whole concept was new to him though he is a very good critic himself. We both have seen the movie...and both of us disliked it....Let's look from two different perspectives...As for Star Trek fans this movie signals death of 43 years of deep Gene Roddenberry themes , philosophy and vision. Star Trek was always about exploration , getting whole universe a better place for mankind and its surrounding races , deep philosophic problems or questions ( remember original series Spock and Dr. McKoy always bickering. They were representing opposite ends of a serious theme or problem) They are gone now. Now it is all about CGI battles against powerful and two dimensional villains who has a personal grudge against main characters and who wish to destroy Earth/Federation/Humanity because of that with super powerful weapons. So the endings are always predictable. You can not identify yourself with destruction of Earth so Vulcan had to go. (we humans always think ourselves and our planet as center of universe selfishly by the way. Even Star Trek adapted that stupid thinking ) Destruction of Vulcan changes whole history of Star Trek and make previous entries invalid.By the way I am not a purist and if there had been a decent script with proper drama at least I would even liked it despite all of negative factors I mentioned above but the whole movie was also a giant ST X:Nemesis and ST:II The Wrath of Khan rip off with elements of time travel from ST:VIII First Contact added. I can say Orci and Kurtzman watched these three movies and decided to write a script which mixes all three...So it is not even authentic or original. During whole movie I said myself 'I have seen that before' In fact characterizations was even worse. During whole movie most of the cast (except Leonard Nimoy and Bruce Greenwood) were either playing young and kid versions or parody types of TOS characters (especially Yelchin and Pegg ) Even in worst entries of this franchise ( before this movie ) like in ST:V or ST:X most of the characters were taking themselves seriously. So aim of this movie is clear. Young , 12-18 year olds who never watched Star Trek or its excellent spin off versions....Kids who will be entertained and buy Star Trek toys in Burger King but forget everything in a few years (who is remembering Transformers anyway right now ?) This is a result of Hollywood Studios always looking to gross income of week not if they ever done an actual art production....As for my friend he simply said 'In an age where they make dark , exciting and thinking sci-fi productions like BSG or Alien this kind of childish productions are bound to fail in artistic sense...I agree completely...",2,17,39,22 May 2009
Public Enemies," HEAT in 1933 style
","If anyone watched Michael Mann's 'HEAT' starring Al Pacino , Robert DeNiro and Val Kilmer then you know what I am talking about. Seriously the parallels between HEAT also a Mann production and Public Enemies are several....A charismatic , even sympathetic bank robber with a code of conduct and honor , an obsessed law enforcement worker trying to catch him , robber getting closer to flame and his demise after a series of unfortunate events , death of his friends in a stylish gunfight and losing his girl ( played suberply by Marion Cotillard ) because of circumstances he found himself at the end.... Johnny Depp continues to amaze me...His versatility in characters he chose to play is incredible...From a 19th century detective to 17th century pirate to Willy Wonka and now this...John Dilinger....Bank robber a common criminal in Great Depression era but also some kind of Robin Hood or Jesse James like public hero figure....Isn't there any role he can not handle ? Christian Bale unfortunately is overshadowed by Depp's character but this is hardly Bale's fault...Even the best actors can only perform as well as the material given to them...So Bale's character Mevin Purvis seems only a stoic stereotype cop , a one dimensional character. Although writing for Bale's character suffered he did his best and pulled that accent thing fairly well.Unfortunately film begins with a fairly uninteresting and uneven pacing after initial scenes of a jail breakout. I don't know if that's due to Mann's choice of confusing editing , or mediocre writing of script adaptation. We don not know anything or more precisely see anything about Dilinger's life prior to initial prison break out or his earlier exploits...So the movie begins with an assumption that audience has enough historical information about characters..That is a bad introduction..After a while we see Dilinger's robberies after break out his other escapes from law etc.. And then we get partly familiar with him... After night firefight in farmhouse and to the end of movie things get interesting...We see a fairly dramatic ending to main character John Dilinger with Eroll Flynn's 'Manhattan Melodrama' accompanying him..While Dilinger is shown as sympathetic to audience lawmen of that era are mostly not...J.E. Hoover FBI Director is a bureaucrat , a media relations obsessed public servant who has never been in field. He proposes to use the methods of Fascist Italy to catch Dilinger's gang...Melvin Purvis as I mentioned is very one dimensional except he is a crack shot and he gives in under the pressure of Hoover and 'takes out white gloves' as Mussolini said....He turns a blind eye as a wounded suspect is tortured while he was in hospital bed and in pain....He then blackmails someone to set a final trap for Dilinger...Another detective brutalizes Dilinger's girlfriend....Meanwhile Dilinger continues to evade them until the end of movie...Only decent looking law enforcement officer was Special Agent Charles Winstead ( Stephen Lang ) who shot Dilinger at the end and delivered his final worlds to his girlfriend Billie in prison..1930'ies settings are nice and well produced from clothing to cars and weapons...Firefight in farmhouse at night was cool looking , stylish , with fast moving camera. I think that kind of firefight scene is Mann's trademark.. Summary : A decent movie. Worth seeing..",7,3,4,16 July 2009
Spider-Man 2," Better than first one
","Well Spidey is back after two years and what a return. And poor Peter still has struggling to pay his rent , have a stable job and taking care of his aunt. Besides his love Mary Jane seems to have a new boyfriend and getting away from him. Well what are you expecting Spidey ? You put barriers at Osbourne's funeral two years ago.This movie is more about choices we made and doing right thing. And it is more about Peter Parker. He is struggling to survive as both Parker and Spiderman. Once he started his second career as superhero he is failing as Peter Parker. So he shall do a choice. Or events shall force him to make a choice. Tobey Maguire is playing Peter Parker , his unlucky or incompetent behavior brilliantly.Now we have a great new villain. Dr. Otto Octavious ( Dr Ock ) with his mechanical arms. He used to be a good guy in fact we still see goodness in him has not gone at the end of movie. But after he lost his wife in a tragic way and his implanted mechanical arms began to whisper nasty throughts in his head he became a meganomaniacal bad scientist who wants to complete his experiment regardless its consequences. Now Dr.Ock in comic books was a real villain with no consequence but in movie he was presented as a character who has the sympathy and almost pity of audience. Don't get me wrong. Alfred Molina played Dr. Ock magnificently. I just wanted him to be more villain.My last respects goes to James Franco. He is great as Harry Osbourne who is bent on revenge , thinks nothing else. There is even a little role of Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne. I hope we see Harry as Green Goblin version 2.0 in third one and a little bit more Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne.",Null,0,0,3 July 2004
Terminator Salvation," Soulless Movie
","The title I wrote above basically describes what me and everyone felt in the theater at the end of movie. Somebody should really get up enough courage and say to Hollywood producers that filling a movie with lots of CGI , pretty explosions and cool looking fight/car chase scenes does not equal to movie making as a cinematic art form. Mindless action and gunfire does not compensate bad and patchy storytelling...At the beginning of movie it felt something was off. The short scene showing Marcus at death row tries to be dramatic but it is not. The scene and lines said by Marcus and Doctor pass off so fast that it feels forced. Then we do leap into future to 2018 exactly. 15 years after Judgement Day the war between human resistance and Skynet is going on full scale. At this point we gave up watching a sensible dramatic acting or story because US Military Hardware Advertisement starts. Really for the first half of the movie all story ( full of holes by the way ) as it laid out , performance of actors or themes or messages of plot ( if there is any ) is secondary background noise. All of them can be discarded. What we see in primary are A-10 ground ground attack jets launching missiles and pounding their targets , Vietnam-era Huey transport helicopters fly by and men in combat gear carrying assault rifles firing at bandanna wearing terminators ( I am not kidding those terminators and art director or producer of this movie have a horrible fashion sense ) , Hunter-Killer or motorbike terminators are chasing , blowing up pick-ups , cars etc......It is as if watching Transformers or Iron Man ( two movies I strongly dislike ) again. In visual style , sense and action McG just rips off those two horrible productions of last year. Actors and actresses do their best but writing of character development is very weak ( except Sam Worthington who stand out among others because most of the movie is about his character Marcus ) so Christian Bale does nothing but shooting or fighting or saying heroic things and others are not so bright also ( I especially cringed when Moon Bloodgood or Common spoke...)Towards the end there is supposedly big showdown between humans and terminators at the heart of machine except it was copied from metal/steel factory scenes in Terminator 2 : Judgement Day here and there...T-800 makes a cameo appearance which is silly at best...After a combination of luck and most convenient factors and coincidences humans triumph...Well that said Terminator 4 shows how much Hollywood and mainstream visual entertainment sector ( like TV ) has regressed more and more.. Do not bother to spend money on T:4. Just watch Transformers ( still horrible by the way ) instead they are quite similar...",3,6,12,6 June 2009
Man of Steel," A Great Cinematic Experience
","All I can say to describe MoS is a very satisfying big silver screen time. Synder/Nolan/Goyer trio did what Nolan accomplished with The Dark Knight series. The main superhero comic book character taken and lifted with its roots and resource material , updated with current times and themes we can relate ( great drama and character work , non linear back story , a plot stakes with as high as possible to thrill , wonderful production values , zero camp/cheesiness or immature humor ) This is the first first-class production that do Superman justice since Christopher Reeve era. Production is very impressive. It is not trying to imitate or try to be something from past of Superman mythology. This is completely a new a restart of Man of Steel legend. With plot themes like isolation , trying to find your place , alienation from society , first contact and choosing to do right thing Superman comes to our level for a better understanding and we rise to his level to empathize with him. This is a guy with almost god like powers after all. What can harm him or stop him ? A green shiny rock ? No even better. Himself. His identity search. His principles. His limits. His inability to save everyone. When third act starts and casualties suffered in characters introduced and climatic battle finalizes you realize what I mean. Story themes are about being as idealistic and inspirational as possible but there is a limit even in that like in real life. Soundtrack is amazing , beautiful. (I am listening it as I write this review ) Hans Zimmer adds so much to this movie. He is the BOSS.Casting is just perfect. Henry Cavill is this generations Superman. He relays everything Clark Kent feels and experiences with his quest for identity and choices. Russell Crowe was just great as well. He was the mentor , guide of Kal El as his biological father. I felt Kevin Costner was underused though. He nailed Jonathan Kent but his scenes were not that much. Amy Adams fits as not as damsel in distress but as a resourceful investigative reporter Lois Lane. And antagonists. Michael Shannon is a new and fresh take on General Zod. This is not a character to conquer Earth for his ego but for his vision his agenda about greater good. He is a fanatic but you can even sympathize with him. Rest of cast Antje Traue as Faora (watch Pandorum) , Diane Lane as Martha Kent , Laurence Fishburne as Perry White , Chris Meloni as Col. Hardy perform superbly as well. Just this amazing cast is enough to watch this in theater.As for negatives in third act there is just too much CGI destruction action and even after you accept nature of this movie after a point your mind goes numb and blank after one destruction scene another. How many buildings you can destroy you ask and then you accept plastic CGI simulation as 'meh whatever.' And aliens leveling another US city like this was done to death before. They drop a couple of stars from this. Please try something else next time Snyder. I know you are visual director but enough is enough. Still very impressive take on Superman. Eagerly waiting the sequel.",8,2,4,19 June 2013
The Patriot," South Carolina Land of Happy Slaves , evil tyrannical sadistic Brits and one unblemished American hero. That's Hollywood for you.
","I am really really sick that Holaywoods's latest trend that USA is the God's gift on Earth or best thing on Universe always stands for right things ! Sure. Mel 'the drunk high' Gibson is a honest good American farmer from South happily living with his family children until righteous Revolution sweeps peaceful slave holding Carolinas , evil Brit Red Coats slaughter every innocent colonist including Mel's sons and surprise Mel and rest of his family becomes super ninjas to avenge their losses.First of all. Director is a problem. Roland Emmerich is a hack , one of worst directors in hall of messy overblown productions history. In an attempt to rewrite history (I am warning everyone historical movies SHOULD have an obligation to be more than entertainment. They must be somewhat historically accurate. Depiction of Tavington and his supposed atrocities are unforgivable. If Warshaw Ghetto inhabitants were depicted as criminals in 'The Pianist' or Amon Goeth character was depicted as a sympathetic or heroic character in 'Schindler's List' imagine the uproar from Holocaust survivors. A lot of people from general audience get a sense of history from these productions not from books ) Emmerich depicts every Englishmen as Nazis. Guilt trip Herr Emmerich ? There is a simply disgusting scene in movie which really happened actually a certain torching scene which was done actually by German SS against French and Russian civilians during WW2. American characters are all innocent and righteous are freeing black slaves (in Carolinas of all places ! ) , sparing enemy wounded and prisoners (too bad they are not doing same thing in Afghanistan and Iraq) and making British look like fools. British were ACTUALLY granting freedom to blacks in colonies (thousands of them went to Canada as free men along with loyalists which was under Crown's reign after the war) They also abolished slavery 60 years before you Yanks.What else ? Mel playing his long gone Lethal Weapon performance. He and his super kids slaughter a bunch of Red Coats in swamps where Mel hacks a Brit to sheds literally with his hacket. A scene which will George Romero proud really. A very corny romance. Battle scenes are nice and realistic though I give that. (though I really would like to have that flintlock pistols killing people from several hundreds of yards. LOL. In that era you really had to be very very lucky to kill person with a pistol/musket even from a close range )",2,7,13,11 September 2013
District 9," You want something different and original ? Prawns of D9 can provide it.
","District 9 was this years secret ace. But it exceeds expectations of a thinking sci-fi audience. District 9 is basically crisis of an alien arrival to Johannesburg South Africa and its effects on everything after two decades. But unlike a stereotypical evil aliens bent on destruction of humanity and taking over the planet ( do sci-fi writers or audience ask themselves what is so special about this little planet or humanity anymore while writing scripts ? ) these are chaotic , aimless , half starved creatures who landed to small planet of ours because their giant spaceship hovering above Johannesburg is out of fuel. South African government transfers them to a temporary camp outside the city due to international pressure. But temporary camp becomes permanent , militarized and at the and turns into a isolated slum called District 9. Aliens segregated and mistreated by human population of South Africa in general. Because they look different almost ugly. We humans are so easy to judge them from their outer appearance we can not comprehend they are sentient living beings..They are called Prawns , a degenetaory term due to their half cockroach half locust outlook. They are humiliated and segregated from humans by force. There are special public places they can enter and they can not. ( Subtle Apartheid allegory from director Neill Blomkamp ) Nigerian gangsters who move in to District 9 exploit them with various scams , like selling their favorite meal , cat food with high prices...And now a large arms manufacture company MNU ( Multinational United ) contracted to baby sit aliens and District 9. MNU does not give a damn to well being of aliens. All they care are advanced alien weaponry brought with them. Because humans can not operate alien DNA coded weapons MNU takes it as far as making medical experiments on Prawns...This whole universe laid out in first ten minutes with a largely mocumentary TV program edition. You can get the feeling this is news channel or documentary of already happened. Then main plot starts from tragic dramatic story of one man. Wikus Van der Merwe. A MNU official a bureaucrat who is tasked with alien affairs. A regular everyday man Wickus he has same prejudices against aliens with rest of society. Not because he is a bad man but the society he is living in makes this prejudices as a reflex. He does not even acknowledge that he is treating Prawns wrong. When novelty of alien first contact wears of and it is clear Prwans are just refugees who do not offer anything MNU starts moving 1.8 aliens population from District 9 to a far away camp District 10. By force if it is necessary. Wikus is the one of several MNU officials to notify them eviction notice in District 9. During his search in District 9 he contacts some alien chemical with slowly turn him to a prawn. As a result his life is ruined he is the most wanted man in South Africa now because he is the only human being who can operate alien weaponry. He goes only place he can seek refugee now...District 9 It is clear that Peter Jackson and new director Neill Blomkamp try to display our human nature to screen. Our ability to prejudice , exploit , segregate and even hate to others who do look like and act differently as a society...At the entrance of District 9 there is a huge statue , a Human and a Prawn hand to hand but it is worn down and disrepair...Just from it atmosphere is apparent. The message is clear. The idea of humans and aliens co existing , living together has lost its appeal long time ago..We humans are majority on the planet and we are the hunter gatherers by instinct. We do not care anybody else because it is not in our nature..Second half of movie goes from mockumentary and hand held camera to regular film making with themes of run-pursuit and sci-fi action....Ironicly as Wikus transforms to a creature like scientist in The Fly he becomes more and more human with good traits...like self sacrifice , help , understanding...Sharlto Copley as Wikus Van der Merve shows an excellent acting performance...Conclusion :If you like smart thinking man's sci-fi with regular CGI action diet ( final battle is quite satisfying though it is a little bit gory ) do not miss District 9...",9,3,6,9 November 2009
2012," Adventures of Super American Dad and his family !
","The title of this sorry excuse for a movie should be like that..I mean after watching Curtis family survive every massive disaster milliseconds before...with making so many jokes and in script gags ( I swore I thought this was becoming a comedy towards middle while countless gigantic tragedies supposed to be going on everywhere with millions dying 'The guy is an actor. He is getting paid to read a script !' ) , scientific nonsense and dismissal of laws of physics ( jumping through massive gaps on the ground with a limo ! , flying with a two propeller aircraft in front of an exploding super volcano , moving a gigantic Antonov plane between collapsing buildings and inside chasms , cell phones and global network of communications still on along with GPS and other navigational systems after Earth's magnetic poles screwed up ) , god awful leaps of logic ( hey listen and follow what every conspiracy nut says when the end is coming....They might have a map which shows our survival ) , racial and national stereotypes for dumb Americans ( 'Arab sheiks and their families are not worthy of saving' implies morally superior scientist hero...WHAT ? Queen of Great Britain is leaving everyone and saving herself with her dogs , shifty fat Russian billionaire buffoons can not be trusted but hey their Paris Hilton like mistresses are hot ! ) , every disaster movie cliché crammed in ( a dysfunctional American family , dad estranged from wife and struggling with an menial job but he is a hero , her new boyfriend is a jerk to be killed , dog survives , family reunited at the end , a scientist warns everyone with a moral and ethical speech at the end and gets First Daughter , US President good decent man doing right thing always and sacrifices himself with his people....STOP STOP TOO MUCH US PATRIOTISM ALERT ) After watching all of this I went to restroom and threw up....Another case which Hollywood does not make a real production or interested with art of film making anymore but only bothered to create a PRODUCT to be consumed by idiot audience to make money....And it will make money because of the marketing campaign , CGI porn and ignorant masses. Not because script or acting means or worthy of anything. Seriously I respect John Cusack a lot. What happened to this guy ? Why he accepted leading role ? I will not even bother to discuss rest of the cast...They were all terrible one way or another ( except for little actress Lily Morgan ...She was quite talented and acted better than anyone else...Because she acted natural as she supposed to be...not like Woody Harrelson's overbearing absurd conspiracy nut mannersRoland Emmerich has only one or two script and he is using it over and over again with little changes ( except little changes names , characters events and characters are similar with 'Independence Day' and 'Day After Tomorrow' ) Even he has a different scrips he shows what a terrible director he is....He is just selling a CGI show and you can go to Disneyland instead and get a similar thrill in rollercoasters....",1,76,117,27 November 2009
Transformers," God , that was awful !
","You know one day in future our descendants will look history and say how tasteless and simple minded we were in entertainment especially movie making , 7th art. All the big product ads , massive marketing hype and lots of CGI and other special effects. Add some stupid cr..py dialogue , US Armed Forces propaganda and a few hot chicks for eye candy : Here is Transformers. A huge excuse for massive explosions , typical Michael Bay (creator of Pearl Harbor disaster. Not the historical attack. Disaster of a movie made in 2000 I am talking about ) style. I bet he is laughing while counting big bucks he got by suckering all stupid 15 year old male target audience (MTV generation we might say) to theaters and showed them worst acted , edited and plotted film I have ever seen in my life. I really congratulate myself in fact because I had sense not to see it in movie theater and spend money on it. I just borrowed a DVD and wasted two hours no..no endured two hours of torture. I mean CGI and massive explosions are all nice but what about character development , proper acting , a sensible story ? You know essentials of a scenario or proper editing ? Nada , zero , none. Michael Bay must have assumed that we will be in love with giant robots fighting each other and USAAF aircraft firing missiles. But robots were not even primary characters. Primary characters are a boy who wishes to impress a hot chick , his first date , a bunch of US Army grunts , a hot chick computer hacker and her fat stupid hacker friend , Defence Secretary of US ( who is old veteran actor Jon Voight. He must really have been desperate for money to play this non character ). There are so many coincidences , convenient occurrences , clichéd plot points you really have to turn your brain off to see it to the end. Lame slapstick humor completes this whole mess and destroys whatever self respect these characters or movie itself had...Hot damn I am annoyed. I will do my best to forget this latest Bay calamity. I think I need a therapy for that. Worst big budget movie after Independence Day. If this is the best they can do that means American movie industry is dead and buried long time ago. My recommendation to Bay. Quit movie making and start your own demolition business...",1,1,5,28 May 2008
The Dark Knight," Suberp movie in every sense but could have been better
","First of all I usually dislike movies about comics , superheroes and Hasbro toys all the time (my only exception on this subject is awesome 'V for Vendetta') When I was a kid I used to watch most of them my mouth open and mind closed. If I was still a kid I would continue to do so. But I am 27 now and most of comic book inspired big budget movies (and that equals almost all of Hollywoods investment efforts in every year unfortunately to milk cash from comic book markets) seem silly , childish and pointless. It is the difficulty of transferring a comic books contents and subjects to big screen I think. They are completely different media and art forms with usually different type of audience. If you can reflect integrity of comic or a novel in a film it is great (and rare) but if you can notmeh another fiascoThey might make money but in cinematic sense and art form they are massive failures But Batman Begins and now its sequel The Dark Knight are not. They are one of the these rare examples which one medium of art was successfully transferred to another. I think the producers and director Christopher Nolan were aware of one fact since the first time they took over Batman project. They are producing a movie , not a comic book imitation and it shows on screen. A comic book adaptation but not a look-a-like or rip off..They are making a unique type of creation , in their own form and style. Almost all of dialogue , characterization and story has good drama , consistent within itself and seem easily to connect most of the time. The characters are not over-sized , overacted and hyped clowns. There is no rushed attempts of bad humor. Editing is fairly good but it could be a little bit better. (Some sudden changes from one scene to another or one location to another is too abrupt.) Production values are again in high quality. But of course you can not accept anything from a high budget box office production anything less nowadays of course. A blockbuster or box office hit or a comic book adaptation expected hit should be entertaining at least and laziest way to accomplish this is special effects , action ,explosions and CGIThe Dark Knight have them but in a suitable level nothing more nothing less. They are just icing on the cake as it should be. As I mention other aspects like story , drama , themes , characterization and acting which both entertain you and raise the level of respect to the people who involved to this project. Batman Begins was about Bruce Wayne and his story , his journey or better description start of his journey. It was about two themes. Fear and justice. Overall story this time is conflict or crash of two different ideologies. Order (Batman) vs Chaos (Joker). Usually decent and professional lead Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne (he is still very good here make no mistake) takes a step back lets excellent Heath Ledger to take the lead as Joker with a performance of his life (in every sense) Joker is gripping , intense , witty , scary , quite insane and very unpredictable. He does not give a damn anything , he only has an agenda of chaos in fact he is an agent of disorder just for sake of itJoker is trying to make a point and for this he lets nothing back. At the end you even understand and get a few points he was trying to make.Maggie Gylenhaal is a little bit uninspired as Rachel Dawes this time but last sequences of her character make up for that. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine are professional actors as usual become one with their characters as Police Commissioner Gordon and Bruce Wayne's butler/confidante Alfred. Another fine acting performance is displayed by Aaron Eckhart as tragic District Attorney Harvey Dent. One last thing that gripped me is the ending. It is not lily white (as usually expected from comic book adaptations) where villain is dealt and threat is over. After dust settled you realize story of Batman and the characters involved in Nolan's universe evolved advanced. Damage has been done. (in a way Joker won) Story progressed forward. It didn't return to status quo. It didn't go backwards. It might be depressing for some but hey it is life. This version of Batman is much more adult oriented and that is why it is so gripping and thrilling. Of course it is not at level of classics like Godfather or Shawshank Reedemption that would be ridiculous. But Batman Begins is one of the best comic book adaptation movies of all time..",9,2,9,7 October 2008
Blood Diamond," Precious gems will not seem same after watching 'Blood Diamond'
","'Througout the history of Africa whenever a substance of value was found locals die in great number and misery..' 'Blood Diamond' is best Edward Zwick movie I have seen so far ( I was immensely disappointed with Tom Cruise turd 'Last Samurai' ) With characters and locations seem straight out of a Wilbur Smith novel Blood Diamond displays an example of blood mayhem , tragedy and huge suffering occurred during Sierra Leone Civil war ( 1999 ) in West Africa. The catch is rich diamond deposits of Sierra Leone of course. Everybody wants them , brutal RUF rebels who raids and burns villages for labor to work in diamond mining , South African mercenaries who sell arms to them in return for the diamonds rebels got , diamond cartel which funds mercenaries and rebels to control the illegal diamond flow to market , individuals , governments you name it. This movie shows how inhuman we can be in pursuit of material monetary enrichment and disregard human suffering in the background. Or worse inflict that suffering ourselves...Meet Danny Archer , ex-South African soldier now mercenary and diamond smuggler. Leonardo Di Caprio displays this character excellently on screen. He studied this character meticulously , perfected a Rhodesian accent , obviously took some kind of military training down to ammunition saving in battle situation as any sane soldier in combat situation does. This is not an just an action movie ( though there is a lot of amount of action and violence ) This is a drama , history , social commentary movie with realistic action and a little bit romance. When bullets struck home it usually kills or wounds one severely. Archer is a cynic. He is what he is. A man making his own fortune in a place of chaos....Although he is one of the three main characters he is not an angel or do gooder. His actions are usually based on his interests. But in fact he is is a decent man who has the capacity to do right thing. He just does not know or show that...Di Caprio was really brilliant with this character and that year Academy should have awarded him for this performance...( I am not including the Departed of course )Djiman Hounsou is also very good as other main character as Solomon Vandy a poor fisherman who is separated from his family when RUF rebels raided his village. While working as a slave labor for rebels he finds a huge diamond and hides it. Meanwhile trying to find his family , especially his son Archer finds him and his secret so two make an uneasy deal...This character is usual and even a little bit stereotype for Houmatsu but again he plays it strongly...He is somewhat representative good simple ordinary man , another add in countless victims of Africa's troubles , a man of simple nature who determined to take his family back And lets not forget Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen an American journalist , idealist trying to make a difference by writing facts...By acting as voice of conscience for Archer she makes an impression though Connelly's character is a little bit weaker than other two. Still Maddy was passionate and quick-witted. Her silent romance with Archer was beautiful and unusual somewhat more classic romance in over sexualized Hollywood...Most of the supporting cast is also very good as David Harewood as sadistic RUF rebel commander ( he was also humorous sometimes ) , Arnold Vosloo as commander of mercenary forces , Kagiso Kuypers , Basil Wallace and Michael Sheen The battle sequences , violence , tragedy of child soldiers might be haunting but they are also strong reminders of what really happened and shall happen as long as we don't care...When you pay your three month salary to purchase a diamond ring for your fiancée / girlfriend / wife think about it. That piece of shiny rock might have passed through a layer of human blood....T.I.E. ( This is Africa )",9,0,0,20 November 2009
Elysium," Elysium : A Movie with certain sci-fi vision whatever you like it or not
","First of all I really missed Sharlto Copley's heavy South African accented f-bombs. It is great to hear them again.That being said lets get on the review. You can point one constant fact about Neill Blomkamp so far. He does not mind about being politically correct , non -offensive , family friendly or child/studio/box office friendly , PG-rated work. In his productions he shares what he thinks with audience , sparing nothing about his vision of where we are or where we are heading , putting effective real life examples or analogies about main themes or subjects of his scripts. You might not agree about him. But he creates a controversy a discussion about issues we can not ignore. That is his strength and what makes his movies so fun , interesting. Not like Disney funded banal and boring comic book stuff which became shallow formulatic and predictable as hell just to make BO profit by trying to appeal everyone and we are forced to watch on screen every year. District 9 ( which was a great piece of work) was about racism , xenophobia and apartheid. It struck hard. Elysium is about massive illegal immigration , health care , social/income inequality we are forced to face more and more each passing day. Blomkamp basically says that we can not afford to ignore them anymore. Though the actions of main protagonist Max DeCosta we are faced with a desperate man driven to desperate means. In 150 years Earth became a gigantic slum , a Barrio from Mexico City. (most of the film was produced there so it is not surprising ) Pollution , over population , automation of certain services and extension of life created a hell on the planet. When Max played by an subdued Matt Damon has a fatal work accident in the plant he was working (did I mention that Work Safety Regulations , Employee Rights , Unions all vanished as well ) that will cause his demise in a few days he goes on a path that will either save him or kill him a few days earlier. Desperate people and their actions. Alice Braga as Frey Max's childhood crush and Wagner Moura as Spider tag along as well. Then there is Elysium. A huge O'Neill class rotating space station in high orbit of Earth , an orbital habitat , a paradise for humans. A place where extreme pleasure , health care and life can be experienced through technology that was denied to masses. Jodie Foster who emphasizes her detachment from humanity by her fluent speaking French discussion in her first scene then orders shuttles full of immigrants approaching Elysium to be shot down coldly plays Defense Minister of Station Delacourt who oversees tight immigration procedures and makes no one who does not belong to a rich privileged class comes to station. She is OK with this character. But from antagonist types from the movie two other characters over shines her. First company CEO John Carlyle who is played by sharp cold uncompromising straight William Fichtner. The other is great Sharlto Copley who plays a sociopathic , unpredictable creepy South African mercenary / bounty hunter named Kruger. He is basically dealing with dirty work on Earth for Elysium administration.CGI and other visual effects along with camera work is great in my opinion. Droids are cool and cold without any sense of empathy or emotion. Action is great but not over the top or oh look Green Screen overload type of thing. It is adequate.What this movies missing I think is overall sharpness or much more uncompromising attitude of District 9. That movie dealt with our world and our society in a much more harsher , 'in your face' way. Here Blomkamp seems to take a back step , made Elysium s little more audience friendly maybe probably due to studio pressure. Another disappointment is script's similarity to District 9. Characters , their motivations , sequence of events are all to similar. One might even say that Sharlto Copley called his workmate David James from District 9 and asked him how to act like a crazed mercenary. Still one hell of a movie definitely one to be watched in theater with big screen. 7,5 would be closer to my final rating.",7,2,14,9 August 2013
Avatar," Master is Back !
","James Cameron returns to big screen with all of his grandeur after 12 years of hypersleep. During all this time he mostly kept himself busy with some documentary projects like 'Expedition Bismark' and last few years with Avatar. Apearently he was waiting for necessary CGI visual and camera technology to develop....Usually I dislike when a movie production is sold to gullible audience through only with overblown massive CGI ( mainly with explosions ) and a lame bad or awful script and terrible or non existent characterization. Industrial Hollywood directors like Bay or Emmerich just sign on horrible scrips only to show latest massive CGI destruction scenes....But thankfully James Cameron does not take that path. He uses CGI and other extensive visual/camera technology to tell a simple , understandable ( though covered before in other previous productions ) story through visuals...That means he uses elegant scene capturing , camera work , excellent acting and elegant plus revolutionary CGI all combined together to tell a story , including its background and universe. He is using visuals , CGI to tell his story and set its background extensively. That's why 'Avatar's battle scene was towards its end ( it was also excellent and massive of course ) Cameron uses more than half of 162 minutes just to introduce this new alien planet , its ecology , biosphere and beautifully created Na'vi people plus characters with visuals..He takes his time...But to make it interesting he does that again with excellent amazing and creative visuals and scenery...And in 3-D wow..absolutely amazing...You are virtually in this alien but somehow familiar planet. And with all of these imagery , scenery , visual 3-D tech planet Pandora , its surroundings , plant-animal life and Na'vi culture all seem something novel , aesthetically gorgeous , wondrous and interesting to audience...That my friends is the mark of great movie making...We became so familiar and combined with Na'vi and their harmony with nature , way of life and beautiful environment when action starts we subconsciously side with them. It is almost like instinct...One side there is military industrial complex of humanity in future who wants to expel Na'vi with massive firepower , exploit their lands and ruin natural habitat ( as we have seen countless times in history in colonization of American and African continents ) just to mine a mineral below ground...At the other side these beautiful and simple people with their harmony with nature....As I mentioned before story was covered before in other productions like Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas so it is also kinda predictable ( that's why I broke one star from rating ) but as I said before magic of Cameron is ability to tell even a simple and previously told story from a different angle with astonishing visuals , serious attitude ( there is no lame humor here ) and emotionally moving and exciting way...There isn't much originality left in Hollywood storytelling anyway..and I pick Avatar's story over stereotype evil aliens vs good victim humans and military saves world with massive firepower plots....Still towards the end of battle sequence some events began to go over the top....Like Eywa 'Mother Nature' comes to rescue at last minute , it was a lame cop out McGuffin so good guys win at the end...Col. Quaritch jumping from crashing command craft in a battle suit was silly like something out of a dorky Bay movie and his final fight in battle suit with Jake and Neytiri reminded me a final boss level fight from a mediocre video game...But these are small nit pickings. Basically story was good and it was about something ( anti-corporate , anti-militarization , nature/environment preservation ) As for the acting it was usually decent. Sam Worthington was OK...Zoe Saldana was excellent ( still amazed how her and other characters CGI facial features were so elegantly displayed in different emotions..How the hell they pulled off that ! ) Sigourney Weaver is bringing her usual professional performance. Her character Dr. Grace Augistine reminded me another character played by Weaver again..Dr Dian Fossey in 'Gorillas in the Mist' (1988). Stephen Lang was great as bad ass Col. Quaritch. Lang had also pulled an impressive secondary character performance in Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' this summer and here in 'Avatar' he does not disappoint again as main antagonist. Quaritch was basically General Patton of future...Giovanni Ribisi as Selfridge , a corporate weasel ( a clear rip off from Burke character from Aliens ) , Michelle Rodriguez as chopper pilot Trudy and Joel Moore as Spellman were again OK as secondary characters...So summary : Master James Cameron is back folks...Though Avatar is short of excellent or perfect as it intends to be...it is damn good , it has at least a nice plot , amazing visual scenes and it provides a fantastic entertainment...And I loved the soundtrack..Definitely will buy it...",9,4,10,22 December 2009
Man on Fire," 'Revenge is a dish best served in cold'
","Based on a 1980'ies A. Quintrell novel 'Man on Fire' as a production sizzles and then flares with high quality. It is a violent revenge movie , it is a touching redemption story , it is a friendship/healing tale....and it succeeds telling all these aspects in an emotional , gripping way. Main creator of this production Tony Scott ( whom I think along his brother Ridley Scott are last of the few creative artist directors remained in CGI/Marketing oriented Hollywood ) uses a non-original but still very good script , high class acting talents of Denzel Washington , Dakota Fanning and supporting cast plus some very stylish , cutting , flashy , clip like camera work ( especially in violent scenes ) to create a great movie. Tony like his brother Ridley is a true artist on my account.Story : Creasy ( Washington ) is an ex CIA operative/assassin who was burnt and now is an alcoholic filled with guilt due to his past career. When a friend of his arranges a job for him as a bodyguard for Pita ( Fanning ) daughter of a young industrialist in Mexico City where kidnapping-for-ransom is the new rising crime wave , he accepts it reluctantly. But when Pita with her child like innocence forms a bond and takes him out of his self pitying he is committed to her. Until she is kidnapped and Creasy wounded while protecting her. When ransom payment goes awry and she is assumed dead Creasy goes rogue and starts a bloody rampage , begins a violent reckoning among these 'professional criminals' and whoever arranged and profited from this foul deed or 'looked wrong' to CreasyThe whole movie is tight accessible to regular viewer , filled with themes fills you with emotions along with clip like scenes...Acting especially from Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning is great...Highly recommended",9,6,7,12 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Most Watchable Movie of Prequel Trigoly
",".....and this is the highest praise I can think of about Episode 3. In fact it inherits most of the faults of previous two movies. ( but not all. For example no Jar Jar Binks except a few forgettable scenes and thank god no more his silly accent ) Weak scripts , terrible lines and bad acting from some of main casting goes on though. Besides there is too much CGI , enough to give you headache and although Computer Generated Image Tech advanced so far we can see its limits here. During certain times in movie you feel like you are watching an anime or something and this is disturbing. You can see forgery in these scenes obviously. More than that making some key characters as CGI just didn't work. They don't give you the edge of real actors or hand made creature designs. Give me puppets of Jim Henson Creature Shop over CGI anytime. If they did this all just we can see Yoda fight umm no I could do without that.But CGI just one issue to complaint. I can hold myself against bad acting or Hayden Christiansen's inability of acting only so far. Seriously what the hell casting director or Lucas thinking when they give a vital no in fact a key role as Anakin Skywalker to Hayden Christiansen ? Did they think we shall all fall in love with him because he is cute ? MOST OF STAR WARS FANS ARE MALE !!! I mean terrible lines written for him also didn't help ('yo underestimate my power !' Scriptwriter should be fired really ) but Hayden also has a freakingly annoying way to say them. Then there General Grivous. Leader of stupid droid army (making funny droids were a big mistake , every time they did something funny like saying 'Uh-Oh' or run , I was jumping on my seat. Elegant but blunt humor of 3PO and R2-D2 was no more. A pity..) His Boris Karloff accent made my eyes roll. But not all acting was bad. Ian McDiarmid really shined in this episode in spite of his share of silly stupid lines ( 'No you die ! ' 'pooweeeer , unlimited poweeeeeer !') This time he really gave Palpatine character an edge and complexity with his acting skills. Ewan McGregor was also not bad although there was a sense of reluctance from him during some scenes. Like he had enough playing against CGI characters with terrible dialogue. Last of all Natalie Portman is a very gifted actress ( anyone disagrees go and watch 'Leon' or 'V for Vendetta') but this is when she is given proper material to work with. Here she was quite boring again just like in two other Star Wars prequels due to her terrible lines and dialogue again....One thing I liked most is ties that connected to Original Trigology like how Empire was formed , why , how Darth Vader was born etc...Again it had plot holes but...they should be just overlooked if you want to enjoy the movie. Another thing I liked was musical scores. Their synchronizations with climatic or dramatic moments were quite good and moving (like during Jedi slaughter) Still give me Original Trigogy over this anytime...",5,2,3,7 March 2008
Inception," It is...pure creation
","Just like Ellen Page's character Ariadne says 'It is pure creation' This quote summarizes whole movie. Inception is a well through implicitly written and edited , deep , thrilling and above all INTELLIGENT summer sci-fi block buster we miss so much for years.The reason and genius behind this work of art is one name : Christopher Nolan. This is his handiwork , his final work on through , conscious and sub conscious mind state. He spent ten years to complete the script. Believe me. It shows on the screen. Since Memento we see his obsession on time , memories , dreaming , emotional pain , loss , tragedy in dark noir sense....Now I have decided that these aspects are his trademarks...But boy he uses them excellently especially in Inception. He is not after latest CGI explosion. For him CGI and other special effect tricks are just tools to tell his story and his characters. And due to his trade marks I mentioned above his stories , characters are serious and involving. As you go one layer after another you give yourself as a whole to understand the plot and characters. In Inception whole audience is so mesmerized when it ended with that ending there were lots of 'ahhhhhhh's. Christopher Nolan does not insult audience and their intelligence. He trusts them. He creates a maze at first half then puts us right in it. He does not bore and lower his standards with lame teenager jokes and sex appeal of latest no talent chicks. He does not make fun movies. But he also leaves entertainment element in his productions. There is humor but subtle and timely. There is action but it is on the spot and not over the top. There are few clichés if none. It is not predictable. You do not know what is coming next. Time difference , cut/edit work between several dream levels are jaw dropping. Several scenes like zero gravity fight at hotel or slow motion drop of van are sure to be cult moments for fans. They reek of elegant artistic work. Nolan takes his work seriously. He is making what Alfred Hitchkock or Stanley Kubrick was doing in previous decades. He is working on 7th Art....Main characters also display an impressive performance on screen. Leonardo Di Caprio ( who is becoming more legendary and professional because he chooses his projects carefully ) is the main protagonist of Inception....his character Dom Cobb is an Extractor , a thief of thoughts and ideas in dream state and he is one of the best. A fugitive for a murder he did not commit he is on run around the world and he is also a haunted man marked with tragedy. Inception is primarily Cobb's story...his dealings with his loss and his quest to reunite with his children. Caprio puts his best performance with this character. Joseph Gordon Levitt is Arthur the Point Man , Cobb's partner in extracting operations. I saw Levitt first time in that awful GI Joe movie last year. But here he was quite excellent. Ellen Page surprised me with her decent performance as Ariadne the Arcitect , builder of dreams and a recent addition to Cobb's team. She performed as a very mature , wise character , a voice of reason for Cobb. Tom Hardy ( I know him from Star Trek Nemesis movie , Band of Brothers and Colditz mini series ) was another amazing stand out as wise cracking Eames the Forger. And let's not forget wonderful French actress Marion Cotillard as Mal , main villain of Inception....Cotillard was quite good when I saw her first time in Public Enemies last year. But in Inception her acting is beyond words. Her glare was enough...Other actors Ken Watanabe ( Last Samurai , Letters from Iwo Jima ) as Saito the Tourist who hired Cobb and his team for 'Inception' , Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer the Mark ( quite a normal and emotional character a real change for Murphy ) , Dillop Rao as Yusuf the Chemist and Tom Berenger as Browning were also quite impressive. Legendary Michael Caine also has a short role as Miles. Cast is quite international. ( British , Irish , American , Canadian , Japanese , French ) It seems that Nolan is not interested working with latest Hollywood celebrity. He is interested working with a talented cast...And you know what ? It worksLast thoughts : Thank God for Christopher Nolan. When we despaired of Hollywood and its finished creativity he served us Inception....A movie that incepts ideas in minds , inspires , starts creativity....It is not a comic book rip-off or a remake of another classic. I know some would say that Inception was ripped from Japanese animes to Matrix , Uncle Scrooge comics...So what ? Nolan never denied that he used ideas from James Bond movies , '13th Floor' ( another impressive production ) , Matrix....He mixed them so well you do not realize that fact at all. Pay no attention to them. As for me...I am eagerly waiting Inception DVD....",10,1,5,11 September 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Christopher Nolan Makes Movies
","Christopher Nolan Makes Movies.. There can not be any other summary to explain that man's career. He does not make genre flicks , CGI or 3-D simulations , banalities. He does not take lame overwhelming and childish humor because of target audience or nature of script-basically comic book stuff-He goes against expectations. He does not bow under studio pressure. ( I hope other directors take a note how he stands for his own vision and principles ) He is a very bad man. Don't we love him because of that ?Beginning of TDKR reminds me that Chris Nolan once wanted to direct a Bond movie and how much he and his script writing genius brother Jonathan had been influenced with that era of cinema. Aircraft hijacking/crashing scene was intense and one of the best thrilling introductions I have ever seen. Then we get to Gotham our location where our story being told to its finale. Now I am going to intrude here and say that Nolans begin to tell a compact history of French Revolution. He once said Charles Dickens classic novel 'A Tale of Two Cities' was his inspiration. And it shows ! After eight years of suspending a legend , a lie about what happened in The Dark Knight , Gotham seems peaceful. Due to Dent Act all major criminals and other trouble makers are in Blackgate Prison (Bastille ?) But most of the underlying reasons of Gotham's suffering remain. There is still a huge gap between rich elite , a relishing minority and poor suffering masses , a forgotten and ignored majority. Orphans are working in sewers , doing whatever they can. Wayne Enterprises stopped its charities and visionary clean energy projects. Wealthy continue to spread their money for parties and luxury. Police is increasingly powerful because of Dent Act but it is like putting a cork on top of a boiling bottle. Actually things are not as peaceful as it seems (It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the Season of Light , it was the Season of Darkness..) It is all the right mixture for someone with radical agenda to spread chaos and anarchy with extreme violence and destroy the established order.Architechts of all this temporary peace are not satisfied with what they accomplished either. Bruce Wayne , degraded in body and soul , retreated into a solitary life. No one saw either him or his altar ego Batman for a long time after Batman took all blame of Harvey Dent's crimes. Jim Gordon is also at unease and torn about revealing the truth to public. Both Christian Bale and Gary Oldman are great , excellent as usual we expect from these established actors and their well drawn characters. A burglary incident in Wayne Manor puts Bruce Wayne back into game to track a resourceful cat thief. ( Anne Hathaway just made everyone who criticized her to eat their own words with her wonderful performance. No one can question Nolans actor selection from now on ) And meanwhile trouble is brewing beneath Gotham in form of Bane , a hulking and cunning extreme revolutionary/mercenary fanatic and his army. Tom Hardy is just awesome both physical , vocal and facial (as much as with a mask , shades of Hugo Weaving in 'V for Vendetta'. Unlike others I could understand him perfectly and his voice just scared hell out of me ) acting in this role. Death of John Daggett ( or death of Maquis St Evermonde , Nolan Nolan how you gave audience so much credit for their intelligence ) was one of the finest piece of acting between two actors I have seen this year. While Alfred , trusted Butler and confident of Bruce try to stop him for his own good (Veteran Brit actor Michael Caine goes amazing lengths especially in his final scenes) war is approaching....Remaining supporting cast and characters are great too. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is just screaming with huge potential as John Blake , a honest good cop trying to help Batman , Morgan Freeman is also very good again not surprising with his career. I haven't seen Matthew Modine for a long time so he was a nice surprise as Foley. Only casting I had trouble with was Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. (Madam Defarge here) Marion is an excellent actress but here she was struggling with her French accent and her character's romance with Wayne does not make sense or established well ( nor his second romance with Catwoman either ) There are a few plot holes like Blake's figuring out Batman's true identity with a flimsy explanation. Pacing of story can sometimes be uneven but seriously I never noticed how almost three hours passed. The whole movie was that gripping. The throwbacks to first movie are very elegant , Scarecrow , Ra'as al Ghoul both make an appearance and confirm that TDKR is a full circle from first movie , a conclusion of protagonist's heroic journey , closing of final chapter. Actually story structure is somewhat similar to Batman Begins with revelations , hellish conditions in prison ( Black Hole of Calcutta ? ) process of fall and rise and hero's inner struggles but not disturbingly so. It is not a copy cat or rip off.The themes are serious , there are no more darkness and light anymore. While heroes and villains struggle in light for ultimate salvation of Gotham , some like Sidney Carton from 'A Tale of Two Cities' will make the ultimate sacrifice. 'It is a far far better thing that a I do ,than I have ever done , it is far far better rest that I go to than I have ever known' final words of ToTC",9,5,11,28 July 2012
Iron Man," Very Good video clip/passable US Air Force recruitment film/horrible movie
","One asks himself what if Marvel or DC Comics did not exist what would become Hollywood ? I mean once had been cradle of art and creativity these studios are throwing their resources , talents and investments to make clichéd worn out predictable comic book adaptations nowadays. In a few instances they are OK in artistic sense due to talented acting , decent and deep characterization and finely balanced dramatic writing with CGI or special effects are as required nothing more nothing less. (no matter how impressive they are)Unfortunetely Iron Man does not belong to this category. This is a movie produced and edited as a video clip. It has every cliché imaginable expected from a big but empty headed Hollywood blockbuster inspired from comic book aimed for 15 year olds. Cartoonish characters , sterile environment , lots of CGI , lame jokes/humor , unbelievably silly story (he made a super powerful weapon suit inside a cave ? PLEASE !!!) , hot chicks , fast cars , US Army being source of goodness around the world , swarthy Middle Eastern looking like bad guys who are evil just sake of it ( and getting their asses kicked of course as always) , an arch villain who boasts a lot , a final boss level showdown where superhero thriumps without any cost or after consequence....I understand there are lots of fans of that kind of things but frankly I am bored with them...I can endure even ignore clichés or predictability if movie presented something new , unique or original...Nope everything went down exactly I predicted above.....As for acting it is hit and miss really...Robert Downey Jr. shows a really decent performance here since his character Tony Stark is the center of story. Unfortunetely his character is nothing more than a Bruce Wayne wannabe. Mrs Patrow is usual damsel in distress...Jeff Bridges is usual uber nemesis without maniacal laugh or mustache twirling (he does have a beard though) Terence Howard is just awful. He doesn't have even a slight military presence....I see this as a trend....Comic book superhero adaptations just aimed to entertain and please fans of genre or very young or sub educated people who can be dazzled with CGI , explosions and awful characterization/dialog. Due to money making reasons (undeniable result of Hollywood becoming an industry to make profit) it is a popular trend now but this is not cinema.....I do not see a future for Iron Man (in creative sense) except a few sequels then audience will probably shift to next superhero like Superman , Spider Man , Hulk , Fantastic Four etc or its sequel/remake....They are basically same unfortunately...",2,10,21,22 October 2008
V for Vendetta," Can you say Perfection ?
","I had never read Alan Moore's original comic before. In fact I had very little fore knowledge what V for Vendetta was all about before entering theater. All I know it was about dystopia (I have a weak spot about productions like that ) , totalitarianism and one hero's struggle...I sat down and get up when the movie finished. But but I couldn't think or do anything anymore. I was in a sensory overload. This movie was so full of ideas , messages , style , drama. Especially for a comic...Messages of this movie relevant even today and will continue to be important even tomorrow.Development of characters are superb at least. And acting oh God considering acting of today as wise ass lame one liners and having cool exterior , can any word marvelous British stage acting we see here. Hugo Weaving as V an anti hero not perfect just tragic and dramatic main lead was magnificent. His actions as I mentioned combined with his literature and art makes him number one hero among comic book adaptations in my list. Natalie Portman holds on very well also , not disappears but slowly taking up lead with radical character change of Evey. Stephen Rea is mesmerizing as honest police detective Eric Finch who is struggling to find V but meanwhile slowly opening up his eyes and realizing what kind of regime he is serving in. John Hurt is pleasing to watch as totalitarian dictator of Oceania no...sorry England 'ahem' Tim Piggott Smith is Creedy as malevolent chief of secret police organization , Gestapo like 'Finger', Stephen Fry as TV show comedian who lost his taste because of the state everyone forced to live in. Roger Allam and John Standing perverted members of Norsefire party , demagogue TV commenter and sick priest. Natasha Wightman as Valerie a cry from past...Whew no more words to describe their awesome performance.George Orwell's 1984 , history of Nazi Germany and current state of affairs and administration of US are clear inspirations behind this movie. Editing of James McTeigue is marvelous especially in domino scene...I will cut it short. After watching this beauty , a reminder of why cinema is an art , not just an industry of money making , V for Vendetta became one of the defining term of excellence in movie making with 'Shawshank Reeedmption' , 'Green Mile'",10,2,6,1 June 2008
The Island," A Micheal Bay Production I actually like since 'The Rock'?
","The Island might not be most original or authentic sci-fi production so far. Orci and Kurzmann ( I saw them as very bad scriptwriters ) ripped a lot from Clonus Horror. Besides as usual in every Bay movie there is over extensive use of car chases , gun fire and explosions and he filled rest of the movie with them again but first time ever this didn't disturb me much in a Bay movie. Unlike horrible Pearl Harbour or awful Tranmsformers ( worst big budget film I have ever seen in my life after Independece Day ) The Island does not deny what it is : An entertaining summer popcorn flick. Hyper fast chases , fights or explosions are accepted as part of this package deal and here Dreamworks Productions seem to limit Bay's over extensive use of special effects to some degree. A few interesting questions about cloning , its ethics and where it might lead if it was commercialized were aroused but these themes are not followed as far as it could be. There is also lots of commercial brand advertisement but it also gives the audience a more real feeling of close future.The quality of production especially camera-work and sets of futuristic clone production/containment facility is beautiful. The contrast of newly born and naive clones white garment to black uniforms of clone facility staff are well contrasted. A few moments of look at daily life to clone facility actually gives the feeling of militaristic/medical society ( that scene is at the beginning of the movie ) As for acting : It is not bad I suppose. Ewan McGregor is doing his best. His innocent behavior before 'rebirth' of his character and sponsor of his character were well written and displayed. Scarlett Johannson is very easy to look into but he takes a backseat next to McGregor I think. Steve Buscemi is wise comic relief , Djiman Houmatsu is professional mercenary who is tasked to hunt Ewan and Scarlett. And British actor Sean Bean is the villain as the doctor in the charge of clone facility which suits him well.To summarize The Island gave me the feeling of grand 80'ies or 90'ies sci-fi movies feeling (like Total Recall or Robocop ) even just for a moment. My suggestion give it a try if you like decent sci-fi and video clip like fast action",7,0,0,22 May 2009
