3:10 to Yuma," Didn't hold my interest
","Very boring film, lost interest after 20 minutes, even left it playing whilst I did the washing up, didn't improve any when I got back. Sitting in the cupboard alongside interstellar, Dunkirk and Noah (other awful and boring films) awaiting to be taken to the charity shop.",2,0,6,1 September 2019

Dunkirk," Awful
","This film is so boring with absolutely nothing happening of note for the entire 2 hours. Where were the 400,000 stranded soldiers, the huge flotilla of rescue boats and did the RAF only have 3 available Spitfires during the Dunkirk evacuation??? I was waiting for the supposed greatest dogfights in movie history....they never appeared. When this film first came out at the cinema, I read a review stating that during the dogfight scenes it was like being inside a Spitfire, I don't know what drugs the reviewer was on but I would like some. It must have been Kenneth Branagh's easiest gig ever, endless scenes of staring at the sky with a blanked out expression, it is possible he was forced to watch the equally boring Interstellar during the filming of his scenes to help him achieve his expression. Nolan is a bang average film director, I have not seen all of his efforts, but with 20 years in the industry his only film of note is Memento. I have watched thousands of films but Noah is the only film I have watched that is as bad as Dunkirk.",1,1,2,3 January 2018
