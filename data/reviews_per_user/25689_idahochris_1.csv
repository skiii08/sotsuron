Deja Vu," Excellent!!!
","Yes, this movie rocks! The only negatives are that the 'bad guy' is an alleged patriot while the 'good guy' is a federal agent, and that some cops quickly and bravely storm the ferry - cops are cowards and would have required hours to plan ala Columbine. But those propaganda issues aside, the story is outstanding and with an awesome science-fiction twist. One of the few movies where I dreaded the need to get up and use the restroom! Personally, I'll be buying this one once it's on the market; and I only buy a few DVD's per year. Without a doubt one of the best of 2006!P.S. 9/11 was an inside job!!!",10,0,1,16 January 2007
