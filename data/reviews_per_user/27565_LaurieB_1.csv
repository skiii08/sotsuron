The Legend of Bagger Vance," A big 'yes'!
","I've read several of the comments on this Board, and I feel some people are missing the point of the movie. True, Matt Damon is a superb actor, although not in this movie. But this movie isn't just about Matt Damon's character and his struggles, don't you see? If Matt Damon over-performed his role in Legend, then we would miss the point, because we'd be so focused on his despair.True, Robert Redford used yet another sport for his movie, but so what? Redford reveals a bit of himself each time he directs. This is what truly great directors do! Who cares how he accomplishes this?True, the golf balls were not 30's golf balls, and this is an unfortunate and unnecessary oversight (we assume). But if that ruins the movie for you, then AGAIN, you've missed the point.True, there's nothing really 'new' in this story, or the way in which Hollywood presents it. Perhaps that's because to some extent Hollywood knows what people are about, what people relate to, people like you and me. What's wrong with producing something known to us with a slightly different twist (i.e., casting Will Smith - what an excellent choice! - but very unexpected) that WORKS? This movie works!!! It touches me. It challenges me. It causes me to ask questions. And it somehow is able to relate itself to me.Side note: J. Michael Moncrief (as Hardy Greaves) was astounding. I sincerely hope to see this young man develop into a fine actor. He has what it takes.Final comment: If for no other reason that you can concoct, see the movie for Will Smith's and J. Michael Moncrief's performances and the cinematography. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy!!",Null,0,1,2 December 2000
