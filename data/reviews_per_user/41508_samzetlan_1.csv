Whip It," One of the best films of the year
","I went into this movie with rather high expectations. Ellen Page delivers yet another stunning performance as Bliss Cadaver, and Drew Barrymore proves herself well worthy of the title of director. Marcia Gay harden also delivers as Bliss's overbearing mother. The film is thoroughly enjoyable to watch, at the same time it is raw, emotional, and real. The cinematography during the roller derby scenes is spectacular, done in such a way that you can really feel the emotion of the sport. The movie very definitely does not disappoint. i fully expect best picture/director nods for Barrymore, as well as best a best actress nod for Ellen page, and a best supporting actress nod foe Marcia gay harden. all in all this a wonderful film, and is one of the years few must see movies. it is a wonderful story beautifully executed at the hands of Drew Barrymore. I give it a 10/10.",10,9,19,6 October 2009
