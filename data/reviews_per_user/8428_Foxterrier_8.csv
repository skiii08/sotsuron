Minority Report," dazzling effects and better story than I expected
","Man, how I wish I'd seen this in the theatre instead of renting it last night. Like a newsroom working to a deadline, 'Minority Report' moves at a fast pace. The special effects are really special. But one complaint: the advertising that's included is too loud and clear. But still, with good guys like Tom Cruise, with action like this, who needs James Bond 007? This film must have been a HUGE undertaking to make. Not that our director ever does anything small. Another fine job, Mr. Speilberg.Well worth renting, but it deserves a big-screen TV.",9,0,0,21 December 2003
The Notebook," A beautiful love story for tender hearts
","I knew I wanted to see 'The Notebook' from the moment I saw its first trailer months ago. The wait has been worth it; this is a tender, loving film. I've read complaints in other reviews that the movie is too perfect, too idealized, too sugary - too beautiful! - and that maybe the director should shake his head and get back to reality. I agree on one point; that the ending is tied-up as perfectly as a little bow.But to all you detractors out there, I say so what.  So what? Something in our hearts always longs for the best, the happiest, the most wonderful. And that place is always out there, seemingly unreachable, as far away as the moon over the water on a cloudless night.  But then too, on quiet nights, some of us have peered up at that moon, and been swept by its embrace.  This isn't a perfect quotation, but even Mr. Spock, in one of his rare 'illogical' moments, after looking up at a rainbow, once said, 'I could always explain to you a rainbow's science. But I've never before perceived its beauty.'So to all you sugar-coated dreamers out there, bless you. The moon is much closer than you think.",10,0,0,28 July 2004
Cold Mountain," wow! - powerful and involving
","Wow, what a movie! After 'Chicago' last year, Miramax has done it again. Come Oscar time, look for Cold Mountain to get plenty of nominations - and hopefully a gold statue for Rene Zellwegger.Roger Ebert has criticized Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters as being like islands, complete unto themselves. I agree; while the two are talking, you just about want to grab them and say, 'oh come on you two, start smooching already!' But if they're islands, what islands they are. 'Inman' is, on one hand, a man so gentle he can catch birds with his bare hands, but also a cunning warrior who will kill when he has to. 'Ada' is an upperclass lady who falls on horrible times, and does what she must to survive. Yet nevertheless she remains a lady, with skin that never loses its  soft pearlescent glow.Rene Zellwegger - wow, can you imagine anyone more perfect for this part! I loved 'Ruby's' outspoken words and manner. Yet Ruby and Ada hit it off like sisters. Their chemistry is delightful, and you sense they're having fun. Rene's chemistry with musician Jack White is also tangible, and a closing scene involving children may be prophetic. There is some VERY beautiful photography in this. There is also a lot of blood. As with 'Master and Commander,' the fighting is often point-blank and frightfully realistic. Several good people die. (Several bad people die too, happily, but still....ewwww!) Funny how you can see three James Bond films in a row and never blink an eye, and then you see this and just about reach for a glass of water. My only other complaint with Cold Mountain has to do with a love scene between the lead characters. I find it too graphic, and out of harmony with the rest of the film. Inman's and Ada's love is built on faith, promises and high ideals. Likewise then, their love making should have been romantic, idealized and cloaked with mystery. Frankly, it seemed like the director or somebody wanted a sex scene, so okay, they did a sex scene. Ugh. In contrast, the sex that happens earlier in the movie suits the primal nature of those characters and that situation. It seems funny to say this, but in this context, I did not want to see close-ups of Nicole Kidman's tush. Whatever. Nine out of ten is still an awfully good film. Enjoy it!",9,1,1,1 January 2004
Million Dollar Baby," An underdog movie with a surprising twist
","Million Dollar Baby (MDB) is about, among other things, a female boxer's fight to get to The Fight, and then her desire to go out swinging. In a sports culture that spits out phrases like 'second place is the first loser,' Maggie realized that no, she didn't lose: she just forgot to protect herself. Far from feeling sorry for herself, she marveled at the ride she had: traveling the world, being featured in magazines, hearing people chant her name (or at least that name that Frankie gave her). Wow. And when she faced her biggest test, and worst opponent, she stood her ground. Like a prisoner of war defying her captors, she regained her self-respect.Normally I'd conclude by saying, 'bravo Maggie.' Yet I'm hesitant. As noted, isn't it ironic that MDB came out at the same time as 'The Sea Inside,' which shares a similar conclusion? Which makes me wonder, what would Christopher Reeve think of all this? He could have died as a B-list celebrity and the answer to a trivia question. Instead he faced his situation and kept going, and thereby found a new life even brighter than his first.A beautiful film, Mr. Eastwood. Yes, among other things, it's about boxing.",9,7,9,20 February 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," gory and disappointing
","Can't believe I waited seven whole years to see this bloodfest. It is NOT what I thought it would be. I was expecting something mysterious and eerie, with a bunch of shooting thrown in. Instead I got a messy horror show suitable for teenagers at a drive-in.Sometimes the violence is too violent, and to me, what happens to the hostage in the hotel is over the line.Secondly, the notion of somebody who has accepted Jesus then turning into a vampire is just plain wrong. If you've accepted Christ, then greater who is in you than who is in the world - period! Scripturally this movie is not correct, and SOMEBODY on that film crew should have noticed and corrected that. Yes, it would have changed the film. For one thing, it might have made it more interesting.Thankfully, Quentin and company have gone on to better work. I wouldn't mark this one high on my resume.",6,1,2,1 October 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Sorry Charlie
","Screenwriter extraordinaire Charlie Kaufman is one of the most brilliant and inventive people in Hollywood, a town thick with brilliant, inventive people.  BUT, he lost me here. 'Adaptation' and 'Being John Malkovich' also played with space and time, but atleast they were heading somewhere, and I could follow them. 'ESOTSM' (you should do the Donald Trump thing and copyright that term, Charlie!) records and erases itself over and over again, so much so that it's dizzying. Beautifully done (round of applause to the production crew), but dizzying. As the survivor of a few failed starts myself, it made me wonder, did these two characters ever have anything worth getting that upset about? Or was it a lot of smoke, but not much fire?  Even after two hours, it feels like they just met.I've read complaints here about the Mark Ruffalo/Kursten Durnst/Tom Wilkinson/Elijah Wood subplots. Actually, I enjoyed the subplots! They were a sweet (I was about to say 'nice') diversion. But where was the song from the trailer? I wanted to hear the song from the trailer, not that dreary 'Cougars' remake from Beck.Charlie, I'm still in awe of you man, but I enjoyed your other movies  more. Neat lessons on love though.",Null,0,1,23 April 2004
Mystic River," Engaging, but not superlative
","* possible spoiler ahead *I wanted SO badly to see this movie after all the good things I'd read about it. Now that I have, hmm, I think it's good, quite good, but not as fantastic as I was led to believe.Others have raved about Sean Penn's performance, but honestly, to me it looked as if his 'Dead Man Walking' character got a last-minute reprieve, went back home to Boston and settled down. As others here have said, gee, Sean Penn playing a tough guy, that's a stretch. Kevin Bacon's and Tim Robbin's characters are more interesting. But geez, what's eating these two? Dave Boyle doesn't like cops, even good cops, even cops who used to be his friend. So what happened? Their unsolved dispute, which we never learn anything about, leads to tragic consequences, starting with when Davey doesn't go to the police after he'd been cut. Then Davey's wife clams up too, tragically, before  spilling her heart to the wrong people. Why? The characters never let on, and the director provides no flashbacks.There's more I could complain about, LIKE THE MUSIC THAT CUTS IN LIKE SOME TWIT WITH A BOOMBOX, or compliment, like the way the light falls on Dave's face. Also, I enjoyed Larry Fishburne pushing his partner, and the way Marcia Gay Harden's character contrasted with Laura Linney's. Linney as Sean Penn's wife reminded me of a person who feels safe by keeping a big dog in their yard that menaces the rest of the neighbourhood.But it all comes down to the last scene, when we watch the characters look across at each other as they watch the parade. Veeerrrrry interesting. I'll watch Mystic River again sometime.",8,0,0,23 January 2004
Love Actually," humorous but trivial
","Perhaps seeing this movie after a break-up wasn't the best idea afterall (please pass the tissues, Emma).While this movie is amusing and does hit some clear notes, I found so much of it to be cliched and shallow (gee, much like all those shallow cliches we hate about the Christmas season). When there is so much  possible, and yet so little is realized, it's dissappointing.Perhaps there are too many characters; I don't feel I got to know any of these people well.  If you broke this movie up into components and focussed more clearly and deeply on individual couples, you would have a much better film. Sorry to be so harsh, but as it is, I found it to be mostly a waste of first-rate talent.Amazingly, 75% of IMDB users have given this movie an eight out of ten or higher. I presume they're either all British, or were blown away by the opening sex scenes.",6,4,9,30 November 2003
