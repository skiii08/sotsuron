50 First Dates," Charming Love Story, Questionable Gags
","It's difficult to know just how rate this film because the love story with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore together is inventive and delightful, as are the characters in drew barrymore's family to a lesser extent. But everything involving adam sandler as a marine veterinarian and his side show supporting cast is unbelievable and dreadful. I'm not an adam sandler hater or anything. While I found billy madison tiresome, I very much enjoyed Happy Gilmore, but why include that nonsense in a movie that isn't nonsense?The Drew Barrymore story is endearing and brought tears to me eyes both by being touching and for being hilarious, sometimes at the same time. And I particularly liked that the film didn't feel the need to magically resolve everything, as would have happened in the old days with a second knock on the head. Instead the ending is possibly the best part of the whole film.",8,1,1,13 September 2019
Midsommar," The Least Violent Horror Movie I've Ever Seen
","That might not have been my headline had it not been for professional reviews which promise something that never comes. If you go hoping to see carnage you'll be disappointed. Similarly, if you go hoping to get scared, that is about impossible with this slow hypnotic drug-fuelled film. About the only thing it delivers on as far as questionable material is weird sex.But is it worth seeing as a drama? The acting is generally very good. There are some neat special effects that do capture the psychedelics of the mushrooms very well. The message on the other hand is no more complicated than drugs are bad because they take away your ability to make good choices and to protect yourself, and also, cults are bad. (but there are much better movies about the latter). I think the movie's strongest quality is that it is two and a half hours long with no real suspense and yet never becomes boring.",5,1,2,10 July 2019
