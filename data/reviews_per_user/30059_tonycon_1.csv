The Blair Witch Project," is this a joke or what?
","This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Who  are we kidding here?  Watching this movie makes you physically sick.  They took jiggling the camera to a new high, or low!  There was no reason at all to move the camera all over the place as often as they do in this movie. Anyone today can buy a camera with image stabilization for about $500. Another point, a movie of an hour and 15 minutes.  I heard people in the theatre say they felt ripped off, so did I.  I believe the producers hyped this movie up, along with the blind people, or epileptic people that watched it at Sundance, to such an extent, no-one was willing to just say whether or not there was anything redeeming about the flick.  There wasn't.  Its total junk.  The actors were obnoxious.  I've heard one reviewer say that was part of the point.  I don't think so.  If I want to be offended, I could turn on the TV.  There are plenty of shows out there that will totally insult your intelligence, in many different ways. I read another reviewer that was taken in by the plot line - this film was missing since 1994 and we found it.  Hey folks - you've been lied to - this is fiction.  This entire film was produced so sloppily that you are supposed to think this thing is real.  That in itself insults the audience. We have to be lied to, to be entertained?",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
