Sucker Punch," Completing the trilogy which 'Van Helsing' and 'Sky Captain' began: 'Melting Plot III - Moron Rouge'
","I got into the car on Sunday afternoon. The friend who invited me for a movie of my choice for my birthday leaned over to me; 'This one got a really bad review in the paper,' she said. 'Look, ' I replied 'all I'm asking is that I don't wanna need to think, okay?' Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it. Sitting in the theater, next to me there sat two smelly noisy guys who commented regularly and loud the scenes, eating nachos like pigs do and apparently thinking they were funny. The sad thing was that after a quarter hour or so they didn't distract or annoy me anymore watching the film. Can there be any worse verdict? After 20 minutes I thought that any movie gets the audience it deserves. The  story  no, I can't call it that way! The film starts with an orphan-story from the cliché-wing. A Britney-Spears-lookalike brat accidentally shoots her sister in an attempt to protect her from their violent father, just briefly after the mother passed away. The greedy pop uses the chance to get rid of the only other heir and dumps her in a lunatic asylum. There the girl is supposed to lobotomized (an irritating 'Cuckoo's Nest' reference) and –facing the traumatizing process- her mind disconnects and she 'flees' into an imaginary world where she gets abducted, sold to a strip-club (an allegory to the asylum) and practically enslaved with the other girls to dance and to  well to do what can be imagined. In order to escape this fictional joint -into which she actually already hid from reality- she convinces the other dancers of a break-out. To acquire the items they need (knife, fire, map and uh y'see?), she mentally flees during her dance-performances once more from that meta-level into the NEXT meta-level, a fantasy-world which is a pop cultural and historical melting-pot of various alternated historical events, steam-punk- and other computer-game-scenarios, Anime/Manga and bubblegum-philosophy. WWII (or WWI?) is one of the settings, as well as 'Lord Of The Rings', a Shinto-temple and an OuterPlanet. Goofs found: the Nazi-troopers were supposed to be zombies. Zombies don't mind a kick to the crotch and thereby can't be stopped that way AND they have no use for gas-masks! The mediocre and tension-free action sequences are interrupted by 'Baby-Doll's' back-falls to the 'reality', the strip-joint, with pseudo-tragic, cliché-drowning scenes and main-characters which show one other of the films most essential problems: it blatantly serves the reactionary and indifferent Arabophobia by introducing the club-owner 'Blue', a poorly performed but clearly racism-feeding parody of a Persian. Compared to that, Kevin J. O'Connel's performance in 'The Mummy' was balanced, fair and PC. About the way, the factual psychiatric function of Disconnecting as shown here I must say: I'm fairly skeptical. But worse than that, the premise that a traumatized woman seeks relief by mentally escaping into a dreamworld where she gets sexually abused might imply that women dream of being sexually exploited more than anything else. Regardless the fact that rape-fantasies exist and are as legitimate or not as most others, for a movie that addresses a juvenile audience this is simply irresponsible. Another 'PPPffffffrrrrzzz' goes out to the character's names like 'Baby-Doll', 'Sweet Pee', 'High-Roller' or the likes; aw come on As if the author took the promoters speeches from 'Mad Max II' for serious. Yes I'm aware that this flick WANTS to play with clichés but face it: it sounds plain idiotic. Period. So all in all this film's premise is basically the pattern-bastard of the terrific 'Pan's Labyrinth', where also a little girl in a traumatizing and hostile family-situation during the fascistic Franco-reign in Spain mentally escapes into a- world of unlimited imagination and so beyond life and death. But while Del Toro's masterpiece can even be named in one line as for instance great old European classics as Ingmar Bergmann's 'Fanny and Alexander', this kaleidoscope of trash hasn't any own identity, nor any value as a movie-reference-galore. Not to mention any substantial message to take away. As a social-worker who works with mentally ill people for 11 years now, I furthermore have to state that mental institutions in earlier times surely must have been hell. I don't have problems to see that used as a stylistic element or scenario in a movie – not even in a blockbuster. But here it only serves voyeuristic pranksters and feeds the prejudices about mentally affected people in a dangerous way. I'm also an RPG-player for over 15 years now and I must point out, that if ever one of our games-masters would have dared to show up with such a pile of sedative 'powergaming' (roughly for 'when it's too simple and obvious', such as killing a dragon with one slit – yeah. Sure.), we would have hung the bastard. It's a dance-movie  without dance-sequences, a horror-film without being creepy, an action-film with boring action, a war-movie where you tend to root for Nazis because the heroines are so annoying. I can't believe that this idiotic crap was done by the same man who did the excellent 'Dawn Of The Dead'-remake in  2007? Don't waste any money watching this rubbish, you better watch 'Barb Wire' once more (Yes! I mean it!) or best of all: call all your friends and make a complete 'Firefly'-DVD-Session over the weekend; at least that was my decision after the 'Train Job'-sequence: this series action was better, the characters too, the sexism was more enjoyable and had more style, the wit was funnier – in short: forget this waste. I would have never ever expected that someone could shoot a movie BELOW 'Van Helsing' or 'Sky Captain' – but here we are  deeper underground. Trilogy completed. In many years at least we will be able to say: 'Oh yes, there once WAS one crappy movie, even Scott Glenn couldn't rescue. What was the title? Hrmmm'",1,23,47,6 April 2011
Star Trek," Arrested Development
","I had very low expectations when the current ST-movie was announced and when I read, that it was meant to show the academy- and early years of the TOS-crew and ship.And the point-of-critic still remains valid!The makers and cast delivered a good SciFi movie. Nothing less and nothing more. That's all, folks. Throughout the entire time since the 'Next Generation', even a blind could see that the execs in the company and the creative staff behind the whole franchise didn't have neither the guts nor the creative potential to evolve, cultivate and develop the franchise forward. That they completely lacked the pioneer's spirit which all ST-series ever pretended to cherish and portray. Thereby the Closing Argument by 'Q' in 'All Good Things' was *imho* always an adequate description of the entire franchise's problem as such, surely without any of the addressed executives noticing that. What this film mainly suffers about is a problem, which already affected two ST-motion-pictures before: the first movie blatantly ripped-off the TV episode with that NOMAD-probe, for part two they revived Khan. Here the plot delivers an enemy-ship, reminding very much of that one in 'Nemesis' and just like there the villain is on a vendetta against one of Enterprise's clueless senior-officers who doesn't even know of his opponents existence. The whole thing is a 'Dejà Vu'. For the climax the two main-heroes have to fight it out over there – again. Before the whole thing blows away - again.At least they spared us too much idiotic technobabble this time. There's action, good lines, erotic and a logical predesign of the original Enterprise. Unfortunately it's predictable, that the makers will fall back to the old 'Patterns of a Dead Horse' after this brief vitalization. But too many people don't want to hear about the Prime Directive anymore, about Klingon honor, technological bullshit, captain's doubts and constructed conscience-conflicts or about ensigns in their pubertous-prime whom the script don't allow to let themselves get laid. I recall seeing the first three episodes of the last series 'Enterprise'. 'Aha... they dress it into a rock-song and think we'll buy it...' Unfortunately that song sucked (Joss Whedon did better!). And again: the same lame dialogs, onedimensional characters (looking concerned all the time doesn't automatically mean good acting) and those crappy Star-Fleet-uniforms I can't bear to watch anymore. And just as 'Enterprise', this movie also plays in the past and is the same foul compromise. So all in all this is giant leap back to where everyone has gone before. The only good point (apart of Zoe Saldana) is that they once and for the first time consequently showed, that messing with the timeline ends in irreversible mayhem that even the Enterprise can't fix anymore. But when I think that they only did this to restart an all new timeline with the old crew instead of creating new characters who are truly original and interesting I have to freak out. And you really don't wanna tell me that Janeway was an interesting character do you? That would be like selling Chancellor Angela Merkel as Michelle Obama and you don't really mean that.This STAR TREK-movie is good and highly entertaining but it also reveals the still unsolved problem of the franchise and –guys at Paramount: you better get it going to the right direction. SciFi-franchises came and went, some better, some worse. Hell, even George Lucas screwed his own one up! The best in last decade was surely the most short-running: 'Firefly'! There's none higher. Make it so.That'd be all, dismissed!",5,3,7,26 April 2010
Dawn of the Dead," 'High-velocity-zombie at close range can damage the mind'
","I can't recall whether there was any zombie-movie before this one, that accelerated the guys as seen here but it surely revived an ... well, at least 'undead genre'. To me it was a new impulse, a new element to present zombies rather like rabid-raging fast animals, than slow-mo man-eaters who mainly get dangerous in numbers; now even a single one can kill. That's new and cool. There's basically not much to say about zombie-flicks, everybody knows the deal. The only question is: 'Was it good or bad?' or to express it properly: 'Have you been thrilled and entertained clever but without brains?' The answer here is simple and not negotiable: 'Yes!' If after only 10 minutes the whole neighborhood is burning down, the world tumbles into devastation and they are playing Johnny Cash, then... yes well, then I'm supposed to love the movie.When I dragged my buddies into the theater (I had already seen it 2 days before), some asked me: 'Man, are you certain? I don't know.' I paused, smiled and just replied: 'Trust me.' In recent years I've come away of saying that, because it can end in a nosedive for the expertise-rep among one's friends. Here I was absolutely sure. It was the attacking girl which suddenly emptied all their popcorn-buckets after 6 minutes; theater-staff must have hated this film. After the end-credits they were all strung-out but happy; me too even by the second time. Another good point here were a bunch of fine and not too known actors and also a script which allows the characters to avoid the typical horror-movie-mistakes we gotten annoyed of through the years: 'Aw, Sally is gone. Let's all take flashlights, spread out in the woods and search her.' Yeah. Right. Die you idiots. And take the authors with you. Or when finally an armory is found, this idiotic pattern to take a shotgun, bash the ammo-box on the table so all shells spread away, grab three shells into the pocket (instead of directly loading) and go, as seen for an instance in 'Jurassic Park'.These guys are smarter, their ideas are good (see escape-plan), once in a gun-shop they're truly gearing up, and parts of the group finally only fail by a tragic accident (anyway: secure your working-space! I told you once, I told you twice...). The end leaves the survivors fate open; good for a sequel but not necessarily.I'm pleased to see that the DVD is available since 2006 uncut for 8,- Euros (approx. 5$). Nevertheless I'd even say that 'DOTD' is one of the few zombie-flicks which is recommendable to be seen on the big screen. Other Recommendations: '28 weeks later', 'Resident Evil I' (screw the sequels), 'Rec' (Spain 2007), 'Night Of The Living Dead' (1990), 'Evil Dead II', 'The Descent' (UK 2005, Hello Bigwolf ;-)), 'Shaun Of The Dead (UK 2004).",10,2,3,22 October 2008
Ratatouille," The Food, The Rat And The Agleam
","What can be said about this film? It's droll and sympathetic, that could be expected and ain't too remarkable. Good thing is that Disney begins to spare us their musical-attacks in their films (although they turned less annoying in recent years for example with Mulan') and gets away from too predictable sympathic' animals like deer, snobistic cats or Dalmatians (one of the most overrated dog-types at all). It was about time to root for some underdogs ... aaah, rats! The scenario of Paris is tight in atmosphere and art-details  the spirit matches.About the actual issue: if you are uncertain about your skills at the stove, this will probably encourage you. This flic... er... sorry: 'flick' shows what it's about. Not that it teaches one to cook but to get the proper attitude to try. Failure is not a shame, you get better dish by dish. The main thing is just not to take it too serious, get the funny side of it. It's a creative process and there ain't no mystery about it and no elite should tell you how a decent meal is done by the book. But mainly: this is good Disney-entertainment. Definitely one of the better works if not even among the top-ten.Vouléz-vous regardez le menu, s'il vous plait?Bella Marta (2001) Eat The Rich (1987) The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover (1989) Who is killing the great Chefs Of Europe?

No Country for Old Men," 'NEBRASKA' . . . the movie.
","From the town of Lincoln, Nebraska with a sawed off .410 on my lap through the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my path...''round the age of 14 (1986 or so) I bought a copy from Springsteen's 1982 solo-album for 5,-DM (2,50 uro or approx. 2$) in a second-hand-record-store, listened to it twice and put it away  disappointed for finding no 'Born...' party-sound but a dark and scaring side-path of the American Way. I obviously made the same mistake as the shop-owner then, underrating this album (good for me, so I could buy it for toffee). It was only the early '90s when I put it on again to find out that it's the most essential of all Springsteen-albums. Since then it's among my all-time-top-five-records, the only one carved in stone there. License, registration, I ain't got none, but I got a clear conscience about the things that I done. Mister State Trooper, please don't stop me...'Years ago a friend gave me a copy of McCarthy's 'All The Pretty Horses' which was practically glued to my hands in the following months, making CM one of my all-time-favorite authors. Unfortunately since then I have neither seen the Horses...' screen-adaption, nor read No Country...'. I was nevertheless pleased to read this movie to be made by the Coens, some of my main favorite and un-compromising filmmakers. Uncompromising as the novels of McCarthy.The film is set in 1980 but it even appears as it was shot then; Josh Brolin comes along as a younger Nick Nolte in E.P.'. The opening sequence instantly devastates all eventual hopes for a good' en-ding, as Walter Hill preferably did too around that time. Watching Javier Bardem's first appearance with his lunatic eyes and haircut reminded me of Powers Boothe in Southern Comfort'. His interpretation of Anton Chigurh to me was the most terrifying psycho-killer-performance since Benoit Poelvoorde in Cést arrivé près de chez vous' (1992) Only by the second time watching it I realized what the final consequence of his sole-inspection' in the sequence on the porch was. A brief but meaningful gesture, performed so minimalistic that it could easily be overseen, but strikes the viewer the deeper as soon as it's been noticed. Seeing a man standing over a dead dog lying by the highway in a ditch. He's looking down kinda puzzled poking that dog with a stick...'The Coens revive the early 80s with a love for the detail and the certain atmosphere which Hill and Tarantino probably envy and enjoy too. I'd therefore say that this film would fit better in a double-feature with 'Death Proof' than the clumsily 'Planet Terror'. 'Death Proof' also works with the Tarantino-typical sense for the hilarious, which the Coens cultivate that well and preferably; but 'No Country...' is no fun, only bitter. Maybe a little like 'Reservoir Dogs' (mind the torture-scene).All in all there are gorgeous actors, a great script, no annoying score and an adequate because unromantic display about what violence is about  something truly horrible (as soon as it happens to yourself) that simply should not be: '...People accept the most idiotic and unrealistic use of sex, violence and politics in any other book (...) I don't' take the reader into a world were all the girls are sexy and all the guys are dress-men, were somebody gets bashed with a rod and doesn't even have a headache next day, catches 15 bullets and wipes them away with a grin. Such a world I don't know...' Andrew Vachss,'Flood'-afterword, German edition. Right. Neither does 'No Country...'I'm glad that the Coens worked once with Tommy Lee Jones now, a perfect match. As the character closest to the viewers point to lead through the plot, Jones was the right choice, his character Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, a valuable alter ego to look through his eyes, an old, experienced but disillusioned officer who tries to outweigh his sense for duty against his hope to reach retirement unharmed. Thank you all, cast and crew.'Well I chased him through them county roads 'til a sign said Canadian Border 5 miles from here. I pulled over the side of the highway watched his taillights disappear...'",10,4,7,22 October 2008
District 9," 'The name is Plissken ... 'P R A W N' Plissken!'
","This (in 'Blairwitch'-tradition) documentary-alike motion picture tells a story, loosely reminding of the James Caan-movie 'Alien Nation' but set in the townships of Johannesburg/South Africa.The basic premise is that a couple of years ago above the city an alien flying saucer came to halt and the crew stranded here. They couldn't get the wrecked rig afloat anymore so they were deported into a slum at the edge of town, in the following the 'regular alienation' gets replaced by 'average apartheid' (insert irony here). The status of the colored southafricans in the film apparently switched with the arrival of the aliens and they also fall in in the racistic patterns which they themselves suffered through for centuries. This may be basically a realistically portrayed mechanism: for instance if you enter a train-compartment were already 3 other passengers sit for a while, you are the 'disturbing newbie' and it's something you can even feel. When the next one comes in, your status gets passed on automatically.The viewer accompanies a bureaucrat from the Joha-municipal authorities and some soldiers and police-squads into the ghetto to hand over and execute an eviction for the mockingly called 'Prawns'. The aliens already work in hide over a plot to escape and/or set their sails again, a suspicious reagent is the stuff to go. The bureaucrat –actually a harmless guy on the edge to marriage- is the poor guy to get sip of it; after that his well-sorted life turns into a kafkaesque metamorphosis, where he is forced to change sides, gets hunted by his own authorities and his own father-in-law who administrates the martial show and who anyway didn't like him too much in the first place.Actually it would have been the more revolutionary movie, if it was shot 20 years earlier but fascistic ideologies even after being removed have a long fallout among many people so maybe it's even today enough up on current events (I live in Germany so I guess I can tell).Regardless, this is an excellent and highly entertaining movie with a nice b-picture-appeal, good actors and FX and an inventive premise – no revolution but very well!Facutally it's the kind of movie John Carpenter would have been doing in the 80s. There's a strong connection to 'They Live' and the dystopic, satirical aspects of 'Escape from NY', also regarding the apparently relatively low budget and the dramatical consequence, this flick plays very much in the same league. After watching this, it's once more unclear, why Carpenter couldn't continue to fulfill the standards he himself had set 'til then. Obviously others can do excellent.",7,0,2,24 April 2010
The Da Vinci Code," Terrifying, Belief - shaking, Provoking  a dangerous movie ... if you are Ned Flanders.
","This is merely hot air, just as the novel it's based upon and it's author in general. It is not thrilling for a dime and it's performed really bad. Shame if you see the premier-league-cast wasted here. All those brilliant actors and actresses directed to perform on groundlevel. The explanation of the conspiracy hidden in the artwork is one for elementary-school-kids; okay, that's basically the novel's fault too. Those who opposed this film for religious reasons must *imho* ask themselves if their pattern of faith is really such a solid one to enrich their lifes (as it should be) or rather narrowing it down if their belief gets disturbed by such an unsubstantial discounter-heresy. Sorry, no offense given... The entire movie as a statement about confessions, religion and history is totally pointless. It's neither a valuable source to trigger a religion-based argument nor even a decent discussion about theological perspectives. The provoking' theories shown here are as such nothing new and apart of that actually shouldn't tremble no one's faith. Even IF Jesus had a woman (or even if he was a woman): so what? Relax for Christ's sake!!! If you wanna be entertained and provoked decently, watch Dogma', contrary to this it's good and smart (and funny). Vaya con Dios.",2,1,3,3 January 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Capital Goof - an open appeal  Dear Peter (and NLC) . . .'
","... thank you for your fine work on Lord...'. You've done it right and well and about time. Many people had looked forward to what you finally accomplished and you didn't disappoint us.With basically one capital exception!It is obligatory that you do The Hobbit' and show how terrific dwarvens really are! An Elf may be one hell of a long-distance-fighter, an astonishing acrobat and a superior in strategic warfair. But NEVER EVER will an Elf compete against a Dwarf in close-combat and long-range-drinking! An Elf hits the bar-room floor after one cream-liquor, a dwarf parties on for nights. That goof between Gimli and Legolas at the end of ROTK' was unacceptable particularly after Legolas has already been shown as the generally superior fighter to Gimli almost all through the trilogy! Which kinda made me mad as well...I as much as many other Dwarven-fans- insist you to do The Hobbit' and put things right about our favourite fellows (or whoever may do it in the end). As soon as you did, I'll have you your tenth star here. Thank you, don't mind.ZWERGE  DAS EINZIG WAHRE!",9,2,6,14 October 2007
V for Vendetta," Vermurkste Verfilmung Von Visionärer Vorlage'
","(='Screwed up theatrical adaption from a visionary tale')The Wachovskies continued here what the already did with their Matrix trilogy: while the first part was an interesting and highly entertaining variation of Descarte's methodic doubt (do I really exist, or is all that I see, hear and smell just the coincidental one-second-glimpse imagination of a one-cell bacteria which I truly am?'; watch Carpenter's Dark Star' for more details), they dismantled it themselves with two sheer-below-mediocre sequels with virtuous but pointless action, plot-hole-chains, horrible performances, grotesque attempts in coolness and hazardous dialogs. When I read Vendetta' first in about '91 or so, I was once more reminded that we're yet not safe from the menace which my country unleashed over the world in the 30s and 40s last century and that it can occur anytime anywhere again. The vision of the novel was as credible, authentic and fearsome as many news-broadcasts today. Which is what the author tried to accomplish as he mentioned in his foreword in the trade-paper-release I owned then. If I recall correct he mourned about cheeky (cheery?) and cheesy, soaps, comedies and music-shows' and about ... people who turn off the news...' there. He dedicated the novel to ... people who don't turn off the news...'The Vendetta'-movie-adaption is for people who turn off the news.A valuable blueprint of a possible dystopia which played in the same league as 1984', Fahrenheit 451' or Brazil' has been turned into a useless action-flick, lacking any political ambition or any attempt to subversively play with the viewers perceptions and political convictions. You leave the theater without anything to cut your teeth into or a matter to discuss controversially. And that despite the fact that the story today has enough actual events to function as an allegory for, as it had when it was written (war-propaganda, media-control, cutting of civil-rights, unbalanced and misanthropic economy etc). Hell, even Mad Max II' was probably more political than this flick.All the characters were real in the novel and became comic-characters in the film. Especially V' is now a one-dimensional clown who rushes through the dialogs like a rabid rocket and through all the fighting-scenes like the energy-cell-rabbit: It has no blood, no animae...' (Grosse Point Blank'). All those brilliantly placed quotes from literature-history that V used on any given occasion and during any terrorist action in the book turn into a what-did-he-mumble jelly here. Too fast for everybody who didn't read the novel, hell even too fast for those who did and -worst of all- too fast to celebrate the punchlines behind them. Who swaps drama for dynamic, deserves to lose both.The story is an only fast forward. The fear of a fictional but credible fascistic regime that drowned out of every page of the novel got replaced by constant sensory-nervous-system-attacks and by the annoyment and anger about todays regular one-cut-per-second-editing-for-the-Mtv-generation; If it's too slow, people can't follow.' God, I miss Alfred Hitchcock...I paid much attention on the Konzentrationslager-background of V but it didn't struck me at all as it did while reading it. Au contraire: Look what a cool fighter V has become there. Gee, Concentration-Camps can't be that bad...' Folks, this is dangerous!It's plain obvious that it was the wrong decision to let some non-UK-filmmakers do the project; some British would have better done this. No anti-americanism here, not at all, but the priorities would have probably been set elsewhere then and for sure on the more essential aspects than just on the visual and martial-arts. All the important side-stories were cut too. They should fold the Watchmen'-project right now.Turn on, Turn on, Turn on - THE NEWS!!!'
