Hereditary," Dont believe the negativity here
",The best horror in years. Doesnt need to rely on jump scares. This movie is everything the witch wasn't. Relying on mood and performances(Toni and Alex were beyond amazing). I havent been left emotionally shaken by a movie like this before. Do not watch this film alone.,10,4,9,24 August 2018
Aquaman," As silly as it is fun
","Let's be clear, Aquaman is a pretty dumb movie. But boy if it doesnt put a smile on your face then you probably shouldnt be going to a CGI laden superhero film. James Wan embraces the lunacy of the subject matter and delivers. The dialogue is truly what brings down the movie but Jason Mamoa doesnt let the poor script stop him from oozing charisma. While his chemtestry with costar Amber Heard doesnt fire on all cylinders it is still fun to watch everytime they share the screen together. For all the CGI, and there is a ton of it, the only time it's hard to watch is during the final battle. Other than that we get some of the best the industry has to offer. Most of the cast is working below their talents to be sure but they seem to be having fun and deliver convincing performances.",8,3,3,22 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Perfect ending
","The Russo brothers have handled their films impeccably and seemingly had an impossible task on their hands. That is do justice to every single superhero in the shared universe. I gave this film 9 stars even though the first two acts seemed uneven and predictable. As Thanos said, it was 'inevitable' that they should all face off again. Because of this it was hard to get terribly invested when you know they may lose some key members along the way but in the end they will succeed in getting another shot and Thanos and his army. To be fair this could be said about most every superhero movie ever.This brings me to the final act and it is perfect. One of the absolute best, if not the best, battle scene of all time. CGI and character balance was flawless. Cap and Ironman leave their roles with the integrity they entered them with. I cant say enough good things about how everything was wrapped up.",9,0,1,28 April 2019
The Witch," Suspenseful film. I'm still waiting for something interesting to happen.
",Were the witch sold as a period drama with creepy elements I might have looked more kindly upon it. But since it was sold as 'the most terrifying film of the year' all I found was disappointment. The film throws a scary scene featuring 'The Witch' at us in the first ten minutes but after that it builds(if you can call it that) unsuccessfully for over an hour. the first thirty minutes the audience accepts as necessary to build suspense and flesh out the characters but one boring scene after the next has the people bored and unamused. Now keep in mind I'm not the kind of person who requires instant gratification in film. The babadook is my favourite horror film in years. The Witch is not that film. Several times we expect something scary to finally happen only to be greeted by a rabbit. This film felt like it was edited in the 70s and is choppy at best. It also ends more times than LOTR with each fade to black making us hope that it's finally over. This film is well acted but that's about it. It's hilariously unscary.,2,11,28,21 February 2016
