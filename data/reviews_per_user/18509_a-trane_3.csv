Requiem for a Dream," Outstanding
","As a movie aficionado I naturally watch loads of movies. But I hardly witnessed anything as thrilling and shocking as this milestone of modern cinema for years. It even surpasses the brilliant 'Festen' by Thomas Vinterberg in terms of authenticity and slapping in the audiences face. I can't recall a flick that brought together brilliant acting, intense narration, a spine-chilling score and not least superb photography alike.The movie deals with the well known subject of (drug) addiction and the possible, almost certain results. Nothing special so far. But there are so many sub-plots that make the difference. And foremost the acting is simply breathtaking. Ellen Burstyn - well in mind for her role as a desperate mother in 'The Exorcist' - gives one of the best performances I've ever seen, with the other actors just close behind. And as if that wouldn't be more one can expect these days, the visual translation of the subject is excellent - never before special effects seemed to make so much sense. Darren Aronofsky has created a shockingly real view on contemporary society. And it hurts.Be prepared for one of the most intense films ever made. Not for the faint hearted.Rating: 9/10",9,0,1,13 January 2002
The Others," Dejavu in many ways
","Not very original and in terms of the acting little convincing, yet stylish flick with a twisted finish that reminded me (and some of the other reviewers here) of 'The Sixth Sense'. Rumors spread that Amenabár wrote the script before 'The Sixth Sense' came out, but even if that would turn out to be true, it wouldn't make 'The Others' a more valuable film.
Amenabár evolves a very conventional haunted house plot, with Nicole Kidman in the centre of attention, as she gives an above average but not compelling performance as a strict and at the same time desperate mother, concerned about her two kids. The youngsters are over-sensitive to light of all sources as a result of a rare disease. Since they can't be exposed to daylight, all windows of the inhabited mansion are permanently darkened. Three domestic servants move in and strange things start to occur, like the floor board creaks without anybody walking and the kids begin to hear voices and so on.The film is too much about Nicole Kidman's character and the kids aren't believable for most of the time, showing once again the difficulty of finding talented low-aged actors. All in all 'The Others' looks somehow dated and creates tension just in a few good moments. The photography is quite good though.Rating: 5-6/10",6,0,0,20 January 2002
Mulholland Drive," Not compelling but still worth watching...
","Watching 'Mulholland Drive' somehow brought up memories about Lynch´s earlier effort 'Lost Highway', basically in terms of the whole architecture of the film. An interesting story, memorable characters and a certain mood are developed slightly for quite a bit of the running time. All in a sudden the story breaks up and a different, if you like second story builds up. The storys are in a strange way connected, at least because the main characters, most of the other personnel and some symbolic items are featured in both of them, although they´re juxtaposed differently.So what is 'Mulholland Drive' all about? Mainly it´s the story of two women from whom one suffers amnesia as a result of a car accident. They meet, somehow fall in love and while many strange things happen, everything seems to be connected to a certain film production in Hollywood. Any further explanation would be a complete waste of time.To me 'Mulholland Drive' is a quite enjoyable movie, with dark humor at times, but it isn´t as compelling and sinister as most of the other weird fantasies of David Lynch, especially the similar constructed 'Lost Highway'. Anybody willing to experience this unique director at the peak of his art should watch the brilliant 'Blue Velvet' instead.Rating: 6/10",Null,0,1,6 January 2002
