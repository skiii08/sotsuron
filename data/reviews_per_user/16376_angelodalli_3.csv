The Blair Witch Project," An utter waste of time and money.
","The Blair Witch Project is an amateurish film, of the style produced by film students during their practical courses. The camera work is horrible, and the story is confused and more or less unplanned. There is absolutely no horror in it until for maybe the last minute. Apart from that last minute, which I admit is brilliant, the film is one big boring sequence of video clips.I am normally quite open to experimental film styles, and love to watch strange films. But although this film is something that I would recommend to horror film enthusiasts to watch late at night at home on video, this film is an utter rip off - it should have never been marketed as a commercial cinematic film. One of the worst hoaxes I have ever seen!",1,2,3,14 November 1999
The Matrix Revolutions," Best ending of all films in the trilogy
","Warning: Spoilers in this comment!!!I am surprised at how very few people have realised the underlying connection between the Oracle, the Architect, Neo and the other non-human programs existing in the Matrix.The role of Agent Smith vs. Neo is clear -- he is his opposite.Neo's role however may have been misunderstood by many - he is a *controlling element* of the Matrix itself: If you were a machine and wanted to improve the experience of the Matrix to other people, how would be the best way to go about it? Recruit a human to help you out! i.e. Neo!The Oracle simply tries to push events the way the Matrix's machine creators want them - by giving ambiguous hints that increase the chances of people making the decisions the machine wants.At the end, when Agent Smith is destroyed - it is the machine who makes the winning/losing decision - based on Neo's show of persistence. He shows that as long as humans are alive, they will persist until the very end. So, Agent Smith is kept in check by Neo - but the machine destroys him at the end. It is a signal that it accepts the peace offer.The other non-human programs also have abilities to change the Matrix to improve it as they see fit. The little girl's comments try to give this away: she says she did the sunrise and nice sky for Neo - because she knows that Neo is now part of the Matrix itself! And so are the six previous Neo persons who became part of the Matrix before him.The Architect tries to explain this in Revelations, but again, most people missed out on this. Maybe the dialogue was not clear or direct enough to most people, but there is a very sound logic behind the plot.The Matrix trilogy as it is till now has ended with a nice ending: an equilibrium between the machines and free living humans. Whoever wants to be released from the Matrix, can do so freely. I guess people would come and go to/from it voluntarily since there is the liberty to do so.",8,0,0,7 November 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Excellent idea -- not for everyone's taste
","'Kill Bill' provides a variety of Kung Fu like sequences in a simple but clear plot, with strong influence from Chinese and Japanese films. Uma Thurman, in her yellow jumpsuit reminiscent of Bruce Lee, is absolutely fantastic in portraying the sweet motherly figure - with a tough tough edge! Don't mess with this girl!I really liked the way that the graphically violent scenes are almost reduced to a comical, hilarious joke - some of the scenes are serious, but some are downright funny. The brief switch to manga style sequences in the film is particularly effective at portraying the anger and lust for revenge felt by most protagonists in the film.The mellow background music and peaceful atmosphere surrounding the gory battle scenes - which are very unlike the over-mystified crap being shown in some recent movies - is quite reminiscent of the way 'Clockwork Orange' had used music to intensify the violence shown onscreen.The major thing I strongly did *not* like in this film was the fact that it was split into two parts. I believe that with some proper editing, the film could have been released as a long feature in one part. I believe that the abrupt cut in the middle of the story is quite frustrating to viewers and leaves you with the feeling that the whole business of film sequels is being carried a bit too far lately. Films should not be like TV serials!!",7,0,0,10 October 2003
