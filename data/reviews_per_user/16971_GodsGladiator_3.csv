Sucker Punch," Good, but Lacked Punch
","First of all, let me state that I'm a big admirer of Zack Snyder's ability to astonish the visual senses and, for lack of a better term, his ability to make the audience feel extremely 'badass.' However characteristic of his style, the film also unfortunately fell into his footsteps of tradition in terms of story and character: the plot was extremely thin, and the characters felt two dimensional. At numerous points throughout the film, I found myself extremely engaged in fantastic action sequences rich with steampunk imagery and almost anime-characteristic, intricately choreographed combat; yet, at the same time my own nondiegetic nagging voice questioned the intent behind the sequences. For example, the main character Baby Doll (Emily Browning) exists on three planes of existence (and to avoid spoilers, I will not further divulge information about them).One of the three, however spectacular it appears to be, is completely disconnected from the plot or story, so much so that when watching these particular sequences, the viewer is almost asked to completely disassociate from the logical narrative world and plunge into a world of chaos and fantasy. While very engaging due to their nature as quasi-comic book action scenes characteristic of Zack Snyder's style, they serve little purpose in perpetuating the narrative or developing ulterior themes. They just look cool. This is unfortunate and very detrimental to the film, as the common film-goer may find this fantastic, but those looking for a deeper, more heartfelt message may find the film a bit dry. Additionally, this harmed numerous scenes with character interaction, especially with certain characters' states of finality (where the viewer knows what emotion should be felt, but the connection to the characters just isn't there to contribute to that emotion) in the closing images of the film. Knowing Snyder and his potential, though, the revelation of this fact was disappointing, albeit a bit expected; however, it's standard quality did not come as a complete sucker punch to me.",6,1,6,26 March 2011
Cars," Brilliance
","I'm beginning to thing that Pixar doesn't know that such words as 'bad' or 'mediocre' exist... The characters were excellent, the humor, both adult and child was excellent, the plot was beautiful... Cinematography was beautiful. The acting was spot-on. The music and the animations themselves were incredible. It's a bummer that I'm restricted to 1,000 words...The characters of cars are incredibly well done. Each car, each voice, each store - everything felt like it had a history behind it, unlike many of Disney's current films, which generally seem to be drenched in superficiality and their characters, albeit traditional, are too stereotypical. Pixar has in every one of their films created memorable characters such as Mater, McQueen, and Sally; yet in each film the characters remain brilliantly unique and captivating. You can't forget how Mater is like a 'Ta-mater, 'cept without the 'Ta'', or how McQueen is changed by the town, and the Cars in the town are changed by McQueen. The characters are so excellently entwined in the storyline that the plot IS the characters and their relationships. The small elements of the film brought it to life even more, such as the flies being cars, or the characters replacing common human lingo with 'car lingo', or the tire marbles from the car tires. I thought the movie was excellent - one of the best that Pixar's done, thanks to the unforgettable characters and the extremely beautiful and lifelike animations. Even though Pixar's movies can't really be fairly compared to one another because they are each so different, I call cars their best film yet! Undoubtedly, if I could name a 'Film of the Year', Cars would be that film.",10,0,1,28 December 2006
Happy Feet," Well done!
","Excellent and well done. This movie has humor in it ranging from crude, adult humor to entertaining slapstick and kids humor, making the film very funny at times and melancholy at others. Hard to accomplish, but the Warner Brothers found a way to pull all of it together in 'Happy Feet'. The comic relief being neither to extraneous nor too single-audience oriented was very well scripted, and the talents of robin Williams shine once again.The plot throughout the movie seemed to be rather unclear until one specific scene came along, though - twenty minutes or so into the movie. After the plot was introduced, it seemed to be no more than an irrelevant curiosity of a small number of the characters, ergo the plot was rather equivocal during much of the film and until the main character blatantly states his standing on the seemingly unimportant fact, turning the audience's attention in the general direction of the film. As the film turns to a conclusion, the last few scenes are rather ridiculous and unnecessary, and it seems as if the director and scriptwriters forgot to remember to construct and script a sufficient and / or montage resolution.The ideas, characters, and music were superbly developed, thought out, and intertwined throughout the entire movie, and the musical-like scenes were very well done and perfectly animated as well. A very original and entertaining movie, just work out a few scenes and 'unrealistic' patches and it'd be a nine out of ten; work a few scenes in and work out a few scenes and it'd be a ten out of ten.",6,5,13,17 November 2006
