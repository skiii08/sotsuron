Sucker Punch," For the fans of previous Zack Synder films.
","2007 he brought us '300' and in 2009 he brought us the comic book adaptation 'Watchmen'. Now we are blessed with 'Sucker Punch'. Im not going to explain the movie in this review, but I am going to point out the good and the bad points.PROS: I love the action sequences. Sure, they're a bit clich√©, but who gives a flying f**k. I love the way Synder makes his movies. The story is deep and great. and the graphics? This is Blu-ray material, ladies and gentlemen.CONS: the PG-13 rating. It holds this movie back a lot. It could have been better if they had released it as an R rated movie. (this is the only reason keeping me from giving this movie a 9)If you enjoyed 300 And Watchmen, You'll love this, If not, go watch Battle: Los Angeles.",8,21,41,28 June 2011
