The Avengers," Avengers: Marvel's on top, so far.
","Marvel's Avengers...A well paced movie that delivers from the beginning. It's hard to review this awesome movie without give some spoilers, but I'll try to do my best, promise.I tried to keep my expectations low about this movie before it came out, because watching this all- star cast playing the 'superheroes' is exciting itself. you have to add Samuel L Jackson as 'Nick Fury' and a very good CGI work pumped up by a big amount of money. But I have seen a lot of movies with great casts and high budgets going down (cough *batman and robin* cough), so I decided to stay calm and not to get hyped.So the movie started with a very decent action scene that sets up the whole plot fast and effectively. Even when I tried to forget what this was about, I couldn't help myself and I was sold after the ten first minutes. Why? Because you can't help it!! you get to go in deep with every main character's motivations. The action never stops growing and the tension last until the very last minute. It's impossible not to fall in love with movies like this! Every relationship between the superheroes are well established and when the moment comes, it shows.What are they avenging?: Spoiler! It's Hulk well done in this movie? Hell Yeah!! (finally) It's Tony Stark above the rest of Avengers?: Nope, he's part of an awesome team!Is this movie worth to see on cinemas? oh, please, oh, please, don't miss it. Watch it at least once. 9/10 At the same level of 'the dark Knight'CONS: <ul><li>Didn't like the 3D. - Black Widow should have kept her long hair. </li></ul>For the rest, no complains.",9,2,7,28 April 2012
Black Swan," Lovely black swan!
","One word comes to my mind when I try to define this movie. The very same word she (natalie Portman) uses in the film: 'Perfect' This hyper-sexual film has a very dark plot with very impressive scenes and a very good casting. However, there's one reason for me to consider it as 'unforgetable' and is the fact that it makes you hate the poor, sweet and harmless white swan and makes you fall in love with the black swan instead. There is where the real poetry of the film is present. Is not the fact that she will become the black swan (everybody knows that from the beginning!).The scene of the black swan transformation is astonishing. An instant classic for me.Great performance of the cast. This movie is a 'don't miss' at all.8/10 Because of the obvious plot. The rest is very impressive.",8,2,6,21 December 2010
Sucker Punch," Nice Soundtrack!
","Yep! That's almost all what I have to say about 'sucker punch'. A film that ought to be a masterpiece and ended merely as a good action flick. Very simple plot about a girl that imagines a whole world from his living disgrace. The only thing I wonder is how can you make a PG - 13 movie from such a hyper sexual script. Only Snyder can do that.I was expecting way too much. I only got sucker punched...I went to see this movie, just to figure out how good or bad Superman 'Man of steel' can be. Now I don't know. Zack Snyder is very good adapting comics to the big screen, but yesterday, while watching 'sucker punch', I realized that '300' and 'watchmen' were previously written by someone else. maybe he's a good director, but not a good writer.as I said before: The sound track was awesome! 4 / 10.",4,3,9,8 April 2011
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Vampire Hunter? Yes! Abraham Lincoln?
","It's always good to watch a movie where vampires are evil creatures who want to rule the world and drink blood from every innocent human that goes around and not stupid eternal teenagers looking for an emotionless girl to fall in love.As I have mentioned ALL the good things of the movie, let's continue with the bad stuff: Abraham Lincoln? Seriously? carrying a shotgun - Axe, killing people and burying them in the night? No brothers and sisters? No sons and daughters (yes, plural!). a little toy sword made of silver that can be shot as a bullet? A human being jumping from horse to horse once and again? A person that can endure being hit with a horse? The only way I could watch the whole movie was seeing all this mess as an action movie having NOTHING to do with the greatest American president yet (and I'm not even American!). If you give me a different name for the main character, I'm sold. There's no need to put a man Like Lincoln, who made a name by himself, in a crazy adventure that looks like a bad joke.last thing: What happened to Mary Elizabeth Winstead? I think she needs to change her manager...3/10 Good effects. Wait for the red box.",3,2,7,28 June 2012
Inglourious Basterds," How glorious basterd!
","Wow! I do believe that heroes are as big as their enemies can be and in this film I found out one of the best 'Bad guys' of Hollywood: Christoph Waltz was astonishing from the beginning!! showing this lack of humanity or compassion. I found him remarkable even when his role demanded to become a complete idiot the last minutes of the film.Brad Pitt? very good in this one, he gave some funny moments to the movie, but as I said, Waltz beats him every minute. I liked most the performance of MÃ©lanie Laurent as the good girl searching for revenge, it was credible and gave meaning to the film.These were - in my opinion- the highlights on this movie. excellent production and costumes; weird story, but a very good direction that honors Tarantino's works.Definitely a must see.",8,0,4,19 February 2010
The Expendables," They needed 5 guys to do a single man's job...
","I remember when I was a kid, I always was wondering: 'How an action movie could be if they put together Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis?' A total blast, for sure!! Well, after 25 years I saw the light... A trailer of 'the expendables' and I said: 'Finally,now I can die in peace.' I have to remark, that previously (some weeks ago), I had suffer the big disappointment of 'the A team' movie.And there I was, in front of the big screen. The movie started with a very nice action scene. Stalllone and his team looked undefeatable. Then, it happened: I catched myself thinking: 'this looks like 'commando', it's the very same plot' I tried to keep away that off my mind, but when the movie ended, I couldn't help it: I saw a group of buddies, trying to save a girl kidnapped by a southamerican dictator and his whole army, inside a castle (why directors believe ALL southamerican dictators DO live in a castle?). They had the attitude, the airplane, the skills, the muscles, the foes and even the bad lines of... John Matrix!! 25 years ago, John Matrix did the same. I wonder why they needed 5 guys to do the same thing now. Yes: they have nice motorcycles, tattoos, money and some of them have hot girlfriends...But it still was the same thing.I give 6/10, because I thank they made the effort. and because it's entertaining... as 'Commando' was 25 years before.",6,1,5,4 October 2010
2012," No story, just bunch of FX scenes put together...
","Finally I have seen a movie that even John Cusack Couldn't save. this comment does not contain spoilers just 'cause there is not story or a plot line at all.. it is just a lot of special effects and awesome scenes lost in a mixture of so called 'unchained events'. Not worth to watch, even if it was on 3D. I just felt that I lost my time and -What hurts the most- my money.Not even close to the 'Big disaster movie I was expecting' no explanations given. You almost can see how Cusack really tries hard to keep it real and interesting, but in the end,he looks tired and tiresome expressing like: 'I did my best, you know? but those guys just wanted to make some money'. well they did it. But not in a good way.",1,7,10,5 December 2009
Clash of the Titans," 'Crash of the Titans'
","Well... I'm very disappointed about this movie. It's not the 2D to 3D 'digital enhancement'. It's not the bad acting of Sam Worthington. It's not the lack of a decent story. I think it's the voice inside my head telling me that the original version was better than this. Of course the Fx were impressive (Kraken was very good made). But that's all. you need more than very good special effects to make a movie (As we all know it already since '2012'), but this was a Re-make!! It was supposed to be awesome, not this bunch of 'Not well defined characters'.I'll give it a 3 out of 10, just because it has the effects that the original movie needed to be perfect.don't expect too much about this movie.Sorry, I just didn't like it.",3,2,5,10 April 2010
The Dark Knight," A really good movie doesn't need help
","Let's be clear: I have seen this movie 8 times -6 on the big screen- and it seems excellent to me. The plot, the characters, the director, the photography, the music... Everything is just great. The best superhero movie ever, but this is because it implies the duality and the internal figths of common human beings. that's what this movie has in common with the godfather saga and Shawshank redemption: two good movies that don't need help to be on top of the rating. That's why I cannot believe that some people easily can put just one star on this movie. they must be shawshank's fans. Let's be honest: we have, by far, one of the best movies ever here. It doesn't deserve just one star, does it?Finally, thanks Nolan, Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, Oldman, Freeman, Caine and Gyllenhaal for everything!! you were great!",9,0,5,16 July 2009
Avatar," Awesome!
","I went to see this movie without high expectations. I was thinking about a 'state of the art in special effects' and no story, but I was gladly surprised by an entire new world created by James Cameron, with humanoids beings able to interact with nature and a complex language and social structure. I'm a real fan of 'Terminator I and II' and 'Aliens' and I enjoyed a lot the gags he incorporated from the older movies (like Sigourney Weaver saying: 'What's missing on this scene?').Even when the plot was like a futurist 'Dancing with wolves' line, Cameron gave this special touch he has and turned the whole movie into a real fantasy. I never have seen such a movie, like this one! 'avatar' movie is a new hit added to the long list James Cameron Has on his own. Congratulations!",8,0,3,25 December 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," More than meets the eye... Less than needs the fan
","OK. Let's do this:For me, this movie is a 6/10, but there's one reason why I'm voting it as a 5/10: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. And I think is very important to begin with her, because every time she appears on the screen, you will feel that somehow 'she's not fitting there'. Please don't get me wrong: She's beautiful, she's very good looking, but she can't act! Now, if you ask me How much a character can make a movie to loose its rhythm, after watching her, I could say its a lot (and I'm not a Megan fox's fan).Lets say that after 'revenge of the fallen' This franchise deserved an unforgettable last chapter. As an action movie it was good at its best: The Bay's old formula worked pretty well this time(slow motion + explosions + hot chick's cleavage/skirt close ups) and the topping was the excellent 3D work, but the lack of a good plot turned this film into an 'average film' when everybody was expecting a total blast.I let you here some numbers, so you can get an idea of how this movie goes:<ul><li>Successful jokes: 2 - Unsuccesful jokes: 42 - Rosie's close ups: 100 - Rosie's different facial expressions: 0 - New characters: 214 (including the new decepticons) - Unexplained new characters: 210 (including the new decepticons) - Sub - plots: At least 8 - Finished sub - plots: 5 - Slow Motion scenes: 24 - Events defying physics : 13 (including that flying guy who explodes when he crashes into a building)</li></ul>As you can see, I can't go beyond this point without revealing too much.So, if you want to go and watch an entertaining movie, that is a visual feast but with no plot, this is your movie. It is very enjoyable, but not what I expected.6/10 (-1) = 5/10",5,2,6,29 June 2011
