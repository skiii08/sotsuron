Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of the best films I have ever seen
","In terms of pure unadulterated cringe-worthiness, this film just about outshines them all. It is brilliant, horrific, hilarious, sad, outrageous, revealing, and incredibly clever. It shows up people's narrow-mindedness, their racism, their inability to accept or understand different cultures. It makes me scared for the future of the world, and delighted that someone actually sees most people for what they really are - blinkered and uneducated.Go and rent it, and enjoy. It will make you want to be a better person, make you laugh until you almost cry, and undoubtedly make you hide behind a cushion at times.Sacha Baron-Cohen is a genius. A definite 10 out of 10.",10,143,196,1 November 2007
Alien," After this, nothing was ever the same
","I wish it was possible to give Alien more than a score of 10. It really is utterly perfect, and it's impossible to imagine an alien movie after this that wasn't in some way influenced by it. A true benchmark movie, with acting/cinematography and music second to none. I've watched it 100 times and will never tire of it. 40 years old this year! Blimey!! What an absolute triumph. One of the best movies of all time and definitely in my top 10.",10,1,2,10 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Totally get why people didn't like it but... wow
","Going to stick my neck out and say OUaTiH is truly astonishing. It's a Marmite movie - you'll either love it or hate it, but boy, did I love it. It's a masterclass in movie making/acting and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. A gem.",10,14,18,6 December 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A great big turn off
","I went to see this film as I am a big Johnny Depp fan, but I was completely turned off by the whole thing. The pace was so slow I was almost asleep, and I kept waiting for the magical moments to happen. Alas, they never did. The opening went on for ever and a day - remember the wonderful entrance Gene Wilder makes in the original? Well, Willy Wonka's entrance here, with the stupid 'song' of the puppets, was just dire. He actually looked embarrassed to be there. The parents of the 'lucky winners' were one-dimensional to say the least, and although the child actors were OK they were nothing to write home about. My 11 year old son went with me to see this film, and as we came out of the theatre I was wondering what he would have to say about it (and whether I would have to pretend that I had liked it!) but the first thing he said was, 'Well, that's not the best film I've ever see. Bit of a disappointment really.' I just felt that the director had wasted so many opportunities, not to try to emulate the first film, but to bring some fresh magic to the wonderful story. Instead, all we got was long-drawn out scenes, bad dialogue and a faintly embarrassed Johnny Depp.",1,53,99,19 September 2005
The King," Just not sure
","Ok, as far as Netflix fare goes this is probably among the best it has to offer, although that's not saying too much. The King was ok - it looked good, and the acting was reasonable. However I found the music to be incredibly intrusive as it barely stopped droning for the entire movie. Why? Why do that? We don't need to be told what mood to feel all the time. Most of us are quite capable of working that out for ourselves!I found the whole thing a little overblown, and even forced. When compared to something like Wolf Hall for instance this is rather pale fare.So 6 points out of 10 for Joel Edgerton for his accent, which was great, and for the overall look of the film, but that's all. Sorry The King.",6,1,4,4 November 2019
Mystic River," Clint Eastwood - my least favourite director
","Watching this a second time I was reminded again how much I dislike Ol' Clint's directing style. I just cannot get on board with him at all, and Mystic River is no exception. Kevin Bacon is the only stand-out performance for me. Everyone else hams it up big time, and the story is weak and pointless. 6/10 only because of Kevin B. Highly overrated movie otherwise.",6,4,5,19 February 2019
Marriage Story," A punch in the gut
","I'm lost for words. Marriage Story has left me almost speechless. What an outstanding movie. There was not a single moment that I didn't love, and I did not want it to end. I hope it wins everything going, but especially Adam Driver. Wow. I cannot heap enough praise on this film - HUGE applause to absolutely everyone involved.",10,6,8,29 December 2019
