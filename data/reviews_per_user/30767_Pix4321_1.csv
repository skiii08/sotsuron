United 93," Amazing movie but..........
","This was an amazing movie from start to finish. it really touched my heart, but it is a movie i wish to never see again as good as it was i would hope i never have to sit through so much sadness ever again. To know that those actual events happened is crushing. The very fact that a good portion of the money earned from this money is actually going to the memorial efforts is reason enough to go out and see this movie. If there is one movie that you go out and see this year, United 93 is the one. It is more then just a movie it is almost a piece of history frozen in time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has any doubts that everyone of those people aboard flight 93 were indeed heroes.",10,2,6,10 May 2006
