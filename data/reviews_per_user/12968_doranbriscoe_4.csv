Captain Phillips," More Shallow Than Expected
","Let me preface this by saying that I am normally a fan of biopics, and even more a fan of Tom Hanks, so this movie was intriguing, especially because of the generally good reviews it has gotten. However, I found this film to be rather flat, to be put quite simply. The dialogue at times felt mechanical, and as the story went on I realized that I didn't feel any substantial connection to the characters, as little effort is given to build any- including Captain Phillips, whose backstory was presented altogether poorly. Instead, the film jumped fairly quickly into the action, which would be fine, except that with the length of the movie, it drags on towards the end without giving the viewer any real reason to keep his or her interest. At the conclusion, I felt, meh. Not much of anything, just that it was over. As I usually do, afterwards I read into the backstory of the film, to find some reasoning as to explain why I thought it could have been better developed. I learned that not only is the true Captain Phillips misrepresented in the movie as a hero, but that there is a much more interesting dynamic when it comes to the backstory of the Somalian pirates. In the movie we are only given a few confusing scenes (without subtitles, so fairly vague) where the pirates leave their village to be picked for the expedition, and throughout the story they are not really made out to be endearing, nor unlikable either. The viewer is left unsure what to think about their fate.In real life, the plight of Somalians is that of foreign ships illegally taking advantage of their shipping lanes and fish, which dissipated their fish populations. As they have relied on fishing as nearly their only means for living, this led many to self-regulate the waters as their seemingly only other option, escalating into piracy. Whether this is morally justifiable or not, I can't say, but I dislike that this film fed the audience a definitive answer without even providing the full context. If the movie had developed this aspect more fully, I feel that it would have made for a much more compelling tale, as it would have done better to connect the audience to the Somalians rather than acting as just another Hollywood film with the undertone that American lives are more important than all others. I would also have preferred a better developed Captain Phillips character. Obviously after reading articles, I would have liked to have him portrayed truer to his questionable real-life self, but it's the media business so I can settle for their idealized version; but only if they develop a reason to like him, which I still wasn't given. I just felt myself waiting for the movie to give me a reason to cheer for him, but like the entire role of characters, was given an altogether two dimensional character instead. The story in its full context is incredibly interesting, but the movie decided to tell the basic press clippings version, and for that I am left disappointed.",5,1,2,23 November 2016
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Beyond the Suspension of Disbelief
","The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is perhaps a decent movie for general audiences with limited exposure to films more substantial than Hollywood's common and lighthearted blockbusters, but I feel it does not have the true depth it is sometimes credited as having. Now, I don't mean to demean anyone who had a powerful experience in viewing this film- it's good for people to have their minds stirred to the tragedies of the past who may or may not otherwise, and the movie has proved effective in bringing its viewers to tears, no doubt, but only through juvenile methods of storytelling. The issue lies in its framework. It attempts to confront a delicately heavy subject, the Holocaust (which is automatically something that should tug at one's heartstrings for obvious reasons). But it doesn't do it in an authentic manner: it stretches the historical events around its plot, instead of the other way around as it should. I needn't go into the details as one can find them with a quick internet search, but the historical inaccuracies are downright blatant- yet integral to the plot. I understand the concept of 'the suspension of disbelief' when approaching fiction (and even historical fiction), but the story has to work by the rules that it sets forth. A comparison I will give is Life is Beautiful, another Holocaust film that stretched the truth: however, the world that movie had established was one of hi-jinks and coincidence, and therefore the minor historical liberties it takes are forgivable because the viewer ought not take it at face value. In The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, though, the story is presented as true-to-life, and therefore has a responsibility to neither mislead its viewership nor insult their intelligence, which is exactly what it does. Because of this, it doesn't come across as authentic- not only by its historical falsities, but also in its far-fetched unfoldings of its plot, and in the flat traits and utter obliviousness of main characters. Many an audience can look past these shortcomings, it seems, but I found it to be insufferably jarring to the viewer experience, and the ending felt contrived and shallow as a result.",3,4,8,28 November 2017
Rocky," 'All I wanna do is go the distance'
","I find Rocky to be one of my very favorite films because of how complete it is, from the writing of the screenplay to the acting to the soundtrack to how the whole thing comes together so effectively with such originality. It's the quintessential underdog story of life and love and fighting for one's dreams, a work of art straight from the heart of Sylvester Stallone. I think what I find so endearing about Rocky is how much I can connect to it individually. Rocky is the every-man that so many of us can relate to, and I haven't found a film that so perfectly encapsulates the struggles of life that I also find myself facing. I think that way more than being a boxing film, Rocky is a fighting film- it's the fight that we all have to face to varying degrees.Rocky comes from the bottom. Notwithstanding his heart and honesty, he wasn't blessed with the same talents and abilities that others may have; he's clumsy in speech and perhaps not the brightest of the lot. Like Adrian, he's surrounded by people (ahem, Mickey) who tell him he's not good enough, to 'stay down.' And like I feel in many circumstances, he feels inadequate. But he approaches those struggles head on. Whatever blows he's dealt, he comes back with persistence that he can overcome those obstacles. His simple hope is to become more than just an average bum; he uses his frustration to fuel himself towards rising above the mediocre misery that plagues so many.My favorite scene is when he lies down in bed the night before the big fight and confides in Adrian how he doesn't really feel the need to win, he just wants 'to go the distance.' Likewise, I don't need to be the best, but if I can just match up against the struggles I face, stand toe to toe with them, refuse to let them knock me out- endureÂ… Well, that's a victory worth celebrating. In the end, what the movie focuses on is not the outcome of the match, but on the love between Rocky and Adrian. Because in a world full of turmoil, underdogs like Rocky and Adrian can find each other, and rise together- and that's what matters.",10,1,1,31 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," All the Reboot/Sequel Tropes in One Movie
","On the surface, it would seem The Force Awakens did everything I'd want to see from it: likably interesting new characters, nostalgic old ones, entertaining adventure mixed with tragic heartbreak, and quality filmmaking techniques consistent with the originals. But while all this might makes one leave the theater feeling satisfied, it merely masks the gaping, fundamental issues at its core.It's actually quite amazing how perfectly The Force Awakens encapsulates everything I despise about remakes, reboots, and sequels. Here is my list of a few of the tropes I loathe the most about such franchises, and how The Force Awakens violates all of them:1. Unoriginality: Surely no sequel mimics any other nearly to the extent that Episode 7 does to Episode 4- not in a subtle, nuanced way, but more of a 'you automatically fail the course for plagiarizing' sort of way. It's not only certain elements, it's the framework of the movie as a whole: unlikely hero from sand planet discovers Jedi potential on adventure to help rebellion destroy the dark side's mega weapon. It's not simply paying homage to the original or using it as a sort of archetype, it's straight up recycling the main plot points and feeding from the brand it's created. 2. Shifting Morals and Themes: Abrams seems to be under the impression that the aforementioned plot framework is what makes Star Wars great. What made Star Wars great to me is the personal journeys of Anakin and Luke to choose good or evil, and the ultimate triumph over evil. That was the character arc, and it all wrapped together nicely. The new franchise reboot seems to disregard that in order to add a different, ambiguous spin on what the 'balance of the Force' actually means.3. Characters Jarred from their Happily Ever After: The same ambiguity given to the themes is reflected onto our heroes. Call me naïve if you will, but I believe that some stories deserve happy endings. The original Star Wars trilogy has a happy ending. When we last saw them, Luke had defeated the Dark Side, Han and Leia were happily in love, the Rebellion had overthrown the Empire. Legalities aside, what right does the new franchise have in saying, 'Psych! Just kidding! All those things were a lie, an illusion- the situation is actually quite opposite of all those things!' If a reboot wants to honor and respect the original, it starts first and foremost with not spitting on its story. 4. The 'Bigger and Badder' Effect: Sequels furthermore downplay the seeming success of its predecessor's story by the emergence of a threat that's much worse than what's come before. 'You thought the Empire/Darth Vader/Death Star was bad? Well that's no match for the One Order/Snoke/Death Planet!' It's egregious how shamelessly this escalation is presented, and it's supposed to be accepted at face value as if it makes any intuitive sense why a story continuously levels up to the next higher boss as if it's a '90s video game.5. Unexplained/ Weakly Explained Circumstances: The prequel trilogy spent three movies showing the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire, while the original trilogy spent three movies showing the Empire's overthrow. It's fulfilling to see the Rebellion triumphant at long last. And then in the following episode, the Empire (now 'The One Order') is essentially in charge again? And they're stronger than ever before? And Han and Leia are divorced? And the Millennium Falcon is gone? And Luke is missing? And R2-D2 is busted? All out of nowhere? What? Those are all pretty big story elements to simply be glanced over by a line of dialogue here and there, don't you think? Oh, I must have forgotten to scour the internet for all the blog articles explaining and theorizing the convolution, silly me to think a story is supposed to be self-explanatory and maintain any reasonable flow.6. Rejecting resolution in favor of becoming another generic gateway to an endless cash cow franchise: In the 136 minutes of this movie, nothing was resolved beyond the trivial. Sure the Death MacGuffin was blown up, but all character development (which is the heart of the Star Wars story) was left at a cliffhanger, and mostly left unexplained. (Han Solo's death had no closure because the backstory was missing.) The capabilities for meaningful themes and closure in a story are severely limited when that story is intended to continue in perpetuity into the eternities. If you're a big Star Wars fan, then you might eat it all up because 1. it is entertaining, and 2. it gives you a bunch of stuff to discuss until the next trailer comes out. But for me, it's disappointing and aggravating to see a franchise sacrificed to the Almighty Dollar so ruthlessly, and it represents so much of what I dislike about the state of today's movie industry. I gave this reboot a chance, I won't feed the Disney Sequel Monster again.",5,14,16,28 November 2017
