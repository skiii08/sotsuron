Moneyball," Brilliance, Reality, Chills and Brad
","Okay, first of all I'd like to tell everyone I'm from Pakistan and folks from Pakistan don't know a thing about baseball {we're more into cricket, hockey and football (soccer)}.Moneyball has to be thee most anticipated movie about sports, passion, hard work and motivation and I'm pretty much blown away to see that this movie didn't get that much recognition as it deserves. I believe this movie stands equally with movies like 'Million Dollar Baby' 'Rocky' 'Cinderella Man' 'The Wrestler' 'Raging Bull' and etc. Brad Pitt as Billy Beane did an amazingly magnificent job and it'll be a disgrace if he's not nominated for an Oscar for his brilliant performance, the way he cloaked himself into the character it was just masterclass and on the other hand he's equally well supported by Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman (who by the way did an amazing job as well)In my view, Moneyball is arguably second best sports movie ever made. My Rating: 8.7/10",10,2,3,10 January 2012
District 9," Remarkable......
","District 9, has now become one of my favorite Sci-fi films ever.The plot of the movie is just speechless, I first watch this film alone on my Television, after watching this magnificent piece of art the next thing came in my mind,'I think I should share it with my friends' and so I did. Not to mention The Direction of the film, it is just outstanding the way the movie rises.... After watching almost all of the movie I was curiously waiting for the end and I thought it might disappoint me, but it didn't, it totally blew me away because I was expecting a predictable ending but the ending almost made me cry a little.District 9 is an extraordinary movie and I believe it stands equally with the Sci-fi classics, The Matrix(1999) and 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968) which of course are my Personal Favorites as well....Do watch District 9 if you are looking for a nice plot and I tell you its real.",10,3,9,3 November 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Definition of Perfection
","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Genre: Drama Runtime: 159 minutesHere's the thing, when the title of the movie is this long and the subject to the matter is told in the title, there is no element of surprise left in it then.Yes the movie is about assassination of the outlaw named Jesse James who was killed by of his admirers Bob (don't worry folks it's not a spoiler) However, the movie is so beautifully shot that every scene of the movie is worth watching over and over again, the cinematic style blended with lime sepia containing slight mixture of candle light takes and through the glass shots reflect that this movie is nothing short of a modern masterpiece and don't even get me started on the cinematography because that was just 'SHEER BRILLIANCE' hats off to Andrew Dominik the director and screen writer of the movie, a big round of applause for Roger Deakins for his marvelous efforts in cinematography. The best thing director did in the making of this movie is he didn't miss any little things, every scene represents details of its own The cast and crew was picture perfect and the acting was spot on. Brad Pitt as Jesse James was the most real then real characters as if he was born to play the role and Casey Affleck's (Bob Ford) performance was unbelievably second to none. Equally brilliant performances by Sam Shepard as Frank James, Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller, Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, Jeremy Renner as Wood Hite, Mary-Louise Parker as Zee James and of course last but not the least Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford. The last thing that any action junkie would be wanting is to make this particular movie another shoot-out, commercial money grubbing flick for their entertainment (which is by the way a curse)'A complete movie after a very long time''A perfect blend of drama, storytelling, emotions and art'10/10",10,2,3,6 April 2015
