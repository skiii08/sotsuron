United 93," Great Film Cheapened By Its Ending
",I must admit when I first heard about this film I feared that it could have been handled so badly and even may have been made a bit too soon after the event. To be honest if it wasn't for my wife I probably wouldn't have even gone to see it.I was pleasantly surprised at the way the subject matter was handled and the drama was built nicely. With a powerful story that everyone in the cinema knew inside out and some fantastic performances I would recommend this movie to anyone. I found myself thinking about what I was doing on that September day and the sheer mundane normality of ordinary people turning up to board a flight brought home the absolute horror of the atrocity.Unfortunately I did find myself trying to work out who was an actor compared to who was really present that day but that is just a minor quibble. If there is a complaint about this film it is that it went for the gung ho America will not take this lying down ending with the passengers storming the cockpit. As no one really knows what went on in those last seconds of Flight 93 to try and imagine it for us all was a bit crass for my liking. I believe this would have been a far more powerful piece of drama if the film had ended at the infamous 'let's roll' statement and left the rest to our imagination. As a result the film is slightly overlong and I came away feeling a little disappointed. I can understand why the producers thought the ending was a good idea as it would definitely have Middle America standing up and hollering in that way only Americans can! The problem was is that it cheapened the film and that's a real shame.,6,1,4,3 July 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Excellent even without a plot!
","A welcome return for Manny, Sam and Diego in this quality sequel. The plot maybe wafer thin but that doesn't matter when a film is this entertaining.Still struggling with his beloved acorn is Scrat. Thankfully the director realised that he is by far and away the best creature in this film, pure comedy gold. Sandanha treats us to generous helpings of his trails and tribulations and in doing so surely give us some of the best comic moments that film will see this year.Although flawed this film has more than its fair share of laugh out loud moments, good fun for young and old but I still stand by my belief that this film is wasted on kids!!!http://seetocher.blogspot.com/",8,0,3,10 April 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Clooney can do no wrong
","A fine effort from the ever impressive George Clooney. This film both entertains and informs on every level. The evocotive black and white cinematography intercut with real news reel of the day gives the film a unique feel and perfectly captures the mood.With obvious parallels between the McCarthy witch-hunts and todays post 9-11 world aside this is how political films should be and begs the question whether or not we really learn from our mistakes. It leaves you in no doubt where Mr Clooney's sympathies lie but it is done without the feel of lecturing and haranguing that these type of films so often fall foul. Excellent.Just one word of warning though, do not watch this movie if you are trying to quit smoking!!!! http://seetocher.blogspot.com/",10,1,2,15 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Excellent, but it is only a movie after all!
","It's become the fashionable thing to knock this movie; it's as if people go into the cinema actually wanting to hate it! After all the hype I finally got to see the film. I love the book, being a great fan of conspiracy theories and a good ripping yarn, so I was straight off to the cinema as soon as I could after it opened.This is one of those films that you know the critics are going to hate simply because of the hype and the publicity surrounding it. Being a subscriber to satellite T.V. the schedules were bombarded and chock full of Da Vinci Code documentaries either agreeing or disagreeing with the theories in the novel. I must admit I found it amusing watching certain religious types being up in arms about the book and literary types being sniffy and snobbish because how dare a book be so popular as to have the great unwashed reading!!! As expected the critics panned it, the academics hated it and all of them missed the point. It's a NOVEL, not a historical documentary! Everyone should get over themselves and appreciate it for what it is. A popcorn thriller and a bloody good one at that! Some chunks are missing because you can never fit the full book into the film but it doesn't detract from your enjoyment or understanding of the plot.The central performances are solid and it looks as if Ian McKellen is having an absolute ball hamming it up as Sir Leigh Teabing. The script is okay without being stellar but it grips you in all the right places as a good thriller should. It may not be on anyone's best ever movie list but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a good adaptation well worth two and a half hours of anyone's time. Don't be led into not liking it because it's fashionable to, watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed, but it won't change your life. Well it is fiction, isn't it?!",8,24,47,27 June 2006
