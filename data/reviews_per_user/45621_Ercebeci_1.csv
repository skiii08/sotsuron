Minority Report," 'Film Noir' for New Generation
","Science Fiction! When a movie has Steven Spielberg in the director's chair you can expect more than this. This is Spielberg's second golden era in his career. He began his first period with Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.  Spielberg`s previous film, the misunderstood masterpiece A.I. was his coldest and most cerebral film. Most people couldn't figure out the reasoning behind its virulent expression of a heartless race, but the beauty of the movie lied in telling its fable of an android that had a greater capacity for love and feeling than any human of flesh and bone.Now it's time for Spielberg's another great accomplishment, Minority Report. This is stuff of great film noir, except its positive final scene. And the most fervid of movie fans will admire the sterile,  grey tint of the picture that suggests technology over freedom and autonomy in this future society. The visual effects seamlessly blend into the composition of the film to create a perfectly credible. The look of the picture, and characters all create a film noir with a look that is both future and retro. The story crashes into inevitable consequences, where the hero has to choose the ultimate moral dilemma whether to save himself or to remain truthful to destiny and future  Minority Report is a futuristic cinematic landmark that deserves to be ranked with Blade Runner, Se7en and Brazil as one of the best of the genre.",Null,0,0,10 October 2002
