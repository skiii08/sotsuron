E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A Very Heart-warming Film
","I don't care how many times I've seen it.  E.T. always moves me to tears.  I begin to cry when E.T. starts to 'die' and separate from Elliot.  By the time E.T. tells Gertie, 'be good', I'm an emotional wreck!!  This movie is every kid's fantasy to meet and have a friend like E.T. to have someone to share a secret with. This movie is for all ages to enjoy and to see again and again.",10,1,2,22 November 1998
