The Incredible Hulk," I am crying because I cannot give it 0/.10
","This film simply breaks all the rules of storytelling. The characters are empty, the plot-line is empty and the makers must have been on holiday and allowed a primary school to manage the project. Maybe the whole thing is a Louis Leterrier joke on the stupidity of humanity - for dignifying this by forcing us to comment on this piece of garbage.The shots of the Favela in Brazil are the high point. If you have a Blu-Ray player that shows this shot in its glory, then you can have enjoyed that, take your copy with your tail between your legs to a store where they will give you 'pre-owned' money for it. This is the most favourable outcome for the victims of the 'Incredible Hulk'.As someone who knows a bit about CGI, I can say that creating these characters without any reference to the immutable laws of physics that govern our universe is lamentable stupidity. I cannot go on. I am utterly disgusted. Please let this be the worst ever. Do not test us with new precedents film makers.",1,39,79,15 October 2008
Hitch," Magical...with caveats!
","It is spellbinding. The three leads are so comfortable with one another. Kevin Jamess comedy is very versatile and his physical skill gives the film added depth. I had wanted to see a good romcom for so long, and here it WAS. I am actually laughing at the utterly competent and sublimely confident Smith in every scene and he delivered the slick script with the deftness and verve of a skilled master-boy of comedy. The sub-plots were there to glue up all the seams and they did so very well. Eva Mendes was delicious.Did I say spellbinding though? Oh my! I forgot the last 40 minutes of this movie where I allocate 9/10 to the first part and 4/10 to the last 40 minutes. Why? Because, for the end of the movie the storytellers in their complete boneheadedness decided to strap the characters rigidly to a 'Loses-girl-Situation falls apart-Saves situation-Gets girl back-Live happily ever after' formula that kills ALL of the humour and for the most part, the characters stone-dead. Simply because it was wrenched from its natural flow.Awful...and the same thing happened in 'How to lose a guy in 10 Days' too. Pattern emerging and I think it might be 'Studio Management interference'.Anyhow, I have decided to up the combined average score from 6 to 7 because Eva Mendes is gorgeous and Kevin James proved that we should see more of him.",7,0,1,14 February 2010
