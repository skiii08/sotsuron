The Expendables 2," The Boys Are Back
","Being a movie junkie, this film comes as a cotton candy for me.I rated 10 because it kept me totally immersed in it for the whole time.Mr. Stallone has my respects for making the industry alive and generating unforgettable characters and revenue.This time he was not the director,but wrote and starred,and I believe the whole films projects' (1 and 2), are his ideas.The addition of Chuck Norris and Liam Hemsworth are more than welcome.A disenchanted and disillusioned young former Afghistan 's soldier, shows us some contemporary air,or that the world is still dangerous and full of woes,or lots of tyranny and despotic rulers,and wicked souls... Norris-he fought with Bruce Lee..I never saw any of Mr.Lee's films,but many of Chuck Norris back in the 80's.And I believe if we don't account his fighting skills-a major winner.Then,at least, take a look at the ' Lone Wolf Mc Quade-'a 1983 flick with David Carradine,as the bad guy and the stunning Barbara Carrera.He also trained people like Steve'The Cool'Mc Queen.Expendables 2 is much better than the previous one and happy to know they have already scheduled another one.I'm so ready for it. 'I 'm back!'shouted Arnie and we are glad he is,although I didn't find him in a good shape yet-but then, after all those years out,we can kinda of forgive him,for all his previous excellent services provided.Hope he'll be in a better shape in the next franchise.'And now I pronounce you man and knife' Staham has accomplished so much in such a short time.A perfect match for Stallone.He can deliver punches and whatever needed action. The armored vehicles:Knock knock,Bad Attitude,and Coming Soon-boy,they were effective...Scott Adkins-I hadn't seen him before,but then I learned o his success in the U.K. and his fascinating story of martial arts expert.That must have been a blast when he first acted and fought with Van Damme,his hero!By the way,Van Damme was pretty good and still can fight.Long life,Mr Van Damme,long life! There's a fight scene that reminded me of Indiana Jones and The Raiders of The Lost Arch when they are fighting near the airplane's propeller...but OK,it's just a recall of other fantastic action movie.And like everyone else, I do have my Expendables 3 list: lose Willis-add Nicholas Cage as the CIA guy;call Clint Eastwood and his memorable Dirty Harry lines;of course we need The Rock-he's in an excellent shape-Dwaynne Johnson;Vin Diesel,and please bring Paul Walker tagged along...Jackie Chan,obviously.I would somehow add two other gigantic stars:Cristopher Lambert and Rutger Hauer...Vincent Cassel,and all his evil grim and feats...Clive Owen as a classy hero and...Channing Tatum -he can handle a machine gun in style.There are other two bad guys:Ray Winstone and Vinnie Jones-Brits and well known to Staham...And please,let's have a minute of silence in our hearts for Charles Bronson-a truly action films' hero.",10,1,8,2 September 2012
Macbeth," What went wrong?
","Like everybody else,I went to the theater with high expectations for this movie!...and we all know what happens when we have high expectations,don't we? It went through the whole film as a phony imitation of what it could have been if,well intended,or wanted by the director.I can't claim that I am an expert in the old bard's plays-English is not my first language,and I am a Latin American girl,saying this to imply my lack of sound knowledge in Sheakespeare's plays.But I do love films,and been seeing them for almost 60 years now.That would count,at least for me,in being moved by some quality work. They say European directors are countable for everything in a movie,and in the American ones,would be the producers.How that would that apply in here? I feel like calling the director responsible for the tragedy he created!Yes!Because he had lots of talent in hands,but he decided not to demand a better job from the best boys...are they not who look for all the main details in a film?Again,I am a Latino girl,but that kind of castle,is out of the right time in history!!!Am I just raving?You know when you see a nice cake and you try it,and it is just tasteless?That's this Macbeth,unfortunately.When I saw Fassbender's war painted face,I could not wait any longer,but going to the theater...I feel like not only I,but we should be reimbursed.Espetacular Scotland's scenery counted,or otherwise I would have given it a star,or maybe two;seeing the great performers,also counted.But,then,you have the director!I found the performances cold,out of touch,repressed by both Cotillard and Fassbender,and I know they are fine actors!But if you ask me,there was one(1),just one scene that moved me:when Lady Macbeth is dead and Macbeth says that part of the monologue!'...tomorrow,and tomorrow,and tomorrow...'Fassbender is an actor that maybe has believed in fame that he has acquired...he forces himself strongly,like in 12 Years of Slavery,and in that time he was crazy about the Oscar's winning!Is he totally immersed in Hollywood's vanity?He needs to ...study more,perhaps?Now,he is easy on the eye!!!that I can't disagree,and he has the potential for big deliveries,if..:he decides to leave his vanity aside!Well,it is a film that probably was made in between schedules,with great names!!!",3,13,25,4 January 2016
