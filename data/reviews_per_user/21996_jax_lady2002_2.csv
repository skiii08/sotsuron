Requiem for a Dream," This is a terrible movie
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's crazy and I sure don't understand it, let alone get a 'message' as most movies have a message and that's one of the things I like about movies. I don't understand how it won such critical acclaim. I watched it with a friend and he thought it was the worst movie he's ever seen also. I shouldn't have wasted my time watching it all. I do like Ellen Burstyn, but that didn't get it any points. She and her refrigerator....it's crazy. I don't even understand the title and how it relates to the movie about someone going insane. I don't like the extreme close-ups either. It is hard to follow sometimes with the screens going by so quickly.",1,2,4,15 January 2015
Stranger Than Fiction," Love this movie, one of my favs
","I really enjoy seeing Will Farrell in a dramatic role, not comedic. It's interesting how his life's routine are told in a story like way, but the main character (Will) can hear her and it's driving him crazy he's got to figure it out. She's writing a book, yet its his life. However mundane and boring it may be. Dustin Hoffman is an interesting as a psychology professor. Will meets the Maggie Gyllenhall character and she's so much fun and such a free spirit, quite his opposite. Yet he lets loose a little and is attracted to her. She's so free and open minded she gives him a chance. I love this movie and it's such an unusual method of story telling. One of my all time favorites. Such a great message.",10,1,2,25 December 2014
