The Ring," I've coughed up things scarier than The Ring
","OK, it is expertly directed and the music and mood are creepy.But Come on!This movie does not resolve itself at all. After a great build up, the ending is like an bad episode of 'The Outer Limits'.This movie operates under the same gimmick as the another horribly overrated thriller, 'The Blair Witch Project': if you are ambiguous enough, people will create their own version of what happened in order to scare themselves.

28 Days Later...," Potentially very good movie sunk by plot holes
","OK, the film makers get great marks for some impressive and powerful footage of an abandoned London. The acting was very strong and the film moves at a crisp pace. Overall, the film accomplishes a lot on an obvious shoe string budget.But this script could have used a rewrite or two. The story is too contrived. There are too many implausibilities to ignore. If the author could have made the story more believable this could have been a powerful movie. Perhaps, the budget was too tight to resolve the major plot holes.
The whole virus should have been explained a little more. It just seems to be an excuse to introduce 'classic' zombies into the movie. The scenes with the soldiers are just the writer's attempt to make a 'Lord of the Flies' type of statement and should have been omitted as they distract from the terror of the main characters fleeing from Zombie London.The idea of a handful of people surviving a virus that wiped out a city is good. The fact that the survivors are hunted by the virus victims is great. But this movie quickly takes a wrong turn and just ends up as another hack and slash revenge flick.In a nutshell I was disappointed by this movie. It was stylish, clever and well paced and acted, but the story itself is too flawed to be taken seriously. This movie was 3 rewrites away from being great.It had me, then it lost me.",6,2,4,18 June 2003
Paranormal Activity," It stinks! It is like a big practical joke on the public.
","If you thought this movie would be another Blair Witch Project you are so right.This movie is downright stinky. It's the biggest movie disappointment in years! Blair Witch was actually scarier than this joke.Obviously, a slick marketing campaign was used to fool people into believing this movie was a lot better than it is. I'm angry with myself for having been fooled. I can only guess that the studio paid scores of people to write glowing but fake reviews of this trash. It is like a big practical joke on the public.I read that Steven Spielberg was so frightened by this movie he had to stop watching it in the middle. BULL! I've seen Cracker Jack commercials scarier than this.We have been fooled again. Boring, uninspired, plodding, pointless, dumb and shameful. How low will movie marketers go to separate us from our money?",2,0,2,22 October 2009
