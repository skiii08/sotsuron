The Ring," A slow burn scare
","This film does not seem scary. When you are watching it it's clearly not terrifying or thrill packed in the traditional horror genre way. What it is, is creepy but it builds up to scary and perhaps even terrifying but not till after you leave the theatre.I think it is because the film never gives you that release moment - that moment to let all the tension and suspense out with a good shudder or scream, so you have no chance of processing that tension (which is what, in my opinion, horror movies are for.), it's still there when you leave the cinema, whether you realise it or not.Add to that some very disturbing visuals of a scary looking little girl and I - a hard core horror fan, found myself having nightmares over a film which i left the cinema believing wasn't even remotely nightmare material.This  film is interesting on a number of levels, it's like a puzzle your mind still plays with for hours, days maybe even months after watching it. Is this a good thing - i don't know - let's see if I sleep tonight.",Null,0,0,27 November 2002
X-Men," The best Comicbook adaptation so far
","I just watched this for the third time and it still manages to impress.A great script, strong characters and a very powerful underlying message makes this so much more than your usual 2 dimensional comic book adaptations.The fact that the good and evil characters are so blurred is the key to the success of this film (and it's sequels. Special effects don't rule this film, they simply allow the characters to really perform.
Hopefully the producers will recognise the reasons for this films success and not lose the darkness in endless sequels based on big stars and silliness (Batman anyone?)Overall a HUGE thumbs up here.",Null,0,0,14 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas should just give up now!
","Absolute rubbish that still manages to be a marked improvement on the first of these 'new' episodes. Anakin is decidedly unlikeable - yeah we all know he is going to turn into Darth Vader but surely he can be a little bit endearing. Whatever does Armadala see in him? Well i guess she is to busy trying to not rip over her terrible 'love scene: lines and look anything less than ridiculous in the garbs she is squeezed into or falling out of through out the movie.George Lucas should finally admit that he is not a writer, the first movies were so much better than this specifically cause George Lucas had so little to actually do with them.Give up George - let Episode 3 stay in our imaginations, you can't ruin it that way.",Null,0,1,3 October 2002
No Man's Land," a dark, tragically funny satire
","this film is a brilliant commentary on war in general and the war in Yugoslavia in particular. No other film has managed to portray the pointlessness of the hatred within this country so well.No Man's Land focuses on the situation where sworn enemies are forced to work together to insure their own survival. But the film goes much further, no participant in this conflict, not the Serbs, not the croatians, not the UN, not the peacekeepers or the diplomats are spared from the accusing finger this film manages to point.Even if you don't normally see foreign films, see this one, it's powerful, funny, heartbreaking and above all timely.",Null,0,1,28 December 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill No Thrill
","I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarrantino. I loved Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and even found a place in my heart for his hit and miss Jackie Brown, but KILL BILL Vol  1 was a total disappointment.Where Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs never shied away from violence and blood, both films contained a hidden cheekiness and clever sense of humour that created a black comedy even when bullets were flying.Kill Bill attempts this but somewhere along the way Tarrantino has lost his sense of humour.The violence was over the top and an obvious homage to kung fu killer flicks. But this one just missed the mark. Uma Thurman's BRIDE did a terrific job of convincing us that her character could well be a force to be reckoned with. But the over the top aspect of the film really negated rather than added to the actual strength of her character, making her seem more cartoonish than courageous.The hospital rape aspects were quite disgusting. I wonder why every time there is a strong female protagonist in the film she has to be raped at some point? Clearly Tarrantino was trying to shed his mysoginist reputation by having a large female cast here, but he has fallen into the same old stereotypes male film makers always make - the women have to be beautiful, have to be raped/beaten or somehow defeated by a male in the story, have to lose a child or protect a child to account for their strength and finally have to be ultimately controlled by a male (Bill in this case.)Added to this was the Volume 1 aspect. The current trend to create serial movies is annoying at best. But when a movie such as this one wastes so much time having fight scenes rather than moving the narrative along, it really becomes frustrating. Kill Bill VOL 1 could have been told in an hour and we could have seen the conclusion of the film in one sitting. Instead a cheap marketing ploy was used and then time filled with senseless violence.It's a cheat and despite some memorable scenes and great female performances, Kill Bill failed to ultimately impress.",Null,1,1,2 November 2003
Big Fish," Personal myth makes great film a reality
","Beautiful story giving the importance of storytelling and perceptions of our lives in the limelight.Often Burton can be style over substance ( re: his appalling Planet of The apes) but in Big Fish the material really requires the surreal style of this film maker.Like Edward Scissorhands - Burton's other successful film, Big Fish is an exploration of the magical place were myth means life, were fairytales interwine with reality. The scriptwriter and writer of the original book require more kudos than Burton of course, and the charming performance of Ewan MacGregor dds a huge amount to the excellence of this film.Go see it - it's suitable for everyone.",Null,0,0,19 January 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," A waste of time, space and ideas
",The first Matrix was excellent. It took an interesting philosophical concept and rendered it into a film which was interesting and entertaining.In this sequel the whole philosophical aspect just loses itself in it's own existentialism. Ending up in a classic case of style over content we see too many scenes of pure CGI that are all about 10 minutes too long.It just screams out that the film makers are doing nothing more than stretching out the thin idea to create a trilogy (all the cool film series are trilogies don't you know?)The Matrix was kind of a Sophie's World for cinema (a nice introduction to basic philosophical ideas) but one film does it unless you actually know something about this stuff and these film makers obviously don't.It's a shame that the 1st film is so sullied by this piece of money grubbing rubbish.,1,1,2,14 November 2003
The Terminal," Tom Hanks is still a crummy actor but here he somehow pulled it off
","Honestly I hate Tom Hanks, I think he is probably the most over rated actor of this generation. I also think Steven Spielberg is a good technical director who often needs someone to tell him when a story has actually played out and not to add an unnecessary 15 minutes to it... But somehow this film resisted the fatal flaws of it's two creative heavyweights (Probably because of the script which was charming and didn't allow too much faffing about from Hanks or a (overly) sentimental ending to be wrung out by Spielberg.) Overall created a lovely little gem that I am sorry i resisted seeing for so long. The main reason it works is because it is such a simple premise told in a really simple way. It wasn't the best film I have ever seen, but a nice surprise.",6,0,2,16 July 2006
Donnie Darko," excellent doesn't begin to sum this up
","A dark, risky and all together successful first feature. It's a twisted storyline that may take a few viewings to get - or it may be like Usual Suspects - the first time you see it you think - wow so much going on - but on second viewing it all falls apart and you think - that made absolutely no sense.However i think Donnie Darko will stand up to a second viewing, and a third and so on because it is not relient on fast pacing but slow unravelling. This i think is the strenght of the film, and why some people may find it hard, you have to concentrate - but it's worth the effort.no spoilers here. See it!",9,0,0,29 October 2002
