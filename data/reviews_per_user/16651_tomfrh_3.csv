Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Immaculate Conception?!?! Cmon...
","I didnt like this movie much (or the next one for that matter). The major problem was that it lacked any decent characters. You simply didn't care about any of them. When ObiWan died in Ep IV you feel sad. But when Quigon dies you dont care too much either way. Amidala was alright, but she is no Leah. Etc EtcAlso, Lucas overuses CGI. His CGI looks real fake because his direction of the virtual camera is undisciplined. There is way too much panning 1000ft in the air for it too be believable.My final gripe is the Immaculate Conception of Anakin story. How lazy is that? What next, a great flood?5/10",5,0,1,7 November 2003
The Usual Suspects," Emporers New Clothes
","I am not sure why this movie rates so high. Isn't it annoying when everyone loves a movie and you're left scratching your head over what all the fuss is about!.I think if anything, Benicio Del Toros' unbearable voice should push the rating down!7/10",6,0,2,14 February 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Ok, but not as good as original.
","I believe I feel the way most people do about this movie. It's good, but it just doesn't leave the same impression as Matrix 1 did.It has more fighting, more computer generated effects (bullet trails, crashing vehicles, keanu flying etc), but a much less interesting story.3 out of 5",5,0,0,8 June 2003
