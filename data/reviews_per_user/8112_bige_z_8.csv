Scarface," Good, but too long, boring at times.
","Okay, this is a good movie and everything, but its too damn long. I'd give it a ten if it wasn't so damn long. At the end of the movie, I was like, damn finally. I was more happy that it ended than anything. My uncle Alfonso Cardoso liked it though.",7,0,0,8 April 2000
The Fifth Element," You better take my comments seriously.
","From the beginning of this film, to the end, I was really sucked into it. It is full of comedy and action and it never stops entertaining. Bruce does a very good job in playing his part, just like the rest of the cast. The way that it all clicks together scene after scene really amazed me. I give it a big ten.",10,3,5,3 April 2000
American Pie," hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahaha
","Damn I love this movie. Since the first time that I watched it, I still love it. I probably have seen this movie about 100 times, and i still laugh as hard as I did the first time that i watched it. The best part of the movie is when the 'Flute Girl' is riding on Jim and says and I quote, ' What's my name B1TCH!' Awww man, that made me bust out with tears of how funny it was. Damn, if you haven't seen this movie, or you didn't like it, or dont like my comments, BITE ME! hahahahaha",10,1,2,21 August 2000
American Pie," My uncle likes it
","American Pie is gonna be really hard to beat in comedy. This is the most hilarious movie I have seen since Dumb and Dumber. If there ever will be another movie as funny as this one, it will have a hard time cus damn this movie is funny. Not just funny but it also has a good plot.  My whole family loved it. We watch it almost everyday. Especially my uncle Alfonso Cardoso.",10,1,2,3 April 2000
Dumb and Dumber," HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!
","Keep in mind that my comments are always serious. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!! This was the most funniest movie I have ever seen in my Uncles house. No but for real this is a very funny movie. This is the funniest movie that I've seen that doesn't have to have any sex in it to make it funny, like American Pie. Now dont get me wrong, I love American Pie. Anyway this is a very entertaining movie. My uncle Alfonso Cardoso likes it.",10,0,0,8 April 2000
Titanic," Whats wrong with this movie?
","Thats the question that DiCapitated-lovelorn girls ask themselves when someone like me tells 'em that this movie really truly sucks. I went with my girlfriend (she is not a DiCaprio-lovelorn girl, she actually thinks he's gay) to the theatre to see this movie. I thought it would be a good movie to watch with her, since its basically a chick flick, and she would be happy after the movie, and really happy with me for wanting to go with her, I just wanted to make her happy. But those three hours in that theatre seemed to go longer than any In School Suspension that I have ever served in school. And believe you me, ISS is the most boringest part of school. I mean, at least in class you got your friends and chicks to check out, but ISS is like a prison. But anyway, before I get completely off the subject, Titanic is way way way stretched out. 3 HOURS! 3 HOURS is what they make you wait to see the ship sink. And thats it! In between those 3 HOURS all there is is two people that fall in love, one being a poor boy, and the other, a rich, easy girl. I mean, they just met, and she already took of her clothes and even had sex with the guy, aint that an easy girl?! So, all that happens is the movie wastes 3 HOURS of our lives, which I couldve used in other things, and show us a really cool sequence of how the ship looks and how it sank. You can see all that in the Discovery Channel, or even in the internet. The only reason why I dont give this movie a 1 but gave it a 6, is because it made my girlfriend happy, who which in turn later made me happy :) DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE, UNLESS YOU WANNA MAKE YOUR GIRL HAPPY, WHO IF YOUR LUCKY, WILL MAKE U HAPPY",6,2,4,21 August 2000
The Matrix," Best action/ Sci-Fi movie ever!
","The first time that I finished watching ' The Matrix ', I couldn't wait to see it again. This movie has everything that every good movie has, thats why its a great movie. This movie is Action Action Action. Not one second of this movie is boring at all. The movie carries out a plot that keeps you thinking about your life in a different way. Every time I eat a steak, I think, this tastes good, but is it real? The few people that don't like this movie because you think that the plot was too confusing, must of watched the movie with earplugs or something, cus Morpheus spends almost the whole movie explaining what the Matrix is and what the Agents are trying to do. So there shouldn't be anything not to understand. And then there's the FX. Oh man, this movie really takes the special efects to another level. The way they were able to make those eye-catching effects along with the sound effects was amazing. No other movie has been able to do that, except maybe ' The Fifth Element'. But overall this is a must see, and I give it a Ten.",10,0,0,3 April 2000
The Matrix," This is a kick A55 ride of a movie
","This movie is so cool, that im acctually watching it right now on my big screen. The big screen that I use to watch this movie on DVD each and every single day. Since the day that I got the movie in my hands, i feel powerfull, like i can dodge bullets. But then when me and my uncle tried it, he ended up in the hospital and had serious surgeries on his spinal erector. I even tried to shoot up a government lobby, but right when I stepped through, I turned around and walked back out because NEO used more than just 2 guns, and thats only the ammount that I had tucked under my belt. Or else all of you that are reading this right now would've seen me on the news and there would've been another big deal about movies encouraging teenagers into doing violent acts. The movie kicks A55!!!!!!!",10,0,1,18 August 2000
