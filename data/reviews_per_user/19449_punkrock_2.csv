Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," NOT THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE
","The phantom Menace was a very good movie. It had action it had excitement, And it even had easy to uderstand humor. I rated this movie a ten because it was interesting and it had a good plot. but not everyone can understand the story. If you haven't seen Episodes 4, 5, and 6, then it will be hard to understand parts of it. The computer effects and animation was awesome but I don't understand why the first episode would be made to make the other star wars movies look so primitive. the style of the movie is what upset me i believe George Lucas made mistake when he started the series with Episode 4. but I'm sure Episodes 2,3 7,8, and 9 will be awesome.now for the viewing experience of the movie. as it starts out you feel invigorated by the star wars theme music and the scrolling marque on the big screen and then things slow down for a while but when they meet up with anakin things start to get interesting. The war scene was very exciting and the buildings were astounding. Jarr-Jarr Binks was funny most of the time but his constant missunderstanding of words started to get to me.now let me tell why i headlined this with NOT THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE. the reason is because it lacks what the classic star wars movies have in common, a continuing story line. the movie drifted off into things that did not matter a lot, and also heres a big one, The 'FORCE' was seldom mentioned in the film, and it was barley ever used. I prefer 'RETURN OF THE JEDI' because it has the best plot and story line, it brings together episodes 4, and 5.i guess i've said enough. if you want to know if this is really a good movie then you'll have to go see it yourself this is only the opinion of an amateur movie critic.",10,0,0,24 May 1999
The Matrix," #1 SCI-FI Movie of All Time
","The 'Matrix' really gets your mind working. The special effects are great but I don't think that that is what makes it a good Movie. The 'Matrix' has a great plot and it's original. The characters were portrayed very well, especially Laurance Fishburne as 'Morpheus' and Keanu Reeves is the perfect match for Neo, I had my Doubts about him but after I saw it I Thought he was great.If you think it's a bad movie you better see it again because obviously you didn't understand itThe first time you see this Movie Many ideas will pop into your head about what's going on, the dialogue was planned out very well and it's hard to tell what the plot is at first. you really don't know what's happening until 'Neo' meets up with 'Morpheus' and he shows him what the 'Matrix' is.I rated This Movie a 10 Because I love the plot and dialogue. and the special effects help too. Basically it's an all-around good Movie.",10,0,0,17 April 1999
