The Ring," This movie is not good.
","I must have missed something. I thought this movie was funny.
Please watch it for the scene in which whatever tension was being attempted is brought to an abrupt halt by the man being yanked to the ground by the firehose. I'm thinking the film must have glitched in editing and no one saw that that take made it to the final cut until it was released. I certainly hope this is what happened. However, that is far from the lowest point in the movie.In my humble opinion, this movie is not good.",1,3,9,18 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Very good, because it's Star Wars
","I came into this film expecting way too much. I should have just expected Star Wars--because as such, this is a very good movie.
Rating-wise: (minor spoilers) As a straight-up movie, I'd have to give it a 3. But add 2 for the fact that it is in a series and it gives a lot of good history. Add 3 for the sheer fact of it being Star Wars and that it kept to the saga's theme. Minus 3 for corny dialgoue. Add 1 for giving most of the corny dialogue to Sam Jackson. You see, 'The party's over' is a corny line. But when Sam Jackson says the party's over, the party is over. Add 1 for Samuel L. Jackson's sheer presence in the movie and acting. Add 2 for another lovely score composition by John Williams. Minus 3 for Natalie Portman showing less emotion than if she was reading from a cue card and for looking completely bored with the movie. Add 1 for another stalwart villain performance by Christopher Lee. Add 1 for Ewan MacGregor beginning to become Alec Guiness. Minus 1.5 when Anakin rides a two-legged cow and when Obi-wan appears to talk to Shrek in the bar. Add .5 for Yoda, strange, but good for the history. Add .5 for the effects being better than I thought they would be. I think that adds to 7.5 out of 10. Sounds good to me.",Null,0,0,26 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," A Quite Perfect Trilogy
","First of all, I understand that this post is number 1123 on this film and it came out a week ago. Hence, not much of what I say here is going to matter to anybody. Having said that, I posted this for anyone who may be scanning through these reviews looking for a positive view on this film. I thought the three films were quite fantastic and amazing in all respects, artistic ideas and themes foremost. I know that must make me look like a very poor critic. After all, you can only look like you intelligently know what you're talking about when you can prove how you are in some ways smarter than the filmmakers. Quite honestly, I would love to do that. I like being smarter than people. However, with these films, I simply cannot in all objective thinking. The three films, this one piece of art, was incredible. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about...but I know what I like.Larry and Andy Wachowski, I appreciate these films.",10,1,2,11 November 2003
Signs," I thought it was beautiful
","I guess a lot of people didn't like this movie, but I must state my opinion that it was beautiful. Maybe that means I don't critique movies as well, or that I get frightened easily, but I'm willing to accept that. I felt that no other movie has done what this one has. It is not a horror film or fright-flick, but much rather a drama; a drama which uses light and humor to emphasize the darkness and build the tension, which in turn emphasizes the underlying theme of the movie, which in this case, was truly underlying as foreshadowing and meaning of everything abounds. Never before have a been so scared of nothing. It is not the jump scenes that will truly frighten you. That's a moment's fright. rather, it is the five minutes of suspense as you are trying not to be frightened while the score repeats the theme in a different and subtle voice and the shadows play. That's what art is all about. True emotion playing to end with an ultimate theme. This movie has shown the standard for art, in my small opinion. Acting, it's Mr. Gibson and Mr. Phoenix, who are two of my favorite actors, so I watched and tried to judge them more closely, and their performances I felt were once again awesome. The score was once again superb and shows a genuine feel for the movie, and the writing and directing, well that's what the movie is and it's awesome.",Null,0,1,3 August 2002
Windtalkers," Um, at least James Horner's score was great!
","Hey, I'm not much of a pro movie critic, but this is what I saw:--As toryline I'd seen before. Complete with Cage seeing hias first battle over and over again every time he hears a scream --Unrealistic war (I know I've never fought in a war), Cage's handgun took out about 5 or 6 guys in the end who were only holding their rifles.--I like war dramas. This was like the action hero of war. What did these guys feel? I dunno. I felt it in We Were Soldiers and in Saving Private Ryan, even Enemy at the Gates, but I did not feel it here. I cried on Indian in the Cupboard (ya, I'm dumb) but I didn't stifle any tears here. There was no drama, partly by average acting, mostly by directing and writing this movie as Mission Impossible II (sorry, I hated that one, too) goes to war. --What happened to the girl? --Christian Slater should've been cast as main role --Or Jason Isaacs (after Patriot, I think he deserved more than 3 minutes) --James Horner composes an inspired war effort score, complete with reoccurring themes, dynamics in the right places, a mixing of our European classical music with Native American music, contrapuntal passages at the conflict sections, and moving harmonies in oblique motion for the themes. (Sorry, I had time to listen because action sequences are unrealistsic and bore me) :-)Anyway, I'd skip this one",Null,1,1,5 July 2002
