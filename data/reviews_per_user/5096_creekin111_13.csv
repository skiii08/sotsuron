E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," My #11 favorite film of all time
","What a thrilling joy E.T. was when I was a kid. And what a trilling joy it still is. What an intriguing concept, to make an alien from another planet befriend children from Earth. At first the encounter is extremely tentative then by the end becomes a great friendship.What an exhilarating score from John Williams. Probably the best composer in film history, this ranks as one of his best. The music dances and flows with the images on the screen with sweeping majesty. It ranges from the foreboding to the thrilling.In my personal opinion this is Spielberg's best. He said he would never make a sequel to E.T. because it is too close to his heart. I for one applaud such a choice for a gutless industry that pumps out hundreds of sequels, remakes, spin offs...etc. a year.",10,1,2,12 February 2006
Casablanca," My #10 favorite film of all time
","To see Casablanca's poetry on screen is like witnessing the Sistine Chapel for the first time. Like a fine bottle of perfectly aged wine, its complexities are seemingly endless. It only gets better with time. To quote Bogart in The Maltese Falcon, this truly is the 'stuff that dreams are made of.' Easily the greatest romance ever to be produced on celluloid. Casablanca blends the genres of musicals, drama, romance, war, film noir, suspense, a little comedy, and a touch of mystery so seamlessly it is easy to forget that at its very heart and soul is a romantic picture.It pacing is almost frantic from beginning to end. The use of shadows and lighting are so vivid and fascinating that it is probably the best looking beautiful B&W film ever made. The most memorable lines in movie history and the most amount of memorable lines in movie history.I don't expect people who dislike romances to like Casablanca. Its dialogue, characters and songs have been so familiar, it hardly even seems as fresh as it should be. But like witnessing the Sistine chapel for the first time, you know what its like. But its another thing to see it completely for yourself.",10,1,3,12 February 2006
Citizen Kane," My #3 favorite film of all time
","'Rosebud...' A single word that will echo throughout the history of the motion picture and beyond. No film deserves more credit to the craft of film-making than Kane. Its ideas and groundbreaking achievements were so revolutionary that much of its majesty wasn't fully realized for over a generation. Time manipulation rip roars back and forth, up and down, diagonally and horizontally, like a thousand puzzle pieces scattered over the floor, until by the end of the film everything fits together to create a masterpiece.Kane is a picture of insane genius. It was not potentially realized for its time and is eerily modern for today. This is a film that not only stands the test of time but grows with it.Amateur to novice movie goers will not be able to fully appreciate the innovative film language it created. Many disregard it because they believe that a film from over a half century ago could not possibly relate to them or be entertaining or (just because the 'snobby' film scholars view it as one of the greatest) they don't want to like it to go against their view of the critical consensus of being out of touch with the general public. If someone told me to see this film because it was the greatest I would be inadvertently critical of it myself. My advise for anyone seeing this film for the first time would be to keep an open mind before viewing. You have probably heard from various publications, scholars etc. that this is one of the greatest if not the greatest film of all time. See this film to discover what it means to you personally.The joy of viewing a legendary film is to discover its greatness according to your own terms.",10,1,3,8 February 2006
The Godfather: Part II," My #4 favorite film of all time (including part 2)
","What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far.Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn't defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family.",10,1,2,12 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," My #9 favorite film of all time (including part 2 and 3)
","The following comment is going to be on the same lines as my Star Wars comment.OK so... for all you giving this trilogy a 1 out of 10, is it REALLY and I mean REALLY that bad. Where you want to rip out your eyes and pour gasoline on them? Where you thought the script for White Chicks was equal to or better than this? Where you thought the acting in Batman and Robin was equal to or better...? Where the special effects in Plan 9 From Outer Space was equal...? Where Peter Jackson is a worse director than Ed Wood? Where it is the worst technical film ever made. Where the cinematography has ABSOLUTELY no tone or depth to it. It has the worst sound quality for a film. Where the song made you want to puke at the end... etc.If so AND you can site SPECIFIC examples as to WHY each of your points are true and can prove it then I will let you saw off my leg and beat me over the head with it.For those of you who think YOUR opinion counts more than anyone else's and give this a 1 out of 10 so it will bring down the overall rating here is what I have to say. If you think its a 5 out of 10 THEN RATE IT A 5 OUT OF 10. Don't give it a 1 so that people can see YOURS first from the HATED IT filter. That is just total BS. OK its fine to have an opinion against public opinion. Just stop being so angry at the world, move out of your parent's basement and get a life.",10,0,0,12 February 2006
Gone with the Wind," My #13 favorite film of all time
","I dare anyone to find a more memorable female lead character in Scarlett O'Hara or a more memorable supporting female character in Mammy. Both bring such a powerful presence to Gone With the Wind that makes it one of the greatest films ever made.One of my favorite shots of all time is when we see Scarlett enter a medical camp and the camera pulls back to see all the injured soldiers. Beautiful color cinematography, music score and setting all blend perfectly together. This is the epitome of the Hollywood epic. The rest of the cast are marvelous. Its amazing how Rhett Butler throughout the whole film takes so much crap from Scarlett that finally by the end he 'just doesn't give a damn.' But I'm sure many who view Gone with the Wind will.",10,1,2,19 February 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," My #1 favorite film of all time
","I was first given this film from a friend in high school. I saw it on VHS and wondered what it would have been like to see it in the theater.Then about 5 years later I bought the remastered DVD and was completely blown away by it. It is legendary at all levels. Acting, script, direction, cinematography, music score....I am with the school of thought that a great film can never be too long, and a bad film can never be too short. At somewhere near 4 hours, it feels like half the length.If you want to learn to be a serious movie goer this is would be a perfect starting point. I truly believe this to be a cinematic treasure.",10,1,4,7 February 2006
The Graduate," My #2 favorite film of all time
","How can a film feel as fresh and original now as it was 40 years ago? If the Graduate was released today for the first time it would be as good, maybe even better, as it was back then. Mike Nicols revolutionized film directing. The timing of the acting is impeccable between the chemistry of Hoffman and Bancroft. The soundtrack is easily one of the greatest if not the best. The script perfectly reflects the sexual revolution of its time. The dialogue and situations are poetically offbeat and hilarious. Benjamin Braddock may be the one of the most brilliantly developed character in film history.This is an absolute must for the student of film in everyone of us.",10,1,2,8 February 2006
Psycho," My #12 favorite film of all time
","It goes without saying that Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is easily his best film. The best horror film ever made. The best surprise ending ever unveiled. And the best Anthony Perkins film ever (although that isn't saying much).One of the most revolutionary films ever made, Psycho has so many thrills and shocks ever made. What might look like child's play to today's audience, must have completely blown away the minds of movie-goers from its time. Hitchcock throws caution to the wind and it pays off big time. What no other director would dare to put on screen, he does with surprising bluntness.To reveal Psycho's secrets to someone who hasn't seen it would be crime. The score of Herrman is the real star of the film that gives it a legendary status. No other film score has ever added more depth and intensity to propel a story. A truly horrifyingly great stay at the Bates Motel. Mother knows best.",10,0,1,17 February 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," My #7 favorite film of all time
","Without spoiling 'Bridge' too much, in my personal opinion this film has to have the best ending I have ever seen. Everything in this movie is leading up to this point and it doesn't disappoint even though it is still a fantastic film up to the climax.Easily the best prisoner of war film ever made. Which is ironic since, 'There is no barbed wire. No stockade. No watchtower.' Yet there is a sense of seclusion. The thought of escape is so impossible that Colonel Nicholson has no other choice to keep his soldiers occupied by helping out the Japanese by building a bridge that would link an important railway system.The top notch performances are led by Guiness, Holden, Hawkins, and one of the best supporting performances ever by Hayakawa. The whistle march of the soldiers is something the audience should instantly recognize. And with the budget and the on location setting, it is ever a wonder how this film was made for an estimated 3 million when it would probably cost easily 50 times that today.David Lean's subsequent 2 films of Lawrence (my #1), and Zhivago (my #90) make this probably the greatest triad of films a director has ever made.",10,2,5,11 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," My #6 favorite film of all time
","What has been difficult for me to understand is why someone would give Star Wars a 1 out of 10. For this and movies in general, why would someone give it a 1 and STILL say the words that it was good or even great in their reviews. The only reason they rate it a 1 so people can filter out the worst reviews, or they believe they have to give it a 1 because they believe it to be 'overrated'.If you really, really, hate this film (I mean on the level where you think Batman and Robin, Baby Geniuses 2, Glitter, Son of the Mask, or Leonard Part 6 are vastly superior films) then thats fine. But do would you really honestly think that those films are better or equal to Star Wars? I mean lets be honest, the majority of most regular Star Wars fans are embarrassed by the prototypical geeky hardcore fan. People DO take it too far, but that doesn't mean you have to hate the film itself. Its not Lucas's fault. Maybe it even goes to show how powerful a singular film can be.If you really hate this film and think it is the worst or one of the worst films out of hundreds of thousands EVER made then thats fine. But to think you are creating a certain backlash against a film's popularity and rate this film a 1 because YOU believe YOUR opinion is is SO much greater than anyone else then fine.Just do me and everyone else a favor. Watch some of the top 100 worst films on the IMDb. If you think any or all of those films are equal to Star Wars... Then OK, its fine to have an opinion thats different from everyone else.",10,0,0,11 February 2006
The Wizard of Oz," My #8 favorite film of all time
","No film is taken more for granted than 'The Wizard of Oz'. As a Fantasy film, it probably ranks better than any other. As a musical, it probably ranks better than any other. As a family film, it probably ranks better than any other. Any which way you slice 'Oz' you have to admit that it holds its own as a legendary film.The production value for its time was incredible. The musical numbers outweigh any other before or since its release. The choice of the transition from b&w to color is something that will never have the same impact again. The performances are impeccable, including the munchkins and monkeys. I'd say any film that has a midget or a monkey doubles its entertainment value. One of the most memorable heroines and villains ever put on screen.OK. Ninety-nine percent of Americans have either seen this recently or a long time ago. My point is if you haven't seen this in a long time, go revisit it. It is more than just a child's fantasy film. It is so much more.",10,1,2,12 February 2006
