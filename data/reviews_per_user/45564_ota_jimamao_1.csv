Come and See," Forgotten fact in the Unforgetabble movie
","I had a nightmare after watching this movie. With many shocking scenes, the movie describes the REAL. The movie absolutely is branded on your memory, and it doesn't let you go. This is something very important you should watch and understand before supporting the War in Iraq. This is absolute realism. On the other hand, you never meet such a movie in Hollywood. A young boy gradually understands the real during the war. What he experiences is pretty dramatic: death of his family, many of dead bodies, slaughter, rape, and many paralyzed hearts. His experience represents the victims. This is not a propaganda movie that make particular country look great, but tells that the war creates losses. The movie doesn't entertain you, but it educates and cultivates you.",10,3,3,10 December 2010
