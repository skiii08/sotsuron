Blade Runner 2049," May possibly be an overlooked classic on release - deja vu anyone??? ;)
","At time of writing, Blade Runner 2049 looks like it might underwhelm at the box office. There are probably a few reasons for that: the R rating obviously keeps children and young people, and families away; a demographic in the 18-25 range is probably pretty unfamiliar with the original movie; and its 2 hr 43 min running time probably feeling taxing to a number of contemporary moviegoers who are used to an hour and a half.However, here are my responses to each of these points:  this is the kind of 'thoughtful couples/date type movie' for when your kids are at their grandparents or babysitters; or it would make a great works night out to watch this if you're unfamiliar because you're pretty young with the classic original Blade Runner movie, you're admitting to missing out on a classic piece of cinema that you need to watch (up there with the original Star Wars; the Godfather; the Shawshank Redemption etc.) So do yourself a favour, and rent or buy it now, rather than watch the latest average to shoddy Maze Runner sequel;  if you're put off by a film's running time, then do you really have a love of cinema at its fullest and finest?Very important the last bit, because in my opinion, this is arguably the best sci-fi sequel since Terminator 2, way back in 1991. It respects, builds on and pays homage to the original film, without being constrained by it, whilst making us look again at the original film with a new eye. Without giving away any notable spoilers, the story continues and advances the conflict of replicants pitted against humans. Whether the divide between the two parties may be coming closer to an end is illustrated in a creative and thought provoking plot development (involving the characters of the original film), which I genuinely didn't expect. The characters here are fleshed out, conflicted, and portrayed as complex and realistic, give how Earth has so tragically ended up in the environment this franchise creates. Whilst most actors here give a sterling performance, with few off notes, I'm happy to note that in a film which needed him to carry the weight of the narrative and mythos, Ryan Gosling (not my favourite actor) is outstanding in an understated, often subtle performance that marks as one of the finest of his career. I'd also probably give Robin Wright credit for her turn as the prejudiced, conflicted and brutal Lt. Joshi; Harrison Ford (who plays a latter act part, but is nevertheless a key role) gives his best performance for a character in years as a now wizened Deckard. It's interesting that, compared to the pre advertising buildup of him, Jared Leto doesn't get as much screen time as you might expect – although he's competent in what time he does have.Of course Blade Runner stories are hugely about visuals: whilst much has been said for cinematographer Roger Deakins being Oscar nominated for this (he should be), the visual effects team really have done sterling work overall. The visual look is stunning and seamless – an understandable, logical and beautiful progression from the universe of the first film, that makes me hugely excited to own this at home on Blu Ray. It's one of the few films I would recommend seeing in 3D: the effect of it is subtle and not garish as can be in 3D, and it nicely enhances certain scenes, rather than distracts from them.So any quibbles at all? Thankfully, only a few: a brief cameo from a very well loved and intriguing character of the first film is sadly all we get from that character. The score is satisfactory, and services the visuals and plot well, but it can't really come close to the classic Vangelis original. In my mind, the only person who should have really been approached for this sequel is Vangelis himself, but maybe he turned it down. We don't know. The film also ends on an intriguing cliffhanger – one which is dependent on certain characters being available and happy in future to film a subsequent sequel. I'd have probably preferred the ending to be one that could make the film a stand-alone film, like the original, whilst allowing for the possibility of sequels.Still, these are minor quibbles overall. Hopefully it will make enough through box office receipts and home video and TV (remember, it's the latter two that led Blade Runner to become a cult hit over time, rather than the original box office receipts) to make a Villeneuve led sequel. If not him, the only other two people I can ever imagine doing that sequel might be Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott. However, let this man at it again, he'd done a fantastic job here.In summary: a brilliant achievement, which hopefully opens the doorway for another film to make what might hopefully then be the best sci- fi trilogy in history – aping the Lord Of The Rings trilogy for fantasy, and the Dark Knight trilogy for the superhero comic book genre. If this gets ignored by the Oscars for the usual costume dramas, biopics, and rote drama films, there should be hell to pay.",10,20,41,8 October 2017
John Wick," Not profound, not Shakespeare... but kinetic fun
","This movie would never win a screenplay Oscar, but that's almost not the point here. This is a B movie, with choreographed fight scenes galore - and if you take it on it's own terms, it's kind of fun.It actually makes a nice change from Marvel and DC antics, where CGI seems to be always the king or queen. Here, there's old school beat em up, Hong Kong kung fu inspired cinema back on the screen again. It's almost a throw back to 80s and before fight flicks in this way.A simple revenge theme drives the film, and it suits Keanu's brooding persona well. The movie gets some decent acting chops from Alfie Allen and the late Michael Nyqvist, and a sly Willem Defoe, in fleshing out otherwise simply drawn and thinly written characters. Watch out also for a key character from 'The Wire' in a quietly scene stealing turn, whenever they're on screen.If you're looking for docu drama, and high realism, then take a pass. if you put the brain on 'get this' mode though for an old school pop corn fight flick, John Wick is definitely an entertaining few hours.",6,0,2,3 May 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," If you adored Star Wars: The Force Awakens, you'll probably love this not necessarily a compliment
","Watching the trailers, I got the sense of Rogue One gearing up as a grittier, darker film. After the endless ' massive space battle clash' feel of much of the rest of the series, I was hoping for a smaller, character intimate project about espionage. Perhaps a work about Bothans being the CIA, MI6 or Special Forces equivalent within the Rebel Alliance. Yep, the odd battle scene, but mostly these scenes as strictly character and story driven, rather than by plot and action.Well, what were we delivered ? Sadly, you guessed it again, mostly plot and action. More massive space battles (more space dogfights than any Star Wars movie to date, incidentally); more explosions; more pace, over slow build up.Beneath the surface in Rogue One, there's yet again more of the key issue that plagued Star Wars 7: characters and events, rather than being introduced and explored with respect and feeling, 'appear' from nowhere. People thrown like driftwood - from plotted scene to plotted scene. We're supposed to instantly and intensely care them, and their fate. Well, I'm sorry, but if I can't get a rounded sense their histories and context, I can't suddenly force myself magically to care much in the end as to their outcome. Note that a large part of why the best film in the saga – the Empire Strikes Back – is best is because it takes a long, bonding, intimate stretch -examining Luke's fledgling sense of identity and purpose learned from Yoda, and Han and Leia's burgeoning relationship.Rogue One's at least marginally better than TFA on one character front, but only by a whisker. Jyn Erso gets some nominal backstory/history, and has to work hard at her progress in the film (unlike the credibility stretching 'Mary Sue' exploits and appearance of Rey in the TFA). However, aside from Jyn, who else gets a look in? Take for example Donny Yen's blind Force sensitive character, whom I was initially fascinated by. Where did his power originate? Who might he have trained under? How do his abilities tie with the Jedi exactly? But the filmmakers didn't seem to care two sticks about exploring this kind of territory. He ends up finally, as might be expected, as little more than cannon fodder for yet another large scale Empire-Rebel battle.As said, building a person driven story is not helped if the film insists on jumping location to location, at a breakneck pace – Rogue One revels in this. Just when you're beginning to work out where you are, and what might be going on – bang, they move again! Note it's very telling the filmmakers decided to add captions at the bottom of the screen, that describe which place and planet you are now on. These were never present in the previous episodes - you need them to have a faint stab at where you are next! To justify a five out of ten rating - there are things to appreciate here. The cinematography, special effects and 3D detailing are mostly excellent - probably the best of the saga to date (the only exceptions being the facial recreations of Grand Moff Tarkin and Leia: see below). I was also impressed with the narrative decision that all the major Rebel characters are dead by the end – bold, but gives the story at least something of an attempt at a kind of sad dignity (although as I've said, given how little characters are fleshed out, it's not nearly as sad as you'd hope it might be).There's also frankly an incredible scene – one of the best of the saga. Vader, in Vader costume, goes into full on Sith mode towards the end, in a way we've only imagined for the last 40 years. It's a truly stunning moment – that sadly only lasts a minute or two.This again makes the point again about meaningful and memorable characters. Vader - the most memorable character of all in the entire saga - could have done with being in the film a lot more than the three or four minutes present. Tarkin (and Peter Cushing) being recreated digitally, eclipsed Vader's screen time, by some distance. Was he memorable? Yes, but sadly not necessarily for the right reasons. I don't know whether if I had not seen the original Star Wars: A New Hope, whether I would have noticed the digital recreation or not. If you've seen him though in the prior film, you'll see the difference between the digital and the real Cushing. The effect wasn't stunning to me: it's creepy and unsettling, and distracts away from the film. Ditto the young Princess Leia digital recreation.So why all this plot based, digital action obsessed filmmaking taking place in a saga that once mixed action and character so beautifully? Perhaps because you get the sense that, under the Mouse House, their primary concern is displaying as many new locations and characters as they can squeeze in, in order to sell more toys and merchandise.It's interesting to me David Fincher – who would be my first choice by a long shot with this kind of movie, if allowed to work without creative interference from Disney - originally declined Star Wars 7 when offered it. My guess now as to why he declined is because he was wisely afraid of exactly what has happened - the franchise being dominated by the Mouse suits, and their intent on lowering Star Wars to the lowest common denominator.My overall comment then: what a waste of creative and narrative potential - just like Episode 7. For the love of Pete, Disney – tone it down in future: please. Please. We don't need recycled space spectacle every time: we don't need endless action and jump cutting. Stop treating us like we have the attention span of a goldfish, and actually write a quality story - over constant visual effects and space battles filler.",5,6,10,27 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Oh how the mighty have fallen - the Rise of Tedium
","In my previous review of the Force Awakens for IMDB, I stated that I'd likely watch the latter films on TV, rather than the cinema, such was misfire of that film.I actually broke this in going to see the Last Jedi - maybe the good reviews were right this time? No - just the reviewers again refused to see the wretchedness at the heart of that film as well. After seeing that, there was no way I was going to the theater for the last one.So this review is from seeing it on TV. Decision rewarded. I hoped beyond hope that somehow, Jar Jar would somehow pull something new out the hat. No.What an appalling film, and conclusion to the new Trilogy - from somebody who loved the originals, and to some degree, liked even the Prequels.So many have listed this film's flaws individually here already - I won't do a forensic on it. Summary - it just jumps from one tiresome, bloated, unoriginal battle set piece or Macguffin to another. Just like its immediate predecessors did. No notable writing, or character development beyond cardboard cut out archetypes. Scarcely a scene anywhere to fill one with wonder. Plot holes and recycling of previous films again aplenty.A film like ROS is an embarrassment to the original Trilogy - in fact, it makes even the Phantom Menace look admirable, and Revenge of the Sith a masterpiece in comparison. That should tell you something.I'm done then, as far as Star Wars and films go. We have to hope somebody can pull this trainwreck of a franchise in a more modest and thoughtful direction. TV series such as the Mandolorian I hope can help to erase in time the memories of this stinking third Trilogy.Advice - try and forget that the third Trilogy existed, and go to a fan film like Darth Maul: Apprentice on the Internet. Better story, pacing and tension in less than 20 minutes with amateurs producing, than this film or its predecessors managed with multimillions.Why did I give three stars, you wonder? Cinematography and music mixing and score are fine. Make up and CGI/special effects functional. Everything else - forget it.",3,1,1,9 May 2020
American Sniper," Easy to admire on a technical level, but deeply troubling as a historical account
","This film has good cinematography, sound, and a committed performance by Cooper, and other characters. What's wrong is the screenplay. Very, very wrong.I read Chris Kyle's book, and he was far from a pleasant character, however good he might have been with a rifle. A quasi-sainthood with which this film heaps on Kyle (the closing credits are disturbing to see, in this regard) with PTSD unsurprisingly put as the sole demon that interferes with that sainthood. This does huge disservice to how borderline psychopathic and jingoistic the real Kyle was to the people of the Middle East. Which you can read all about in his own text. You get none of that explored in any depth here. Because that would be 'anti-American' of course.Eastwood also ought to know better as a director than to just present this Iraqi conflict as a pro American flag waving, us versus them, 'makes up for 9/11' quest. But that's what it is. The only moral questions that we're presented with are Kyle's fears about shooting children, what his work does in taking him away from his family in America, or how he balances his home life on return with helping out other vets. Little else. Nothing on the devastating bloodshed inflicted on the Middle East by the West, at least partly in the names of oil and opium.You might feel moved by watching this, but you realise soon after that you've been had, if you're politically informed in any way. I don't recommend this film, and I'm glad I never paid money to see it at the cinema, or buying on video at least.",4,5,18,31 May 2020
Ocean's Eleven," A classic for the ages
","I watched this film first probably around 2003-4, and nearly 20 years after its initial release, I'm still hugely entertained every time I watch this again (I've rewatched this probably half a dozen times over the years). It's aged tremendously well. Fun, and kinetic like this is rare today.There's very few green screen, CGI or special effects shots. This is all about good writing, characters, plot, pacing, camera work, score, and set designs. Apart from one characters laughable English accent (and I'm English, people!) there's virtually not a line or scene out of place.Hollywood today could learn a lot from noting the heartbeats of this film, and the great, great underrated screenplay that drives it. Its perhaps not a surprise that the sequels struggled to live up to it - this is mastery on the first take.",10,0,1,4 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Mistaken
","4/10Dear oh dear: Abrams botched it. This is basically a copycat film, with only a few inspired moments. It's not so much that there are problems with the directing, although there were issues with that at times. Mainly, it's that the film's script should never have been passed for production. The initial flurry of good reviews, and nostalgia based denial from film critics (similar to the Phantom Menace) should hopefully be repealed soon, as painful reality sets in.The highs:1. Han Solo having a large part in this film. Harrison Ford's acting certainly made watching this more bearable at times. 2. Maz Kanata's character. Even with her dubious CGI, she was probably the only speaking new character I found wholly interesting. Hopefully, she'll be in future films. 3. BB-8. Very cute, and threw in a number of laughs that were definitely needed at times.4. Use of 3D threw up certain nice visual moments at times. If seeing it in 3D, watch out for seeing a Star Destroyer in 3D. This was an unexpected highlight and wonderful :)Lows (where do we begin??):1. Recycling of plot, almost ENTIRELY from the other films: mostly, from Episode 4, but also bits of the other films at times. Example: we've seen Death Stars destroyed done before, twice. Anticipating something similar destroyed, for the THIRD time, was actually boring. No doubts whatsoever as to what was going to happen. Can't believe in a way that the writing was that lazy, given the previous pedigree of the writers - but incredibly, it was.2. Amazingly, given the plot is almost entirely recycled in the first place, plot holes still abound in this. There's too many to list here in a short review, but the biggest clanger of them all was Rey inexplicably behaving like an experienced Jedi master: defeating a well-trained young Sith lord, when she hadn't even handled a lit lightsaber before that moment. Laughable, considering the premium that the previous episodes had set for how important a Jedi's training is.3. Little to no exploration of character origins, or development. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver do what they can with script characterisation that let them down badly. In what were prominently advertised roles, it was hugely disappointing that Oscar Isaac and Gwendoline Christie in particular have little more than extended cameos in the actual film.Maybe character development is being left for future episodes. That's a shame if it is, because it was desperately needed here. It's hard to care about characters without background context to their lives. Only a certain type of character can get away with this (e.g. the Joker in 'The Dark Knight'). That's because imagining the unspoken horrors of their past appeals to the audience's forbidden imagination and fantasies. A lack of history and context usually doesn't work well with relating to characters that aren't sociopathic or demonic. 4. Mark Hamill was truly relegated, enjoying only a 10 second cameo at the end of the film. I was hoping beyond hope we might get some Yoda – Luke like dialogue scenes between him and Rey at the end, which might have partly salvaged the film at the close. Instead, they cut the film at this point. This summed up the whole thing bitterly I felt.I'm sure Hamill will then be due for more action in Episode 8. Sadly, I'm not sure I care so much after this film.A guy sat next to me started playing with his mobile phone thirty minutes in. I was ashamed to admit I felt a little like joining him. Nobody watching with me clapped or cheered at the end of the film. Nor was the theatre sold out either. Perhaps word is getting round.My biggest resentment: my local theatre charging the price of several DVDs, or even a quality Blu Ray or two, to see this. I should have waited for it on TV. If you have a choice, I recommend you do so.",4,56,87,20 December 2015
