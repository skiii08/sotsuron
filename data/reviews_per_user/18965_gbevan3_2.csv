Insidious: Chapter 2," Massive disappointment
","The 2nd 'chapter' (which means there will be more) was sadly one of the biggest anti-climaxes in Horror movies to date. The movie is nothing more than a 'different version' of the 1st movie...in fact,there are so many flashbacks to the 1st part you may have well have been WATCHING the 1st part again. This time,it's the turn of Dalton to go into the 'further' to find his Father ......there are no major jumpy parts (perhaps the odd one or two,but that's it).... VERY inferior sequel and I for one will NOT be spending good money at the movies to see part 3. The acting is quite appalling and Barbara Hershey has the lead role(and BOY does she overact it) whereas it was the family who were in the spotlight in the original. This should have gone straight to DVD .... the producers have just milked a good storyline to milk us of our money.",2,10,20,12 September 2013
Avatar," This movie needs to be watched,not explained.
","Took the kids to watch Avatar 3D at the Manchester IMAX and it's true,you really need to see this movie as it was intended.The other screens are good (I've been 3 times to watch it now) but IMAX cannot be compared nor beaten. The effects like so many have said are amazing and you really DO have to see for yourself what all the fuss is about and it will NOT let you down. I was extremely surprised at how fast the movie went by and it is so engrossing that all 3 times I have been,...no kids have interrupted the movie and not one mobile went off (bit of a record for Manchester cinemas as they seem to be afraid of tackling teenagers with mobile phones) Go and watch,...I'll bet you'll be tempted to go and watch it a second time.",10,3,6,8 January 2010
