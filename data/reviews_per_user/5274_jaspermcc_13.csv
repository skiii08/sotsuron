Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Superfluous. OK, but superfluous.
","I enjoyed KBI immensely, despite the square peg in a round hole anime section and some typical Tarantino trademarks I could live without, but I had a feeling that the 'sequel' wouldn't live up to it. Like the Matrix, I was right.From the number of 10/10s this is getting, obviously other people think I'm wrong. But this should never have been a separate film. The amount of plot and action that we're treated to here could have been squeezed into the 40 minutes easily excisable from volume 1. And then we might have been spared some of the crap QT inflicted on us in both volumes (David Carradine's monologue, for instance). Viewing the two in one sitting might improve matters, but that might also highlight the filmmaker's indulgence. I give it 6/10, because I liked the music and the fights, but it's becoming increasingly obvious that QT will never better Pulp Fiction.",6,0,1,28 April 2004
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," as bad as the last stand
","My mistake was going to see this optimistic that it might be decent. Unfortunately the writers and director had other plans for my evening.Badly written, over complicated and strewn with pointless characters (Gambit, Cyclops and Emma Frost, for example). The dialogue was bad, and the fight scenes seemed to have Wolverine and Sabretooth running, or loping, at each other on a loop.Things weren't explained, or were so badly thought out as to be preposterous e.g. the marvel(!) of the adamantium injections, and Wolverine's ability to instinctively use his now unbreakable, factory fresh, beautifully shaped claws in scenarios that would have torn his arm off only minutes previously.The sequence up to and including the titles I quite liked, but it was a very steep downhill from there.",5,2,7,1 May 2009
Troy," I liked the big wooden horsie - not the wooden film
","Well, the horse was good. I liked the horse quite a lot. The designers must have spent quite a while designing that horse, with its nice abstract shape. Very pleasing in proportions, and a very effective made from scrap appearance.The rest of the film is equally wooden, unfortunately. The acting, script (oh dear god, the script), direction, quite a lot of the fight direction, even. Awful.I now have to pad this review for IMDb submission. The horse had nice multi-coloured panelling, and the removable sections from where the greeks emerged were cleverly disguised.",5,2,6,16 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Better than the first two, but still not magical
","Hindered again by a wooden lead, the Harry Potter films will never catch the spark that's in the books. Cuaron definitely makes a better fist of it than Chris Columbus, and the appearance of the film is good. All the other parts are played well, even Gary Oldman manages to restrain himself for once.The funniest thing for me was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and his bizarre choice of accent. He sounded like Dennis Taylor (the snooker player). I couldn't help but snigger.Overall, not a bad kid's (but not too young) film, I'd say. I didn't expect any more, and it didn't disappoint. 6.5/10 for me.",6,0,0,2 June 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Dreadful
","Anyone who knows me knows that I like cars. I can't wait for movies with cars. I even liked Swordfish better because it had a TVR in it. Not considering the 'car' scenes, this film was really awful. Add in the car scenes, and it was still awful. The cars were ludicrous Japanese painted whores of cars (primarily a Japanese market for this film, I guess), and the action wasn't filmed particularly well: there was nary a sense of speed anywhere.To the acting, plot, and dialogue. Perhaps Vin Diesel skipped some acting classes to go to the gym. He was certainly the most wooden actor I have seen for a while, which wouldn't have been so bad if he hadn't been the lynchpin of the movie. On second thoughts, I'm not even going to discuss the plot and dialogue.Rating 1/10 (for the 900hp Dodge)",Null,0,1,19 September 2001
X-Men: The Last Stand," Stick to partying, Mr Ratner, you're not a film-maker
","There are so many problems with this film, it's impossible to discuss without some spoilers, so I apologise for that. For a start, it's quite boring. I'm not sure how that's possible for an action movie running 104 minutes, but it is. The action scenes aren't terribly exciting, and quite a few of them are a step back or too similar to scenes from 1 or 2. Storm's and Wolverine's fights, for instance, seem all too familiar. Juggernaught running through walls? Wasn't that a Levi's ad? The big finale? Bit dull, really.Mmmm, Cyclops bumped off in the first 10 minutes? I don't remember that in the Dark Phoenix saga. This 'origin' of the Phoenix is slightly daft, too, and makes the name utterly nonsensical. Nor is there any of the evil from Phoenix. Her eyes go dark and her skin grey, but there seems to be little malice in what she does. There's some debris circulating around her, sure, but the deaths of people in this is more a kind of accident than deliberate. Where's the Dark Phoenix who went out and devoured a sun? Wolverine watches Xavier reduced to a flurry of ashes, and instead of taking off after Phoenix and the brotherhood of mutants, he falls to his knees by the Prof's wheelchair, 'consoled' by a sobbing Storm. It'd be funny if it wasn't so bad. Speaking of funny, Xavier's funeral. Oh dear lord who wrote this garbage? There were quite a few pointless wasted characters - Rogue and Angel particularly.I won't say that there weren't a couple of moments that captured some spark, but they were very few and far between, and mostly involved the utterly beautiful Famke Jannsen (I might be showing some bias, I don't know). Halle Berry was utterly wasted, again, Kelsey Grammar was a blue Frasier, really (what was with the 50's glove hands, they stood out a bit?). Everyone's dialogue was bad. The story was bad. The bit with the bridge? What was the point? Sorry about the crummy review, but this really was a crummy film.p.s. Weren't the x-men supposed to be a well trained bunch? Rogue was looking quite chunky to me. Apologies to Miss Paquin.",4,6,13,18 May 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The sum of the parts...
","...will hopefully be.. Err.. Hang on. How does that go?As a standalone film, this doesn't work for me. It's fairly entertaining, but goes nowhere. A revenge film, with huge amounts of death-dealing, but the whole tapestry is left unfinished and we've only seen a few threads. Hopefully when the second volume comes out, it will come together.Much as I can't stand Tarantino as a person (not that I've met him, I just imagine from the interviews I've seen that he's one of the most annoying people on the planet) I think he's a pretty good craftsman in this industry. He's certainly thrown a few good scenes in here. But there are a few things that are jarring, like the anime and the black and white.Another reviewer mentioned the sherrif's sunglasses as an example of Tarantino's depth. Every character is thought out in great detail. The way I see that is that Tarantino finds it impossible to be subtle. If it were a throwaway moment, fine, but it's right in our faces, and then for good measure the deputy is the sherrif's son. Why isn't he out looking for the Bandit?The cast was great and the soundtrack excellent, but I'll give this a 7 until I see the whole thing.",7,0,1,16 October 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Loses _everything_ in the translation
","Well, having enjoyed the books, I was looking forward to this. As usual, I was greatly disappointed.A terrific cast was wasted by plodding direction that instilled no wonder or excitement anywhere. The script seemed pretty faithful, sure, but maybe that was the problem. The Quidditch match stuck in my mind as being exceptionally dull. We lost all the interest and build up of the training, and the execution of the actual match was very uninvolving.The kids who played Ron and Hermione were excellent, but Daniel Radcliff displayed no discernable acting ability beyond dropping his jaw and widening his eyes. Perhaps this is Chris Columbus's fault. I'm sure the rest of it was.",4,0,1,20 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Looks great... Errr. That all there is.
","My vote history for Star Wars goes 9, 10, 8, 5, 5 (for IV V VI I II) and 3 for this utter travesty of a film. It looks beautiful. Almost everything, apart from some of the Clone Troopers looks solid, and real. Pity about the dialogue and script, acting and delivery, not a single word of which was remotely believable. The plot was OK. Much better than I and II.I can't understand how in this film (and to a slightly lesser extent the other two) the human aspect of it was made so badly. Surely people watching rough cuts, the filming, you name it, would have spotted just how awful it was going to be? Still, I guess the stills look great, and that must have been what was considered important.I'm looking forward to the Special Editions of these, where George Lucas redoes the rickety script with something (anything!) better, and CGIs in some acting.",3,3,6,26 May 2005
Vanilla Sky," interesting but patchy
","I haven't seen the original film of which this is a remake, but what the hell. Terrific opening scene of a empty Manhattan. Cruise, Diaz (and Kurt Russell) are well worth watching, but this is a film let down by a mediocre script, abysmal incidental musak (really, I though someone had left a 'phone on hold by the microphone _all_ the time), and unappealing performances by the rest of the cast.",Null,0,0,28 January 2002
Bruce Almighty," Trivial
","Although this made me laugh in quite a few places, it was ultimately very dissappointing. I think it just comes down to how utterly utterly shallow the script was. Perhaps it was a well-hidden message that people shouldn't be so shallow, I don't know. Then again, for God himself to knock the ideals of world peace and feeding the hungry as beauty pageant contestant cliches seemed a little harsh and unnecessary.",5,2,4,1 July 2003
Signs," A laid back Independence Day
","There were SIGNS that this was going to be good. Shyamalan's last few films (especially Unbreakable) were SIGNS that this would be good. Another SIGN that it would be good was the very creepy trailer. I began to notice some SIGNS that I might like to see it, like when I said to my friends, do you want to see this film? A SIGN that I was actually going to see it was when I was buying my ticket in the cinema lobby. After it started, I began to notice some SIGNS that it wasn't that good. The first half of the movie is pretty slow. Then the aliens start to appear (first rule of filmmaking, don't show the alien!!!!), which was a SIGN that it was pretty bad. The ridiculous denoument was another SIGN of a not very well thought out film. Perhaps I'm seeing too many SIGNS, but that appears to be common with respect to this movie.I do have to say that everyone acted well (the kids were terrific, and I don't think that often), the direction was slick (but possibly a little too laid back), but it was all let down by a very poor story. And the foundation of a good movie is a story.",6,0,1,18 September 2002
Sin City," Loved the comic - hated the movie
","But this was just the comic come to life - how could I love it and hate the movie? Well, it's life, Jim, and not as we know it. The ridiculous hard-boiled goes over well on paper, but as soon as someone starts to read it word for word, oh dear. Which brings me to my next point: this whole green-screen acting thing has got to go. The actors don't understand it, and can't work with it. The action wasn't all that good either. I always imagined Dwight with the athleticism of a cat. Rodriguez can't bring that to life. Nor can he and Rourke brink the enormous hulk that ought to be Marv to the screen convincingly. Just looked like an ordinary guy in a mask. Some of it looked good, some of it so-so.I'll stick with bringing it to life in my head.",5,2,4,9 June 2005
