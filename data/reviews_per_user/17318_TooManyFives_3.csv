Lucky Number Slevin," A clever, cool film with some really funny moments.
","I very much enjoyed this fun film. The characters are good and the actors playing them did well.I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and I think he is great as the boss, but I was even more impressed with Ben Kingsley's performance as the Rabbi. Josh Harnett's character 'Slevin' really amused me with his ability to say the wrong thing and rub people up the wrong way. His sarcastic manner really helped me to build up a fondness for a character that you don't get much back story with until later on in the film. Bruce Willis also does a good job and the character really suits him.Slanley Tucci plays the role of the cop Brikowski well, and I think he is always good in roles where you're not supposed to like him.I really enjoyed 'Sloe and Elvis', a very funny double act. It bugged me for a while because I knew I had seen the actor who played Sloe somewhere but couldn't work it out. He was Bubba in Forrest Gump (thanks IMDb) and plays someone just as clever in this film.I know some people that have said this film is predictable. I did not find this and wish I was clever enough to have found it so. I don't think the writer or director were trying to push any boundaries or trying to make an ultra cool Tarantino type film. I think they were just making a good watchable movie, and that's what it is. There are lots of people that will love this film and I can understand why it has such a high rating (7.8 while I'm writing this) and why lots of people would have given it 10/10.This is a funny, easy to enjoy film. Just let it happen and don't try to work it out in the first five minutes. Not an amazing or incredible film, but well worth watching.",7,0,0,1 June 2010
Schindler's List," One of the most important films ever made.
","I watched Schindler's List for the first time a couple of nights ago. I can't really put into words how great it was. At first I thought wow that's amazing and horrifying. I'm so glad I have now seen it and never want to watch it again...But it's still playing in my brain and I actually can see myself watching it again now quite easily. Not that it would be easy to watch, it could never be that. I cried and cried and was shaking with anger and fear and pure horror at it (especially scenes like the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto). But I can see myself wanting to see it because of just how brilliantly made it is.The performances were fantastic and not just the two leads of Liam Neeson as Schindler (I hadn't realised he was such a flawed protagonist and had built him into this thing of perfection in my head because without seeing the film and knowing the story i couldn't realise that to do what he did you needed to be sneaky as hell and have that edge to you) and Ralph Fiennes as the truly wicked and evil Amon Goeth. I keep on forgetting, and did so in the film too, that it was Ben Kingsley playing Schindler's 'clever accountant'. He was so good in the role that he disappeared into it.The score was brilliant too and also stayed hidden and didn't get in the way if the part it was playing in the film as a whole. (I loved reading this in the trivia of the film 'When Steven Spielberg first showed John Williams a cut of the film, Williams was so moved he had to take a walk outside for several minutes to collect himself. Upon his return, Williams told Spielberg he deserved a better composer. Spielberg replied, 'I know, but they're all dead.'')It can't not get a 10/10 from me. I will watch it again, and be utterly heartbroken again.",9,9,13,9 September 2015
To Kill a Mockingbird," I hope this film will change and inspire you.
","Wow, I know that's a silly word to start a review with but really, wow! I watched this film for the first time ever last week and I am still thinking about it. So powerful and moving. So beautiful and poetic. So gritty and real. So difficult to review... but I'll try.It's set in a bad time when most white people believed that black people were inferior beings. It demonstrates this beautifully without making it rule the film. It also shows how one man believed in fairness and equality on all levels, and how he managed to change the way others thought about this too, even if he couldn't change the minds of the jury.Gregory Peck is fantastic as Atticus. He is a true hero in my opinion, and as a 27 year old man who has just become a father for the first time he is a role model. It is very easy to almost go along with things you don't agree with in life just so as not to go against the majority. In work and other places we all come across people who opinions and values differ from our own and it is so easy to not agree with them, but to not disagree either. This film should teach you that standing up for what is right can never be wrong.This film has so many strong points and almost no weak ones. I occasionally noticed the young actors mouthing the lines so as to keep up/not get lost, but they did a brilliant job despite this and it did not take away from the film. My favourite scenes were when Scout calms down and almost disarms an angry mob by talking to an individual. This seems to embarrass the whole group who then leave. The other is when the whole upper tier of the court room stand and the reverend says to Scout 'Stand up. Your father's passing'. This scene is so powerful and moving, without being overdone and cheesy, which would have been so easy.There is an early appearance from Robert Duvall who's only in the film for a short while but his character is mentioned from the start.If you haven't already, please watch this film. It is a true great and deserves to be even higher up the top 250.",10,1,3,1 June 2010
