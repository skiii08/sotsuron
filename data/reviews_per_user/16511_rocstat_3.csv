Casablanca," Over-hyped & Over-rated
","After watching this film, the only thing I feel is dissapointment.The acting is superb, but when you watch the film, the only thing you can see is that this is a war propaganda film, trying to persuade mothers and wives to feel good about letting their sons/husbands go off to be killed for a 'noble' cause.The direction at times is too schmoltzy and the story is just too weak.Overall a fantastically made but pointless attempt at war propaganda.",5,5,17,19 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," If you want to watch the book, put it on a shelf
","Having read a number of the reviews by fans of the books, i am dismayed at some of the reactions to this work. It appears as though they were mainly interested in comparing this film to the book and not looking at this as part of a film trilogy.What they seem to forget is that Peter Jackson is a huge fan of Lord of the Rings. He has adapted the books and I have to believe that he has stayed faithful to his experiences of the book.One of the beauties of novels is that they allow you to create your own landscape and vision of the characters. I have known of two people reading and loving the same book, but when they discuss it, they have what seem like completely different ideas of what the book was really about.All I am trying to say is that this is Peter Jackson's vision of the books and I am sure the changes he made were forced upon him through the difficulty of trying to adapt a complex novel into a film.When it comes down to it, a film is mainly the directors vision of the action, whereas a book allows us to create our own experiences.I will only suggest that no adaptation which was made to pander to the experiences of the reader has ever made a good movie. The point of adapting a book into a film is to share your experiences of the book with others, not to collect their experiences up put them all together and release them back to the people that gave them.Oh, I thought the film suffered through the limitations of the story which will end up creating a ten hour masterpiece but judging it on its own means that it will suffer9/10 (in anticipation)If you got this far, thank you and sorry for the rant.",7,0,0,21 December 2002
Am√©lie," Smile, and the whole world smiles with you
","Jeunet has achieved what should be the ultimate goal of any film-maker. He has made a film that has made the world a better place just through it's existence.If only so many americans/english did not have prejudices about foreign and subtitled films. You can't help but think life would be just that little more bearable if they would just get up and watch a film instead of deciding they don't like this type of film or that type of film.This film does not have gritty realism or heartbreaking romance, it just wins you over with its pure charm.I cannot implore you enough to go and see this film. If only so that you can see that more good films come from Europe and Japan than you could really believe.In conclusion, I challenge anyone to watch this film without grinning in pure joy by the end.",10,0,1,27 August 2002
