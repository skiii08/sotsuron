Iron Man 3," Great movie and probably the best of Iron man
",The plot is awesome and we'll thought out. Continuations of stories are always great. I got only one major complaint about all Iron man movies and that is the hyping of Paris or european nationa. A lot of German automobile commercials by showing audi or reflecting how great France is supposed to be but if you need beaches and stuff you can Florida or some other places. For an American production I would like to see American automobiles to be hyped like Chrysler or Tesla. This is the main concern why I am not enjoying iron man as much,8,0,1,17 April 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Awesome and truly appreciated movie
","First off I used to be the person who watched movies like Braveheart or Goodfellas and never was into Marvel's except Wolverine and Spider-Man. However, I gave it a chance and do not regret it at all. I really enjoy Marvel's now. I always liked Captain America and really enjoyed the first avenger even more than any single super hero like Ironman, Hulk or Thor. The return of the first avenger is even better but this Civil War is great and I really enjoy it. However, it is slightly less as enjoyable to me than the other two captain america movies. The reason more due to Ironman and the producers Kevin Feige who seems to have an affinity with Germany and Europe. He implements a lot of unnecessary and ridiculous commercials for Audi a German automobile manufacturer and for Europe itself. Ironman tells Spider-Man how great Germany is or he would enjoy Paris. Well, Ironman is supposed to be an American super hero and Marvel's are American productions so why not implement Chrysler or something like that to foster American automobile manufacturers. European dislike America and I was born and raised in Germany so I know that besides the beer and a little vacation Germany sucks. So does Paris who is more an Arabic style city than anything else. Kevin Feige is trying to implement this multinational diversity perspective that America is not as good but others are. Germany even had to scrap the name captain america of the title so people would go to the theater. After bad revenue and critics of the captain america the first avenger they realized that they need to change the title to the return of the avenger- winter soldier and civil war. So why are they hyping Europe? This is my only critic which keeps getting annoying. Other than that awesome flick",9,0,2,13 April 2020
