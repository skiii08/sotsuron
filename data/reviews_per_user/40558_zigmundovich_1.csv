Child 44," Awful lying movie
","I think Tom Hardy got a huge remuneration for playing in this sh*t. I am disappointed in my favorite actor. There is no historical accuracy in this movie, just only disgusting unrealistic characters and the stale clich√© about Russia. People who wrote this 'intellectual' book and created this movie, have you ever held the handbook of history in your hands? Moreover, have you ever opened it? People who wrote the comments about the insufficient promotion, are you in your mind? This B-movie should not be promoted at all and should be distributed on DVD only. People who are going to watch this chef d'oeuvre, if you have 2 hours of time, please, spend them with your beloved, children or at least a good book.",1,71,172,15 April 2015
