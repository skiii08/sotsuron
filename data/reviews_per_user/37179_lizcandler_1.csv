Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Slow and pointless
","This is the worst film i have seen in a long time. Although it's only about an hour and half long it felt like 3. There is no real story, it's something to do with finding a bomber and stopping a war but i'm still not sure. Many of the characters are unnesccesary as are many of the locations.It is one of those films where after a while you can't actually remember what the crime was that they are investigating. I actually fell asleep for a while and it didn't detract from the story. You know it is a bad film when the people on both sides asked us if we knew what the story was about at the end of the film.",1,25,50,21 December 2011
