Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Where's Harrison Ford?
","The effects are spectacular, the costumes and makeup fabulous, and the computer work is better than anything I've seen, but the characters could have been cut from cardboard.  It needs some three-dimensional characters like Hans Solo in the other episodes.  It would be good, too, if there was a little suspense.  From the very first, every thing that happened was far too easy to predict.",8,0,1,19 May 1999
