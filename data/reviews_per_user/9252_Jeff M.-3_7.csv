United 93," Powerful
","Roger Ebert said in his review that this 'is not a film that knows any time has passed since (Sept. 11).' That gives the movie more gravity because it doesn't know what will happen next, and makes the situation that much more immediate.'Powerful' is a good way to describe this movie. There are a lot of emotions involved, and little character development, but we don't need to know the backgrounds of the people on the plane. They found themselves in a horrible situation and did their best to find a way through it.The camera work adds to the realism of the movie, but can be distracting at times.For those who say it is too soon, that may be just the reason this movie is needed - so we don't forget. If/Since the networks don't want to show Sept. 11 anymore, someone else has to step up and make us remember. Director Paul Greengrass and the cast of this movie do that.",10,7,14,1 May 2006
Finding Nemo," Not Pixar's best
","For once I find myself in a minority.  For once, I was expectingmore.  For once, I am undecided about getting the DVD of a Pixarfilm.Description of characters and plot points are plentiful in otherreviews, so I'll cut to the chase:The general idea was good, execution was decent, but too muchwent wrong.  Dory and her lack of short-term memory (how doesshe remember she has that problem?) were more annoying thanendearing.  Jar-Jar Binks provided more comic relief.  I had morefun with the tank residents speaking dentistry-ese with the pelican.I never quite 'got' Nemo's disability (if indeed there wassomething to 'get').  The only purpose I saw in it was to give Marlinan extra excuse for being overprotective - what, having your wifeand all your other children killed isn't enough? - and to give Nemoa kinship with Gill.  I am not acquainted with Albert Brooks enoughto compare his fish character with humans he played. But to be thecharacter that Marlin is, given that they are very small fish and thereare very big things out there with very pointy teeth I can't blame himtoo much.  (Then again, overprotective parents have been aroundforever as movie devices.)  Willem Dafoe did an excellent job asGill.I expected to see more of the sharks, especially given the line ashark says in the trailer that he doesn't in the movie.  I wanted tosee more of the sharks, lots more.  But I did like that whole chasesequence sparked by the whiff of blood.And after all those scenes with the turtles, sounding like they werestraight out of the late '80s/early '90s, I was extremely disappointedto not hear a 'Cowabunga!' or even a slight 'Teenage Mutant NinjaTurtles' reference.  (Four young turtles could've had eyes in thefour TMNT colors, for example.)  Pixar never seems to miss a shotat a movie reference, this one fell in their lap, and the pun wasignored.  The other movie references that were included,especially 'Psycho' and 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' weregreat, and I did get a kick out of the shark being named 'Bruce' (cf.'Jaws').Finally, the seagulls were absolutely hilarious. I wish there hadbeen a way to give them more screen time, because those sceneswere of the Pixar we know and love.The animation and supporting characters carry this movie morethan the plot, and I'm disappointed that Pixar spent so much timeon the former while seeming to have problems with the latter.6/10: It's not necessarily 'Swim away! Swim away!' but not 'I've gotto find Nemo!' either.PS: I recently read a newspaper article that was half-devoted topointing out that 'Nemo' was the name of the captain in '20,000Leagues Under the Sea.'  If this needs to be pointedly discussed,something's not quite right with the world.",Null,0,0,22 June 2003
Cast Away," I don't get it (the wings, I mean)
","Spoiler alert, just in case.I think I may have missed something in the way of symbolism for the ending, but then again, I see a lot of other people who liked it wonder about the ending too.Misc. Thoughts: First, we start out with about a two-minute commercial for FedEx.  Not bad in and of itself, since apparently it eventually has something to do with the plot.  And I may have missed it (Dad said it was there), but I would have appreciated a line with when we were supposed to be - for example, 'December 18, 1995' or along those lines.  You only realize that the beginning isn't the present day when you see the older CNN logo and the dead crewman's 'gravestone' end with 1995.  Seeing Chuck and Kelly at the end sparked more emotion than I've had for a movie in a long time. Also, Silvestri is great (he did Back to the Future, after all), but how does music in a small fraction of a 2:15 movie amount to an Oscar nomination?  I'm confused.  Finally: That 2:15 did fly by.  I could not get myself to leave the theater.What I did not understand was the whole wings thing.  So this lady in Texas makes a LOT of sculptures with this design.  Point?  When Chuck first picked up the package, I thought the wings meant 'rush delivery' or 'overnight air' or something, a FedEx mark of some sort. When he didn't open it, I wondered 'What is significant about this package?'  He had no qualms about a 'Dissolution of Marriage' paper.  Holding on to that package, to me, made absolutely no sense.  Why did this have to be delivered?  What was so sacred?  What about it made him paint that design on his sail?  _Why did it save his life???_  I'm sure I'm missing something, but I certainly am unsure of what.7.5/10 because the ending, specifically the last five minutes, sucked, and I'd like an explanation about the wings.  Too many unanswered questions and ambiguities.  I don't get it.  I just don't get it.",7,0,0,18 March 2001
Spider-Man," Exciting, well-put-together story almost cheese-free
","I haven't had any contact with Spider-Man since the newspaper canceled the comic strip in 1993, so I went into this without many if any preconceived notions.The credits at the beginning are a little long, but when it starts into the story it starts right away.  The first thing that happens is the trip to the lab.As Spider-Man first develops his senses, he seems to get a handle on them a bit faster than you might expect, leaping from roof to roof the next day.  Perhaps it's a little too effortless, but you get the idea that he is trying out his new powers (and it takes him a bit to master the web thing).His costume in the wrestling ring is hilarious, although you later wonder just how it goes from sweatpants to Spandex.  The filmmakers tie the wrestling story nicely in with Uncle Ben's death, as the robber Peter lets go past him at the arena kills Ben in a carjacking.After Osborn becomes the Green Goblin, the internal conflicts of personality are portrayed very well.Spider-Man's fight to become a hero is attacked by the editor of the Bugle and others in the city, and the headlines certainly help show that.  Peter Parker does a great job of taking pictures of Spider- Man, if you know what I mean.The city scene at the end with Spider-Man swinging between the taxis to the skyscrapers seems like a bit of SFX ego-building, but it also helps show that Spider-Man is here to stay.  If you watch fast enough, the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are still in the background. (Note: A mention of 'the bombing' in an earlier scene is NOT a reference to Sept. 11, but to the Green Goblin's first attack on Quest Aerospace.)The character of Peter Parker himself is a wonderful Everyman, full of human emotions, and Tobey Maguire is cast well. Kirsten Dunst is a good MJ, and that first kiss is one to linger over.  In a slight twist at the end, MJ is confessing to Peter her feelings, and he sort of brushes her off, because it's part of his curse that those he loves are in danger.  But the comic books tell us how that turns out.  Willem Dafoe is at his best when holding dialogue with himself, in the Jeckyll/Hyde good/evil scenes 'with' the Green Goblin.It's alternately a movie to sit back and think, and sit back and enjoy the action.  With great power comes great responsibility; use your power to enjoy this movie wisely. 8 1/2, maybe 9/10.",9,0,1,3 May 2002
Shrek 2," Throw up the spoofs and hope they stick
","'Shrek 2' often tries to follow the pattern of movie spoofs designed as spoofs, and this doesn't necessarily mean following its own predecessor. There aren't many scenes without a foreground or background reference to either movies or pop culture. Be assured that even if you're trying to look while following the movie, you won't get them all.At times I think the DreamWorks crew looked at a scene and thought 'What can we add in here to spoof and/or skewer something else?' Thus a couple of blatant references to Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' (two of the elves get changed into a clock and a candelabra, a shot even more pointed than the dancing furniture) and somewhat gentler pokes at everything else from Garfield to 'Lord of the Rings' to Love Potion Number Nine.This spoof-shoehorning can be overwhelming at times, and sometimes it seemed the movie would have flowed better if we could just sit back and watch the main characters do what the plot wants them to do. The songs are more forced in this one too as DreamWorks tried to walk the line between the old Disney formula and Shrek's spoof-o-matic. (Disney itself has not followed the formula for about a decade, ever since the villain stopped getting his own song, but I digress.) The one song that did work was 'Hero' near the end, which I enjoyed despite the slightly formulaic nature of the sequence (hero defeats obstacles, meets villain, final confrontation).As for the other aspects of the movie, there are reasons this film got a PG in relation to the target audience of children. Edgier, however, does not necessarily mean 'hipper' or 'more entertaining'.I give 'Shrek 2' a 7.5, in part against the overwhelming advertising but more because a 9 would have come without the overwhelming satire attempts. I did enjoy Puss, who stole the few scenes he was in. I wish Julie Andrews' character had more, but then we'd miss the payoff of the king's botched deal with the Fairy Godmother. Besides, how many other times can you get John Cleese and Eddie Murphy in the same movie? (That makes me wonder how such a spoof-laden medieval movie with John Cleese can get away without a single obvious reference to 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', but the table was most likely already full.)",7,0,0,24 May 2004
Titanic," One of the Best Ever
","**Standard covering spoiler warning, just in case.** Like many other films I have seen and then read the IMDb comments for, many seem to either love it or hate it, although in this film the extremes are not as vivid.  I happen to, for this movie, fit in the former category.  I saw it five times in theaters, most with excellent theater sound and picture quality, but if you want to really see it, you have to have seen it in all its glory on an IMAX screen with the surround sound (Branson, MO, Aug. 1998).  THAT was a cinematic experience.I have been interested in the Titanic story since 1994, and I never tire of learning or talking about it.  I more or less fell over myself (and my parents) to get to it in its first ten days.  On December 27, 1997, I was not disappointed.The CG work with the ship is spectacular, especially the flyby with the water and the smoke.  That takes a lot of work, and it was pulled off nicely.  Not to be outdone by that, the CG work in the sinking phase of the movie was great too.  Give the hand to Digital Domain.  Especially that guy that hits the propeller.  Another big hand goes to the art and set departments.  Can other historical movies claim to order the same carpet and lifeboat davits as those of the original?  Lots of little things add up, although there were as many equally little things that were missed.  This movie certainly has the biggest goofs page I've seen, but more on that later.As a male, I certainly am not one of those who went to see it for Leo and/or any part of a love story.  However, it does provide an effective vehicle (however flawed you wish to claim it) for connecting the present to the past and showing all aspects of the ship.  The love story is not the central issue.  The story of the ship and the hope, glory, and tragedy in it is what you're looking for.  The story serves to get you from first class to third, from the forepeak (although passengers didn't go there) to the stern, and the boiler rooms to the bridge.  As far as DiCaprio and Winslet themselves, well, I don't have enough acting 'experience' to be declarative on that.The interplay with the historical figures is done well, for the most part. Some of us more than others may know exactly who is being discussed or referred to with their historical context, e.g. Colonel Gracie with the women he was helping when Rose and Jack come out of the Second Class stairs. Getting to know Mr. Andrews was a good thing to put in.  Of course, you have to realize that the cast of characters during the dinner scene, although all real people except for Rose, Ruth, Jack, and Cal, would most likely never have dined together.  However, it does serve the purpose of putting the fictional characters in with history.This film is not without its errors.  I mean, check out the goofs page. Many are your run-of-the-mill continuity errors, but others are legitimate factual errors that, despite the best efforts of Cameron and crew, happen. A film based on a true story with photographic and witness records, not to mention a couple volumes of Senate testimony, will do that. Those who are not at least moderate scholars won't catch most of them.Goofs particularly grating to this buff are Astor at the Grand Staircase at 2:15 (he was crushed by the funnel), Molly Brown being called Molly before the sinking, the inordinate amount of women on Collapsible A (there was one, Rosa Abbott), and the Brown/Hitchens standoff, which Brown actually won and did get the women to row.  On a side note to that, though, you will notice in Boat 6 both Frederick Fleet and only one first-class man, who was ordered into it because he was a yachtsman and they only had one seaman on board. That's a historical detail not lost on me.The soundtrack is worth every note played on it.  I think the movie as a whole earned every Oscar it got, and/but was rightfully denied the ones it did not.  The fifteen minutes that begin when the band finishes playing are, in my opinion, one of the (if not THE) best fifteen-minute sequences in movie history.  (But some may not say that doesn't mean much because there are a lot better five-minute sequences out there.  To each his or her own.) Anyone wondering why this movie didn't hit the AFI 100, by the way, it's because voting was cut off at movies made in 1996 and earlier.  Obviously a December 1997 release doesn't make the cut.If you want to see some of the more-known deleted scenes and some of the not-known deleted scenes, and would like to know more about the ship in general, I recommend James Cameron's Titanic Explorer CD.  If you are interested in the ship's story as a whole, this is a valuable addition, and movie clips interspersed throughout make it that much more real.Looking at the rankings, you can see that it's tops (10-35%), it's great or good (8/9-25%), or it's not worth the 3:10 of celluloid it's printed on (1-11%).  AS I said earlier, to each his own.  I loved it, and it earns its ten.  For the naysayers, well, I also love The Matrix, and according to some of the reviews I read I'm a mindless hack for that too.",10,1,2,11 April 2001
The Breakfast Club," Uh, so where's the 'great movie'?
","If a spoiler is defined as how the characters make out in the end, there is probably one or two here.Now, I was flipping between a few things when I saw this on TV so I didn't see every minute of it, but I can describe my reaction in two words: Thoroughly unimpressed.I just didn't like the direction the story was going, almost from the get-go. Why, at 17 minutes in, would any of them have any reason to cover for the guy who took the screw out of the door? It went more or less downhill from there, and just when I thought it was about to redeem itself and become this 'great' movie everyone who was a teen in the '80s says it is, it didn't.Bender is the type of student that would torture me in high school, if such a stereotype had actually existed, and to that degree. My high school self would have wanted to alternately try to beat him up (and fail spectacularly) or go tell the supervisor what was going on. He comes falling through the ceiling? Yeah, sure, like I'm going to cover for that.The movie revisits, or perhaps imposes for the first time, the 'values' that supposedly everyone has in high school, meaning none. Look down on virginity, smoke pot, and swear enough to turn March air in Illinois even bluer. Oh, and you can find a guy/girl by getting a total makeover and/or being one of the chicks who dig bad boys.Anthony Michael Hall's character was alternately overexploited (is that redundant?) and underused. OK, so maybe a flare gun was all he had access to, not an unreasonable position for 20 years ago. But the revelation of that during the conversation pretty much ruined whatever the movie had going for it at that point. Then he willingly writes 'the essay' for the group? Mm-hm. And on top of that, they expect me to believe that the nerd can dance. If you think about it, his situation is one of the most dated parts of the movie, since today he would probably have been shuttled off to a psychiatrist, put on Prozac, reported to the police, or all of the above. (The 'underused' part comes from the gymnastics one must do in the script to get a nerd in detention in the first place, which is where the flare gun came in, and then there's the problem of what to do with him after that.)I'm not dismissing the possibility that I just don't 'get it' for generational reasons, as high school came 15 years later for me. I'm also not dismissing the possibility that I don't 'get it' because perhaps my experience and angst aren't like most people's experiences and angsts, or because being in a small high school doesn't lend itself to as deep divisions in the student body. (And Saturday detentions aren't part of the discipline.)If anything, this movie has confirmed two things: I am most emphatically not a member of Generation X, and I should've know I probably wouldn't like this movie given my loathing of that other alleged symbol of teen angst, 'Catcher in the Rye.'",3,10,21,16 January 2005
