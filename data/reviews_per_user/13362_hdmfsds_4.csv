Your Name.," Your Name Remade And Set In USA Is For Losers
","This (the original) however is pretty damn good.In the hands of Japanese illustrators and animators Kimi No Na Wa is a great film and not just great animation. As it is, it's a good film for both teens and adults and that's certainly no small achievement.",9,30,34,12 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Hi JJ Abrams And Kathleen Kennedy
","Thanks for your input and all the upvotes here.Now back to reality and a review for us viewers and Star Wars fans:The film is bad, as bad as the rest of the trilogy that was wholly unneeded and attempted to reboot the whole thing for Disney's kiddie demographic via copying what Lucas had done albeit with weak actors and actresses, no character development and cheap directing.Face it: the dark side won.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Fun Period Piece
","As much as the characters were interesting and the references to actual events were intriguing I suspect this film skews to an older demographic that has an inkling about the Hollywood of the time and how society, language and fashion sense was.Margot's legs are definitely hot and she needs to show more skin more often.The dog is a star and needs to win a prize.",9,106,151,12 January 2020
