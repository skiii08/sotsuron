Come and See," A film I've seen only twice but...
",It is truly the most engrossing film one could see from the start. I will have to see it again and that is one reason for its greatness. It's a long time since I've seen it but I know I must. The feeling I remember from it and I did make sure I remembered the title was one of being in the presence of a work of greatness and a classic that I recommend time and again to all those who are serious about film as an art form. This film can and should take its place in the pantheon and it is a shame that not enough people know about it. Even people who are not fans of 'World Cinema' will find it moving and engrossing. Please see it and recommend it. It deserves the publicity and the humanity it can engender.,10,5,8,14 August 2006
