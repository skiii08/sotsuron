Deja Vu," Denzel's Doppelganger
","An interesting premise - a special task-force is equipped with a cutting edge technology enabling users to look into the past. They do not bother to go further in providing elaborate explanations of how exactly this stuff works but we got to understand that the remote sensing technologies they use have certain limitations providing insight into only particular time span (4 days backward), which cannot be fine tuned. It looked like they somehow miraculously have been deriving satellite 'ghost' imagery which is 4 days old.Initially I was thinking it might be due to some abysmal hard disk storage, which is capable of saving myriads of data from RS satellites in near real-time and these file archives could be accessed to furnish information on any area of surveillance which is only 4 days old and they can manipulate and interpret information shot from different angles of observation that could be rendered into free rotating 3D imagery. And my assumptions have been shattered when I figured out that they can also pierce through the walls.There was a really gripping sequence when Washington is blind chasing the 'delayed vision' of terrorist's car racing across the highway.I wish they could stop pushing an envelope beyond those already immense technological capabilities. Sadly they went further experimenting with time travel aspects and have thrown the protagonist to the past, exactly where all the confusion began.I don't want to ruin expectations of the audience that haven't seen the film yet and to disclose further intricacies of the plot. But I wonder what could have happened if Washington eventually managed to find his way to the surface out from the submerged car.Guess whom he was supposed to meet at the berth beside the salvaged girl?",6,3,5,21 May 2007
Dawn of the Dead," Zombies would have enjoyed this one
","Possible spoilers alert!It looks like the army of ardent fans of the critically acclaimed zombie sensation from the first-time director Zack Snyder has been propagating to proportions commensurable with the scale of plague that evoked legions of the undead in the movie.At least the voting history statistics for the 2004 version is nearly to catch up with the one for the George Romero's classic in the course of 6 years since 1998 (i.e. from the time the first comment on 1978 movie has been posted).If I may consider myself a devoted fan of the horror genre, I can't say I'm a zombie film buff, considering sensitive nature of life and death issue, which is normally provided with a kind of cynical treatment in such movies. However judgment on moral aspects should be tossed away, once we can afford watching that sort of stuff.Unlike Savini's earlier (good but per se frame-by-frame) remake of the Night of the Living Dead, this one in comparison with the original definitely has agenda and style of its own.Except for the shopping mall as the main set of the film the new Dawn is totally different (neither better nor worse): more characters (both dead and alive), wilder action, more realistic and graphic violence (even disabled stunts were employed in the movie), more gory mayhem, more sinister black humor (I wonder if Reynolds admits the alleged distant likeness to the handsome mustached folk in the crowd?).Of course striking visual style and great fx are its primary merits. But I can hardly uphold the opinions accusing the creators in lack of characterization and personality development.Of course the emotional experience of the leads that found themselves in a situation like that, loss of relatives and dramatic change in usual way of life are concealed behind the opaque veil but it is reasonable compromise for the sake of frantic momentum.Sarah Polley (together with her stunt doubles) has demonstrated more than decent performance.Terse and tough as a cliff Rhames is always fun to watch.Kelly' CJ was simply awesome, while Burrell as a bit zany Steve is a standout.Two scenes, one with CJ heroically sacrificing his life to save the rest of the gang, and the other depicting Michael's utterly respectable retreat in the end, nearly made me cry.Note cameos from those behind the original Dawn (Tom Savini, Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) as well as brief appearance of the director himself (shooting towards the audience with an automatic rifle during opening titles).Now I may say that I know a true definition to a word 'thrilling': I felt my guts shriveled, my lower jaw dangled and my eyes pinned to the screen from the terrific 5th minute take-off until the final flash of the closing credits.Despite worn out topic the movie has to deal with, it is surprisingly refreshing and truly riveting even if considered to be more action than horror. A definitive roller-coaster ride from start to finish and a rarely good nasty little hell of a pure entertainment.I dare to assume (contrary to some prevailing views): The die-hard fans of the Romero's masterpiece shouldn't be disappointed.Just a parting thought - it was always a mystery to me: if they are so dumb (zombies, not fans) how do they tell the living from the dead and why don't they gnaw each other as much easier food?",8,0,0,5 October 2004
Hostel," A Lesson of Geography
","Dear fellow Slovaks that feel offended with allegedly revolting image of their beloved native country portrayed in the movie could have calmed down. I dare to refer to some of the postings at Hostel discussion boards.SOME SPOILERS: What a delight to find out that those sophisticated entertainment for wealthy foreigners comes from nowhere else than homeland of ballet, vodka, caviar and Kalashnikov! Just have a brief look at the e-mail address at the 'Elite Hunting' card. (Incidentally, my favorite Sony Wega that vividly and truthfully reproduced the colors of this movie was made in Slovakia.)Everything has it's price. Perhaps Russians are the easiest prey in that neck of the woods, while Americans are hard to find, if American meat is five times as much expensive as that of the Russian - it's a market economy... Or, maybe, Russians are simply more primitive. And the excitement of torturing and killing a Russian for mere five grands is nothing compared to the sky high pleasure of dismembering a more complex live organism. It would be ridiculous if Russians would feel somehow abused and may protest against the inadequate price-list.The chick that lured the boys into the trap, Natalya, is Russian. Her blond girlfriend Svetlana is Czech. Besides, no one would judge the entire country by a couple of hookers. The bad guys are Dutch, German and American. Oh, I've just forgotten hideous Takashi Miike (nice cameo!). Contrary to them the majority of the locals look friendly and intelligent. I guess maybe the bunch of zombie-like kids that kill for a chewing gum is something slightly over the top - but anyway they did a good job in one of the final sequences.The rotten renegade cops that law-abiding individuals must be afraid of are abound elsewhere in the world - otherwise internal investigation officers could have got the hook.Most of the cars exhibited in Hostel are good old Russian Volgas. I understand that the country is now flooded with major European brands of vehicles, and vintage Russian make in a reformed East European economy may look something extraneous and ancient. But at least this is a part of the Soviet legacy that should hardly be embarrassed of. The movie is shot on location in neighboring Czech Republic (frankly I found most of the scenery to be quite beautiful and not appalling at all, irrespective of either it stands for the particular country or not).I believe there's absolutely none of country specific features reproduced in the film that could have shattered respectable image of Slovakia, especially considering that this is just a movie. Moreover the film-goers shouldn't expect that foreign filmmakers could do a feature about their country better than their local producers.As to the film itself, unfortunately, the concept about a kind of human safari wasn't extremely original as the producers claim. At least I found Roth's earlier effort, Cabin Fever, to be more chilling, effective and surprising.",5,0,0,16 March 2006
Wanted," When style is a way above substance
","Timur Bekmambetov is a remarkable director distinguished with recognizable and fascinating visual style. Yet before his 'Dozor' series and a small number of earlier feature films he came to prominence with highly artistic and memorable commercials for the Imperial Bank in early nineties (sadly, the bank has later gone bust and those cool adverts were no longer aired).With his latest big budget thrill-ride starring Morgan Freeman, James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie he has once again demonstrated his outstanding directorial skills and infinite power of imagination. The film is packed with inventive gimmicks, plenty of complex visual effects and no nonsense stunning action scenes that may take one's breath away, especially when watched on a big screen.I liked the filmmakers' approach towards localization of the movie. In a dubbed Russian version adapted for the Russian-speaking audience, some of the essential textual information in Russian (like amazing ATM touchscreen messages, guidances spotted on supermarket posters, and even the obscene inscription shaped out of the disintegrated keyboard) were seamlessly woven into the canvas of the film (no puns intended). I wonder why they decided not to replace web interface returning 'no hits' search results with Russian version as well.Ironically, contrary to the movie, web search engines suggest truck loads of links for 'Wesley Gibson'; the majority however are pertinent to the protagonist of the movie.The film also delivers one big and interesting message: many people may live their lives unaware of their true mission on earth and often overlook a chance to expand their real capabilities.Unfortunately, the stellar cast, exceptional camera-work and visual fx extravaganza are practically the only assets of the film, whereas the plot itself, in my opinion, is reduced to zilch, lest to say is pure nonsense even in terms of comic book based movie.The very idea of an ancient knitting loom prompting for the targets of assassination seems somewhat ludicrous.Granted they have cracked those damn binary codes and decrypted certain names. But how on earth did they guess that those people are supposed to die but not to be awarded with Nobel Prize or something? And going all out just to obey stupid orders from an Oracle disguised as a pile of junk, I'm sorry - this is something preposterous.Those people entertain themselves by engaging in killing spree just to bury the fact that their own names are compromised? Who else cares about this tricky arithmetics? I know this question sounds kinda silly and inappropriate in the context of such type of even more serious action flicks, but I always can't help wondering why the municipal authorities and the police seem to be so unaffected with all this bloody carnage on the streets?All-in-all watchable and gripping at times owing to outlandish, if over-the-top, action sequences, but the storyline is too thin to be fully enjoyable.",7,0,2,13 August 2008
