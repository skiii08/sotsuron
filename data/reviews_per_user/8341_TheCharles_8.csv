Scarface," Journey Of A King
","After only 20 minutes I realized it was love on first sight. Tony Montana takes you on a thrilling ride to the top, making a name for himself in business, in a very fashionable way. Besides the obvious action I was charmed by its many memorable quotes and also laughed more than I would have expected.The movie aged very well and even works as the authentic feel only enhanced the movie. I suppose you could compare Scarface, like many other classics, to a fine wine. I'm wondering how annoyed the people, who I live with, will be when I'm going to keep quoting Scarface for the entire week. The only bad part is that it only lasted 3 hours. That's when we had to say goodbye to the bad guy.",10,1,2,16 February 2016
The Thing," Don't trust anyone
","Childs: 'I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit.'Palmer:'Childs, happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it, right, Mac?' John Carpenter's The Thing really is something else and I can't even imagine how impressed I would've been if I was there to watch it when it came out. There's a reason why The Thing is praised by many critics and considered to be one of the best Horror movies ever. It's visually repulsive, in a good way, thanks to the isolated setting in Antarctica, fantastic make-up and practical effects. In fact, this may be my favourite Horror movie ever based on practical effects. Personally, I prefer practical effects over CGI. A good combination of both works as well. The Thing remains complete as both a Horror and Sci-Fi movie.Besides being eye candy, the paranoia caused between the researchers is something well executed. It's by no means deeply layered or complex. In fact, it's rather straightforward but just like the researchers you try to focus and pay attention to all the little details as you're trying to figure things out for yourself. Each scene made me wonder: 'What would I do in this situation', which is something I happen to like. It's safe to say that there were no holds barred when it came to imagination. To top it all off, you have Kurt Russell, which takes a sip of his bottle of J&B every couple of minutes, and some cheesy but acceptable dialogue. The Thing will forever remain an iconic piece of work, no matter how much the movie industry transforms.",9,3,7,29 February 2016
The Orphanage," Gloomy Yet Beautiful
","Once again I've fallen in love with a Spanish Horror movie. Directed by Juan A. Bayona and produced by Guillermo Del Toro, The Orphanage impresses with its cold and gloomy atmosphere. Despite the fact there are ghosts included, the movie doesn't rely on cheap jump scares but rather on its touching story and dark elements. Beautiful cinematography and a plot twist are only a few of many positives. A strong lead performance made me genuine feel for the the characters. The Orphanage is a prime example of less being more. Without a doubt a modern Horror classic. I would even recommend this movie to people who aren't that fond of the genre.",7,1,3,22 February 2016
The Shining," Where's Johnny?
","The Shining is not exactly you happy family flick. It's a timeless classic that easily holds up with today's Thriller/ Horror genre. In fact, I believe it may be one of the best Psychological Horror movies up to this day. Living in an empty hotel on an isolated location sounds quite unsettling but it's Jack's Nicholson stellar performance as Jack Torrance that made this movie in my opinion. The overacting, memorable dialogue, and unnerving ambient sounds only enhanced the film adaptation of Stephen King's sinister novel. Unlike the child or Jack, I felt as if the wife lacked some personality. Her character seemed a bit flat. The ending was a bit anti-climatic but nothing that made me enjoy this movie any less. Definitely a must-see movie for the lovers of the Thriller and/or Horror genre.",9,2,4,22 February 2016
Apocalypse Now," Embrace The Chaos
","I was expecting Apocalypse Now to be a movie mainly based on action and explosions but I couldn't be more wrong. The movie is far more than just that. You'll feel your heart pounding as you travel with Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) and his team through the jungles of Vietnam. The further they travel, the more they and the people they encounter become distant from humanity as they seem to embrace the chaos.Technically, visually outstanding and enhanced by a perfectly fitting soundtrack. With an amazing cast and artistic choices by Francis Ford Coppola, Apocalypse Now became a masterpiece and remains in my honest opinion one of the best picture movies ever made.",10,0,1,16 February 2016
It Follows," Refreshing & Scary
","This movie felt like a Final Destination plot directed like a 70's/80's horror(,which is awesome). Despite not being fully convinced by the plot/story and the slow pace towards the end, it felt very refreshing compared to today's Horror genre.The biggest reason I rate this movie so highly is for their unique approach.It Follows succeeds in creating a certain suspense by the smart use and choice of sound. I felt like the second half was a bit rushed and perhaps too linear but I was pleasantly surprised by the style. Nothing that will keep me up at night but highly recommended for all Horror fanatics.",8,3,5,16 February 2016
Carrie," Puberty can be rough
","One of the best things about Carrie, is that the makers successfully create empathy and sympathy for their main character. I don't think I have to point out that it makes a movie so much more enjoyable. It's something that lacks in today's Horror movies. Carrie White is brought to life by Sissy Spacek's outstanding performance, who I believe was the perfect pick for this role. The pace is quite slow and there's not too much going on for the most part. The plot consists of a slow build-up which builds towards a climactic scene. I won't spoil anything but it's easily one of the most amazing scenes I've seen on screen. The portrayal of high school cruelty combined with telekinetic powers is simply a recipe for disaster.Being a fan of his other work like Scarface and The Untouchables, I was pleasantly surprised as De Palma's name appeared in the opening credits. The fact that I could expect unfiltered graphic violence was a good way to start the movie. He even made fantastic use of split- screen techniques, which I'm not really a fan of in most cases. Neither did I expect John Travolta, which was pretty funny. Carrie, based on Stephen King's novel, feels authentic yet refreshing at the same time. I guess puberty is rough for some teens..",9,2,3,2 March 2016
Rear Window," i spy with my little eye..
","You just can't resist watching Hitchcock's Rear Window, just as L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) can't resist the urge of peeking at his neighbours. What makes this movie so great, besides the witty dialogue and simple yet perfectly executed plot, has to be that unique feeling where you become one with the main character. As a viewer you share and experience everything from Jeffries' perspective which automatically creates a certain suspense. Personally, I found the authenticity of this movie to be quite charming. Rear Window remains an all-time classic for a reason. Good walls make good neighbours, but what happens when you're getting a bit too curious?",8,1,3,16 February 2016
