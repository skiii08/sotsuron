Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Much better then expected
","Holmes meets his ultimate nemesis : Professor Moriarty, who becomes an arms (and bandages!) dealer and wants to stir up a war between France and Germany so he can start making some serious money. That's the plot in a nutshell but it's all more complicated then that ofcourse.I was expecting another dumb blockbuster with lots of fighting and explosiosn and the first 15 minutes seem to confirm this but then the movie really takes in a rollercaster ride and moves at such an incredible pace it's difficult to keep up ! Highlights are the banter between Holmes and Watson, Stephe, Fry as MyCroft, incredible chases, gunfights including the incredible scene where Holmes and his gang gets almost blown to smithereens by German artilleryfire.Director Guy Ritchie provides a perfect bland between action and smart dialogue and at the same indulges in his obsession for firearms (the sniper!).Add the high production values and the perfect recreation of 1891 and you got a real winner !",8,1,2,21 January 2018
Erin Brockovich," A perfect movie
","First I was rather suspicious of this movie : poor single mother wins out against big corporation so I was expecting some 'Ally Mcbeal'-style court case flick to do with discrimination or harassment stuff and in the end plaintive gets awarded a zillion dollars.But its much more serious : a whole community gets almost deliberately poisoned by high toxic waste from nearby chemical plant.  Inhabitants start to get the most terrible infections, parts of their organs rotting away, cancer, etc....and eventually a painful death.Based on a true story this is simply a perfect movie : it's Hollywood at its best. Everything is 'right on the money' : story, acting, direction, photography,... : there isn't a false note in the whole movie.  They even do not botch up the ending, a rarity in recent Hollywood flicks.Roberts has her best part ever: she is just brilliant as the supersexy loudmouthed and abrasive but with a heart of gold single mother.  Greatly balanced by that old UK pro Albert Finney as the somehow tired looking smalltime lawyer they make up a great team against the bigtime corporate lawyers.Soderbergh direction doesn't miss a beat, as he could go for the full 'get out your handkerchieves' style; EB is directed  in a solid, no-nonsense almost docu-style way, without falling into the trap of constant high melodrama.Even the music was great.What can I say : this is one of those rare pictures that is just 100 % sheer perfection.A straight 10/10 of course.PS : if you would have to put with constant foul-mouthed language by someone who looks like Julia Roberts, would you really mind ?",10,1,2,6 December 2003
U-571," Almost a WWII era propaganda movie
","(major spoilers ahead)Based on a true story, it is the plan to get hold of the German code machine Enigma by  capturing it from a U-boat.  This feat was actually pulled off by the British Navy  by scuttling  a  sinking sub already abandoned by its crew.  But as this is a US movie Hollywood takes over : the boarding party becomes entirely US and movie turns into some high adrenalin but ludicrous adventure caper.U-571 is very reminiscent  to  those   propaganda movies made during WWII to boost morale.  It's got all the simplistic ingredients and stereotypes: on the one hand you have the Germans : Nazi b*****ds all single one of them, either  fanatics or cowards, and ofcourse  very lousy shots.    Just to make case in point that they are no good ,  at the very beginning of the movie, they machinegun a lifeboat full with survivors of a just torpedoed cargo.On the other hand the US sub crew : resourceful, smart,  brave, self-sacrificing, multicultural (even including a  black cook) and above all : they can hit anything, no matter the odds.The basic premise may ring true historic wise, the rest of the movie is ludicrous. Just imagine this : the US crew, down to about half a dozen, manning a crippled German sub, succeed in sinking another U-boat and a German destroyer !  This would even be deemed too wild by WWII propaganda standards. So as for sheer accuracy and credibility the script is sub (haha)-zero . Even the assault to capture the U-boat is  ridiculous, attacking with mere handguns  through the various parts of the submarine while Jerry is waiting for them with  machineguns.I also have to admit I couldn't care much for the American crew, except for David Keith as a though OSS-officer, but  he gets sadly  offed mid-picture. Matthew McNaughty is pretty annoying as the leader,  so it is  a 'controlled' Harvey Keitel, as the CPO, who is the most likeable of the characters.I will admit though that  U-571 is  rather fast-paced  and reasonably well directed  so during the movie  you tend to forget most of the improbabilities. So director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-scripted and produced, does an above average job, but if it was sufficient to hand him the job to helm `Terminator III' remains to be seen.Many reviewers refer to the Germanmade `The Boat' as the prime example of the quintessential submarine movie.  An excellent choice undoubtedly, but let me (as also IMDb does)  point to a  US flick from the fifties: `The Enemy Below' which starred  Robert Mitchum and Curd Jurgens and was directed by actor Dick Powell.  This is a solid and realistic account of a duel on the high seas between a US destroyer and a U-boat .  It stays clear of the usual  clichés and Nazi stereotyping (quite an achievement for US movie from 1957) and builds up to  a very exciting climax.Conclusion :  U-571 is  fairly entertaining until you begin to see through the enormous plot holes and the sheer incredibility of the whole thing.",5,0,2,25 May 2003
Cross of Iron," 'The Wild Bunch' transferred to the WWII Eastern Front
","Sam Peckinpah directed this almost unique account in Western cinema of the fighting on the Eastern Front during WW II. This is basically one of the most intense warmovies ever made, not surpassed until Saving Private Ryan came along. This is a gritty, raw tale set against the largest and most brutal landbattle fought in human history. Coburn is excellent a the seasoned sergeant Steiner, having to lead his men through several hard battles and narrow escapes, and his fight against his arrogant and cowardly superior, captain Stranz (Maximilian Schell).The rather weird ending is explained by the lack of budget. German producer Wolf C. Hartwig, who gained most of his money making countless softcore sexcomedies, ran out of budget near the end of filming and Peckinpah was left with only two days to complete the big finale, but it does not detract from the overall quality of the picture. A sequel,called 'Breaktrough: the battle for Avranches' was made in 1980 Richard Burton (!) reprising the role from Coburn and also starring Robert Mitchum as his American nemesis. The setting was now the Normandy battles in july 1944. As directed by stalwart Andrew V. McLaglen, it is painfully inferior to the original Cross of Iron.",9,0,0,7 November 2002
1917," Shades of 'Dunkirk'
","Great movie to look at, beautifully shot by Roger Deakins and well directed by Sam Mendes. But it is not the masterpiece they want us to believe.I was struck by the sililarities with that other recent war epic 'Dunkirk'. Ofcourse that was in WWII and based on a real event, but bear with me on this one.
1917 and Dunkirk were highly praised on their release and 1917 will undoubtedly also rack up some Oscars. Both movies are made by high-profile directors, Mendes and Christopher Nolan for 'DunKirk, and both movies are shot in the ultra-widescreen Imax format. They are also both serious British flagwavers. Also both stories are full of plotholes (remember the Spitfire in Dunkirk that could fly without petrol).
But my main concern with both movies is this : where are the bloody Germans ? In 'Dunkirk' we see a few German planes from a far distance and in the very end a few shadowy German soldiers. And it is almost the same in 1917 : we only see dark flashes of them, even the downed German pilot is quickly disposed of (after he in true Hun-fashion has stabbed one of his British saviours). What is it then : can't we have a fight, would it be to gruesome on the giant Imaxscreen or is it maybe Hollywood won't allow these days German troops in full regalia on such a big moviescreen ?",7,2,5,25 January 2020
Mission: Impossible II," Most inferior sequel ever
","The first MI was aimed at an audience already out of high school and with an IQ at least over 50.  It was real brain candy and stylishly directed by DePalma. MI2 has none of it all.  It's just  one big ego-trip for Tom Cruise. He is the  über-James Bond, doing all this amazing stuff, killing a lot of people in the process and of course  getting the girl in the end.This movie combines the worst  recent Hollywood action movies have to offer : totally unbelievable action scenes, an almost complete lack of   plot, and a hero escaping all this mayhem with barely a scratch. One of the most ridiculous scenes features Cruise on  a motorcycle being chased by an armada of cars  full of guys shooting at him with machine guns. Imagine this in real life, only one bullet has to hit either him or the cycle and its quits. And what about the mask changing thing again, the lame romance, Anthony Hopkins (?) and so on. Halfway the movie I just started rooting for the bad guys.I never liked much John Woo's movies.  I have not seen any of his earlier Hong-Kong made films but I am sure it has a high bodycount.  I even didn't enjoy the much hyped Face-off, which I'll admit had a clever premise, but finally resulting  in the same ridiculous shoot-outs.I'll give it a 3 (though it deserves a 1) , for  the camerawork and the stuntdoubles.",Null,0,1,28 November 2002
Black Hawk Down," Hyperkinetic account of modern warfare
","The story  : in the 1993 UN intervention in the Somali civil war  US troops get ambushed in Mogadishu during a raid to capture local warlord Aideed. They must   fight their way out of the hostile city, under constant assault from thousands of  Aideeds warriors and Somali civilians.I remember reading about this incident  and thinking that this would make an interesting topic for a modern warmovie but frankly, I'd never expected something like this.
Based on the book by Mark Bowden, it's a painstaking accurate retelling of the actual raid.  Prepare yourself  for a breathtaking, blistering brilliant  account of non-stop mayhem and carnage,  limbs getting blown off, hundreds of casualties and more ammunition  spent then on a dozen recent action movies combined.   BHD makes `The Wild Bunch' seem like The `Sound of Music'.BHD is near too perfection : direction, acting,  production values, editing, photography and script are  almost flawless. It is so rich in detail and moves along at such speed  you 'll need at least 2-3 viewings to get a full grasp of the full chain of events.    It may be  confusing  sometimes but so is a real war. The battlescenes are exceptionally well handled by  Ridley Scott ,on the top of his craft here, turning out one of the best movies of his long career (Alien, Hannibal, Gladiator, 1492,  Thelma and Louise, etc...) It almost looks like  a bunch of vets did the whole raid all over again.The DVD offers off-screen commentary by Bowden himself and some of the actual vets who that went through the ordeal, so movie must be pretty accurate.
A good thing producer Bruckheimer decided on shooting (sic) the whole thing in Morocco instead of some Hollywood back lot  (and that he didn't choose Ridley's brother Tony to direct or we'd stuck with a  Club Med commercial with some blood 'n guts thrown in).
Movie has some big stars like Ewan Mcgregor and Josh Harnett,  but they are hardly recognisable between all the shootings and explosions. But Shepard is distinguishable as General Harrison, the CO who took full responsibility for the mess.  Also Tom Sizemore as the convoy commander and William Richter as some kind of super Delta warrior stand out.BHD is almost an updated version of  the old-style colonial war movies where a small number of white soldiers pitched against  thousands of hostile natives.  One of the best  in this 'genre' is 'Zulu' (1964) and  also based on the true life event of the Battle of O'Rourke Drift  in 1879 South-Africa, where a handful  of British soldiers must fight off a few thousands Zulu warriors.  Michael Caine's breakthrough movie !One minor  remark though on the reality bit : these high-tech soldiers are sure a far cry for the thugs and ragtag grunts  seen in `Platoon' or `Casualties of War' and whose main concern was  getting laid  or scoring some dope.  These model Rangers and  Delta Force (cool outfit !) troops are all such clean-cut and wholesome guys,   spending their free  time playing chess and scrabble, reading John Grisham novels and getting high, haha, on coffee.  Yeah, right.
Is BHD the best  war movie ever made ?  Perhaps not,  but it sure comes close.Ah yes, all this lamenting from fellow IMDb reviewers on the lack of characterization  :  you want characterization  ?  Go see `The Hours' instead.",10,1,2,20 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," One long and endless light saber fight
","First let me state that I am an avid Star Wars fan from the first hour, having seen Episode IV on the big screen when I was some 12 years old.A quick rundown off all episodes :Stars Wars IV : never had an audiences seen something like it: who can forget the opening shots of that enormous Starcruisers thundering over your head ? Undoubtedljy one of the most influential movies ever made.The Empire strikes back V : Even better. More elaborate special effects, good character development and a brilliant story, largely thanks to then wonder boy screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan and the seasoned Leigh Brackett (from Rio Bravo fame). Probably the best SF epic ever made.Return of Jedi VI : brilliant first half but then the Ewoks showed up. You know the rest.Phantom menace I : Dull story, tepid acting but somehow passed the test through the absolute mind blowing CGI and special effects (The Podrace, the incredible spectacular end battle)Attack of the Clones II : not bad at all, some fine characters (Boba Fett Mace Windu) , a rather exciting story (the creation of the Stormtroopers) combined with (again) super CGI wizardry, makes it the best of the first trilogy.And then this thing comes along. An absolute embarrassment for everyone involved. 'Plan Nine from Outer Space' on a massive budget.Some spoilers ahead.Except the (totally confusing) space battle at the start , the whole movie seems to consist of a series of interminable light saber duels : Anakin vs. Count Dooku, Mace Windu vs. the Emperor, Yoda vs. the Emperor, Obi-Wan vs. General, Obi-Wan vs Anakin, only to be interrupted by some of the most inept acting ever to be witnessed in such a major Hollywood movie. Ewan Mcgregor, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, etc are normally pretty competent actors but here they are just plain awful. But it is of course Haydn Christensen who is the most likely candidate for the next bad acting Golden Raspberry award. I mean some of these scenes feel as they have been directed by Ed Wood. The less said about the storyline, the better. The part in the end maybe, where they have to tie the knots with Episode IV, are rather moving, but they do not take very long.So a very big disappointment, but let us not condemn the whole saga on this dud. Most of the others episodes are still magical and will be in my memory forever",Null,3,5,18 June 2005
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Usual suspects but with a twist
",Actor who used to be famous tries a comeback. This must be one of the oldest clichés in the book and indeed the story itself and character tick all the right boxes :Previous successful (in Batmanstyle blockbusters) actor with alcohol problem tries comeback (via the theater) : check. Teenage daughter on drugs : check. Slutty much younger girlfriend : check. Complaining but still caring ex-wife : check. Super nervous producer : check. Much younger annoying co-star trying to steal his lines (and his daughter) : check. Bitterold theater critic : check.And so on.I guess the director and producer knew this very well so they had the real bright idea to film in a series of long continuous shots with a minimum of editing and it works brilliantly. It has not been done since 1948 'Rope' (Hitchcock) which is rather strange as the current film technology makes this so much easier as then. And on that part alone the directing and best film Oscars were duly deserved !,7,0,1,21 January 2017
Amélie," Funny and engaging up until the last second
","At the start of this movie I was almost sure  director Jeunet would never be able to keep  up this incredible mix between different storylines, characters, colours, old movieclips, newsreels,.... for the whole runtime. But Jeunet succeeds admirably in holding on to this fast-paced rhythm until the very end. This is in stark contrast with  many recent US movies (or others) which seem to run out of steam after about 2/3 of the total runtime.  Not this one !PS :  If you hate this movie and think it is unfunny, dumb, gloomy or boring,  go out and seek some treatment before it's too late.",9,0,2,30 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force goes all PC
","The Empire is replaced by 'The First Order' as the main enemy of the Rebels. A former stormtrooper and a lonely farmgirl will try to save the day.The 7th installment of the Star Wars franchise moves along at a reasonably brisk pace but it's mostly 'seen that been there' with a heavy dose of political correctness.It's rather obvious the First order are the Nazis, there is even a Hitlerlike thunderspeech delivered by one of the leaders to endless rows of Stormtroopers.
The rebels are then this multicultural bunch of dogooders. The main charcter is this young girl with no background who becomes this superwarrior without any previous knowledge or training. This character seems to have been inspired by Joan of Arc/maid of Orléans, who was a very young girl, divinely inspired and turned into supreme fighter and leader, leading the French to victory against the invading Brits. Anyway : she is mightily annoying. Joan of Arc was burned by the Brits at the stake which could be an idea for a next episode.The ex-stormtrooper is from Nigeria : Hollywood is now in full PC mode so there you have it. Nice guy and a bit funny sometimes.The whole plot is cutandpaste from the original StarWars so no surprises there. Again :special effects are Ok and it's worth to see it on the big screen.But the PC-ness almost kills of the movie, definitely for the older generation fans. But the new generation, not so familair with the original trilogy, will undoubtedly like it very much.",6,2,3,6 January 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Ultra-violent spoof for the video game generation
","Based on some comic book (another one) this is the tale of the initiation of a teen (I suppose) into a British secret service organization.The reason why I went to see this thing in the cinema is because I loved 'Kick-Ass', also from director Vaughn. That movie was also very violent but the crazy concept, a shy high school boy and a 11 -year old girl fighting crime, made it work.The next installment from Vaughn starts off well, largely thanks to Colin Firth as the mentor. Just until halfway into the movie when Firth character is offed, during the now infamous church scene (extremely violent even for this kind of movie), we're stuck with this 'new kid' for the rest of the movie. As this actor has basically zero charisma it's all downhill from that point. The whole thing simply turns into this violent video game style catastrophe with our 'hero' having to invade the bad guys fortress, in doing so killing dozens and dozens of his henchmen, not to mention exploding heads and a certain Swedish princess.This ultimately pretty sicko movie will be largely appreciated by a late teen/early twenty audience, not only due to the R-rating but as they simply are the target audience for this: brain dead geeks addicted to ultra-violent video games. If you do not fall into this category : do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague.",3,10,22,6 April 2015
