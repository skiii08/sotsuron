Source Code," Plot holes
","I am sure I am in the minority, but I can't help but look beyond the surface to determine if there are any plot-holes. And there are. Now, I accept the movie's main premise (hey, that is what sci-fi's are about) but beyond that premise there are paradoxes.One thing I DID like about the movie was that it really was not an action movie. It had about 5 minutes of action and the rest was dialogue. I think 'action' is incorrectly describing this movie.The acting is good. If you like sci-fi, like your imagination to run a little wild, and don't mind plot-holes, this movie is for you.If plot-holes (i.e., inexplicable parts while allowing the main premises) bother you, then you might leave disappointed.",5,3,6,17 April 2011
Warrior," people used to have higher standards
","I know these 'Rocky 'movies use poetic license, but come on!
this was called a middleweight tournament, which means their weights should be similar, and Koba was 50 to 70 pounds heavier than most of them.also, the teacher in his first fight was being choked for like 8 seconds, and they don't call the fight?and its one thing for Rocky to get an upset and defy the odds. It is yet another for a mild mannered physics teacher who has not fought in a while to win an MMA fight where, unlike boxing, you really have to be nasty.the worst part, however, was that the whole movie really focused on a certain relationship and that relationship was never resolved.the movie had a good story line, and had great potential, but either lazy or stupid writing sabotaged it.just curious for the people who loved the movie, do these things not bother you?",4,0,2,25 July 2018
