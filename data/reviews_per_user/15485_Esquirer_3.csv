Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't compare it too much with the original trilogy
","I loved the original star wars movies and was a bit disappointed, there was not that magic which I felt in the other movies. But let's have a look at some very important points: The original movies had great characters like Darth Vader, Luke, Hand and Lea. Nobody of them appears in this movie. So in my opinion it's quite difficult to replace such impressive people with others. Also note, that 'A New Hope' starts in the middle of war. 'The Phantom Menace' starts elsewhere, what explains that this story can't be that dramatic like ' A new hope'. There are great scenes in this movie, but everything seemed very different from the original trilogy. The trilogy had like a thin red line through the whole story, but the phantom menace is like something else, completely different. Let's hope that George Lucas will put the pieces together and we finally see a complete story with six good films.",7,0,1,20 May 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," James Cameron is missing and Nick Stahl/Claire Danes are not the right actors.
","I think T2 is one of the best movies I have ever seen. With anticipation I waited for T3. The movie has a great start and some great and funny ideas. the major problems are tough: Nick Stahl is not a good john connor. He turned into a wussie! He is not that young man with a lot of courage that he was in T2. And back then he was 13 years old! Claire Danes plays a scream queen and I can't beleive that the fate of manking would depend on her. The T-X seems to me not as dangerous as the T2 altough she should be more dangerous, but the T-1000 made a more dangerous impression, hard to say why. The movie lacks also in terms of sound. Sound is 50% of the experience and many action sequences have just no music or not good music, it takes away part of the experience. James Cameron knows very well how to use the sound, Mostow now. What doesn't make sense that this T-800 is not the same as he was in T2, yet he refuses to kill humans, how should he know not to do that? I also think it's stupid of Mostow to show an American flag in the movie. Nothing against USA, but this is a human vs. machines movie, it's the world united against the machines, it's just plain stupid to show flags. But I'm not surprised as Mostow claimed in U-571 that the americans captured Enigma, while it actually were the Britisch. T3 has a good start but becomes more and more boring and not very well layed out. Too bad James Cameron and Edward Furlong didn't participate, I'm sure it could have been way better.",Null,0,0,23 August 2003
The Mummy Returns," Good sequel, bad final scene.
","I loved the first movie, and also liked 'The Mummy Returns', but this time they wanted too much. The little boy is very funny and the Scorpion King and the visual effects are very impressive. But the final battle scene is not very good. It's always visible that the scorpion king was rendered. This is a big problem, because at the beginning he is very charismatic and everybody would expect a very interesting fight between Imothep and him. But at the end, this fight is not a fight rather a race and the scorpion king is rather ridiciulous and has almost nothing to do with the original at the beginning of the film. In conclusion I think most of the people who liked the fist mummy-movie will also love this one, the story is funny, a lot of action and amazing effects (except the scorpion king at the end). I can definitely recommend it. Rating 7/10, with at better fight at the end and a more convincable scorpion king I would give 9/10.",Null,0,0,20 May 2001
