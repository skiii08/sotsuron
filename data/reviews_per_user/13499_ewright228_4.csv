Casablanca," Wow
","Casablanca was a great movie out of the 1940's. Scratch that of all time. Humphrey Bogarts is an absolutely outstanding actor. He plays this part just amazing. I thought the acting overall was phenomenal all around. This movie is also a romantic movie, just look at Rick's face when he first sees her in the bar. And every time there after for a matter of fact. I could watch this movie over and over again unlike most movies I have watched for my Cinema class, as I really enjoyed this film. I would recommend this movie to everyone not only because of how great a film it is but because it really is on of the best movies in all of American Cinema and thats not only my opinion.",9,2,3,28 March 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," ehh alright
",I found this movie to be quite dry in many parts and also very repetitive. The acting on the other hand was superb and it made me want to keep watching the movie instead of changing to something else. I have viewed two other John Ford films with this being my least favorite with 'The Man who Shot Liberty Valence' taking the cake. The acting by Tommy was outstanding and really was intriguing the entire film. To me the character that stood out the most was the mama. She portrayed the lady of the house very well with all the cooking and the cleaning and caring for the family. It was only right that she got rewarded at the end. This film was an alright film but I don't think I would watch it again for fun. In my opinion not one of Ford's best films.,7,0,1,2 April 2014
The Graduate," nice
",I thought Dustin Hoffman stole the show and the acting he did was superb. I also thought the acting of Mrs. Robinson was excellent as well. One of the better and more funnier movies that we have watched in our History of American Cinema class. I thought the film was very good and it made me wish that one of my friends mom could have been Mrs. Robinson and I could have been Ben. I thought the editing in the movie was really good especially when they are in bed together and then they instantly show him in the pool on a raft and having a drink. It was truly awesome. I also really liked the view from the scuba suit as that was different and cool. Overall I liked the movie and would watch it again.,8,0,0,28 April 2014
Singin' in the Rain," The Best
",Singin in the Rain was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am 100% a musical person and they started the first ever musical out with a bang. Not only were the songs excellent but the acting was that much better. Obviously Don and Kathy's characters were portrayed excellently but I thought the actor that portrayed Cosmo Brown absolutely stole the entire movie. Him singing Make Em Laugh was the best part of the entire movie. I also thought that the actress that portrayed Lina did a great job or portraying a ditzy Hollywood lady (and I hope she isn't like that in real life!) Overall I thought this movie was fantastic and I can't wait to watch it again.,10,0,1,15 April 2014
