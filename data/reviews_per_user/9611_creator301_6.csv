Blade Runner 2049," Check my Ratings
","I look for problems, plot holes and general dissapointments. The only dissapointment for me was that this movie ended. Similar enough and different enough. Perhaps its not an exact sequel to an amazing film, one that made me hate modern movies more than I already do upon viewing, but its a true gem in the toilet that is hollywood today. A lot of reviews saying there is no emotion makes me wonder about the human race.",9,1,5,23 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," This is Star Wars. Im the hater, believe me.
","I despised the last films. There is one very nonsensical scene in this movie that threatened to ruin it like the others but it cannot stand up to this story. This movie feels like Star Wars. It feels like the gang is back together. The effects both practical and computer generated felt real. Beyond what any other movie had achieved. Everything felt real, and like actual human beings were behind it, unlike the last few disney dumpster fires. This movies story could have taken all three movies and have been a much better story. I hope this is the start of something good. Bless you JJ. That kiss scene was very very bad but still felt like the originals in a way, you know what Im sayin. True fans rejoice.",9,2,9,23 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," These low ratings are mass hysteria.
","Low reviews must be fans of the prequels. Keep in mind this movie is mopping up the mess of the last two terrible movies all while being great on its own. Watch the first star wars trilogy, then this movie. Consecutively, original cuts not Lucas dip spit jar version, then try and argue its not like star wars. Has everything those movies had, mystery, discovery, laughs, twists, and just weird looking aliens.",9,3,19,4 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Soulless. If you understood this, enjoy insanity.
",Not one time did the scene after a scene make sense or have anything to do with the previous scene. I know this was a kids movie really but wow. I wish luck to all that come after me. The future is not bright. Maybe one of you can stop this. I feel like I watched 4 different movies all just settiny up movies to suck more moneu from my wallet but im done. Chris Pratts likeability will no longer fool me into beliveing this film series has a heart. It does not. It is evil personified. Hollywoods sins on a silver platter. Hope you have hot sauce to choke down this garbage.,2,62,126,28 April 2019
Joker," Finally a beautiful film in the mainstream.
","This is not your average supervillian movie, and that has never been such a good thing. This movie stands out beyond the superhero genre. It is a movie that will last. Through the lense of the current climate it can be viewed as fairly volatile, youll have to be a sane rational human and try not to think of it with that bias and enjoy it for the story it is, in the time period in which it is set.",9,1,1,8 October 2019
Annihilation," Not logical but fresh concepts
",A little hard to accept at some points the poor decisions that are made but you have to understand that the lead characters are women and should be expected to make such simple mistakes. Its a surprise to me that they make it as far as they do.,8,2,13,23 March 2018
