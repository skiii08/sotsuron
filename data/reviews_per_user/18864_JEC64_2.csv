Antz," Eye Candy
","Woody Allen still lives up to his unique style, blending humor and every other aspect of life in this short animated movie. The CGI was incredible, I never thought this could be pulled off, it was this least to say, enjoyable. Although I expected more, the running time seemed appropriate for all of the stimulating scences. It was probably one of the more interesting films in recent CGI animation thanks to Dreamworks.....",8,0,0,25 January 1999
The Green Mile," The Most Beautiful Movie I've Ever Seen
","This has to be the most touching inspirational movie I've ever had the pleasure to view. I cannot put into words the deep feelings and imprint it has left on me. I cannot think of another movie that has ever moved me the way this one has. The characters and scripting was perfect, this is now my all time favorite movie by far. Even though it is sad it is all too beautiful at the same time.",10,0,1,14 June 2000
