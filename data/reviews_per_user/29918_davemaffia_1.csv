Ford v Ferrari," Oh so disappointed
","Bale's good. He plays the role, he's engaging. He's good.But the film..,,my god what a snooze fest. I love cars and I love car films but this is just slow, tedious and painful.Worst part is the American depiction of 'bloody English stereo bloody types cor blimey av a cuppa tea' so full of cliches.At the end of the day USA has never touched anything close to what the italians can build despite the outcome of the race.Boring.",2,2,8,20 April 2020
