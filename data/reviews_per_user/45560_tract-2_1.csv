Requiem for a Dream," Should be the definitive anti-drug film in all schools!
","If Ellen Burstyn doesn't win an Academy Award for her work in this film................I GIVE UP!!!! Once again, she gives an absolutely BRILLIANT performance, reminding me why I consider her to be one of the greatest actors of our time. This movie will stay with me a long, long time.",10,0,0,12 November 2000
