Blade Runner 2049," Wow! Just wow! great, great movie. Enjoyed every minute..
","I had high hopes for this movie. I was a massive Blade Runner fan, probably watching the various versions of releases at least two or three times a year since its release. I watched the trailers, yep all of them, including the ones that weren't even in the movie?! And with the sort of expectations that I had I really worried that the movie would be a disappointment. It was so far removed from that it actually exceeded my expectations by vast amounts. Ryan Gosling was absolutely brilliant, in fact, he was more deserving of an Oscar for his acting than any of the recent winners and frankly that is sad because this sort of movie doesn't even make the consideration stage. His role led me into a myriad of questions and ultimately left me realizing that only he could top the end play in the original, which I might add he did to perfection. Harrison Ford was great, he mirrored some of his previous performance and some of the scenes he was in left you feeling you could be looking at earth in 2049, certainly the tech side and the way older people, even today, try to hold on to some of the old traditions, styles and lifestyles. As for the special effects; they were exactly what was needed to give the same look and feel as the original, although I believe that the number of times running water, standing water and rain, was present may have been a tad over the top and certainly doesn't help with a longer movie for us older folks who pine for the return of the intermission (AKA bathroom break!). A masterpiece of cinematic brilliance which not only compliments the original, takes a story that is 100% plausible (sort of) and makes it work. My only criticism would be that there is no way that a digital release could do either the cinematic or audio the justice that it rightly deserves.Final comment: where did all those trailer segments go? I assume that there will be a number of special releases just as there was for the original?",10,3,10,22 November 2017
Captain Marvel," Entertaining
","Wow! Marvel + good story line. I thought it wasn't possible but they did it, they actually provided the viewing public a movie that has a good story line.No taking the credit from the makeup artists as well as the CGI people, no Marvel movie would be worthy of even a fleeting glance without them, but in this movie they excelled. Sam Jackson looks like he could be a teenager. Great work. Additionally he is probably the best actor in the entire Avengers bunch, well was, Brie Larson does a phenomenal job, up against the likes of Jude Law she demonstrates that an epoch in the industry isn't required to be convincing.Back to the story line; it works! Sadly, this may be the first Marvel offering that not only has a fair story but doesn't get so convoluted it becomes a distraction. It also fills in quite a few blanks along the way.I never hold comic book type movies in very high esteem but this would be the exception. It is just a pity that the Marvel folks may force Brie to work with some of the other pathetic characters that bore my socks off!Synopsis: a good family movie with some great CGI, good acting and a nice story line.",9,3,10,15 August 2019
Knives Out," An entertaining Sherlock'ess with a GREAT story
","Perhaps I'm just old fashioned but, this movie has ALL of the components that make a detective mystery complete!Daniel Craig is probably one of the most adaptable actors around. He fits this part so well I firmly believe he could pull off the Pink Panther role in a heartbeat. And the rest of the cast are memorable and make this a great movie with plenty of 'twisty bits' that help to keep you wondering right up until the inevitable 'room full of suspects' scene.The cinematography is one of the greatest parts of this movie, the sets are somewhat limited (it's a manor house detective movie, what do you expect!), but if you have a tendency to admire the photographers artistry, you will with this. The panning and focus isn't something that I would normally notice, but in this it is carried out with utter perfection, which adds a depth of art that is frequently missed, or simply not present, in many of today's offerings.Synopsis: great set, great acting, great story and delivers the required caveats when and where required. Long but worth it.Note: would have been a 10/10 but I want to reserve that for the next Rian Johnson offering!!",9,1,3,28 December 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel - the Quest for Cash
","Sorry Marvel fans but this is 100% no more than a money maker!I watched this when it was first released but apparently I was so unimpressed that I forgot about it completely! Now, having made the mistake of watching it again I feel the need to make the statement: it is just awful! There is no real story, just the 'convoluted regurgitated, how can we modify this to make this marginally sensible' sort of approach. The acting is cardboard, frankly I wish someone would melt Ironman down and make a nice saucepan out of him, then take Steve Rogers and shove the shield up his.. enough, yes, I was deeply, deeply disappointed with this movie.The ONLY saving grace for this was as always, the special effects. Ironically because I was so disappointed with the movie I found myself trying to figure out just how much acting the actors actually do? I believe that 75% of all character scenes are actually CGI, therefore, these 'actors' (cardboard) are getting paid heaps of money for doing less and less! Of course that thought process probably didn't help with my overall opinion of the movie!I will mention that part of the reason I watched this again was because I lost the link for Infinity Wars and Endgame, so I needed to review this to refresh my memory, sadly! I say sadly because I think Infinity Wars should be called 'Marvel the Quest for even more cash' and Endgame; 'Marvel the we want all the cash you have left from our previous mugging sessions'.I wasn't a comic book kid so perhaps I shouldn't have even watched these movies, believe me, I wish I hadn't because they are long and I could have been doing something that created memories worth having in the time I wasted on these really awful, pointless and terribly acted excursions into nothingness.One final comment; Benedict, please leave this clan of losers before you, whom are probably THE only actor worthy of a future from these terrible movies, become labeled as a 'comic book' character and lose ALL credibility as a real actor.Comic book fans; you'll probably love this drivel.",1,2,5,15 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," boring, bored, boredom - what a mess of a movie
","What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that!I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either!It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't. Also, personally, it has done so much harm to the franchise, I for one won't be bothering to spend the 'sizeable' costs involved in cinema excursions for any Avenger related future offering again.",2,178,308,8 June 2019
Non-Stop," Tremendous, great acting and great story..
","Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore and the 'we don't see enough of him'; Linus Roache make this movie a piece of art! From the beginning you are thrown into a contemplative mode whereby you are never really sure how stable the main character is. As the story progresses the 'cards' begin to stack up until finally, it's man against the World (well; crew and passengers!). The master plot (if that's what you would call it?) is woven into some smaller sub plots and they revolve around an underlying story of; 'what happens when your World falls apart', which is actually true for more than one of the characters in this story. I would recommend watching this movie with a simple thought in the back of your mind: could this really happen?",9,0,2,7 October 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," TOSH
","What a boring, pointless and terrible movie.Marginally more entertaining than Civil War, better than Memento (because the constant scene flipping was at least in some sort of order), but less entertaining than watching paint dry.I can't write a subjective review because I feel saddened that I spent money to watch this. Perhaps I should have read some of the comic books first? I just can't stop seeing this as just yet another money maker for all concerned. For me, it was a stupid, erratic, often lost, story line that made little to no sense and stands only on the merits of the talented CGI artists.Bored, boring, boredom. Yawn, 'has it finished yet?'..Synopsis: I would have been happier to have just written Marvel a check, then at least I wouldn't have the experience of: 'what a pile of ......'",2,2,6,15 August 2019
Big Hero 6," Great for kids, great for parents!
","Enjoyable movie. I'm pretty sure my 10 year old enjoyed it, but I was too busy laughing (apparently out loud, much to her disgust and shame!) to notice. I think that says it all.. The Good guy is bad, then the bad guy turns good, same old same old for plot (I don't think that is a spoiler, it would be like saying that it sank was a spoiler for the Titanic movie!) with some interesting caveats here and there. The animation is superb and the characters, especially the 'robot', are likable. I would say; go watch the movie, if there is a 3d version you don't need it to enjoy it and don't be afraid to go without the kids.. Although, you may seem a tad out of place in a theater full of 5th graders!",8,25,40,10 December 2014
Life," Great CGI, terrible 'regurgitated' storyline..
","What can go wrong when you combine Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhall and Ariyon Bakare.. Answer: everything! The story is so old that it should now be considered to be abused as opposed to used!The CGI is pretty good, pity the sound effects people are unaware that sound doesn't travel the same way in space!If you've never watched any of the Alien movies then you may enjoy this movie but if you have watched them all, you will undoubtedly be seeing too many familiar scenes and start wondering if they just decided to xerox sections of the Alien (all) scripts!Synopsis: seen Gravity? (Sandra Bullock) seen any or all Alien movies? (Sigourney Weaver and Co). If yes; then save your time and money. If no; perhaps you will see something in this movie that you haven't seen before.",4,3,6,23 May 2019
Annihilation," The Thing meets Evolution!
","Sorry about the title but I couldn't resist. Ironically because the basis is similar to the classic comedy Evolution and the storyline borrows from John Carpenters classic 'The Thing' (the one starring Kurt Russel).
I have to add that both those movies were classics and frankly I see no reason that this shouldn't be.
Contrary to some reviews I believe that the acting was great, Natalie Portman does what she does best, convinces me she is really there (isn't that what they are supposed to do?). I agree that some of the supporting actors leave a tad to be desired but not bad acting, just not as good as Ms Portman's.
The special effects are okay, nothing to write home about, and the 'sets' are sort of believable, the set special effects crews did a pretty good job, ironically often similar to other sci-fi movies (you'll see what I mean when you watch it). The final scenes special effects are great.. then not so great, maybe the budget ran out or the cgi guys were bored! but that didn't ruin the movie, it just meant that the actors had to be better at those times.
Would have been 10/10 but for the flashbacks. Some were tedious, some pointless and often confusing. It is as if the producers insist on something a little edgy and frankly they may get the rating up from a 12 to an 18, but why? Am I the only one that feels that way?
In short; watch this as a sci-fi drama, marginal horror and above all, try to keep up with the plot despite the pointless flashbacks.",9,1,2,25 May 2018
Incredibles 2," Watch Hancock for plot ideas, oh, they already did!
","I guess my level of expectation was too great for this because I was left disappointed..No problems with the exceptional animation, computers are great tools.
No problem with the voice acting, as ever, a brilliant performance.
But story, oh my, I really hoped they would do more with the previous movies ending, but alas no.I can't help but wonder how they ended up with such a blatant copy of the Hancock story, which by the way is a great movie. They did, and then the rest was same old same old.This may be lowest rating I have ever given and it was mainly because after watching a movie should not be a moment of; why did I bother!",3,1,6,9 November 2018
Warm Bodies," Just good entertainment with plenty of exceptional moments.
","This is a bias review because I bought the DVD and have subsequently watched it over a dozen times in the years that I have owned it.
There is no chance that anyone with a pulse couldn't like this movie, it is exceptionally well acted, has an exceptional soundtrack, marvelous sets, brilliant story and above everything else John Malkovich is in it!
The concept is truly original, probably the only movie of its kind to have a real conclusion that is as plausible as the initial cause, which by the way is only briefly mentioned but is totally superfluous as the movie carries the plot without it!
I personally believe that this movie should be up there in the 'classic zombie dramedy' list for anyone that enjoys light hearted humor along with a great and extremely well acted stories.
And then there is the soundtrack, oh my, whoever selected the music for the specific scenes deserves an award for their choices.
John Malkovich is never anything but a brilliant, talented and adaptable master of his craft and this fits in with the history associated with everything he has ever done. As convincing as possible with the hints of his personality thrown in as usual. By the way, even his small roles such as that in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy only he could have pulled off in the style that he did.
Overall, a brilliant movie with great music, however, not for the faint hearted as some of the scenes deny the younger viewers an opportunity to watch this.",10,1,1,26 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," Watched 3 times, doesn't get any better!
","This is a sad sad moment in the Alien stories because it spells the ultimate end of them. Why? because this is a Ridley Scott movie and it is flawed in so many ways that no self respecting movie studio is going to want to take a chance on anything that follows.Prometheus was okay, it filled in a few blanks, had a reasonable story, presented some reasonable acting and contained the horror that Alien represents. Beyond that it was mediocre at best, but this is almost laughable on all of those points.Although the story could have been good the constant need to do the same things again and again, made this a predictable and 'made for TV' style presentation. It also attempts to sew the seeds of the next one in too many ways at too many points along the way.I have been a great fan of the majority of the Alien movies, immortal moments such as 'game over man, game over' have become a facet of almost everyday life, but this falls so far short of that I literally watched it three times to see if I could enjoy some of it at some point, and, I didn't.Synopsis: sadly this is likely to inspire the end of the Alien franchise, but the saddest part of that is that it will end on a bad note with a bad movie.",2,3,5,22 February 2020
