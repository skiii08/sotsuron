Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Best Trilogy Made
","The Indiana Jones series was the best series ever made, in my opinion. It was extremely fun and enjoyable to watch and it can be watched repeatedly, with no lesser joy. Harrison Ford as Indy is extremely charismatic, like Han Solo, but the character of Indiana for me has an essence that creates a more likable character (modesty, I think) and by doing that, it creates a better trilogy for me, indeed surpassing the Original Star Wars Tilogy (don't get me wrong I love Star Wars as well).Raiders is such a great film, containing some great action scenes (the Truck scene) and creating Indiana Jones, which is the best adventure hero ever made, partly I think due to Harrison Ford (I don't think these movies would have been as good with Tom Selleck).",10,92,166,25 December 2004
Garden State," Seeing Garden State is Like Seeing the Light
","And I mean that in all aspects. This film was so good. Those brilliant trailers that were released, hooked me so much. They showed a film that looked stylish, touching, funny and original (unlike other ads which, like Sam, lie.The style and look of the film was so brilliantly done, and it shows Zach Braff's amazing talent as a director as he creates visual poetry. His writing is so quirky, like a darker Scrubs, and it is extremely entertaining and touching. The acting is superb. Braff manages to take his character from drug induced and emotionless, back to life and it is very convincing (especially when he goes off at his friend Mark). Natalie Portman is different than usual in a very good way and Peter Sarsgaard is great as the dreamless Mark. And the music is part of what makes this film. Coldplay helps illustrate this movie extremely well and Zero 7 creates a realistic party scene, whilst The Shins give Large his anthem and Frou Frou helps capture the mood of the piece.This is one of the movie is the best I've ever seen. 11/10",10,0,1,22 November 2004
