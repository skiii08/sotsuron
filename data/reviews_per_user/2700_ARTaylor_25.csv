The Incredible Hulk," The Hulk Film We've Been Waiting For
","I thought this was an incredibly good Hulk movie. It was everything that Ang Lee's Hulk wasn't. The Incredible Hulk was perfectly reminiscent of the beloved Bill Bixby Hulk series. It had a great combination of smashing Hulk, 'just wants to be loved' Hulk, tormented Banner, and 'learning the Hulk isn't completely evil' Banner.The cast does a terrific job. Norton certainly works better than Bana did. The others are quite good, though I can't really say whether they were better or worse than their counterparts in Ang Lee's version.The story is pretty straightforward, without all the unnecessary art house mumbo jumbo. No overly complicated daddy issues. Just Bruce learning to accept his other half and Hulk looking for a place in the world. Emil Blonsky also has a good story arc with him trying to overcome his age limits and reclaim his glory.I loved the slow reveal of the Hulk, much like what Paul Verhoeven did in RoboCop. The monster in the shadows then the hand in the fog. So that when Hulk is fully revealed he's been built up and appears even more spectacular.The CGI is very well done. Hulk and Abomination look like they could actually appear in the real world. The level of detail on the two exceeds anything done in Lee's version.The action was terrific. It didn't overwhelm the slower, character moments but it was enough to satisfy action fans. The chase in Rio and the college battle are both exciting. The ending is particularly what is needed more in comic book movies. Showing too powerful creatures beat the crap out of each other while innocents are caught in the crossfire. It's what too many others are lacking. When someone like Hulk or Superman has seemingly unlimited strength, they need to fight someone with similar abilities to really show off their powers.The movie did a great job setting up future films without feeling forced like Iron Man 2. We get the set up for Leader, Doc Samson, S.H.I.E.L.D., Avengers, and Captain America. But it all feels natural, like all these characters exist in one universe whereas Iron Man 2 sometimes felt like 'Hey look, comic book references!'My only real complaint is that General Ross is portrayed as more of a straight-forward villain. Sam Elliot's version was more a man doing what he needed to do. He loses some of his dynamic character in this version.Overall the film did what it needed to do, it was fun from beginning to end and didn't dumb anything down just for entertainment.",10,1,2,13 May 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," How Movies Should Be Made
","This is one of the most fantastic movies I have ever seen. Brilliantly done. This will be one movie that will be remembered for years to come.The story works. I ride the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland all the time. It's so refreshing to see that they just didn't copy the ride story like Haunted Mansion did. It's original and doesn't feel like you're just going on the ride. They used parts of the ride but only when it fit into the story. They could have perfectly well made this story without the ride at all and it still would be good. The scene where Jack is in the prison and the others are trying to get the dog to come over is hilarious, if you've been on the ride. But it's not like the whole movie revolves around that dog. Just one of the subtle touches that people love.I could go on forever on the acting. Every character is perfectly cast. But the two that I must point out is Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. While every single actor and actress does a good job, these two stand above the rest. Barbossa is no nonsense and completely threatening. A villain worthy of the ranks among Darth Vader, Sauron, and Hans Gruber. Jack Sparrow is . . . well he's different. Completely unique. Like none you've ever seen before. Depp plays him almost like Christopher Walken would. He does goofy things with all seriousness. He steals just about every scene he's in. And when those two characters meet it's like when Batman and Superman meet. Two great characters, great on their own and even better together. I just love the way they play off each other.The CGI also terrific. It's not over the top like some movies tend to get. When they need CGI they use it but don't use it everywhere. Just the right amount. The most incredible scene is the Barbossa-Sparrow fight. The two go in and out of the moonlight, both turning into skeletons, and yet the CGI doesn't take away from the fight itself. The CGI use is so great you'd have to go through the movie frame by frame just to get it all. The CGI is just used to enhance the already good story.The soundtrack is outstanding. The music never overwhelms the movie. It fits in perfectly. It's also a great soundtrack to listen to on it's own. It's one of my favorite CDs.Now, no movie is without it's flaws. The rules for the curse seem to change. Like how exactly did Bootstrap Bill get out of the curse? Why does Barbossa die when he's shot before Will drops the coin? It seems that a movie of this size should have had such an important part of the story a little more defined. But unless you really stop and think about it or are just picky like that who cares. Also the last fight scene seems a little tacked on. They just had this huge climatic battle and then they decided to add just one more. It sort of seems like a pistol shot after a cannon blast. It is nice to see Will and Jack working together but after the previous fight it seems to drag the movie on longer than it needs to be. But the movie works anyways.A great movie for everyone to enjoy. Go out and rent this, then go and buy it. You'll love it. A movie you'll never regret seeing.",10,1,4,22 April 2006
Blade," The First in the Superhero Renaissance
","Blade was the first of the modern wave of truly serious superhero movies, and it establishes much of what would follow. Gone are the outrageous vehicles, overly silly enemies, and alternate universe where time seems stuck in one decade. This movie was one of the very first to show what it would be like for an extraordinary person to appear in an ordinary, modern day world.For a character so obscure, Blade is handled very well in the film. Let's face it, before the movie he was more known for being a recurring character on the 90s Spider-Man cartoon. But afterward he skyrocketed almost to the top. Not quite X-Men or Captain America popular, but he became recognizable to non-comic book geeks.The story is good, it isn't just another standard superhero origin movie. It's handled like Tim Burton's Batman, he's already out there and fighting. The origin is just a brief explanation for the newcomer. I really would like more superhero movies to follow that model since it does work and gets the hero into the action sooner. There's the right blend of action, horror, suspense, and humor to keep audiences entertained throughout.Wesley Snipes does a terrific job. He seems to fit the role perfectly. Snipes handles both the fights and exposition well. He also has that Arnold Schwarzenegger/Harrison Ford style 'serious comedy' delivery where he says funny lines but doesn't come off as a comedian. Now I find myself reading Blade and only thinking of his voice.Stephen Dorff is also amazing as Deacon Frost. He's the only one able to move the spotlight away from Snipes. His delivery makes for one terrific villain, though his character doesn't have the pathos many other villains have. I remember him more for his sadistic acts, but not particularly as to why. Still, sometimes a villain without a specific reason is more frightening.The other actors are also good, though most are overshadowed by Snipes and Dorff. Kristofferson's Whistler has a great relationship with Blade. Their final scene is really great, though makes me wish the series had a stronger sense of continuity with Whistler. N'Bushe Wright is good, though not particularly memorable. Donal Logue is great as the comic foil and I wish he would do more than just be the comedic relief in the occasional superhero movie.The action is the real stand-out. No stuntman in the Batsuit fighting in the shadows ten feet away. Snipes is in there doing the work. It moves fast but is never confusing. There's a real sense that they are going somewhere with it, not just trying to show random cool scenes. The only real problem with the movie is the ending. It's still exciting like the rest of the movie, but a little sloppy. That's because the producers made one ending that no one liked. So they quickly made another using many of the same ideas. The one they have works fine. But if they had known from the beginning, it would have flowed together better.The CGI is also noticeably dated and takes you out of the movie. Luckily they don't use much of it and rely more on superior practical effects.The best part is that the movie revitalized the superhero genre. Before this, there was Superman and Batman. Superman hadn't seen the screen in ten years (longer if you look at an actually good movie) and Batman & Robin had nearly killed the genre off just the year before. But notice how afterwards there has been at least one superhero a year, and now several a year. Marvel used their minor character to open the floodgates for everyone. Sure, subsequent movies have had their ups and downs. But generally speaking the quality of superhero movies has been quit good. No more nipple suits or Richard Pryor built computers.The movie's exciting action sequences and exploration of vampire lore keep this an entertaining flick. Though Blade still may not be the comic book character to read, the movie is still entertaining enough on its own merits to keep it around. And at the very least it will stand as a marker for the following renaissance of comic book movies.",8,1,2,23 May 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not X-Men's Proudest Moment, Not Their Worst
","After the massively disappointing (though box office success) X-Men: The Last Stand, Fox needed something to improve their franchise name. So they turned to the fan favorite hero who also happened to have just been featured in the massive Marvel crossover House of M and even had his own series, Wolverine. Logan was the center of the last three movies so they logically assumed a movie of his own would be just as successful. They thought wrong.X-Men and X2 were successful because they were intelligent and well made stories. Wolverine did have a major part in the stories, but he wasn't the only one. The Last Stand was over packed with characters and story so that no one, not even Wolverine, had a decent character arc. And honestly, he was only featured because most of the other main cast were killed off or unceremoniously pushed to the side. Now in the comics, Logan has had a lot of success in individual series. But the movie contained none of what made those comics good.The story is an abbreviated version of Logan's early life through Weapon X. Problem is, each and every phase of his life is so incredibly interesting that each could warrant a film of their own. Origins is, in my opinion, one of the best stories Marvel's ever put out and on equal level of DC's Batman: Year One. Here, it's paraphrased in the first five minutes, and all the mystery and intrigue of the comic series is bluntly stated. His time on Team X is also very interesting. Here, it's over in the first thirty minutes and only one mission is shown. Weapon X by Barry Windsor-Smith is, again, one of the best stories you'll read. Here, over with in the first half without anything that made that story engaging. The whole movie is like the CliffNotes version of the comics. You get the basics but none of the heart and soul of it.The explanation for how Logan loses his memory is atrociously bad. I won't spoil it, but it boggles the mind that the producers came up with something so dumb. It's factually inaccurate, especially within the universe the movies have set up, and just a hair beneath deus ex machina. Origins had a very appropriate explanation that revealed a lot about who he is. If the producers went with that this movie would have been much more Christopher Nolan-esque.Wolverine also has one major problem that The Last Stand did, far too many characters. And again, the more characters they add the less time to develop any so that basically all become stagnant. Logan has a story but doesn't really evolve. Nor can he since the previous movies established that he will be reset at some point. Stryker in X2 was one of the best villain in film and expertly shows the true enemy of the X- Men. Here, he's simply a maniacal bad guy and almost a mad scientist stereotype. The others (Blob, Maverick, Agent Zero, Gambit, even Silverfox) are simply there to move the plot forward. Fan favorite Deadpool is most disappointing. Like everything else, he's so briefly shown that can't have the time to be the anti-hero fans know and love. Ryan Reynolds was perfect casting. But he only gets two scenes and nothing much to do besides be a guy with swords.On the other hand, I will say that they did a terrific job with Sabretooth. In X-Men he was simply a big thug who for whatever reason disliked Logan. This version was far more faithful to the comics as he and Logan were personally connected and actually got to play off each other. Liev Schreiber was terrific casting. If there's one good thing to take away from this movie, it's Sabretooth.Hugh Jackman gives another great performance. I still can't imagine any other actor in that part. If only he had a better story to work with. But besides the aforementioned Reynolds and Schreiber, no one else stands out. No one is particularly bad, but no one is more than just okay.Finally, this movie really should have been R. I understand all the stuff about studio marketing, the teen audience, etc. But Wolverine is Marvel's bloodiest superhero followed far behind by Blade and Punisher (both of which had R rated movies). This shouldn't be a Saturday morning cartoon show where Wolverine can only punch foes and uses his claws to open doors. This is supposed to be long before the X-Men where he still lets his anger get the best of him. Plenty of movies, much like Blade, have proved that R rated can be financially and critically successful.That being said, this film isn't the worst I've seen. Certainly Daredevil, Ghost Rider, The Last Stand for example are far less entertaining. The action is exciting. Seeing people use powers against each other is always cool. And it does open the gates for Wolverine's early history to those who don't know the comics.The film is tolerable. Nothing as good as X-Men, X2, or First Class but certainly a step up from The Last Stand. It could have, and should have, been better. I certainly hope the upcoming sequel (as I write this) is better. But being someone who grew up on the 90s X-Men series and the comics, I do say I enjoy watching this simply because I do like Wolverine.",6,0,2,8 June 2011
X-Men," Still One of the Best Superhero Movies
","X-Men may have come out fairly early in the recent superhero renaissance, but it still holds up as one of the genre's best. Blade was the first serious modern superhero film, but X-Men was the one that made them popular. For the first time since they stopped making Superman films, audiences got to see heroes using superpowers fighting others with superpowers.The film was also one of the first to deal with some deep themes. It is in no way a simple good guy versus bad guy story that usually populates the genre. Magneto is every bit as developed, interesting, and sympathetic as the heroes. Possibly, more so. And Singer is able to use his own experiences being a homosexual to enhance the mutant problems so that it becomes an excellent allegory for current events that still remains true to the vast comic book history.The story is presented as an origin story, but it's not like the numerous other origin stories. Like Blade and Tim Burton's Batman, they're already heroes and can start with the action right away. The Wolverine-Rogue relationship works wonderfully. I don't quite know why they didn't just use Jubilee as it is in the comics, but Rogue works just fine. The Logan-Jean-Scott love triangle starts off great, though I wish they went further with it in the sequels. Though the really terrific relationship is the Xavier-Magneto friendship-turned-rivalry which out shines everyone else. It really added a whole other dimension to the movie that, quite honestly, no other superhero movie has been able to match.The movie does have a bit too much exposition. Sure there is a lot needed to be explained, but there are a few too many sections of the movie where it's just long speeches by Jean, Xavier, etc. There is plenty of action, more than many other origin movies, and they all work well that you can forgive the long exposition.The movie is nearly perfectly cast. Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto, Jean, Rogue, and Senator Kelly are exactly like they are in the comics. Now, I can hardly read the comics without thinking of their voices to match the dialogue. Mystique is good, but she is better in the sequel. I liked Cyclops, though he has progressively less to do in the sequels which is disappointing since he is such an interesting character. Storm is fine here, but Berry's subsequent rise to fame and insistence on more screen time drags down later movies. I loved Mane as Sabretooth, but the character is given so little to do and honestly he was portrayed more interestingly and faithfully in the Wolverine movie.The movie isn't just a terrific superhero movie, but a great movie in general. Singer really goes above in beyond in his two X-Men movie, that it's a real shame the next two had to be so overstuffed with characters that everyone became uninteresting. There's a faithfulness and intelligence that's missing from too many other superheroes. X2: X-Men United may do everything this movie did better, but it's still a wonderful movie that I'll happily watch any time.",10,2,4,30 May 2011
Yes Man," Carrey's Simply Too Old For These Kind Of Movies
","Jim Carrey is not the man he was. He can't do the Ace Ventura, Dumb and Dumber, or Liar Liar anymore. You can see it in his wrinkled face. He's a great actor, funny and charismatic (and the one and only good point of Batman Forever). But he can't do the same movies forever. Even Tom Hanks moved on from these kind of goofy comedies.Carrey does not fit in with this cast. Everyone seems to be in their late 20s early 30s, and most of the actors are. Carrey looks, and is, past middle age. Yet he's trying to fit in with these people. They say he's been working at the bank for five years, but what has he been doing the rest of his forty years? The whole thing reminded me of that episode of Friends where Bruce Willis dated Rachel, but at least they they acknowledged the age discrepancy played on the idea that Willis was older. This movie keeps trying to pretend that Carrey is a thirty-something again. He's not. He's almost fifty. He should be moving on to more mature characters, something like Truman Show.Zooey Deschanel and Carrey simply don't click. There's no on-screen connection between the two. Maybe it's because Carrey is exactly eighteen years older than her (both born on January 17 but Jim in '62 and Zooey in '80). But it's probably because director Peyton Reed doesn't have the experience for that kind of thing.Maybe they should have gotten a younger actor for Carl. Maybe they should have gotten older actors for everyone else and made it a City Slicker-esquire mid-life crisis movie.Carrey's age is not the only problem. It seems a bit random, like they just threw in a bunch of gags together and tied it with this 'just say yes' gag. Some of the 'yes' gags don't pay off. At some points it seems like they created a situation that didn't fit the story at all but would pay off some gag. It doesn't seem very thought out. The side characters are underdeveloped and rather one dimensional. There's no side stories so the movie relies entirely on the one seemingly unplanned plot line.Not that it was a bad movie. It was funny, with plenty of laugh out loud moments. Zooey is cute in every role she plays. I've never seen Terence Stamp do anything less than a superb job. His part is short but sweet. Although Carrey should not be doing these roles, he does have fun with it. Giving it the full nine yards as he always does.In the end it's just a poor man's Liar Liar. It has Carrey. It has a very similar plot. It has most of the gags. It just didn't have the wit. Carrey fans will probably find something to enjoy being reminded of his older, better films. But I can't really recommend it for many others.",6,1,3,11 January 2009
The Prestige," Three Parts Of A Magic Trick
","The Pledge:Christopher Nolan, the brilliant man who brought us Memento and Batman Begins and soon The Dark Knight, brings us The Prestige. Starring Hugh Jackman, Wolverine from the X-Men movies and soon to have his own film, and Christian Bale, Batman in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. The movie is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Jackman and Bale respectively.The Turn:Their rivalry is something more than two competitors. It becomes about revenge. Eventually one of them discovers an amazing trick. Soon the other becomes obsessed with finding the secret. Everything he does becomes about finding the secret to the first trick. Later he finds an even better trick. A trick so astounding that not even the man who builds most of the tricks can understand it.The Prestige:Trusts are broken. Loyalties are tested. Loves are lost. Watch the movie carefully. This one requires you to pay attention and follow along. The movie is told in a non-linear format, even more so than Memento. There are subtle clues in almost every scene. This is no movie to text-message, make out, talk with friends, or even go to the bathroom during. Each and every scene helps to build to this mystery of what's going on. Missing one scene means certain confusion. It's not something you can half pay attention to. Even if you do pay attention you might just have to see it again just to see all the build up to the final trick.The Response:Amazing. Though if you found Memento confusing you may want to skip this one. But if you're a Christopher Nolan fan or always like a good mystery you will be sure to enjoy this one. Enjoy this one while you can. Movies with this level of excitement do not come around too often.",8,3,5,21 October 2006
Blade II," Good but not Special
","I didn't care for this one. Maybe because I heard so many people say it was better than the first that I got my expectations up too high. I didn't find the characters all that compelling or the universe all that intriguing this time around. The villain certainly wasn't as interesting as Deacon Frost. It didn't seem like Blade had any substantial subplots to keep us interested in him. I hated that they brought back Whistler after his terrific sacrifice scene in the first film. Perhaps if the first had set up his return, but as it is it's just sloppy continuity. The action and style of the movie are great. But they would be out-shined by Del Toro's Hellboy movies. It worked, but it wasn't as fresh as it was when the first movie came out. At the very least, the CGI looked finished this time around. The movie is okay, but it doesn't really do much to stand out on its own. The character was already introduced, the story was nothing special, and the fights were nothing that The Matrix didn't already popularize.",7,4,6,25 May 2011
The Shining," Kubrick vs King - A Comparison
","Let me say this right off the bat, the Kubrick version is the superior movie while the King/ Garris version is the superior adaptation.What's wrong with the Kubrick version?His misses out on certain very important plot elements. Jack seems to be crazy from the beginning. Jack's alcoholism is not as known as it should be. The Overlook only seems to be haunted in one or two scenes, the rest could be cabin fever. The breakdown of the family is not so clear, Jack and Danny don't seem to really love each other as much as they should. Differs greatly from the book.What's right with Kubrick's version?Superior directing. A very definitive style. Classic scenes ('Here's Johnny!'). Excellent acting. Danny seems to really be his age. Wendy really seems to be scared. Jack really does seem crazy when he's supposed to be. A very good horror movie in general. The hotel is much more imposing. Foreboding music helps to set mood. Differs greatly from the book (I'll explain why it's in both later).What's wrong with the King/Garris version?It suffers from many TV-Movie problems. The actors aren't quite as good. They use CGI when puppets, wires, or trick camera shooting could be equally effective. CGI looks out of place. Danny talks like a twenty-year old, although the same problem was in the book. Jack is fine when it comes to being Mr. Every Dad but he doesn't seem to be crazy when he's supposed to be. Jack's transformation doesn't seem so gradual as it should, Wendy says 'You're old drinking habits have all come back' when the book shows each one pop up. It's the book, very little is changed so if you've read the book you pretty much know exactly what happens.What's right with King/Garris' version?It's not a remake of Kubrick's movie, it's a movie version's of King's book. It's the book, if you loved the book and are a die hard fan you'll love this. Very little is changed. Minor subplots are changed but movie works well without them. You get pretty much everything the Kubrick version left out.Which one?It depends. If you loved the book and are a die hard Stephan King fan then watch the Garris TV miniseries. If you are a regular movie fan or a Kubrick fan then watch the Kubrick version. Garris' is for the book fans. Kubrick's is for the non book fans.Final Thoughts.It's not really fair to compare the two movies. Each one has their own pros and cons. Kubrick's is more of a movie using the basic premise of the haunted hotel and the father who goes crazy. It's meant to be a movie that's not just a page by page adaptation of the book. Which you got to admire Kubrick for doing that. He did something that even those who memorized the book would be surprised and scared. But Garris did something that the die hard Stephan King fans can love. It depends on who you are. It is definitely not fair to compare the two since they are both very different from each other. Both are good in their own separate ways.",8,0,1,10 December 2006
District 9," Excellent First Movie for a Terrific Director
","Walking out of the theater I felt like I had watched The Terminator or Jaws for the first time in my life. It is a movie that will be loved for decades from now. People will look back at Neill Blomkamp's career and still remember this fondly. I felt very lucky in the theaters for the start of this director's what will be wonderful career. While the story is none too subtle it is quite entertaining. It was a great story of social commentary that works even if you know nothing about the history of South Africa outside of Lethal Weapon 2. The effects are spectacular. Excellent use of CGI. Not overdone but enough to create the world around them. What really strikes me is that this is Blomkamp's first turn as a director. Most director's first movies are, while entertaining, still flawed in some way. Even the greatest of directors have some flaws in their early movies, usually that are overlooked by the quality of the rest. District 9 appears like it was made by a veteran director of forty movies. In the coming years people will look at Blomkamp's career and think about how wonderfully he has made his movies. And it all started with a little movie called District 9.",10,2,9,23 March 2011
Ghost Rider," Needs a Flaming Facelift
","Let's face it, Ghost Rider was never a popular character. He was always rather obscure and known mostly known only to comic book geeks. And whatever popularity he had was mostly due to the awesome visual of a flaming skull on a motorcycle. He had two cameos on animated series in the 90s and an appearance in Marvel Ultimate Alliance. So adapting this obscure character could have either been awesome like Blade or completely forgettable like Man-Thing. The end result is disappointing and forgettable but does look cool.The movie, like far too many others, is an origin story. Like every other origin story, it follows the exact same formula. That's the same problem Fantastic Four had, and these producers didn't learn. I don't know why more first movies don't follow the Tim Burton's Batman and Blade format of showing a hero already with his powers and explaining the origin later on. At this point even the most basic of movie audiences can predict the story beats.Unfortunately it takes on a campy tone. Cheesy dialogue is said with the utmost sincerity. Silly scenes are played seriously. Many of the actors chew through the scenery. I understand that there's a certain silly factor to comic book superheroes, but this movie embraces that idea far too much. This is supposed to be a movie about demons, sins, Hell, and the fate of the world. Yet I can't help but laugh at moments that were never meant to be funny. Then moments that are supposed to be funny just come off as awkward.I will say this, the opening act is quite good. The scenes of Johnny with his father, selling his soul, and the father's accident are pretty dramatic. It's the point where Nic Cage shows up that I started losing interest. These scenes have enough darkness to convey the proper tone but enough lightheartedness to keep them interesting. If the rest of the movie had only followed suit this would have been quite good.The cast is hit or miss. Nic just doesn't have it in him to convey being a serious superhero. He's trying too hard to be his usual goofy self that he is in all his other movies. (Brief aside, I'm absolutely glad he never got to play Superman as was once planned.) Peter Fonda is the bright spot in this movie. He's dark and manipulative with just enough creepy playfulness, perfect for someone supposed to be the devil. Eva Mendes looks pretty, but doesn't do much else. Wes Bentley is tolerable as the villain but never memorable. Donal Logue does a good job, if only he had something to do. Sam Elliott is great, but again he needed something to do other than simply offer exposition. Honestly, Matt Long and Raquel Alessi have the best scenes and do some of the best work. Those two should have been the stars of the movie.If there are two things consistently good. One is the CGI. The bike, the demon spirits, and especially Ghost Rider look great. The visuals are what people remember about the comics and the movie nails it. I wouldn't expect anything less in this day and age. The other is Christopher Young's score. It's effective and has some memorable themes throughout the movie. I also love the version of 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' by Spiderbait in the movie. There's also an instrumental version in the film that works quite well.Overall the film is disappointing. It isn't quite awful but it's certainly not good. There are little moments here in there to keep you interested through the otherwise lousy movie. As I write this, they're making a reboot/sequel. I certainly like the idea, but I wish they had gone with someone else for the role besides Nic Cage again. I believe that each and every movie has the potential to be good. But somewhere along the way, someone forgot that the most important thing is having a good story.",6,0,1,13 June 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Disrespectful To Fans
","X-Men: The Last Stand is a tragedy of a movie. It managed to overshadow The Phantom Menace as far as disappointing follow-ups to successful movies. The first two intelligently set up a terrific and complex universe. This is anything but.Like far too many bad movies that had potential, the movie suffered because the studio decided to get involved. Singer left the project for Superman, and honestly I think he recognized what was going on and jumped the sinking ship. Ratner gets a bad rap for this, but he came in so late that there was no chance in saving it. For whatever reason, studios seem to think that bigger is always better despite the majority of such movies showing otherwise.The biggest problem is that far too many characters are added. The first had about ten main characters. The second about fifteen. This has about thirty. Having a bunch of cameos is fine, but this movie tries to give time to everyone so that essentially no one has any time. Forget character development, there's so much trying to go on that no one has any real memorable moments. There's a couple of special effects moments, but not character.The worse problem is that the returning cast is given the shaft except for Storm and Wolverine. Wolverine had a good story arc in the first two but X2 finished it. This was the time to move on, but still he is front and center despite not having much to do. Storm was only elevated because Berry couldn't handle being a supporting character anymore, but again she doesn't have much to do. Cyclops is killed early on and no one cares. Xavier is also killed about half way through but there's some half-hearted feelings at his funeral, and it's especially terrible that his good friend Magneto doesn't seem to care for more than two seconds. Whatever dynamics Magneto had in the first two is abandoned as he simply becomes a bad guy. Mystique is depowered and tossed aside without any fanfare. Rogue's character changes completely for no apparent reason other than some semblance of development. Jean turns into the Dark Phoenix but basically stands around while other people do things around her. The love triangle set up in the first two is torn to shreds.Instead we're asked to care about the new characters, most of which are bland and one- dimensional. Juggernaut is his bland Ultimate version rather than dynamic main comic self since he's just a brute rather than Xavier's step-brother. Callisto is basically there for Storm to fight and to stand at Magneto's side. Fan favorite Colossus literally only has one line. Angel is nothing but a plot device. We're asked to accept a second love triangle between Rogue, Iceman, and Kitty but it's forced and unemotional, probably cause Rogue becomes so one- dimensional this time. They try to touch our heartstrings with Leech, but again there's so little of him that audiences just can't care. Beast is usually quite interesting, but for whatever reason you loved his comic and/or animated self is gone here.The action is merely okay, but without character development it's just flashy special effects to distract us. The special effects themselves are good, and it seems the producers had fun coming up with different powers for all the cannon fodder. Since the characters are uninteresting it's hard to get into caring about them in the action. In pretty much every action sequence, there's little rhyme or reason besides showing off powers and special effects. Again, the studio seemed to think that having bigger and louder scenes was better than having intelligence.The love and care from the first two movies is completely absent, almost to the point of disrespecting the characters and fans. The whole film screams money grab as if putting time and care into the third movie would have somehow degraded the box office results. This was certainly the low point in the series. Wolverine was bad but tolerable, and First Class got it back to being interesting. It's a terrible follow up and I sincerely hope that they simply reboot the franchise so we can see Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean, etc. as comic fans truly know and love them.",4,1,2,3 June 2011
I Am Legend," Forget the Theatrical Version, Watch the Alternate Ending
","Simply put, the theatrical ending is the happy, Hollywood ending. The alternate (note that it's also the original) ending makes the movie make sense, better captures the spirit of the book, and is just better.I enjoyed the movie in theaters. Perhaps because I never read the book nor seen the other versions so I had absolutely no expectations. Since then I have read the book (a must read) and at least seen Last Man on Earth (no masterpiece either). Though I realize what the movie did wrong I still like it.From an adaptation standpoint, it's really lousy. Except for the name, a dog, and creatures that come out at night there's very little in common. That's not necessarily bad. It's an updated version of an old book written in a different time with a different mode of thinking. This does bring it to modern times. As a movie, it's good. Not great, just good. The first half is a great movie, it's the rest that falls apart.Neville is enjoyable, though the dog seems to be the best character. You can tell that his quest to stay sane may actually be driving him insane. The scenes of isolation are fun. The scene in the building is definitely scary. Sam's death is sad. I think if they had actually shown what happened to his wife it would have ruined the scene(s). The CGI used to make NYC empty looks fantastic. If the movie had kept up the first half it would have been great.The movie starts to descend when Neville attacks the Darkseekers on the seaport. First, the CGI for the creatures is terrible. Why is it that CGI looks worse 14 YEARS after Jurassic Park? I heard that they actually did go with make-up and prosthetics but it didn't look convincing so they went to CGI. Could it really have looked that much worse? The creatures are fine in the dark when you hardly see them. But they're simply not scary to see especially so clearly. It's not scary when it's clearly not real. And why are they suddenly superhuman? Why are they jumping and climbing like Spider-Man? Adding Anna and Ethan makes it weird(er), not simply because of the plot holes it brings up. Showing up at just the right moment seemed like deus ex machina, not that the scene really was going anywhere. It's almost like they didn't know how to end it so they added those two and this Vermont colony to give it some semblance of an end destination.Then there's the big climax. Where do I begin?It needs to be put into context. Originally, Neville realized that the creatures had made their own society (much like the book) and gave back the female. He apologized, they all left, and he realized he had been the monster. That version humanized them, proved Neville wrong about human behavior being completely absent, and explained a great deal of their behavior. But the studio didn't like that so they came up with the feel- good ending the theaters saw. Then they really were just monsters, mindless, uncompromising, wanted only destruction, and Neville is the undoubted good guy. The Hollywood ending. The lousy attempt to copy the ending to Smith's earlier movie Independence Day.But it doesn't make sense. It needlessly created more plot holes. How could they remake his own trap? How can the Alpha-Male control the others or the dogs? How can they plan an attack? Why are they so against him suddenly? Even by Hollywood standards, having Neville blow himself up to save humanity is too narcissistic. And going to Vermont is like the theatrical ending to Blade Runner. It's completely out of sync with the dystopian world seen before that.The reason it was changed: the Iraq War. The movie is a response to it, but the different endings give different responses (think the minor change in the ending to the '78 Body Snatchers remake versus the original). The original ending brings into question our (USA's) true role there. That maybe, the US could be the monsters just as Neville is and our enemies may have some motive beyond total destruction. The theatrical ending is pure patrioticness. 'We will fight and we WILL win.' We are undoubtedly good and they are undoubtedly bad. Yes, because Heaven forbid that humanity (specifically America) isn't absolutely perfect and our enemies aren't simply monsters. How dare the line between good and evil isn't clear cut and (shockingly enough) blurred. Notice how the colony is so over the top Americana with the perfect little white church and the large US flag in the background. It's completely designed to pump you up and make you feel good. This undermines the theme of the book and the fact that humanity did this to itself.The alternate ending doesn't fix all the movie's mistakes, but it makes it far better. If it had ended as originally intended it probably would be seen in a better light. I recommend to anyone to see the alternate ending. Even if you didn't like the theatrical version it's worth a look. It gives the movie an entirely different tone and at least touches on the book's themes. Theatrically, it's a 5 out of 10. Half is good, half is bad. The original ending kicks it up a few notches so the ending has some saving grace.",7,0,1,18 October 2008
Cars 2," How the Mighty have Fallen
","We hoped it would never happen, but no one is perfect. Even the best can stumble. This had to happen eventually. Even the string of terrific Disney's classic films and the 90s Disney Renaissance didn't last forever. I'm afraid that, yes, Pixar has made a bad film.Cars 1 was their least ambitious film. The story was predictable and character development obvious making it their most mediocre film. It was good but it lacked that little extra touch that made their films great. However, they had some great side characters, a heart, and wonderful scenes that elevated it up beyond most other films. But ever since this film's announcement I always wondered why. McQueen had his story and there's not much else to tell. Like Finding Nemo, where else is there to go? And I'd rather see sequels to better movies like The Incredibles, even Bug's Life seems to have more potential. It's easy to see why they made a sequel to it, since all you need to do is go to Disneyland or any Disney Store and see it covered in McQueen and Mater, which happened to be two my of three year-old cousin's first words. Off all the Pixar films, Cars made the most with the merchandise.The biggest problem is the story. Cars 1, while predictable, was touching. Cars 2 has almost no heart or character development. The focus shifts from McQueen to Mater. McQueen had his story in the first and there's little to tell here. He has one character moment that's essentially the same realization as the first film's. The problem with Mater is that he's such a simple character. Everything about him is on the surface for all to see. He's the same person throughout the movie, with one predictable realization which goes no where, that he doesn't warrant his own film. He's like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove. They're both terrific side characters but lack enough complexity for a full story. And Larry the Cable Guy has always been better with the other Blue Collar guys rather than on his own.While Cars 1's highlight was its side characters, this movie almost abandons them. They do nothing. McMissile is a moving plot device and little more. Shiftwell is supposed to be a love interest but lacks any interesting moments. The rest of Radiator Springs basically sit back while McQueen and Mater have all the fun. Their stories and character are pushed aside so Larry can have fun being Mater. Because of this, there are almost no funny little side scenes where characters just have fun being themselves. Instead, most of the humor is derived from seeing Mater do silly things.The look is impressive but not more than anything else Pixar's done. With each movie, the studio has pushed the graphics into new levels. Each movie has had some wow moment where audiences can't help but be amazed by what they're seeing. There were times in Cars 1 when it looked almost real. Cars 2 lacks any wow factor. One of the most impressive sets, Tokyo, were already spoiled by the Tokyo Mater short. This more than anything makes me wonder if Pixar was even trying to up the ante or if they were just using what they had to make a movie a year.Spies and Cars seems to work well together. After all, any Bond or Bourne film will easily demonstrate why the two go together. Indeed, the opening scene on the drilling platform is easily the best with the fast chase and cool gadgets. But they weren't able to properly combine the racing and spy elements, almost as if you're watching two movies at once. There's too much spy stuff for the racing to be interesting, which becomes pointless against the overpowering and overly clichÃ©d spy story. Perhaps Pixar should have set it as simply a spy movie set in the Cars universe and had McQueen and his friends in cameos or as a background story.Another lousy spot is the music. Cars 1 had a terrific soundtrack with excellent uses of popular songs like Life is a Highway and Route 66. But there's not one memorable song or music cue in this movie. Giacchino usually does terrific work like with The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Up. But he too fumbles the ball here. Perhaps he was just uninspired by what he had to work with.Cars is Lasseter's pet project. But I think he's too close to it. He's got that Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy problem. The people around him either were in awe of the man who made Pixar and Toy Story or they were afraid to hurt his feelings since he loves the Cars franchise so much. Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project. But with Lasseter off working more directly with Disney, he really should have had a co-director or perhaps given the reins to someone else like he did with Toy Story 3.I almost rated this movie higher. It is fun while you're watching it, even if as soon as it's over it becomes too easy to pick apart the problems. But this is Pixar. They've dominated the animation market since Toy Story and have been pushing the boundaries at the Academy Awards ever since. To see them stumble with a not-so-great film would be one thing. But they're coming off from two Best Picture nominees to a movie that's simply flashy but with little substance. Kids will love the bright colors and silly antics, but parents will hate having to then buy twelve new Mater toys. Cars 2 is stalled and in need of a tune-up.",5,177,275,24 June 2011
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Still Mindless Fun, Slight Improvement on the First
","I've never been much into the Fantastic Four. I think Thing is dynamic and Doctor Doom is interesting. But I never much cared for the others. They did get interesting in the Civil War when they broke up and started fighting each other. However, I really can't think of a specific FF story that stands out from the others, certainly not like Spider-Man's Death of the Stacys or Iron Man's Armor Wars, other than the coming of Galactus.The first movie was largely a disappointment. But that just means I got my disappointment out of the way and found myself enjoying this one. Sure the problems remain, but they don't seem as crippling. I already know that Doom, Reed, and Sue are miscast so I can merely accept them here for what they are.Everyone does seem to be trying just a little harder this time. Gruffudd is still plodding along with the technical jargon, but he seems a little more comfortable with it. Alba is still there to be breasts that walk with another scene thrown in just to show off her body, but she does show some improvement. Even Tim Story seems to be trying to be more than just mediocre.I really liked how they humbled Johnny this time around, so he isn't merely an arrogant jerk. Sure he tries to be, but they show there's more to him than that. However, I didn't care for how Thing is basically there with not a lot to do. They seemed to lose that tortured inner self that made him so interesting in the first. I also enjoyed the publicly known heroes aspect of the story. Sure, Iron Man 2 did it so much better, but they were the first to try it and there are some interesting aspects in it all.Doctor Doom is a little more, but not entirely, like we know and love him. I like that they show him doing more than just hating everyone else and actually developing some kind of evil scheme. It's just a shame that they didn't push that more.The real stand out of the movie is the Silver Surfer. He stole the spotlight in the original comic story and steals the movie. Surfer is, by far, the most dynamic character in the movie. There's little hints of his story that they would have expanded on in the proposed SS spin-off. Doug Jones is perfect for him. He perfectly captures those iconic Surfer movements. Though I wish they kept his voice rather than bringing on Fishburne, which just seemed unnecessary. Jones fit the voice just fine, and it seems Fishburne was brought on because he was the cool guy from The Matrix.I know many people bemoan the portrayal of Galactus here, but I liked it. Sure they go with the Ultimate Gah Lak Tus cloud rather than the 616 giant, but it's not like the movie is really hurt by not seeing the giant. From what I read, they would have shown the giant Galactus in the SS spin-off. I do appreciate that they left some mystery to it/him to be explored later.Neither of the Fantastic Four movies were anything that could be considered classics. They were more meant to be mindless popcorn films. This one showed that with time they may have made them more than that, but I'm certainly not sad they're not making a third. Brief aside, if they do reboot the series, I truly hope they bring back Evans and Chiklis as they were certainly the bright spots in this dull series.It's fun taking for what it is. But there's still some problems preventing this from being a great film. My rating 7/10.",7,1,2,20 May 2011
The Dark Knight," Nicholson Passes On The Joker Crown
","Ol' Jack's Joker was dark, creepy, funny, and disturbing. A far cry from Cesar Romero. He was cinema's best Clown Prince of Crime. But Ledger's Joker surpasses him in every single way. He's scarier, more disturbing, has more humor, and even more memorable quotes. Sorry Jack, but to quote Prince from Batman '89 'there's a new prince in town.'Ledger basically steals the movie. Every scene he's in is exciting and perfectly made. I once found myself wanting Joker to pop up just because he was always so good. He's so good that you never even think of Ledger as you watch him. You never think of Brokeback Mountain, A Knight's Tale, or the guy who unfortunately died. You only see the psychotic maniac from the comics. It's such a shame that Ledger died thus eliminating Joker from any other sequel, unless they recast which would be quite controversial and not the same.The story is engaging. Largely based of The Long Halloween, except that Joker is pretty much the only freak villain. That's my personal favorite graphic novel and I loved how they adapted it. I liked seeing a villain before he became a villain so you can get to know and feel sorry for him. I only wish that we saw more of Dent before he got scarred.Fanboys certainly will love it. Nolan brings a seriousness to the movie. It all feels like it could happen if someone just went out and did it. Personally, I still love the Burton films. They're both equally good in different ways.As good as the movie is, it's not perfect. It does have it's problems. It does seem like the movie is about half an hour too long. Some things could have been simplified or streamlined. It has that The Lost World problem where it reaches a couple points that are like an ending but keeps going.One problem I had with this, and Batman Begins, was the lack of memorable music. Elfman had such a classic score that I can hum the tune months after not watching the movie or listening to the soundtrack. But I watched the movie today, and listened to the soundtrack on the way, but I can barely remember any specific song. The music is good, don't get me wrong. I like listening to it and it sets the mood. But it's like whipped cream. Good and adds flavor but nothing substantial.Joker monologues at the end. Didn't they watch The Incredibles where Syndrome talks about villains who monologue? It's one of those things that's been parodied so much that it seems silly when it does happen.I don't care for Two-Face's motivation at the end. The Long Halloween handled him so much better. The movie, he's out for personal revenge. While in TLH he was finishing the quest. The whole novel Dent's trying to take down Falcone and once he's Two-Face he just does it without the law. It was like he was a twisted version of Batman, doing what needed to be done but not necessarily in a good way. I love the idea that Two-Face is an evil version of Batman. But this movie he was just evil. And I certainly don't like that he allowed himself to be manipulated by Joker, that Two-Face did what he said to. Two-Face should do these things out of his own twisted sense of justice, not because a psychopath said to introduce anarchy.The Bat-Sonar seemed too fantastic an idea. Hooking up every single cell phone in the city to make a sonic map of everything? I can see listening in on every phone to find the Joker but using it to see just disconnected me from the reality of the movie too much. And it looked like it was out of a Wachowski Brother's movie, confusing to look at.Overall this is a must see film for any Batman fan, comic book reader, or even a casual film fan. It's fun, exciting, and every minute is entertaining. It's nice to see that audiences are taking movies like The Dark Knight and Iron Man seriously, and not just viewing it as guys in spandex fighting other guys in spandex. I wouldn't call it the best movie ever. And I can't clearly say it's the best Batman movie (Burton had a certain quirkiness). But it's better than 95% of the films being made. This movie is going to be remembered for decades to come.",10,4,9,30 July 2008
Thor," Excellent Introduction to the Expansive Marvel Lore
","I have to say that Thor is my current favorite of Marvel's movies, though tied with Iron Man at the moment. I absolutely loved every single moment of it.While I love Thor, I have to admit I don't really know too much about him. Like Iron Man before, I knew of him and some basics about the character but not enough to know much going into the movie. I watched the Hulk vs Thor animated video and his few appearances on animated series. While I am learning and reading more about him, I certainly didn't know him like I do Spider-Man, the X-Men, or Batman. Like Iron Man, this movie really makes me want to learn more about his history and read his comics. Perhaps my inexperience with him made me more open to the movie.I loved how it was a superhero origin story that wasn't just like every other single origin story. It isn't the usual 'man discovers powers, man learns powers, man uses powers to become hero.' Thor's already the hero with powers. He has to learn to use them wisely. Thor's whole story arc was terrific. I especially love the moment when Mjolnir returns to Thor. It was especially powerful and people were even cheering at that.The cast was perfect from top to bottom. Not a single miscast actor or badly delivered line. These characters could easily come off cheesy, especially if they started spouting out too many thee's, thou's and verily's. Instead they're seriously done interpretations of how they would interact in the modern world.The characterizations were wonderful. I loved Thor in every scene. From his arrogance in Asgard to his fish-out-of- water on Earth. Loki was the best and most dynamic villain since X-Men's Magneto. It's hard to tell whether the God of Mischief is sincere or just plotting his plans. Even the smaller parts were wonderful.Of anything, Kenneth Branagh and Thor were made for each other. His sensibilities derived from his Shakespeare works combined perfectly with the style that Jon Favreau started with the universe. He had an excellent combination of action and humor without any one element overwhelming the others.I thought the 3D was very effective. It was spectacular in the Asgard and Jotunheim sequences. Though I also thought it looked good in the Earth scenes. 3D can easily get gimmicky with things popping out into the audience, or it can be completely unnecessary and a distraction. Thor does neither. It really helps to project the majesty of Asgard, the dark looming of Jotunheim, and the expansiveness of New Mexico.The music was one of the best I have heard in quite some time. I went purchased the soundtrack as soon as I could find it. It perfectly blends the epicness of the battle sequences with the more subtle moments between two charactersI have only two things I don't like about the film. First, was that Hawkeye was basically a waste and completely unnecessary. It seemed to be in there just to have an obligatory cameo than anything else. Two, that they didn't expand on the Thor and Sif love story like they should have. She's supposed to be Thor's love interest since childhood. I read one comic where she was very jealous of Amora and Brunnhilde. But there's not one shot or mention of her reacting to Jane and Thor's relationship.Like Iron Man, the movie was so much fun and enjoyable that I easily overlooked any flaws. It helped to set up The Avengers without focusing too much on it, like what happened to Iron Man 2. I certainly look forward to more.My rating: 10/10",10,1,4,9 May 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A Popcorn Film
","What I mean by popcorn isn't the stuff you take in the theater with you, but that like popcorn the film has little nutritional value. That's what Michael Bay does. He doesn't make wholesome stuff like Dark Knight or Wall-E. He isn't trying to. Why? Because we eat it up anyways. Should we expect better? Yes. Should we eat better? Yes. Are we going to stop? No. There will always be a place for popcorn and the Michael Bay film.Michael Bay. You either tolerate him or you hate him. He is who he is and he doesn't try to be anyone else. I don't care for him but don't hate him. If you've seen his other films you know what you're getting. They are all basically the same loud explosions and hot women. His films should be better, and would be if they were handled by someone else, but if you take them for what they are they're usually enjoyable.This film is more of the same. If you saw T1 you know what to expect. If you loved the first you'll probably enjoy this one. If you didn't care for T1 your opinion won't change. Some stuff is better, some is worse, and some is exactly the same.What's better?Now that we know the story the movie dives right into good old robot action. Now instead of five minutes of people being told what's going on they can just do things. They don't have to explain who Optimus is, he can just transform, roll out, and kick butt.Bay figured out how to show the bots fighting in the film. Last time the camera was five feet away and you couldn't tell who's foot or arm that was and what was going on. This time Bay pulled the camera back so we could see the robots in their full glory. A vast improvement.Speaking of robot action, Optimus kicks serious butt. In the first he had two fights, one was too short and the other he was mostly losing. This time he's taking on three at once and he's fighting enemies twice his size. Optimus fans won't be disappointed.The Decepticons actually get their own scenes and get to do more than just spout a line or two and randomly destroy things. Megatron and Starscream get more bickering. It's not quite like their original series appearance but they do more than in T1.In T1 the Autobot's dialog, especially in their intro, were too campy. This time it's much more real. They're not talking like an 80s cartoon anymore but like someone from today. There's no Optimus saying 'My bad.'What's the same?Plenty of big, fun, loud action sequences. If you don't like those things, why are you going to see a Michael Bay film? It's what he does and he does it well. The explosions and CGI look top notch.Megan Fox continues to be the best looking character in the film. Bay isn't afraid to show he is a man. He clearly loves making hot women look sexy. More than he likes making robots look cool.Bay can't figure out what to cut from the film. There's still too many scenes that distract from the plot and go on far too long. There was Sam looking for the glasses in the first, and there's Judy getting high in this one. Bay may love that character and think those scenes are the best but they could have been cut down and the movie would flow so much better. I just wanted those scenes to get over with and move on. There's a dozen scenes that simply go on too long that could have been cut down and gotten the same effect. A half hour could have easily have been cut.What's worse?The Twins will go down as Bay's Jar Jar Binks. Like Jar Jar you can't help but notice the racial undertones. Bay's reasoning that he wants more personality in the bots is a poor excuse for useless racism. Like Jar Jar they pull attention away from other useful bots. They serve no purpose in the story other than to be funny. Like Jar Jar their humor is poor and pulls attention from the successful humor of Bumblebee. Bumblebee was a great comedic relief because it didn't come off as stupid, but this time he has few funny moments.There's about 40 bots in the film but only 8 or 9 are explored in any way. It's nice that they included more fan favorites but not when you rarely see them let alone hear them speak. I would have much preferred that Arcee taken the Twin's places in the story. She might have given Mikaela someone to talk to rather than complaining. While Starscream and Megatron have more time all the other returning bots have less.This movie is all over the place in terms of plot. The first was simple: find the Allspark and protect it. This film they're trying to defeat the Decepticons, protect Sam, find a couple of different objects, destroy some machine, and defeat the Fallen. Problem is there's so little plot to begin with that dividing it up makes it worse.The first one blew me away because it was so much better than I thought it would be. This one is about what I expect from Bay. I enjoyed it but not quite like the first one. The first one I wished that there were a few things better. This one I wish there were a lot of things better.",6,1,4,25 June 2009
Scream 2," Exception to the Sequel Rule
","In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them.Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better.With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way.Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILERThe cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as 'evil' as Billy did.Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original.Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.",10,3,4,16 October 2012
Dark Shadows," Poor Effort from Burton
","I don't know what to make of this movie. I really don't. It tries to do so many things and ends up doing nothing. The plot is all over the place. There's a lot going on so it's hard to find the important details.I've been a fan of Tim Burton as long as I can remember. I grew up watching his two Batman films, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands. I've followed his work from Pee-wee's Big Adventure through Big Fish. His recent efforts (Planet of the Apes, Alice in Wonderland) have noticeably lacked his earlier charm. I've only been disappointed with two of his movies: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which was more due to how good the original is) and now Dark Shadows.The movie is based on a Gothic soap opera from the 60s and 70s. Johnny Depp plays a vampire who awakes to find his dysfunctional descendants plagued by the witch who made him. I have very vague memories of the show, mostly when I caught the last five minutes while waiting for The Incredible Hulk on Sci-Fi Channel. I know little about the series, and it seems the movie is made for fans of the show with little effort to create new ones. Besides Barnabas and Angelique, there's little development in the other characters. They all have the occasional scene but nothing memorable. These seem mostly to reference some event in the show and not really help the movie in any significant way. Worse yet, Angelique makes a horrible villain. She has no reason to act other than she loves a man who doesn't love her. The whole time I kept waiting for some dynamic motivation that never appeared.The movie is trying to be a comedy, Gothic horror, and romantic drama but never really succeeding at any. The problem is, anytime the movie starts getting into one particular genre it changes gears. The separate elements never really blend together. I understand that the show has a certain camp factor to it, but I've read that this was mostly unintentional. Perhaps if they had simply made it a comedic Hammer films style film, or romantic comedy, or Gothic romance. But the three together never work as a cohesive whole.The finale (not really spoiling anything here) is representative of all the problems of the movie. By the time the third act came out I had somewhat zoned out. I knew what was going on, but simply didn't care. It felt like the movie was just going through a series of checkpoints but without any feeling. There are revelations that mostly come out of nowhere, but apparently are based on the show. The whole thing screams of committee filmmaking, like the studio put too many demands on the film without letting Burton be Burton. Either that, or since Depp and Burton were such fans of the show they tried to hit too many major story points and forgetting to make it into a single film. It's okay to cut stuff out for a sequel. The first Terminator and Indiana Jones films cut out material that they ended up putting into the second. It's okay to not include every single idea.Had the movie stuck with the fish out of water story, this would have been great. The best scenes are Barnabas encountering 'modern' life like roads, television, and pot-smoking hippies. Depp makes these moments quite hilarious. I found the line confusing McDonalds with Satan to be very effective.The only really good thing about the movie is that Burton certainly has his unique look. He is definitely one of the most visually distinct directors out there, if not the most. Every frame of the movie has his visual stamp on it.Honestly, I can't really recommend this to anyone. It's not even an okay-at-best effort from Burton like Alice in Wonderland was. The movie won't win over any new fans for the show. And fans of the show will probably find this to be little more than a overly-silly CliffNotes version. It's too dark to be a comedy and too silly to be a drama. The series is fondly remembered. The movie won't be.",5,2,3,30 November 2012
Scream," Modern Horror Classic
","Scream was made at a time when slashers were on their way out. Michael, Jason, and Freddy had lost their touch. They were battling psychics, going to New York, and all sorts of weird stories that went completely against what the franchises built themselves on. Wes Craven had some luck with with New Nightmare, a meta return to the franchise he built. But it was this movie that really rebuilt the genre and brought it back to glory.The movie is about a group of horror movie buffs who find themselves in a horror movie. Much like the original Friday the 13th, there is a mystery as to who the killer(s) is. It focuses on Sidney, the incredibly sexy Neve Campbell, whose mother was killed a year before and learns how she is tied to the killings. They are all aware of the movies this film references.New Nightmare may have been the first, but Scream was the first to popularize the idea of self-aware characters. Any movie buff will recognize the references (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Prom Night, etc) beyond those the movie directly references. The movie is a love letter to the genre and will make film buffs out of anyone. I know this movie is probably the reason I'm such a film buff, particularly of horror movies, myself.I love that the movie is a mystery. There's so few horror movies that include mystery aspects. The original Friday the 13th tried it, but Ms. Voorhees came out of nowhere. Prom Night did it, but the killer was pretty obvious. This is very much like an Agatha Christie story. The suspects are all there, and they're all guilty until they're gutted or the mask is taken off. The reveal is quite satisfying. Their motivation is fitting. Screams 3 and 4 would be disappointing, but this one was really good. And the movie just gets better with multiple viewings so you can see new layers to the real killer throughout the movie.The cast is good. Campbell looks great and is a great heroine along the lines of Alien's Ripley. McGowan isn't just a dumb, horny blonde. Cox proves she isn't just her Friends character. Arquette is hilarious. Though it's Lillard and Kennedy who steal the movie. The two are terrific and hilarious in every scene they're in, especially the 'Rules of Horror' scene. My only complaint is that Ulrich looks a little too 'evil,' though he otherwise does a great job. They all are convincing as high school students.Of course, what really makes this movie great is the frights. This is an incredibly effective scary movie. Like all the best slasher films, this one relies on suspense over gore. There's plenty of blood, but it's the build up to the kills that really scare people. The opening scene is probably one of the best in the genre. Anyone can make a person jump and enough gore will gross even those with the best stomachs, but suspense is the best way to really scare someone. The movie really spends the time to make you care about the characters, so when their time comes you're actually rooting for them rather than the killer, the main problem with later Friday the 13th films. This is one that will have you hiding behind blankets and pillows on your first watch.The movie's use of cell phones may date the film somewhat, but Scream is a terrific film otherwise. The movie knows the genre and is one of the best of it. This is a can't miss for any horror fan, and will likely make some new fans.",9,1,1,13 October 2012
X-Men: First Class," Makes X-Men Interesting Again
","X-Men has been up and down the last decade. Singer's two movies were terrific, showcasing the complexity of the X-Men universe. Then came the over-bloated The Last Stand. Wolverine was a slight improvement but it can't be argued that it's anything more than mediocre. Fox needed something to redeem the mutants' saga and they did it.Singer returns, though only as producer, and brings sensibility and intelligence back. Vaughn brings a terrific sense of style to the movie that hasn't been seen since Singer left. The story deals with the formation of the X-Men, which was briefly alluded to in the first movie. It's an interesting time period to show because Xavier can still walk, Magneto is good, and mutants aren't widely known to the general public. Like the movies, the comics have alluded to this period quite a bit but not shown much of it. Like Batman Begins, it's great to see how the characters all became the people we know.The acting is good all around. McAvoy and Fassbender really hit it out of the park. Those two really disappear into the role and make them their own. The Charles-Erik relationship was the highlight of the movie as it is in the first film. Lawrence is great as a young and innocent Mystique, though I wish she had a stronger story. It's a bit inconsistent as she's in love with Charles, Beast, and then Erik, plus her 'accepting who she is' moment is rather forced. Kevin Bacon also does a terrific job. Unfortunately he's such a recognizable face all I can see is the guy from Footloose and Tremors. The rest of the cast is good but not great. Beast and Moira have plenty of good moments. But the rest are mostly there to fulfill plot points.It's not quite as violent as Vaughn's Kick-Ass but it gets bloody especially as Erik goes on his Nazi hunt. Many people die, though some seem included just to die. The action is exciting and should keep you in suspense. Though, the problem with any prequel is that we know how certain characters will end up. There's plenty of humor to break up the action and exposition. From little one-liners to recurring gags, it's often laugh-out-loud funny. Though they overuse the joke regarding Xavier's hair.Although it never really reaches the heights of Singer's two X-Men movies. There are a couple problems that keep it from being perfect. First, I wish the movie would decide between being a reboot or prequel. It's a fine movie on its own, but its indecision drags it down for someone who, like me, has followed the franchise and loves (most but not all) the movies. There's numerous references to the previous movies including a recreation of X-Men's first scene and cameos by Jackman and Romijn. But then there's things like building Cerebro, Magneto's helmet, and time line issues that couldn't possibly make it fit with the others. Imagine if Batman Begins tried to be a loose prequel to Burton's Batman. I love them both but would like Begins just a little less if they tried to include Burton references. I know the producers weren't concerned with continuity. But I would have preferred if they would decide between being its own entity or a part of the team.While the 1960s are a fascinating time regarding civil rights, the film doesn't really exploit that at all. Besides a few groovy's from Xavier and Frost's hair style, it never really felt like the 60s. They all acted like modern day people, especially the kids. Then there's no real mention of then-current politics. The Cuban Missile Crisis was just a brief side story for the real plan. But there's no mention of MLK or Malcolm X, the two inspirations for Xavier and Magneto, and nothing about civil rights protests. Since the government is introduced to mutants in the movie no one knows about them yet so there's no way they could have the time for anything like the Registration Act, Sentinels, or the Friends of Humanity hate group. Besides the Missile Crisis and the age of Erik and Charles it could have been set in any period. It's a wasted opportunity.The movie has one problem in common with Wolverine, it's trying to get to that Pre-X-Men point too quickly. (Only SPOILER related paragraph) Both movies try to introduce so much about the world AND get it to that familiar point that it shortchanges the characters more than they should. We know that Charles looses the use of his legs and that he and Erik split up. But this was supposed to be the first in a new trilogy, so why burn through so much of the story at once? It's like if The Phantom Menace ended with Anakin becoming Darth Vader. That prequel trilogy spent more time building up the relationship between the two heroes so when one did fall, like Magneto will, it was all the more tragic. Here, we got a glimpse of the Charles-Erik relationship but it felt like it only lasted weeks when it should have been years. Like Star Wars, they should have ended the trilogy with Magneto's turn as they never truly befriended each other here.Now don't take my last three points as meaning I disliked the film. I loved it. They're just things I wished they improved on. Otherwise it's a terrific film that did what it needed to most importantly, make X-Men interesting again. No more dumb things like killing Cyclops in five minutes or making Deadpool mute. They can finally get back on track towards making the franchise fun for fans and audiences alike. But please, just pick whether it's a prequel or reboot, but not try to do both.",8,0,1,13 June 2011
X2: X-Men United," Expertly Shows That Comics Aren't Just Kid Stories
","Everything that the first movie did well, the second did better. More action, more characters, more story lines, more superpowers, more humor, more of everything. But never at any time does it feel over-bloated like The Last Stand and Wolverine would. It all works and flows together well.The story is an expertly crafted continuation of the first's. I don't know how much of this they had in mind when they made the first, but the two compliment each other very well. Singer really pushes his craft harder this time. The mansion attack is suspenseful, the Iceman confession is hilarious, the battles are exciting, and the deaths tragic. I would have loved to see what Singer could have done with the third had Fox not gotten overly controlling and he left to do Superman.The movie shows off what makes the X-Men comics so beloved, it's not about fighting villains but fighting the ills of society. The X-Men have always fought more against prejudice and that has never been better demonstrated than this movie. The best X-Men stories have always been showing them fight normal humans and their hatred, such as Graydon Creed and the Friends of Humanity. Additionally, showing the X-Men teaming with the Brotherhood is terrific since Magneto has always worked better as an anti-heroic antagonist rather than plain old villain.The returning actors are even better, and the new cast are equally good. It's nice to see Mystique, Rogue, and Storm all get more to do. I know many people complain that Wolverine has so much focus, but it's still handled well and won't get too much until The Last Stand. Alan Cumming is terrific even through all the make up. Kelly Hu is creepy and terrifying. Aaron Stanford has fun with his near-psychotic nature. But it's Brian Cox that really steals the movies. His gleefully dangerous Stryker is one of the best villains ever. The end escape scene really demonstrates many of the actor's better moments.My only disappointment is that Cyclops is given less to do this film. The Logan-Jean-Scott love triangle is still there, but he's not even a part of it. He has one short fight scene and one dramatic scene and that's about it. Of course, it's even worse in The Last Stand where he basically has a cameo.It's tragic that a worthy follow-up was not meant to be given how wonderful this movie is. This one set up so much that the third should have paid off so well. The movie was one of the first to really demonstrate the complex and complicated nature of superheroes. It's still one of the best in the genre.",10,0,1,1 June 2011
Fantastic Four," Plays it Safe, Becomes Lackluster
","Fantastic Four was certainly not the best, but neither was it the worst comic book adaptation. I was mostly underwhelmed by it. I'll sit through it, but I won't go out of my way to see it. I ended up with a lackluster 'meh' feeling.It came out when comic books were just getting started and didn't do anything to stand out from the crowd. It came out after Spider-Man, X-Men, Blade, Hulk, Daredevil, and Punisher, all of which were origins. Rather than do anything different, it just followed the established and already well-worn origin format. It was practically following the same exact beats and scenes as Spider-Man and Hulk. There was nothing about it to stand out from the crowd.As said, the casting is hit and miss. Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans are terrific, almost perfectly cast. They are exactly as I imagine when I read the comics. If they did a reboot, I would greatly appreciate if those two returned. Ioan Gruffudd is mostly uninteresting. He doesn't do anything interesting. He does have Reed's bumbling social awkwardness, but not the intelligence. Jessica Alba was terrible casting, merely there for a 'big' name in the credits. I assume that when people said 'big name' the producers heard 'bra size.' She is absolutely nothing like the comic version. And they just threw in scenes to show off her body without much reason, like the bridge rescue.And they completely missed what makes Doctor Doom so great. He's one of comic book's greatest villains. Here, he's nothing. First, they made the mistake of going with his Ultimate version rather than the far more interesting main universe. Then, he does nothing for most of the movie except hate everyone else. Julian McMahon tries hard, but he isn't given much to work with.The special effects were good. Mister Fantastic and Human Torch looked cool. Though it isn't too hard to make a woman invisible. I absolutely loved that they did Thing in practical make up since it looks so much more realistic than anything they could do digitally. And it wasn't just some crappy TMNT-copycat.Considering that there are four superheroes, there's surprisingly little action. There's the space station disaster, the rescue on the bridge, and the end battle. It's mostly technical jargon from people reading a script, with none giving the impression they know what it means. And the action just doesn't give the time necessary to build up anticipation and make people care about what's going on. It's okay for what it is, but too many other movies have done it better.It's an okay, middle of the road movie, neither terrible nor terrific. It played it safe to make money for the studio and didn't excite anyone. I did think that the second movie improved on a lot of aspects. But I am no where near sad that they decided not to make a third in this series.",6,0,2,18 May 2011
Valkyrie," A Great Cast Drives This Excellent Thriller
","This is an enjoyable movie. It isn't quite as different as The Usual Suspects but it's still an intriguing film. The German channel ZDF summed it up well: Valkyrie is 'neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century...Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film.' The story is suspenseful, filled with tension to keep you glued to it. It isn't bogged down with pointless side stories to add needless drama. 'Will he do it for the world or will he chicken out to be with his family?' There's already enough going on with just trying to get it all planned out and get everyone on board. The movie's like the characters, know what needs to be done and just goes for it. And I liked that they didn't delve into every character's back story and reason for trying to kill Hitler. It's 2008/09. We know there's plenty of reasons for people to kill the man. Besides, that would have just added twenty to thirty minutes of dialog and exposition just to say that Hitler is bad.This proved to be a great role for Tom Cruise. For once he doesn't just break out in a run for some random reason trying to be an action star. Here he goes back to what he's good at, like his older roles in A Few Good Men or Rain Man. He's a good actor but not when he's running around. Maybe we can finally forget about him on the couch and think of his acting.The rest of the cast works perfectly. Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and the ever lovable Terence Stamp are all in top form. There doesn't seem to be a single person who could be replaced with someone better.The production values are great, certainly nothing is done half-hearted. Everything looks amazing and is well done, the kind of touch Bryan Singer brings. I like all of Singer's movies. Usual Suspects, X-Men 1 & 2, and even Superman Returns. He's no Christopher Nolan or Steven Spielberg but he's still a fine director.My only real problem with the movie is I wish there was some extra punch to it. This is a real historical account. Therefore we already know how it ends. Anyone who would see this movie should have enough education from grade school to know that this plot didn't kill Hitler. This is the problem that faced the Star Wars prequel trilogy. How to make it engaging when the audience knows the ending. He did a good job but I feel he could have gone further. Maybe Singer should have taken a page from Nolan's book and made it non-linear. Perhaps played up the suspense of Hitler trying to communicate before the plotters succeeded. Or something a little more that would have pushed it from a good movie to great one.It's an exciting thriller that I recommend to everyone. It showcases not only an important event but one of the best parts of humanity. The plotters weren't saints but normal, average human beings trying to be good. They stood up in the midst of insurmountable odds to do what is right. And the fact that it was all true made it all the more touching.And in the end it did what all movies should aspire to do: I left wanting to see it again.",8,14,20,12 January 2009
