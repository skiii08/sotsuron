It," Hello, Georgie
","Watched it a second times yesterday, and it was even better. People expect it to be over-the-top scary, but if you've read the book, you can relate to the 'lack of horror'. I think it's more about children's fantasy, their deep-rooted fears (I mean, as a kid you're basically afraid of everything), the struggle as an outsider, Derry's background and the craziness of it's people.
Always admired Stephen King's style in developing his characters. The plot doesn't evolve because of scary clowns and faces, its just like an extra topping to portray a disturbed and cruel nd exaggerated reality.So whenever it's an adaption, I don't try to compare it to the first ('original') version, neither to the book, except it's from the same author/director. It's impossible to put thousand of pages into a two-hours movie. It's the default that ruins every movie. See it as an own/individual piece.To sum it up: i fell in love with Bill's love for his little brother, as much as for Pennywise. Great acting, great visuals. See it through the eyes of a child and you'll see the terror.
Can't wait for chapter two.",9,0,1,25 August 2019
The Irishman," A Mafioso and his story
","It really feels like an old man telling his story, about how things used to be back then in the 1950/60sMelancholic with a subtle touch of understated roughness in times of a mafioso. Some sort of gentle drama: no rushed action, not extremely emotionally loaded, but still captivating, characters are built carefully & the confrontation with guilt and loyalty.Beautiful end of an era for incredible actors like De Niro, Al Pacino and Pesci.",9,2,5,4 December 2019
Joker," 'You don't really understand an antagonist until you understand why he's a protagonist in his own version of the world'
","Such a sad movie with a consuming psychological depth. a dark portrayal of a character with an iconic and sorrowful laugh, who slowly collapses under the pressuring circumstances. great soundtracks and beautiful acting.
it seems to be an everyday tragic but it still touches you in a new and different way of raw & haunting reality. the best part: another interpretation of the joker. his disoriented and 'unintentionally' actions are full of desperation, (always had a weak spot whenever I saw people hurting inside, and he definitely hit that). it really feels like the beginning of all - of how arthur becomes the joker.",10,5,9,18 October 2019
