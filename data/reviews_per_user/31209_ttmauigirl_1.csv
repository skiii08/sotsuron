Walk the Line," A special movie
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Reese Witherspoon is a beautiful star rising in this film. Joauquin Phoniex does an amazing job in this spectacular film and so do all the other people who play a role. Johnny Cash went through a tough time with drugs ,marriage and alcoholism.But,when he married June C. Cash he turned his life around. June, is truly a great person inside and out and even though I didn't meet her I would of loved too. With heartfelt music and timeless actresses and actors , I would DEFENITLEY recommend this movie to everyone! And ,it had such an amazing effect on me that I'm going to buy the movie in a few days !!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,0,22 February 2006
