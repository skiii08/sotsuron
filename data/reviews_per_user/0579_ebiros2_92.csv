The Avengers," Avengers Assemble !!
","Looks like another parallel universe version of the Avengers. In the original comic, Hulk was on a rampage, and they got together to stop him. In this version, they got together to stop Loki.So, truly all star cast assembled to make this much anticipated movie. I like the fact that all the actors really look their part except Nick Fury. He kept reminding me of all things, the Red Skull.It's difficult to come up with an enemy that's big enough to warrant an Avengers assemble. Joss Whedon was the first director to successfully direct the motion of the Hulk. Hulk looked most realistic in this movie. He also must have been a long time Marvel comic fan, because all the other characters' best moves were captured in this movie.I liked Captain America in this movie lot more than the Captain America movie. I knew that he would shine much more in a contemporary surroundings.Looking forward for part 2.",10,3,7,26 August 2012
Angels & Demons," NIce idea but ...
","I'm not sure how to rate this movie. I just felt that this movie was phony in some way, and couldn't get involved with the story. Nothing wrong with the movie. It's well made, but the information brought up seemed so fake, and this made the clues forced. Plausible, but not probable best describes everything that goes on in this movie. People's interaction especially seemed unreal, and scripted. It's probably an elaborate disinformation tactic of some sort - to what end I really don't know, but effort at 'selling' the idea and the story seemed to be there. The bottom line is one shouldn't take the premise of this movie as bona fide fact, and should watch it as entertainment.",4,0,0,7 October 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not a bad sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy
","After 4 years of since World's End, Capt. Jack is back on a new adventure. This one is much better formulated than the World's End, and story is more linear without taking so many detour on side plots.For 250 million dollars, this is bit tame, but considering that 56 million went to Johnny Depp, the actual budget of the movie is almost par with some other movies made in recent years. Jack and Barbossa embark on search for Ponce De Leon's fountain of Youth (BTW this is anachronism because Ponce De Leon never found the fountain of youth). Because there's a clear target, story is much easier to understand than Dead Man's Chest, or World's End, but there's still too many side plots. For instance the story would have been fine without introducing Black Beard, but the malady of the plot is similar to those found in the World's End - trying to put too many different elements to the story.The biggest drawback of this film is that things happens in the dark about 50% of the time, and detracts from the interesting sceneries that could have been there instead.There seems to be less focus on Capt. Jack on this movie compared to the trilogy. The focus is more on the story itself. They should focus more on the perfect Jack Sparrow moment like they did in the Curse of the Black Pearl. There's also a lack of antagonist for Jack Sparrow like Lord Carrington who intensely despises Jack for who he is, but actually creates good moments as Jack gets to mock him in his own unique ways. So I think Pirates Of the Caribbean should get back to its roots, and refocus on Capt. Jack, but it might be too late for that, as Jack's mystique is waning after four movies. But it's still a fun movie to watch that doesn't fail to entertain.",Null,0,1,19 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Better than the first HULK....but
","For old time HULK fan, the story didn't quite make it. Whenever Hollywood messes with Stan Lee's plot, it always seems to come out worse. The plot is pure Hollywood - movie trying to put one action scene after another, but nothing innovative about cars being tossed around or chopper coming crashing down, or soldiers chasing Bruce Banner. What I'm complaining here is - it didn't capture the essence of the HULK. It was just a busy movie. HULK CG also didn't capture the subtle character of the HULK either. Good was Edward Norton as Dr. Banner. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was somewhat of a mismatch also. I think they teach method acting to the actors, but do the actors really have the time to assimilate the characters that are fleshed out so well by Stan Lee ? Maybe that's not the point since Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow did a pretty credible job of portraying Tony Stark and Pepper Pots in Ironman. I think Ironman's success was it wasn't a Hollywood production, but Marvel had ownership of the production. So I guess my wish for the future of the HULK is - Marvel will take on the production, and nail the great story with subtleties that only the owner of that culture can put into the scenes.",6,1,4,18 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How can one do this....?
","I think everyone I've talked to who've seen this movie was disappointed one way or another. My reaction was 'What was that !?'. I couldn't believe that I just saw a movie that had 'Star Wars' as part of its title. It was just like another bad sci-fi movie that didn't have any good plot or memorable characters in it. Usage of CGI was unrestrained and got annoying after a while. I felt like saying 'Okay, I see that you got lots of money and people to use on computer graphics; stop it already.' and what's worse, they didn't look all that realistic. The magic of the first 3 Star Wars saga was gone on this movie, where visual effects were truly revolutionary, and the concept unquestionably so also. This was just another sci-fi movie. Well, what's wrong with that ? Lucas raised his own bars and couldn't match his earlier efforts despite the massive usage of computers. It makes you think what makes a great movie, if putting unlimited resources on to a project isn't the answer.",4,2,5,11 December 2005
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Worst of the Series
","Bella is finally tying the knots with Cullen, but marriage between vampire and human brings unusual side effects both physically, and socially.I thought maybe I was the only one who didn't enjoy this movie, but was pleasantly surprised to find such low rating here.The problem with the movie was that it had practically no story to it.I also think the story would have been much more interesting if Bella had married Jacob instead of Edward. Did I also sense that Robert Patterson is running out of steam ? The both actors didn't have enough maturity to carry out the love scenes. Their marriage looked so fake.One thing I liked was the new home Bella and Cullen settled into. It's a nice mixture of modern and wild. I wish I had a home like that.This is by far the worst of the series. If Part 2 continues this way, it'll be a dud for sure.",4,6,7,2 February 2012
The Expendables 2," Good all star cast action film
","It's an all star cast action movie featuring just about all the A list action stars in one film.This is the second installment of the Expendables, and Silvester Stallone, and Jet Li reprises their role. Other notable luminaries includes Arnold Scwarzenegger, Jean Clayde Van Damme, Bruce Willis, Dolph Lundgrean, and Chuck Norris. If there's one negative about this movie, it's that the story is too derivative. Characters are all clich√©, and their sad stories about their life is the same. The scene where they sojourn about their past episodes, etc. are all identical to other action movies from the past. It's typical hero stuff, and is not bad, but it would have been better if the story and action had a new tack to it.All the actors are in great shape and I'm happy to see them in action again. If the production was better, especially the script, this would have been a better movie.",7,2,3,19 December 2012
Memento," It's a gimmick but who cares !?
","The story changes track every 5 minutes, and is a torture to watch. I can appreciate if short term continuity is not an issue to come up with novel plot that you want to cram into one movie as much as possible, the whole movie would turn into something like - this !But honestly, you have to ask yourself, are the characters in this movie worth that much attention ? To me, they weren't. There're nothing likable about any of the characters that spurred me to find out the 'truth' about their situations. So overall, it became like who cares after about the first 20 minutes, and no, I don't want to see this movie three or four times just to understand what's going on.So the movie is just a novelty, and I doubt that it will be remembered as any kind of a ground breaking masterpiece even if the ratings are high. How many people can honestly say that they went to see this movie four or five times at a theater ? I bet none. If I paid $10, I expect to be entertained in the first viewing, not shown some self indulgence of the screen writer that I have to sift through the mess to understand what's going on. You work for us, not the other way around.Please take it back, and you can keep it.",1,37,71,9 September 2011
Iron Man 2," Good, but failed to meet expectation
","Ironman once saved a Russian scientist Anton Vanko a.k.a. the Crimson Dynamo. Now his son is after Tony Stark, and Ironman.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is now on a hot seat. After revealing that he's Ironman, congress is asking him to pass over his Ironman suit in the name of National Security. Tony Stark is feeling his mortality as his chest implant is failing, and passes his CEO job to Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) Meanwhile in a dark lab somewhere, son of Anton Vanko is creating second Crimson Dynamo suit. They butt heads of all places at Monaco Grandprix. Will Tony Stark/Ironman be able to convince the new Crimson Dynamo to stand down like he did with his father ?Why they didn't go with the original Crimson Dynamo's suit design is beyond me. He was one of the more interesting character in the Ironman series. The problem might have been he was a Russian agent, and that country no longer exists. But in any case, the new Crimson Dynamo is not in the caliber as the original, and didn't seem as worthy opponent to Ironman. When the antagonist isn't good, the story suffers. The voltage of this second Ironman was lower than that of the first. So my take is, they better bone up on Ironman saga, and come up with a better story next time.",7,0,1,6 October 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A new kind of a movie
","Jerry Bruckheimer created a completely new genre of movie with the Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not just a pirate movie, not just a ghost movie, and not just a comedy, but all combined into one strange tale of curse, legend, and adventure. Not to mention some romance along the way.The movie also created a new character, Capt. Jack Sparrow who's not even human as the hero.The story is bit convoluted and difficult to understand. Why the curse started in the first place, why Jack is cursed, where the heck Davy Jones' locker came from etc. etc. Even if you've paid attention, some of the details still remains unclear, and remains that way in the subsequent sequels.The movie is beautifully made, although bit creepy at times. Johnny Depp's acting adds to the mysterious mood of the movie. I've watched this movie several times along with its sequels, but I still haven't figured out the whole story yet.",7,0,2,17 December 2011
Spider-Man 2," Better than the first
","Spiderman came more to life in this movie than the first. This movie is based on Spiderman #3, #50 and #55-#59 where Doc Ock nearly did away with Spiderman (and almost killed May Parker). Once again director Sam Raimy ( or Miller and Gough ) chose one of the best stories of the earlier Spiderman series. The movement of Spiderman is really what we expect from John Romita Sr. days of Spiderman, and it was exciting to see this version of Spiderman come to life (I still believe he was the best Spiderman artist).Asides from Doc Ock, many characters were introduced in this movie that could be future Spiderman's nemesis like J Jonah Jameson's son John Jameson who would become a superhero himself one day, and Dr. Connors who everyone knows is the infamous Lizard. If they keep building up this franchise this way, I think we're in for a treat.JK Simmons is spot on as J Jonah Jameson. I couldn't get enough of him doing J Jonah Jameson, and hope he'll continue in future installments of this movie. They made a good movie better the second time around.",8,1,2,16 October 2005
127 Hours," Scary
","Great movie about an unusual situation that happened to a real person.Aaron Ralston (played by James Franco) is a free spirited adventurer. Deserts of southwest is his proving ground. He's physically fit, and knows his turf really well. It should have been another day at the park for him when nature was waiting for him to teach him a very painful lesson. What happened next was one of the most unusual flukes of nature. While rock hopping the canyon, he falls with a boulder that's at the exact right place and size to impinge his hand perfectly between the canyon walls. The result was so final that he has no chance of escape. For the next 5 days he has the chance to think, and hallucinate every situation about his life. He then understands that he has only one chance left for his survival.It's unbelievable that such thing has happened to a person. If it was a story, no one would believe it. But it did, and what happened after is even more unbelievable. I didn't know that people could survive such ordeal. People die from just slitting their wrists don't they ?The movie looks low budget production, but is one of the most potent movie you can watch. James Franco was the perfect match to play the character. Not just a documentary, but makes you think deeply about life. Recommended.",Null,0,2,4 November 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Bring back Bryan Singer
","This movie fails in the way other film adaptation of comic book heroes. The producers and the director has no clue as to what makes the characters and the actions work, and they just cut and paste few scenes and plots they liked skimming through past issues of the comic franchise. And they always put in tons of CG action to compensate for the lack of convincing story line.This didn't happen in the first two X men movie. Director Bryan Singer did a masterful job of telling an original story that didn't mess up the original plot or the characters of X-men, which attests to his talent as a story teller and a visual artist. His story telling was compelling, but none of that depth is seen on this movie. Maybe they don't care. They just want to make quick bucks. But if they kept this up, movie industry would be in the same dive music world is in right now.This movie could have been better, but didn't live up to its potential.",3,5,9,27 May 2009
Alexander," Good movie done in bad taste
","This movie was mixture of good and bad. The good was pretty good portrayal of Alexander by Colin Farrel. Bad was that this movie had no class. Maybe the character of producers and a director shows. The DVD is a two disc set and both discs have movie in it, so it's a long movie. There's also a bonus material about the making of this movie. What kind of appalled me was cussing director Oliver Stone doing throughout the entire sequence. The girl who appeared in X2 was collecting $5 from every person who used foul language on the set. She would have made a fortune if she was in this movie.Cinematography wasn't so good, set was over done with weired color scheme that conflicted with cloths actors were wearing, and the movie lacked the polished feel. It was almost like a rough cut.The movie did tell the story of Alexander although it may be Oliver Stone's version, but after seeing it there was no satisfaction. Colin Farrel's acting was good, and that was the only saving grace for this movie.",4,1,1,23 October 2005
Troy," First movie better seen in full screen
","I know that there're debates about artistic purity in seeing a wide screen movie edited for full screen, but I truly believe that Troy is the first movie that's actually better seen in full screen format.The focus is much clearer on full screen edition, and you won't lose any information seeing it in this format.Brad Pitt is great in this movie. His moves, and his acting are all spot on as Achilles. I also didn't know that Eric Bana was such a good physical actor until I saw this movie. The only cast I wish was more convincing was Helen. She actually looked like a girl next door and not the exotic beauty that we imagine Helen to be. So it's not totally convincing to say that she had the power to launch 1000 ships. If only they were able to dig deeper into casting of this role, the movie would have been better.Production is of epic proportion and captures the atmosphere of the city and the battle well. Purist might complain that the story is not accurate to history, but if Achilles actually chased Hector couple of times around the walls of Troy in this movie, that would take up all the show time.If you're planning to see this movie, try the full screen version. You won't be disappointed. I just wish that DVDs produced stuck to the standard encoding format. My DVD of this movie when played in continuous play mode shows only the intro, FBI warnings and skips the entire content of the movie all together.",7,5,10,5 October 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," They spent 300 million on this ?
","I don't see anything more remarkable about this movie compared to the first Pirates of The Caribbean, so I fail to see why the thang cost so much to make. Originally based on the Disney's ride by the same name, this movie franchise became lot more successful than its namesake amusement ride.The story seems to jump from the Dead Man's Chest. There's this alliances that's formed between Davy Jones, and Lord Beckett - what ? A strait man and a ghost forming alliance ? Kraken is dead, for no good reason. Jack Sparrow is in the nether land, but come back to life with all his flesh and bones glory. Capt. Barbossa also comes back to life for no apparent reason. This story is a veritable free for all in taking artistic license with its own material.When the story is so poorly disciplined, we lose focus, and start to care less about what happens. Because anything can happen by miracle in this story. The first Pirates of Caribbean was good, second was okay, but this one - I'm not sure - maybe so so ? It does maintain fun element that runs through this series, and that IMO is the best part of this movie.",Null,2,3,18 December 2011
X-Men," Truly awesome X-Men coming to life
","This is one of the few movies that I paid twice to go see it for the second time in the theaters.I remember being riveted to the screen from the first scene Magneto as a child in concentration camp bend the steel gate out of its shape all the way to the end of the movie. It was that exiting. It sound's weired but I've felt a strange kinship to the mutants when I was watching the movie. The story just sucked me in and made me feel that close to the characters. Now that's good story telling.The casting was perfect. Each character was represented faithfully. It sent shivers up my spine when I saw Cyclops and Storm appear for the first time in the scene. They looked awesome. You have to keep in mind that many of the casts in this movie were little known until they've made it big in this movie, and it takes someone with an eye to recruit all these talents to create a believable X-Men.Bryan Singer said he had little regret about how the movie came out because he was rushed to make it for the 2000 summer release, but anyone who can manage $75M and turn it into a celluloid gold like this gotta have some talent. First time is always the hardest, and he did a crazy good job in my opinion.I'm giving this movie a 9 only because I gave 10 to X2 which I felt had better attention to the props, but I would have happily given it a 10 if it wasn't compared to anything else.A landmark epic in cinema history if you ask me.",9,0,0,6 October 2005
Spider-Man 3," Sam Reimy lost interest ?
","This movie was done poorly by any script writing standards. Everything was arranged so it would be convenient for the script writer to introduce a character, move from one inconsistent scene to another etc.. Take for instance, Eddie Broch showing up just when Gwen Stacey is hanging on for her dear life from a building, and capt. Stacey her dad is right there too ! Or Mary Jane showing up at Peter's apartment day after she walks out on him night before at a restaurant, and says 'I'm worried about you.' then she goes on and dumps him again at the bridge. What's going on with this chic ? This is just to swing the mood of Petar Parker so story moves forward ? Alliance between Venom and Sandman wasn't very convincing either. Why do these guys need to team up ? and at the end Sandman has another change of heart and turns into a good guy.For me, character of Mary Jane Watson was a disappointment. If you know the original character of MJ, Kristin Dunst just isn't her. I'd say Tobey McGuire really isn't Pete either. He doesn't come across as a New Yorker to me.So compared to the first two Spiderman movies, this one really didn't have the fire it could have. They don't have to worry because there isn't going to be Spiderman 4. Did Sam Reimy lose interest making Spiderman movies for this one ?",5,0,1,10 February 2008
The Prestige," No, I don't understand the plot, and I don't care
","Probably a well crafted plot, but awfully confusing visually because of the 'twins' that appear intermittently.The cinematography is top notch, and actors are decent, so it's a quality piece no doubt, but I didn't like the story (at all). There were more sadistic meanness in each of the characters that escalated from around the middle of the movie, and then continued to no end until its (trashy) ending. I don't care if one was smarter than the other or outwitted the other. The ugliness of the confrontation got appalling to a point where intrigue didn't matter anymore. I also didn't like the audio, how sudden blast of sound got injected to make you jump up from your seats. I know it's digital, and I know that theaters have mega watt systems, but is it really necessary to crank up the volume so loud suddenly ?Nice to watch visually, but the characters and the story that goes with it were unpalatable.",1,13,37,9 September 2011
The Terminator," Best low budget sci-fi movie ever !
","At only 6.4 million dollars, this movie must be the best low budget science fiction movie ever made. Much credit goes to James Cameron for great selection of actors to create one of a kind classic.When I watch this movie now, I'm surprised at how dark the mood of this movie is. It's much darker than T2, and T3 was Terminator in name only.Arnold showed versatile side of him. He wasn't just a robot, he had character that was all his own. 'I'll be back' became a clich√© in his future movies such as the Commando. By this time Arnold had 10 years of acting experience, and this was the defining role that really put him on the map.What made this movie stand out so much out of all the rest of low budget science fiction drama was the presence of Arnold, He really played the part with believability. Rough around the edges, but good enough to shock you, this is one of the best movie of this kind ever created.",Null,2,3,23 December 2011
Cloverfield," New kind of a Blair Witch Project
","They covered up what this movie is all about very cleverly with its title 'Cloverfield'. No one would have a clue about what the movie is about from its title. If they did, this movie would have not attracted many audiences. There's really nothing special about this movie in essence. It's a cross between the original Godzilla (creature from the ocean depth), Alien, and Blair Witch Project where the entire movie runs through a video camera of one of the characters.The plot connects the lives of ordinary young people with the total destruction of Manhattan, which is type of plot that became common in the beginning of the decade first in manga (Japanese comics), where relationship between an ordinary boy and a girl suddenly connects directly with the destruction of the world. Destruction of the world in this case is not the main theme - the relation of the couple who's involved in it is. You can see this clearly if you watch 'Saikano' together with this movie. It's my personal taste but taking one's self importance so seriously somehow does not appeal to me. If you take away the connection between the characters personal involvement, which to me is just that - there's nothing that relates back to the audience. The monsters and the special effects are clich√©, the production is average, and view point annoying. I couldn't figure out what the point of this movie was all about watching through a very limited visuals of a video camera, all the way to the final non-ending of the movie. The entire movie is about one young guy's video of himself.So, if you've been intrigued by the title and the nice sci-fi like picture on the box, my recommendation is just leave it at that. The content isn't worth the $$.",2,5,6,26 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Nice conclusion to all the Star Wars sagas up to this point
","This movie got the unfair share of having to tie all the loose ends from the first two movies, and never reached the streamlined splendor of the ESB and ANH.The character designs aren't as polished as the first two movies that takes away from the polished appearances. The production probably moved little further away from Lucas' own hands and became more team effort. But compared to the Star Wars episodes 1-3, this is more of pure adventure, and we get to enjoy the action in unadulterated ways. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are great in this movie. It's kind of shocking to see how young Harrison Ford looked in this series.There's something special about the visuals of this Star Wars series. It instantly makes you feel good in some magical ways.This is somewhat of the conclusion for the long saga that continued from The Phantom Menace. I'm hoping that next trilogy will be made more in the spirit of this trilogy. I'm certain that another trilogy of Star Wars will be made. The box office revenue assures it.",9,0,0,23 November 2011
The Expendables," Return of Stallone
","I'm glad to see Silvester Stallone in any movie, but I was wondering what happened to him after making Rambo 4. He's back with an all star cast of A list action movie actors in this movie. It's almost like Stallone's version of the Avengers. Only he would have the clout to pull something like this off. At first when you see the list of actors, this is going to be a really exciting movie. Each of the actors are good on their own, and it's hoped that together they'd be outrageous. This doesn't happen though because the script is somewhat old fashioned. If this movie was made in the '80s, it would have been good, but in the 21st century, it's just more of the same. Sly really needs to modernize his concept of how an action movie could be. The bad guys wasn't up to par with the heros either. The Rock music, both on this and part 2 was really old fashioned. This movie would have benefited if it borrowed some ideas from the Magnificent Seven. In that movie, each of the characters were well fleshed out, and functioned as a team, but also interesting to watch as individuals. These guys weren't interesting as a team or individuals. Visually the movie was really good. Just for that it's worth the watch. So a movie that could have been epic more or less ended up being just an above average movie. I think the series has lot of potential, so I hope they'd make a third installment that's totally over the top.",7,0,3,19 December 2012
Megamind," Great Movie
","The movie is like a parody of Superman and Brainiac. Megamind being the Brainiac, and Metroman being Superman's caricature. I throughly enjoyed the movie. The concept is great. I didn't know that you could put a villain in center stage, and pull off a comedy spoof of super hero. But the whole thing works, and it's an amazing movie.All the characters that appears in this movie are some of the best ever created (maybe except for Titan). The comedy and the comic nature of the characters works hand in hand and makes one of the best comedic moments in animation history.It's one of the best animated movie to be made in recent years, and recommended for viewing.",8,1,2,9 December 2011
Nacho Libre," See it !
","Yes, I have to give this movie a thumbs up because it was a good and funny movie. If you think The Three Stooges had good physical comedy about them, wait 'till you see this movie ! I wasn't such a big fan of Jack Black until I saw this movie, but he was perfect as Nacho. You wouldn't think a movie about a man who's not in such great physical shape becoming a wrestler in Mexico would make an interesting movie, but I was wrong big time. The movie surpassed all my expectation, and it was one of the best movie I saw this year. I can't go into details about what makes this movie so good because then it will spoil it for the people who's yet to see it, but I predict that this will become one of the all time classics of the comedy movie genre. If you haven't seen it yet, plan to see it soon. You won't be disappointed.",8,1,1,8 September 2006
Tangled," Awesome !!!
","3D animation that's based on German fairy tale Rapunzel, but the character's personalities are all modern day American.This is the first 3D animation movie that actually looked real. Sometimes more real than the real world. The lighting, movement, and color was all spot on in every scene. Characters featured in this movie are all incredibly 'Real' in their personality, yet so funny.Voice over is done with perfection too. Every character comes to life as if acting was done by live actors.Everything about this movie is over the top.6 years and 260 million is not wasted on making this epic movie.

Full Metal Jacket," Realistic Viet Nam war movie
","I was too young to be in Viet Nam, but from the comments that I hear about this movie from those who were there, this movie has realism that still affects them emotionally.This is probably the best role Mathew Modine has played up to that point. Not all the soldiers were like soldiers in this movie but I guess that's what the reality of it was at the time. The dichotomy or what didn't make sense was why did mostly middle class Americans have to be sent into this brutal war, that United States had no moral reasons to be involved.The part that was most memorable was the scene where a Viet Namese sniper took out an American soldier. One second you're alive, next second you're dead. I could see why you could be psychologically distressed after seeing something like that.To me many of the things that happens in this movie didn't make much sense. I guess you had to be there to understand it. The movie had a mood like no other movie I've seen. Whether it was a good movie or not is beyond me to judge, but it was produced well, and the acting was decent. How this movie appears to you probably depends on your experience.",7,1,2,26 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than TPM.......But !
","This installment of Star Wars was much better than Episode I which in my opinion was shockingly average. I still felt that George didn't learn his lesson about over using computer graphics indiscriminately from Episode I. Although the effects were more realistic, it still looked fake during good part of the movie. Plot line is pretty strained it seemed. Too many elements had to be crammed into 2 hrs. So there was no interesting plot development for the story or the characters (although, part about a 7ft tall gray alien cloning human soldiers was an interesting plot twist, and the battle scene between Obi-Wan and the bounty hunter was one of the few excellent scenes in this movie). Another annoying thing was that there was too many of everything on CG shots. Too many buildings, too many flying cars, too many people, too many weapons, too many animals, too many foot soldiers, they filled the screen, but at the end of the day, they all looked the same failing to give the cue that we're in a different place, situation or a planet. Aliens looked fake, which also was true for all non-human Jedi council members. Cut back on CGI, focus on plot and acting but as ROTS would show, none of the lessons from making each episodes are carried over on to the next.",6,4,9,11 December 2005
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good Prequel to the Avengers
","Captain America is not one of the characters that are easy to translate to the big screen. It shows on this movie as well.The movie takes it's basic story from the Captain America from the '60s. The Cosmic Cube, plane that's akin to the Sleeper, and they did do a pretty good job of combining them into a single story. Out of all the Marvel heroes to come onto the screen, I would rate this around 6/10. The WW II settings prevents this movie from really spectacular action movie. It might have been better if the story took place in a more modern settings, but then you can't tell the origin story of Captain America.I will be looking forward to the Avengers which should make things lot more interesting.",Null,0,2,23 February 2012
The Godfather: Part II," A Classic in its own right
","This is one of the few movies where the sequel is better than the original. Cinematography is better than the original, and story line tighter. The story is about change of guard from the old Corlione (Vito) to the new God father (Michael), and I thought acting by both Marlon Brando and Al Pachino was notch above the original. The unlikely son who went to college and had no interest in the family business now takes over the family as the new Don. Al Pachino shows his maturity as an actor by playing the role of the new Don masterfully, and his transition from his first role to that of the new God father is portrayed naturally.This is one movie I believe will last till the end days of cinema. A classic in its own right.",10,1,2,24 January 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimately Bouring
","Matt Damon is supposed to be some kind of super agent created by CIA. Unfortunately, he's not at all convincing as the character. He has no physical ability to speak of, so for the most part like in the first two installments of this series, we just end up watching him walking around - and around. Furthermore I don't find anything that I see that's likable about the character. He's some poor mind controlled agent who's fending for his life while taking on the government, but there's just no character to his character.Matt Damon has extremely narrow emotional range to his acting, and we end up watching his dead pan face, and not so brisk body motion throughout the film. Just because he's some kind of a lizard prince, I don't think he qualifies as a leading actor.So if you like to watch Matt Damon walking around, this movie is for you, but if you''re not, the movie is not recommended for viewing.",5,0,2,27 December 2012
Predator," Rescue team encounter a deadly alien
","This is the first installment of the saga that still continues to this day.Six agents are sent into the jungle of Guatemala on a rescue mission. Unbeknownst to them, a deadly alien also chose the same spot to go out on a hunting season - for humans. Rather young Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in this horror/sci-fi/action drama. Stan Winston studio designed Predator also makes it's debut in this movie. The movie has a real feel to it and has become the favorite of the fans of this series.Also in this movie is the young future governor Jessie Ventura. His motto was 'Do like Arnold to succeed' and switched from professional wrestling to the big screen. Maybe Arnold thought 'Do like Jessie to succeed' when he ran for the California state governor's seat.The mission was actually a con sprung by Dillon (Carl Weathers) to infiltrate the guerrillas and collect information. Dillon thinks he's got one on Dutch (Arnold), but he's the one who stepped into a big dudu not knowing the danger that awaits him. It's fight to the end for all of them once the hunt begins.",7,1,2,1 May 2011
The Bourne Identity," Boring movie
","This is a movie where lines between simple movie and reality might be blurred. There are some movies that are based on fact or hits close enough to home, that it makes people who were actually in those situations cringe. This movie might be one of them.This movie to Matt Damon is like what 'Matrix' was for Kianuu Reeves. Matt Damon made good movies, but this might be his defining role. Mind controlled super agent finds himself lost in Gernany without memory of who he is or why he's there. The story runs very close to the declassified MK ULTRA program that US government was conducting to create super soldiers. In fact one of the soldiers that came out of this program says he can't watch this movie because it disturbs him too much.The movie is Luke warm interesting, and the believability of Matt Damon as a super soldier is very low. So while this movie may hit close to home for some, it doesn't hit me at all. In fact it was kind of boring, and is not recommended for viewing.",6,0,1,26 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Poor movie
","I don't know why other people think this movie is so great. I think they're happy that Tolkien's classic has been brought to the big screen. Cinematography, and special effects were only average, story was to me rather boring, characters were artificial and lacked believability, so why the high ratings ? I saw this movie in the theaters with my girlfriend, and after seeing this movie I was rather apologetic to my girlfriend because she didn't enjoy it, and I know that I didn't enjoy it. It's an epic, I give it that, but most people in this movie just had sad expression or no expressions at all. I just couldn't get any energy out of this movie.The movie was such a disappointment that I canceled my plans to see all its sequels.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1/10 was it was better than Catwoman, and I could tell that the director and actors put in a sincere effort into making Tolkien's classic come to life.",3,3,7,10 October 2005
American Psycho," Best psycho killer movie
","Of all the psycho killer movies I've seen, this one tops the list. The best part is the dead pan acting by Christian Bale who portrays Patrick Bateman. He acts like he's a normal person, but it's clear that he's 'not there' and thinking about psychotic things that's coming into his mind every minute. On the surface he's a successful yuppie bachelor who has everything one can wish for - a good job, high pay, good social life, and a successful career. The scariness of this movie is the contrast of this good life to the total mess that's going on inside his head. In the end a detective comes around looking for him for suspicion of killing his friend Paul Allen. He makes excuse that he heard Paul Allen say he's going to London while he knows he killed him. But then another friend says he saw Paul Allen in London. At this point Bateman's mind is so messed up that it's not clear anymore if he actually killed a person, or just killed him in his fantasy, and the fact that police is after him is no longer an issue because his mind is already in a far worse place than any prison. Based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis, American Psycho is a great story because the contrast between the yuppie career of Patrick Bateman and his craziness is so far apart. If anyone has a choice between becoming a psycho killer or a successful businessman, no one will choose the psycho killer. But in Bateman's case, his insanity is so strong that despite his good position, he can't help keep on killing. The story portrays the double sided character of Bateman well, and Christian Bale does a fantastic job playing the character. A movie worth seeing.",7,0,0,21 December 2005
Face_Off," Best of Cage and Travolta
","This is one of the early Nicholas Cage movie that I like. Him and John Travolta swaps position by swapping faces of each other, but the evil Travolta has hard time convincing his daughter that he's still the same dad that she knows.Cage has a problem convincing that he's actually the good guy. Movie features good plot, suspense, and great acting by Cage and Travolta. Usually when two strong actors gets together, the plot gets murky because focus of the story goes between them. Nicholas Cage is one actor that seems to be able to work his way around the personalities of any actor he co-stars with. The story flows seamlessly between this rather confusing exchange of faces and characters in my opinion due to the flexibility of his style. Consequently, the movie has the best of Cage and Travolta on screen.This is one of the best action movie from the '90s, and is recommended for viewing.",7,1,2,26 December 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Irritatingly stupid movie
","After seeing this movie, I could only surmise that it's some kind of disinformation film to make jokes out of what is commonly known as remote viewing. The movie portrays remote viewers as army's attempt to train soldiers to be new age hippies (seriously). From what I've read the real remote viewers were deadly effective (otherwise the government wouldn't have funded them for 23 years). But if the effectiveness of remote viewing was really conveyed, it would be disclosing one of the closely guarded secrets of US military operations. So my take after seeing the movie is that it was created to be a disinformation campaign to make the world believe that this is what remote viewing is about. None of the characters in the movie could do remote viewing. As if it didn't exist. And maybe that's the real message this movie wanted to convey.",3,1,6,10 December 2016
Spider-Man," Captured the essence of Spiderman pretty well
","The movie seems to be based on Spiderman issues #39 and #40 where Green Goblin captures Peter Parker and reveals to him that he is actually Norman Osborne, Parker's room mate Harry Osbourne's father. Director Sam Raime focused on one of the most intriguing episode of early Spiderman series, and he was right on target with choosing Spiderman's most colorful arch enemy into the first Spiderman movie.If there was bit of a stretch was Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Kirstin Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Peter Parker is a hard core New Yorker, and Tobey Maguire really didn't look like he's from New York at all, and Mary Jane Watson is supposed to be a real happy go lucky 'Me Generation' type individual, not a muted Gen X character portrayed by Dunst. Also, role of Liz Allan (Somewhat of a love interest to Peter in high school) and Mary Jane seems to be merged into one character.Given that Spiderman is not an easy character to bring to the big screen, overall the movie captured the essence of Spiderman pretty well. If they portrayed the people around Peter Parker bit more in detail to bring out the kind of world he lives in the movie would have been even better, but for a first try, it was pretty darn good.",7,0,1,16 October 2005
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Maturity shows on the actors
","So it's been 14 years since the original X- Men movie. Many actors were teenagers when this series started, but in this version they have grown up in more ways than one.Maturity shows on their acting and their ability to express subtle nuance in the acting which makes this movie more rewarding to watch.Dare I say that this is the best of the many X-Men movie that came along. Bryan Singer still have the ability to turn all the subtitling of the plot into convincing visual landscape. This is a very entertaining movie at all levels.I hope they would continue the X-Men franchise in this direction in the future. A movie well worth watching.",9,2,3,1 February 2017
Spirited Away," Too monotone for me
","I kind of understand the world this movie is trying to express. The world and the characters that appears in this movie are caricature of archetype Japanese personalities. But it's in the area of what I would call emotional human waste dump. I think Japanese also has healthier world views in them asides from the one expressed in this movie. The loneliness, sadness, cruelty expressed in this movie is what kids in the feudal era of Japan would have experienced when they were sent away to serve at a large merchant's house at a very young age. If your family was too poor to support you, that was your only option. This is a fictional modern day version of many stories like this a child might have experienced even as recently as 60 years ago in Japan.To me, the movie basically had no message. I'm surprised that it was embraced so well by the audiences here. I'm pretty sure western audience are not aware of the psychological connotation of this movie which only have meaning to the Japanese. Hayao Miyazaki has been at producing anime movies for 30 years, and he's been digging a lot into the dark side of Japanese psyche for the past 5 years. It might help to remember things that are almost being forgotten today, but for me I'm not sure if remembering these things are even healthy to begin with. Wouldn't it be nice if a child discovers how to grow up in the world as citizen of earth instead of remembering the saddest memory of the past ?",5,3,18,17 October 2005
Quantum of Solace," Daniel Craig Bond is getting better
","Daniel Craig is getting more Bond like in this second installment of his 007 series. He handles physical action lot better than any of his recent predecessors.There're twice the amount of story in this movie compared to other movies of similar length. This keeps the story loaded with action, and Daniel Craig has the goods to deliver them. The characters that appears in the movie are more interesting, and 007 like than most of 007 movies that were made in the last 25 years. If the bad guys were bit more suave, the movie would have been even better, but there's a shortage of good actors who can carry a role of this type.There are lot less play between Bond and his women compared to Albert Broccoli days of Bond. But I don't want to see any more of combat battalion type woman to be Bond's side kick as it was in the days of Brosnan Bond, but that's just my opinion. I guess there're shortage of suitable talent in this area as well.If this is the direction Bond movies are going in the future, I'm interested in seeing more of it. I'm looking forward to the next installment to see the evolution of Daniel Craig Bond.",Null,2,8,24 July 2011
Gone with the Wind," Great Production
","First, I thought this movie was made in the '50s, but it was made in the '30s. I'm surprised that such fantastic movie production was possible back then.I think everyone knows the story already so I'll skip the synopsis. I'm not particularly a fan of period piece movie like this, or any of the actors, but the grand production of this movie blows me away. The style of this movie is absolutely lavish. It might be the most lavish movie ever produced. Just on this point alone, this movie is an important landmark.They didn't have cell phones in civil war era south, but rich people really had luxurious life back then. Even in this luxury, people can't seem to find happiness. Everybody still is putting in their dues. I guess that the whole point of this story.Clark Gable was absolutely charming in this movie. The movie wouldn't have been the same without him.Every scene is shot perfectly, and this movie is artistic in every way.Scaret O'Hara reminds me of modern spoiled high school kid. Vivian Leigh plays it strait but with a little bit of a twist, she could have easily starred in modern teenager movie.If I see one flaw in this movie, it's the mismatch of characters between Gable and Leigh. They have no chemistry together. Otherwise, it's a startling production, and no wonder it is considered a classic for so many years.",Null,0,0,18 November 2011
Alien vs. Predator," Predator returns for a right of passage ritual
","This is the first of Alien vs Predator franchise to be created. In the premise of this movie Predator created a large under ice base in Antarctica in the late 19th century for the purpose of performing right of passage for the Predators. They return in 2004 to perform this ritual for the new batch of Predators. The ritual consists of battle with the Aliens. When the base is reactivated, the heat signature is picked up by a satellite, and an expedition team is sent out not knowing what awaits them.Special effects are good in this movie, but the battle between the Predator and Aliens weren't all that successful because both lacks character and it just turn into a mindless fight. In this movie humans are relegated to a total supporting role. It's the first attempt of combining the Alien, Predator, and humans in one film and interaction between all of them remained somewhat raw. While this movie is pretty good, I liked the Predators (2010) better than this one, as blending of the plot and the monsters were much more smoothly done, and recommend that movie over this.",6,1,1,1 May 2011
Batman Begins," Best rendition of Batman....Ever !
","This is the best rendition of Batman ever. Perhaps for the first time a movie is better than the original comic. What makes this movie so great is the character development of Bruce Wayne and casts surrounding him being perfect. Sure the looks and the mood builds on the 'Dark Knight' version of the Batman of the '90s, but this is more intelligently done, and every i's are dotted and t's crossed on it's plot, character depiction, and special gadgetry that Batman always flaunts.The part I especially like is the fact goodness of each character comes through despite the gloomy visuals of Gotham city. Even in a dump, there're hopes with people like them. The line at the end of the movie where Gordon says 'I never thanked you.', and Batman turns around and says '...and you never have to.' is just killer.10/10",10,4,4,11 November 2005
Twilight," Best Vampire Story Ever !!
","I saw other Twilight saga first so I'm biased in this review. If this was the first Twilight I've seen, it would have been much difficult to understand the story.Bella moved from Phoenix Arizona to Forks Washington. There she enters high school, and meets Edward. Edward is bit unusual, and Bella suspects that there's more to him than what he's willing to tell, but she can't exactly pin point to what it is. In the mean time, there's strange killing going on in the forest. Edward finally confesses that he's a vampire, but of a 'vegetarian' kind, and don't kill humans. They both fall in love with each other. One day, the 'other' vampires who's been killing people in the forest shows up, and wants to 'eat' Bella. Edward tries to defend her, but they got her mom, and by her own volition, she goes to meet the vampires.I usually don't go for vampire movies, especially the old school kind, but this is story done elegantly, with romance, intrigue, and action. This is the first vampire movie that I really liked. Story develops rather slowly, and it's good that series continued, because not enough is said in this first installment. Picture is beautiful, and casts are best of the young actors. Great movie, that should be seen as a series. Otherwise you'll miss the good parts.",Null,3,8,8 October 2011
Saving Private Ryan," Well made, and deals with a questionable concept
","The production of this movie is epic. It's hard to believe that it was made on 70 million dollars, but that was 15 years ago. The story is unusual in that US military goes out of its way to extricate a certain private Ryan from the battle field at any cost because his family has lost 3 brothers to war already. It sends in a squad of infantry men into Normandy to find and save private Ryan. While the intent is noble, the wisdom doesn't make much sense. If Ryan dies, that's only one man, but the entire squadron is under danger of losing their lives in the attempt.This movie could have been 30 - 60 minutes shorter, and would have been better focused. Some of the battle ground scenes are the most realistic ever caught on film.The movie leaves you feeling somewhat empty because of the foolish nature of the war, and a human drama that at its core doesn't make much sense. Like in lifeguard course we learn that if the rescue is too dangerous, it's OK to abandon rescue because one dead person is better than a two dead people. The military's decision in this movie totally goes against this wisdom.You be the judge of the outcome.",6,0,2,23 December 2012
The Transporter," Unlikely hero wins the day
","This is the first installment of the Transporter series. The hero of the series Frank transports cargo without asking questions, but his enemies are not only the guys who are after his cargo.Frank contracts to carry any cargo for (mostly) underground clients. His attraction is that no questions are asked about the content of the cargo or what the purpose of transportation. One day, he notices that his cargo is moving in the trunk and out of curiosity he opens it and discovers that his cargo is a woman. Frank's trouble starts when he breaks his own rules of not to open the cargo.The hero of this story is unlike any other seen on the big screen. He's a guy with thinning hair approaching his middle age, but he's got a body like that of an Olympic athlete, and can move like a Tiger. Handsome and rugged, he's dressed in an expensive suit, and if I may put in my personal comment, he looks better in a suit than Daniel Craig does as James Bond in his suit.So there you have it. A super cool looking guy that becomes an unlikely hero for justice. He always ends up saving the 'cargo' from certain destruction and at the same time saves the day.The story is good and acting by Jason Statham is superb. You can tell that this first installment is made on relatively low budget, but still the action is one of the best you can expect from a movie.",Null,0,0,24 July 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Unlikely Story, but Mission Accomplished
","A terrorist gains access to nuclear missile launch code, and launches an attack against San Francisco. IMF gets the order to stop the terrorist and prevent the disaster.It's highly unlikely that just having the launch code will allow someone to launch a missile. You really have to be a deep insider to be able to do such a thing, so a mere terrorist being able to launch a nuclear missile remotely - and I stress remotely launch a missile from a submarine is not realistic. But that's Hollywood, and Mission Impossible continues its tradition of good action and intrigue.But such attack may still occur in real life, and for that, this movie gives a glimpse of the reality of Russian nuclear weapons that are traded in the underground these days (such as nuclear warhead from sunken Kursk showing up in Okinawa).The movie jumps from one location to another with many players involved in the plot. It keeps you on your toes to keep up with what's happening. Believability of the story was low which took away from the viewing experience, but if you liked the previous installments of Mission Impossible, this one will not disappoint.",6,1,3,4 February 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Spectacular origin story
","The new Planet of the Apes movie is a creation all on its own unencumbered by the original Planet of the Apes from the '60s. In this movie, the intelligent apes are not product of natural evolution, but accidental creation of science. Although it's unlikely that few hundred organized apes can successfully launch a revolution, this movie was intended to be the first of series of movies to come. The story is extraordinarily violent, and that aspect turns me off, but as a story it's done in the most believable format as possible for the origin of the Planet of the Apes.Asides from those two points, the movie is above average science fiction movie. Still it's hard to think that the whole movie cost nearly 100 million dollars. The cost of movie making seems to be going up these days.It's hard to rate this movie because the star is a CGI ape Caesar. The character has believability, but CGI is CGI, and I couldn't get emotionally involved with its personality. The other casts were so so, and had to take second fiddle to the ape. The movie is no masterpiece, but neither was the 1968 classic. But one thing it did succeed and that is it recaptured the sensation of the original Planet of the Apes when it first came out.",Null,2,5,19 December 2011
JFK," One of the most intriguing movie in history of American cinema
","Oliver Stone made some of the best movies. This is one of them.I've heard that when Oliver Stone originally planned to tell the story that on the day of Kennedy's assassination, American people witnessed a coup d√É¬©tente in the country that transfered the power from the president to powers that's yet to come out into the limelight. But he was asked not to do that. Whether this is true or not, the conversation between Doanld Sutherland and Kevin Cosner 2 hours into the movie touches on this subject.It's a fact that over 70% of the American public believes that there was a conspiracy behind Kennedy's assassination, and this movie addresses the doubt that many of us has in very good detail. Even my friend who used to be in the military said that Kennedy's reaction in his limousine was that of someone clearly shot from the front - not from the back. With so many witness and evidence contradicting the official findings, no wonder so much doubt still lingers after all these years.This is one of the most intriguing movie in American cinema, about one of the most intriguing story in American history.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Good finale to the trilogy
","I think more than few people found the X3 to be lacking based on the reviews I see on the IMDb. I was scared to be disappointed to go and see this film at the theaters because Bryan Singer was not the director. I got to see this movie, of all places on an United Airlines in flight movie. To make the long story short, I wasn't disappointed. The movie had all the elements that I wanted to see about X-men that hasn't been shown on the X-men and X2, and still wrapped the story in a satisfying way. The things that I wanted to see - Angel, Beast, and the Juggernaut - (without them, it ain't the X-men) finally showed up on this movie, and all the other mutants that we wanted to see more of (ice man, pyro, phoenix, colossus) was part of the action.Professor X was killed, but in more than one occasion in the comic he came back to life, so if they're going to make X4, I wouldn't be surprised if he came back to life again. It's difficult to show how awesome the power of Phoenix/Gene Gray is without knowing the original comic, but they did a credible job on the destructive power of Phoenix.As a long standing fan (over 30 years) of Marvel comics, I wasn't disappointed at the treatment this movie gave to the X-Men saga. I only wish that they would make X4, X5, X6 and X7 before the actors age too much.",9,0,1,8 September 2006
Schindler's List," Awesome
","The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - 'Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.'",10,14,18,17 October 2005

","What are the chances that in your life time you not only meet a vampire, but also werewolves, and both are coveting you ? Twilight saga continues with Bella's life changing with Edward moving away, and a new boy in her life. This movie is not a stand alone piece, and other Twilight sagas should be seen before seeing this movie.Edward has second thoughts about his relation with Bella, and he decides to move away. But other 'non vegetarian' vampires are not so easy to let go, and decides to eat Bella. Who comes to rescue but a pack of giant werewolves. Jacob, who she's dating turns out to be a werewolf, and wouldn't want vampires to touch her. There's a vampire's version of what looks like Vatican in Italy. Thinking Bella is dead, Edward goes there to end his own life. Bella chases after Edward to save his life. She does, but the stipulation is that Bella becomes one of them.The story moves along slowly, but there's excellent story telling in each chapter of this movie. Since they've already made their mind up to make at least a trilogy, they can take time to expand on the story. The plot is good, and unusualness of the setting of each of the sub- plot, makes this movie entertaining to watch.Krsiten Stewart is perfect in her leading role, and so are the other co-stars.

To add fuel to this, his fianc√© is an old time acquaintance of Eisenheim who he still loves.The love triangle and the fantastic magic act that is shown inbetween, forms the core of this movie. It also leads to the bombastic climax of this movie. This is certainly one of the best movie about a magician ever made. Eisenheim is Edward Norton's best role to date in my opinion.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Rise of Silver Surfer - but No Galactus ?
","Loosely based on FF issues 48, 49, 50 (Coming of Galactus), and issues 57,58,59, 60 (Doom steals Surfer's powers), this movie while done better than the first one, still misses the mark.It's clear that these guys don't get it about what makes FF one of the best super heroes ever to come out of comics. Unlike Sam Reimy's Spiderman where evidence that Reimy gets what makes Spiderman so cool, or Brian Singer's X-Men where his fleshing out of the characters are so perfect, these guys just have the characters doing cartwheels all the time and never get into the plot or the characters, or the timing of action that makes FF so interesting.The suspense and trauma of coming of Galactus and the Surfer in the original comic is nowhere to be found. I don't think Ioan Gruffudd would have been able to act out the stressed out Reed Richards in trying to devise a way to stop the landing of the Surfer on earth. Coming of the Surfer, his powers, and his eventual capture is so run of the mill Hollywood science fiction plot that, it doesn't have to be a Fantastic Four movie. And no Galactus on this epic episode ? What's the excuse ? Not enough time ? Well TV animation from decades ago was able to pull it off in 30 minutes, and this movie is over 90 minutes. Get rid of the phony capture and Doom stealing the surfer's power plot. That was from another story. Here the same mistake of patch work of just flashy story tidbits from different episodes like they did on the first installment is evident. Too many unnecessary scenes, and not tight enough plot makes this movie ineffective in communicating the power of the characters. I don't think the actors could carry the weight of FF characters either ( which was doubted for James Marsden when he was cast for the X-Men but was later shown that he was the 'Cyclops' ).Better than the first, but no cigars.",5,0,1,24 January 2008

Just for these two reasons, this movie is worth watching, but the plot is also great, and the characters are well fleshed out giving this movie the reality other sci-fi movies lacks. It's said that Steven Spielberg is a fan of Transformers, and it shows. You can feel the passion that went into this movie. Also, I think it's the best movie director Michael Bay has ever made. His style translates well for the action of the Transformers. The movie is pretty long (2hrs24min), but it's packed with one great scene to another. Thinking Transformers as kid stuff is wrong here. The movie is PG 13 rated, and there's intelligent plot that makes this not just a good Transformer movie, but a good sci-fi movie as well.

","What I liked about Kill Bill Vol. 1 was that it was really modern movie that paid homage to many of the great TV and movies of the past 4 decades. The color was fantastic and beautiful, and actors and their characters played out superbly. Yeah, I have to give it to Tarantino. No one can make a movie like this (good or bad) other than him. I'd say that good far out weighed the bad in this case, and I hope he'd make more movies like this one that defy Hollywood stereotypes. He's not narrow in the way many American film makers are in that they can only play up a drama in a cook book sort of a fashion. His taste in cinematography is also very different from other Hollywood directors. I would hazard to guess that if a student made a movie like this in art schools, they would be berated very badly. If I like Tarantino, it's for these reasons. The stuffs that's good and fun that are getting forgotten these days is abundant in his movie making taste.Now for the ridiculous antics. First of all, you can never use a Japanese sword the way Uma Thurman did. Samurai's sword is made of steel core and iron blade. For this reason, the blade part chips very badly when it hits a hard object like human bones (this is the reason why the samurai always carries a shorter 'spare' with the main katana). No way you can kill 100 people without devastating the sword way Uma did. Made by Hattori Hanzo or not. Secondly, Japanese Yakuzas carry guns these days. No one carries a samurai sword. So this is the purely fiction part of the movie. Uma would have been gunned down in five seconds in a real situation. Thirdly, there's no tea house like the House of Blue Leaves in Japan. The architecture simply isn't Japanese. It's clear that the set was in China.That's my take on this movie. Don't get me wrong, I thought this was a great movie, and I wish more movies made were fun to watch as this one was.",8,0,3,5 June 2006
Ip Man," Donny Yen in his defining role
","This movie won the prestigious Hong Kong academy award of 2009. Donny Yen was nominated for the award as the leading actor, and so has Wilson Yip as its director.The year is 1935, in the Chinese town of Fo Shan, there are many martial arts schools. Owner of one of the school master Liu (Chen Zhihui) challenges Ip Man (Donny Yen) to a match. Liu was no match for Ip, but asks him to keep things quiet. Ip assures Liu that no one will hear about it. But Yuan (Wong You-nam) who was climbing a tree to recover his kite was watching the match and spreads the word. Ashamed and furious Liu directs his anger towards Ip, but it soon becomes apparent that it was Yuan who spread the word. One day a martial artist named Jin (Fan Siu-wong) shows up and starts defeating all the school masters. He hears about Ip Man and challenges him. Ip is not interested but Jin tries to humiliate him. Ip's wife tells Ip to accept the challenge but don't break anything. Jin turns out to be no match for Ip either. After defeating Jin, Ip becomes somewhat of a home town celebrity, but dark clouds of war was forming. In 1938 the Japanese invaded Fo Shan, Ip's home was taken away from him, and he now had to make a meager living as a worker. Japanese soldiers shows up at Ip's work. They were recruiting sparring partners for Japanese soldiers. If they win, a bag of rice will be awarded. Ip's friend Lin (Xing Yu) volunteers. At the karate dojo, master Liu has defeated the Japanese soldier, and was returning with a bag of rice. General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) steps in and offers three vs one combat to show his skills. Lin and two other challenges, but they are no match for Miura. Lin persists on fighting, and gets killed by Miura. Following day, noticing that Lin is missing, Ip goes to the karate dojo. There he witnesses master Liu challenging three Japanese soldiers, and getting defeated. After he's lost, Liu is shot in the head and killed. Miura is furious that Sato (Shibuya Tenma) shot Liu and orders him not to use guns in the dojo ever again. Ip witnessing the murder, and sensing that Lin has been killed there also, challenges 10 Japanese and defeats them. Miura impressed asks Ip to come back again, and asks his name. Ip replies that he's not coming back, and he's just a Chinese man. But Li (Lam Ka-tung) who was interpreting, tells Miura that he will be back and his name is Yo Mon (Ip Man in Japanese).In the mean time, Jin who was defeated by Ip has turned into a bandit. Yuan has joined him also. Now they are terrorizing Ip's close friend Chow's (Simon Yam) factory. Chow asks Ip to teach kung fu to the workers for protection. Ip obliges, and the factory workers are now being trained in Wing Chun. Jin shows up to the factory again with his bandits, but this time he's met with workers trained in kung fu. Amongst them he sees Ip Man. He challenges Ip again, but loses. Japanese are now looking for Ip and Li is ordered to find him. They show up at the factory and offers him a position as an instructor. Ip refuses, but Li interprets to Miura that Ip is considering the offer, and wishes to challenge him. Miura accepts the challenge, and date is set for their match.The movie is almost tailor made for Donny Yen to star in. He even looks a bit like Ip Man himself. His martial art skills really shines in this movie. Portraying a calm and powerful master is spot on for his personality. This movie is made by seasoned staff, and the quality shows. Sammo Hung is the fight sequence choreographer. One honorable mention goes to the movie's producer Ramond Wong. He's been producing entertaining movies in Hong Kong for over a quarter century. This is his crowning achievement as well. While this movie was made in Chinese Hong Kong, and negative propaganda about communist China was omitted in the story, it was the Cultural Revolution and the Red Army that confiscated all of Ip Man's property in China, and forced him to relocate to Hong Kong in 1949.This is one of the best martial art movie to come out of Asia, and is recommended for viewing by action movie, and Asian movie fans alike.",Null,0,0,9 November 2011
Logan," Crappy movie
","What did they want to tell with this story ? I watched it so that I can follow the mythology of X men, but if they keep on making crap like this I think I will stop watching. The movie is just violent, and the characters are just into violence. There's no action. Only violence. The characters are only there to perpetuate violence, and I didn't like that at all. Maybe a little more plot and story telling next time. But for me I don't think there is no next time.",1,4,10,21 February 2018
Avatar," New Star Wars, or Cowboy and Indians, or ....
","It's obvious within watching this 3D movie for the first 5 minutes, that this movie is breakthrough in cinematic expression in the class like the Star Wars was in the '70s. The tone of the story for the first 1/4 of the movie makes you feel like you might be watching another dark tale of ostracized society like the one depicted in Matrix. I was thinking, oh, here we go again, darkness sold as 'realism', or a story driven plot. Then 3/4 way into the story, it was like is it another cowboy and Indian movie, where the cowboys with modern weapons levels the indians who're basically fighting with bows and arrows. Then the complete surprise came in the last quarter of the movie where the cowboys are actually shown as the bad guys. There's no mistake that the 'Sky People' depicted in this movie are 'Americans' and their corporate greed, and military industrial complex has formed a fascist state of arrogance and insensitivity to any rights of others in the name of profit and control. I won't go into the spoilers of how the movie ends, but it's surprising that an American director (okay he's Canadian, but..) would take such objective view of his own country.This is a movie that comes once in a life time, and is easily one of the top 10 movies of the last decade. I believe 3D experience will become the norm in future movies until 3D becomes a dirty word like so many over commercialized technology has become. Thumbs up for James Cameron.",10,3,6,20 March 2010
The Last Samurai," Best samurai movie in history
","When I first saw the trailer about this movie, it didn't excite me. Tom Cruise and samurai somehow didn't sound like a match, and my guess was that the movie was stereotypical plot about an American going to Japan to kick ass - I was wrong.I just couldn't believe the detail they've put into this movie. Everything looked absolutely real, and even in Japanese made samurai movie you don't see this kind of authenticity (e.g. if you recall plastic looking Armour in Kurosawa's Kagemusha). Given that this movie was made on a budget that's 30x the most expensive samurai movie Japan's ever made, you can still have fouled the plot by making it an 'American' samurai picture. But no, Ed Zwick's vision is so complete, it overwhelmed me. And Tom Cruise was not a simple hero character, but a character based on principle who found himself in a situation where he didn't know how to get out of (until he gets to Japan).Ngila Dickson and Lily Kilvert did a fantastic job with costumes and sets. Cinematography was beautiful. Props and special effects were flawless. All the casts were absolutely believable. In short, a perfect movie.I truly believe that Hollywood have outdone Japan in its own game with this movie. It's the greatest samurai movie ever made, and perhaps one of the last of its kind. Japanese studios are no longer producing samurai movies due to lack of interest from audiences, and it's doubtful that another movie like this would be made by an American studio. They say that swan's last song is its most beautiful and the saying might just apply to this movie.If you turn off the picture and just listen to the dialog you'll notice that only Algren (Tom Cruise), Omura (Masato Harada), and Higen (Sosuke Ikematsu) are really speaking from the bottom of their person. Others are just giving lip service. Harada is a director and maybe he knows how the craft really works. Sosuke Ikematsu was just so great in his role as Higen. He was blowing away actors who had ten times more experience than him with his acting, and maybe (I hope) he will one day grow into a great adult actor himself. As for Tom Cruise, I guess he's the biggest star in Hollywood because he can bring believability into his character at this level.",10,1,3,6 October 2005
Departures," New career brings new life's perspective
","Okuribito is a story of a young man who finds an unusual change in his career from a musician to a mortician. Needless to say, drastic change in his private life came along with it.Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player in an orchestra, but one day finds himself out of work. Recognizing that he didn't have the talent necessary as a musician to survive, he starts to look for a new job. He finds an ad in the newspaper saying 'Help people travel'. Thinking that it's an ad by a travel agency, he goes for his interview. He's surprised that his monthly salary is over $5000 just as an apprentice. He also learns that an ad had an error in it and is told that the ad should have said 'Help people's departures'. He learns that his new job is actually that of a mortician. While not motivated, he takes the job because he needed the money, but keeps his job secret from his wife. New job bring much difficulties for him, but he finds different perspective on life through seeing people's reactions to the loss of their loved ones.This IMO is one of the great new movies that are coming out of Japan. Japanese are finding their niche in unique stories that explores peoples lives from a different perspective. This movie is one example. It's also a step up in Mokkun, or Masahiro Motoki's acting. He's been gradually working his way up, and while an accomplished actor in his own right, he's been challenging new roles that are experimental for him. He nails this one as a musician, mortician, and a husband that is in a compromising position.While not as big budget as Hollywood movies, these new movies from Japan are high quality and original, and should be considered as classics in their own rights.",5,0,3,1 June 2011
Pretty Woman," Now a Classic
","I now had the opportunity to see many of the so called romantic classics from the '30s onwards, and am surprised to find that this movie is one of the best amongst them.The movie has all the elements of romantic movies except for a tragic ending which I find unnecessary. And out of all, this one is one of the most detailed and perfectly executed. It also invites us into the world of super rich in a stylized way that makes for a perfect fantasy.I'm also impressed with Richard Gere in looking so good in his role. He was stunningly good looking as Edward, and had almost a teenager like quality in his looks. Maybe I should thank the HD technology for allowing me to notice so much details that I didn't notice when I first saw this movie.One of the best movie made, and certainly one of the top 10 romantic movies of all time.",8,1,3,17 December 2011
Pulp Fiction," Crazy story about people living crazy lives
","There is nothing normal about this story. It's about gangsters, and life in their context.Familiar phrase sex drugs and rock n roll plus killing sums up the lives the thugs' lives in this movie. It's a very stylized life of gangs, and I guess that's why the movie's called pulp fiction.Travolta and Samuel Jackson plays the hit men. Uma Thurman is the wife of the gang boss, and Bruce Willis plays the boxer who's on the run. Four of them causes/gets into all sorts of mayhem, and in the end there seems to be no conclusion to the story.The story is bit schizophrenic, and is like conglomeration of short stories in no particular context. It's not an intelligent movie, but it's not dumb either. It glorifies some aspect of gang life. The whole movie has a bluesy feel to it, and maybe that's what the audience resonates to about this movie.Irresponsibility's of the characters makes you want to live a life like them if only for a moment. The whole movie is like a moving poster of life from the past.",Null,0,1,8 December 2011
Detroit Rock City," A Movie Worth Watching
","There are lots of really bad B movies, but this one is definitely not one of them. In fact it's one of the better teen themed movies around. It's made in the late '90s, but the scene seems to be set in the mid '80s, and many of the rock classics from the '80s are used in this movie.Four kids who are big fan of Kiss are treated rather badly by their mother and just about everyone else just because they like Kiss. The story is really good, and so are the casts. Many good looking guys and girls gets into all sorts of unexpected loving relationships in this movie.Kiss' Gene Simmons' wife Shannon Tweed makes appearance as one of the lady at the bar.Pretty good movie that you have to see to appreciate how good it is.",7,0,0,13 October 2012
Thor," Onward For Asgard !!
","Nice production of a difficult character to bring to live screen. The story compresses lot of elements from the comic into a 97 minutes movie, and they did a very good job of it.The story succeeds in picking out the best elements from the comic, and puts it into one fine movie. The Odin sleep, the Destroyer, Loki, Sif. The lavish production really succeeds in capturing the godliness of the characters, and magnificent design of Asgard. I really loved the story, and the excitement. I hope they'll do a sequel with Ulik the troll, and Mangog.The movie really captures the essence of Thor in his bravery, nobility along his friends from Asgard. Not to mention his awesome power. Sif drawn by Jack Kirby to me was the most beautiful and noble woman ever to be seen in Comics. I grew up thinking that I'd meet a lady like her one of these days, and it hasn't happened yet.One thing that caught my eye was that there was an Asian character dining in Asgard. It's politically correct, but having Asians in the kingdom of Norse gods is kind of a reverse discrimination.A+ production and a fine movie to watch !",7,0,1,1 November 2011
A Hard Day's Night," Simply untouchable

Asides from the original Ed Sullivan's show aired in February of 1964, I don't think there's a video that captures the godly wonder of the Beatles better than the Hard Days Night, and the songs are just fantastic as well. You'll know how great this movie and the Beatles as living entity are (were) when you compare this movie to the likes of 'Having a wild weekend' by Dave Clarke Five which was made in similar vane around the same time. The latter absolutely didn't age gracefully as the Hard Days Night did.The movie is still great to watch, and is an important milestone in cinema history. Just fab(4)ulous !",10,3,4,20 October 2005

","The movie about final days of Hitler in his Berlin bunker. Bruno Gants puts in an epic performance as Adolf Hitler.The Russians has crossed into Berlin, Hitler has no more forces he can deploy, but refuses to give up. People around him has solemnly accepted their fate. The drama is about war itself, and how German military people has come to cope with it. This movie is to have unexpected effect on home made movie 10 years after it's been released. The section where Hitler rants about reinforcement not coming has been taken out and parodied numerous times on YouTube. The movie has become endless source of creativity for those willing to manifest their take on this story.This is one of the best war time movie ever made, and is highly recommended for viewing.",8,1,2,19 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," By George....
","This is just my personal opinion, but none of the three prequels have made an impact on me the way the first three Star Wars saga had on me. They were all average in the sense that visuals were only par with what you can see on TV in the '90s on ward, and story line lacked the suspense first three Star Wars movie had. It was basically a story to explain other stories rather than a stand alone piece. Still I think George could have done a little better job with plot and sub-plot development (the only good dialog in this movie was 'So this is how democracy dies. With thunderous applause.'). Plot lacked a binding central theme other than to explain how Luke and Leia comes into existence and how Anakin turns into Darth Vader (In which his transformation to the dark side seemed sudden and unnatural to me). I think George Lucas surrounded himself with too many yes men and non-thinkers. For instance, in all the CGI back ground and visuals, things are repeated too many times (like cars, robots, buildings etc.) which takes away from the visual by being too busy. There's generally too much of everything. This I guess is the art department just going along with the computer guys concept (because they can duplicate stuffs easily), and all earthly scenes all looks like they're shot in Europe: The buildings, large marble interior etc. etc. and costumes that also looks like they're feudal age Europeans, which just makes me feel not out there in a galaxy far far away. In contrast to this, ANH had many never seen characters, and back drops such as the storm troopers, battleships, tie fighters, X-wing fighters and yes, I did feel like I was in a galaxy far far away. ESB was even better in this regard. So by George, how did such an original concept filled franchise turn into so mundane a series ?It's been few years since I've submitted my original review, and I've noticed an underlying theme that maybe this series is trying to tell. Padme says to Kenobi 'Have you ever considered we may be on the wrong side ?''What if the democracy we believed we're serving no longer exists ?''And the republic become the very evil we've been trying to destroy?'. Considering that 'Clone Wars' has incorporated many urban legends in its plot - covertly, maybe this movie also has a hidden message to it. Also covertly, is Lucas trying to tell us something ? If so, my hat's off to him once more. So, when I see this with a fresh new eyes, I see that maybe the episodes are trying to convey more messages than I thought. Lucas is the only director who would be putting those deeper messages into his story. We need to look at the world around us, and see where Lucas is getting the hints for his stories. After seeing this movie with a fresh eye, my evaluation of this movie went up a notch.",8,3,5,11 December 2005
Lord of War," One of Nicholas Cage's best
","We all want to make quick bucks, especially if you got the talent for it. You're young, underprivileged, and there's nothing going for you in life - so you've got nothing to lose. This was the situation Ukrainian immigrant Yuri (Nick Cage) was in. He latched on to one of the most lucrative trade business in the world - arms dealing. This sort of thing has a way of catching up to you, and eventually it does. There's a point where you've made enough money that price of taking short cuts are no longer worth it, but unfortunately, life won't let us go so easily. What do we do then ?This has to be one of the top three movies Nicholas Cage has starred in. He's great as the main character. His portrayal of Yuri is so spot on. The highs of out smarting the justice, getting your dream girl, are all portrayed in a stylish way I've rarely seen in recent movies. Of course there's price to pay for all this, and he's paying it. In the end I felt that he wasn't as bad as the justice department that was after him. There are bigger evil in this world, and compared to them who runs the system, guys like Yuri is small fry. He was just after his fortune.I loved this movie, and I highly recommend it for viewing.",8,0,0,4 September 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," The Best Movie Ever Made !?
","After a sobering experience in the prison, what would a person believe as the best thing in life ? This movie tells so much story asides from the drama that going on in the prison. Andy (Tim Robbins) is an accountant who's wife is cheating on him. She gets her comeuppance when she gets killed by a thug during her affair. Andy is accused of the crime, and gets sentenced for life at Shaw Shank prison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who would become his life long friend. Andy knows he's innocent, and won't give up to get the freedom that he deserves. He devises a long term plan that will eventually bring bombastic results to the prison and its people.Why would a movie about prisoners and life in prison ever make it to the top of so many people's best movie list ? Because it's about an underdog hero that gets his goods in the end. It's about someone who believes he's being mistreated, and through his genius not only devised a way out, but constructed a new life for himself. The irony, the humor, and imbecility of society is all crammed into this fine drama.The finest drama ever to be captured on film. It would be a long time before someone makes a better movie than this.",10,0,1,5 October 2011
1408," More of physical terror than spiritual terror
","It was interesting to see how horror would be depicted in a hotel room. It turned into physical violence by the ghosts that would have been terrorizing even if they were not done by any super natural entities. This turned away from pure ghost based terror like 'Juon'. Asians might have the market in this genre. I think they understand true spiritual terror better than the Hollywood movie makers.The acting was good, and although there was only two real actors in this movie, John Cusack and Samuel Jackson, they built enough tension to make the whole story work. The first 30 minutes of the movie was superb mostly due to the acting abilities of these two actors.The rest of the movie, you have to see it for yourself. Whether you like it or not will probably depend on where you're coming from. Unexpected turn of events were well placed, and as a movie this was an entertaining piece.",3,1,1,3 September 2011
The Iron Giant," Brings tears to my eyes
","This is perhaps the best animated movie I've ever seen. Iron Giant is a no name robot who's origin and purpose for creation is unknown, but is surprisingly innocent and powerful. It has a sense of purpose and has loyalty and decency we don't even see in ourselves until it is provoked and shows what it might have been created for - weapon of mass destruction. Who created the Iron Giant with its heart of gold and body as indestructible weaponry ? Was it part of an unknown robot army from another planet that got strayed from its squadron ? The story leaves lots of plot holes that beckons us to know more about this character. Would the writer of this story do a sequel that fills in all the gap in the robot's back ground, and help us look deeper into its character ? It seems to be one of the best character to come along in many years. Although the scope and the period setting is similar to 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' this animated character is much more lively, and thought provoking.",9,2,3,21 December 2005
X-Men: First Class," First Class Indeed !!
","This fifth installment of the X Men series is by far the best of the bunch. Building on the saga that director Bryan Singer started, this is made on a much bigger budget of $160M compared to that of $70M for the first X Men movie.The story picks up where the first X Men saga started, in the Polish concentration camp run by the Nazis where young Magnito (Bill Milner) started to show his unusual power. A mutant version of Dr. Mengele, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) wants to pick on young Magnito's talent, and in the process murders his mother. Some years later in the early '60s, Eric/Magnito (Michael Fassbender), now a grown young man, wants his revenge on Shaw, and is on his trail. In the mean time, young Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher), finds kindred spirit with also very young Mystique (Morgan Lily). They grow up together in Xavier's home all the way up 'till Xavier graduates from Oxford with a doctorate degree. They team up with mutant genius Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) who invents Celebro to locate other mutants. Soon the first batch of X Men is formed (Not the same crew the first X Men were in the comic book series) which includes Magnito, and Banshee who will later become their enemies. By this time, CIA has been introduced to the existence of the mutants, and starts to show their interest. One of the interested party is colonel Stryker. Magnito, still out for his revenge, involves Xavier and other X Men on the battle against Shaw.This is the most polished in terms of production out of all X Men movie series. The screen writers did an excellent job of integrating the origins of X Men saga without hiring back the original actors of the series. Although it's a prequel to the first X Men movie, the movie has freshness that makes it stand alone as an original chapter in the X Men's saga. While other producers continue to trash the Marvel franchise, this series is amazingly consistent in their quality with producer Bryan Singer, and other talented writers, and directors holding the quality together. I loved the plot, and the character development of each of the X Men the way it was shown on this movie. It's an original story, but one that I'm sure will make Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby proud.There were some period piece screw ups in the props like seeing Revox A77 recorder which is a product of the early '70s, and Bose 901 series III speakers which are the product of the early '80s. Fashion, and the buildings were of much more modern vintage than the early '60s when this story is supposed to be taking place. But overall, they didn't mess up the mood of the story too badly.This was a first class production, and even if it wasn't a spectacular hit at the box office, merits a sequel done by the same team of creators.",9,2,4,2 October 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Great Movie
","Johnathan Nolan wrote this movie to be the finale of the Dark Knight trilogy that started with Batman Returns. There's been many good Batman movies, but this one is probably the grandest, and the greatest.Catwoman finally shows up in this series, and Ann Hathaway in my opinion was the most convincing Catwoman since Julie Newmar.The problem with this movie was not the movie but the sound track. The sound effects is so loud that it's difficult to find the right level that makes for good dialog listening, and the action scenes.The movie is in the same style as the previous two installments. But this one's probably the closest in concept to the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller which this series is based on. Christian Bale does Bruce Wayne so well.Everything came together in this movie, and is one of the best movie of 2012.",9,2,7,20 December 2012
Iron Man," There's gonna be a sequel......I hope
","This is the best Marvel comic to movie made in my opinion topping even the venerable X- Men. What was so great was that it captures the essence of the Iron Man's world so well. I was a big fan of Iron Man comics when I was growing up. I especially liked Don Heck and Gene Colan days of Iron Man, and this story has rich innuendos from those days like the homage to the original gray Iron Man suit, to the gold version, and to the red and gold design. What I liked especially was that they didn't try to make this Iron Man 'dark' to pretend that it was a serious drama, (but it was a good drama none the less) and captures the blazing opulence of Tony Stark's glamorous world and boost it a couple more notches. This is truly Iron Man at its best, and it was the neatest Marvel character come to life on screen. I'm little surprised that John Favreau who played Foggy Nelson on Daredevil was the director for this film. He did a great job, and so did all the casts on this movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow were absolutely believable as Tony Stark, and Pepper Potts. Interesting was the arranged version of old Iron Man theme song playing in the back ground of this movie on few of the earlier scenes. Keep the flames burning guys, and come up with a sequel that's just as great.**Happy Hogan makes cameo appearance as the chauffeur of the Bentley driving Stark from the airport back to the factory. Tony Stark makes you feel, he's the cool exec with a heart of steel ! (if you know where this came from, you're really an old fan of Iron Man).",10,1,3,27 May 2008
Casino Royale," 007 reboots
","007 series reboots with this one. Daniel Craig's first starring role as 007, and also as his first assignment as 00.Everyone was wondering how Daniel Craig would do as 007, and in this movie, his professionalism shows. He's in top physical shape, and didn't back off an inch from the gritty Bond that he started out with. It's a departure from Sean Connery/ Terrence Young days of charming but ruthless James Bond. The modus operandi of Bond wasn't fleshed out so well in this first episode except that he's somewhat of a loose cannon, and stops at nothing to get his job done. But this becomes what gets him selected for the types of mission he is assigned to in the future.Even as 007 movie, this is a beautiful movie with stunning scenery. The actors are beautiful too. 007 seems to be ready for the 21st century.The only issue I have with this new Bond is that he seems to be trapped in the system that's run by bureaucracy, and computer information system. He looks too much like just a tool working for the government. M is too high strung, and tries to keep Bond on too tight of a leash. She takes up too much bandwidth in the story. I'd like to see Bond be more of himself, and work in an interesting ways with Felix Leiter or other 'old' friends he may have. How Bond evolves, and develops his own character in the future is point of interest.Good reboot for 007, and would like to see this series take its own direction in the future.",5,0,3,3 August 2011
X2: X-Men United," Bryan Singer is a genius
","I think people have already agreed on the fact that this is the best comic to movie translation ever done (perhaps until X3), so I won't get into that.What makes this movie so good when I total the tally can be squarely put on one director: Bryan Singer (And no, I'm not a friend of his or being compensated by him in any ways). What makes this movie better than other Marvel translations into the big screen is the following: First of all, casting is perfect (or direction is good enough to mask any flaws in casting). They're not selecting the actors based on their previous work but is an uniquely original mix of talent that when brought together, works. The cinematography is also excellent with special effects, props, lighting, background, color and mood is perfectly integrated on each scene. Plot and subplots all enhance the interesting quality of each superhero and villain, and it's not just a blurr of characters showing their super powers one after another.The movie shows that you can be respectful to the original plot of the comic and yet tell a meaningful story in 2 hours. Unlike some other movies that are just superficial translation of character's name, costume, and powers. How deep the script writing, and screen play went into digging into the interesting aspects of the original comic is evident in this movie, and bringing them into life in the big screen shows the true genius of people who've worked on it.I just wished that all other movie rendition of Marvel superheros are as good as this one. But for now, I'll be satisfied that at least one director's got it right.",10,0,0,4 October 2005
Godzilla," Awfully Long movie to be staring at darkness half of the time
","This was a good movie (I think).The reason why I'm not sure is that about 50% of the movie happens in darkness that barred me from seeing what actually happened. Pity because the movie had good plot, good acting , and good action.Maybe they wanted to have good art as well, but they failed on this one. The action scenes happens mostly in darkness, and you can't discern much detail as to whats going on. It's like AVP 2 in this way. And to hang on it for 2 hours is rather a long ordeal. So, my rating is somewhat low for this film despite the good effort that went in it. A sequel ? Nah, I don't want to see another version of this movie.",6,0,0,12 December 2016
Casino," One of the best
","I've been intrigued but never been excited watching an Italian gang themed movies except this one.The movie is based on the life of real life character Frank Rothenthal played by Robert Di Nero. Sam Rothstein (Di Nero) basically isn't a bad guy asides from his talent to sell gambling to the would be gamblers. But because of his underworld connection, he gets into more trouble than he deserves, including an attempt to assassinate him. This is one story that what actually happened is more exciting than any fictitious story. I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen when I first saw it. It's certainly one of the best movie director Martin Scorsese ever produced. Joe Pesci was spot on as Sam's friend Nicky. He really looked like the character in real life he was portraying. The gory ending would be climactic for a movie, but to think that it actually happened in real life is inconceivable.If Martin Scorsese had to choose a character to make a movie out of, he couldn't have chosen a better one than these two. The story is explosive at every turn, and is one of THE best mob based movie ever made.",9,1,1,23 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Still awesome to watch
","The ground breaking visuals never seen on cinema was a shock to many of us who's seen this movie for the first time. After over 30 years, it's still the best movie of its type.I didn't notice this when I first saw this movie but Ben Kenoby does mention about the 'Clone Wars' in this episode. If this was a far reaching foresight on George Lucas' part, my hats off to him. This movie has more visceral impact compared to the CG filled episodes 1-3. It just shows that you can't beat the real thing. More I saw it, more I was in awe of all the fine details that was put into this movie. Each of the scenes were directed precisely without a flaw. George Lucas was an awesome director when he made this film. Ben Kenoby also mentions about Darth Vader who killed Luke's father - as we find out in the next episode, this was only a metaphor. The movie is both simple and complex at the same time.There's no word to describe this movie. Made on a relatively modest budget, it's still the finest movie of its kind. It shows that money is no substitute for talent.It's a miracle that we have this movie. I'd say it's one of the crowning achievements of human civilization.",10,2,3,22 November 2011
Fantastic Four," Awful
","I don't give such bad reviews often. After all it's only a movie and why should one take it so seriously ? But sometimes it might send a message to people who trounce on something good and make it bad.If the movie was an original plot created by the producers, the director, and the screenwriter, then they can do anything they want with it. But when you take a material someone else have worked hard to make good and establish it's worth over the years, it's like walking into an established culture, and you need to take respect for the work that's already been laid down. Suppose you walked into another culture and just superficially swiped the exterior and presented it through your opinion, have you desecrated the value of that culture ? Most likely.Fantastic Four is the hub of Marvel Comics. Without it, it's questionable if other Marvel comics would have had the success that they've had. It had the quality that defined Marvel. As a matter of fact, Spiderman had his debut supported by the Fantastic Four in Spiderman #1, and from there Daredevil, X Men and other silver age Marvel superheros flourished. Fantstic Four's plot, the universe, the characters were always setting the trend to be mined by other Marvel superheros later.In this movie, there was no respect payed to the original plot of the Fantastic Four or the characters which made the story work. Compared to works done by Bryan Singer in the X Men series where the story line was original but didn't conflict with the original ways characters were presented in the comic book, and plot and subplots were laid out carefully to maximize their characters, this movie just took a broad brush and painted over everything. Casting wasn't good and the actors didn't reflect the qualities of the characters of the Fantastic Four. When they made Doom an industrialist, they made the same mistake of making Talbot an industrialist in the Hulk. Then the only angle becomes about money and power. Doom is an interesting character. He's from a country that's a kin to Transilvania and his mother is a sorcerer, they could have presented him as he is and the story would have been interesting. Instead they just turned him into an one dimensional angry character.This was a movie that could have been better than the Spiderman. Instead they've turned it into an amusement park ride.1/10",1,15,29,4 October 2005
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Beautifully made film
","Twilight saga continues with Bella now approaching graduation from high school.Very beautifully made movie with good acting and good story. Each scene is framed just perfectly with beautiful actors and actresses. I consider them to be young A list of Hollywood. Story is interesting, but details are difficult to understand. It's an action movie but, its hidden under the muted atmosphere. Mixture of ordinary, and extraordinary. The story is something that can be dark, but it isn't.As my description shows, this is a difficult movie to rate. It's a unique creation that's very original. The head game that happens between the vampires, and the werewolves is well written. It's not a werewolves in the dark kind of a movie. Where they show up, they show up. Where there's supposed to be action, there's action, and where there's supposed to be romance, there's romance. It's a great movie.I think this movie will become a classic that will be around for a long time.",Null,0,6,4 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The very best of Star Wars
","Many people regard this as the best of Star Wars movies. The details and the story are much more denser than the first installment.I've heard that many people were in tears when they saw this movie for the first time in the theaters. I was certainly in awe with the even more refined visuals of this movie. The prop designs in the first three episodes were great, and they provided the feeling that you were out there having a great adventure. The first Star Wars was shocking to see, this one was pure excitement. I don't think there was a case where the sequel was so good as this one in movie history.This is the finest science fiction movie ever made, and since Lucas himself couldn't top this effort, I will guess that it will be long time before anyone does.",10,0,0,22 November 2011
Windtalkers," Good story, but not realistic
","Filmed in Kualoa Ranch on the windward side of Oahu, Windtalkers takes on the interesting story about US military's usage of Navaho tribes men to communicate in a near unbreakable code of their own native language. The movie is produced well, but it has an artificial looks to it throughout the whole movie. This takes away from the experience. To begin with, all the actors look like they've just taken a shower, and their uniforms just delivered from the cleaners. Nicholas Cage doesn't look like a war worn soldier that he's supposed to be.This is one of the early John Woo film that's made by Hollywood. It was made around the same time as another Asian movie director Ang Lee's 'Hulk'. They share similarity in that they both look too clean to be real.The concept of the movie was pretty good, but the human drama, was weak. The movie could have been shorter by 30 minutes and more focused, it would have been a better movie.",6,1,1,23 December 2012
The Breakfast Club," Cool Movie
","Not sure why this is such a good movie because it practically has no story to it, but it is. Couple of teenagers meet in a Saturday morning detention class, and does some crazy things. They are all anti authority, but they all can understand each other in their own ways.The stars of this movie reads like who's who of the teen stars of the '80s. They all went on to have successful careers during the '80s. They did have charisma, and were entertaining to watch. The movie might have not worked well if it wasn't for the stellar acting by Judd Nelson.This is an interesting movie that the whole movie happens within the school. It captures the social mood of the 80s well. Kids back then definitely had more peaceful outlook towards their life than now. The movie is an interesting concept movie that the likes were never made again. If there was a 'cult' movie of the '80s, this one is it.",7,1,2,26 December 2012
Contact," Masterpiece of Sci-Fi
","I'm not a big fan of Carl Sagan, but the way they made this movie makes it a master piece of a drama, and a science fiction.There's no one element that stands out in this movie (except the excellent deliveries by Jodi Foster), but everything being done at such high quality is what makes this movie a gem from the '90s. On location scenes are beautiful, as are the in studio scenes. Character development in the story is excellent with each character getting their place in the story. That's pretty much all the element you need to make a fine science fiction movie.One other thing that stands out is that there's no conflict in this movie except human ones. It's not about war, destruction, or hysteria that drives the story. It's about new frontier, and first contact. I wish newer movies would show some originality at this level, and not rely on destruction, and conflict as their sole plot.This movie scores high from all angles, and that's what makes it superb.",7,1,4,8 September 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Best of the Transformers movies
","Third installment of the Transformers series is much like the first two, but the story is more interesting. Premise of the story is that NASA sent Apollo space crafts to explore crash landed Transformer space craft containing an elder Transformer named Centinnel. They found five 'pillars' that is part of the technology to teleport matters. But it was a trap. Decepticon was there first, and they stole most of the pillars before Nasa got to them. They left Centinnel there because Optimus Prime was only Transformer that could revive Centinnel that in turn can operate the pillars.Shallow story is a hallmark of director Michael Bay's movies, and this one is no exception. It's all about wham !, Bam !, rock um, sock um battle between the robots. It's made in grand scale, but if you expect any depth, you're watching the wrong movie. There're some cruelty as was seen in the previous Transformer movie, that I really didn't care for. But I could see that they had to bring this in to keep the story going.The movie is best of all the Transformer movies, but it's still not much more than an expensive cartoon.",Null,0,4,24 December 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," Outstandingly Bouring
","Jason Bourne is brought out into action again because him and his girlfriend had been attacked. Jason goes to find the culprit who is after him and in the process starts to regain his memory. This is one of the most wooden movie I've ever seen. The only saving grace of this Robert Ludlum novel based movie is that the story is probably partially based on reality, and mind controlled super agent like Jason Bourne probably really exists in this world. Rcently declassified MK ULTRA material points to this fact. Bourne Identity was written in the '80s, so Ludlum was 30 years ahead of his time.Matt Damon is the most boring actor next to Ben Afflack. His range of emotion is extremely narrow, and that's what's making this movie so boring. The other actors are exceedingly bad looking in this movie as well. Maybe it's because if they hired better looking actors they would outshine Damon. This movie should have been better than the first movie, but the sequel was worse than the original, and is even less recommended than the Bourne Identity.",4,0,2,26 December 2012
Jurassic Park," Landmark Movie of the 20th Century
","Once or twice in a life time an event happens which makes you feel you're glad you've lived long enough to see it. This movie is one of them. I've been a staunch Dino fan since I was small. I used to visit museums on weekends to see the dinosaur fossils. I was awed by their size and beauty, but felt bit sad that I'll never be able to see the real thing. But because of advancement in computer technology, we can see the dinosaurs reanimated. Even after all these years, CGI in this movie is still believable, and integration to their surroundings, seamless. It wasn't a prototype, but a very polished product, and it was the first of its kind. I have yet to see a CGI based movie that has out classed this movie.This is a landmark in movie making, and is highly recommended for viewing.",10,2,3,6 January 2006
The Godfather," A truly story driven plot line
","This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of 'fluff' that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly 'angry' or 'troubled' in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making.",9,1,2,24 January 2006
