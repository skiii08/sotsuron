Sucker Punch," Never a dull moment; engaging start to finish
","I don't understand all the bad reviews... Not only was sucker punch engaging from start to finish, but the story and the special unbelievable, but the acting was superb, even if a little clich√®.Maybe those who gave this movie such bad review should open their mind up to something a little different to what they're used to. To fully appreciate this movie you need openness of mind to something out of the ordinary.Entertaining from start to finish, smart, funny, and wall to wall amazing, I cannot fault this film. Open your mind, and be prepared, for the unexpected. Ignore the bad reviews, those people probably couldn't tell a good movie if it hit them in the face.Well done Zack Snyder, well done.",10,4,9,7 April 2011
