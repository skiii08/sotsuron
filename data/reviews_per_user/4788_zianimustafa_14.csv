Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981)
","Steven Spielberg's film still looks sexy after more than three decades. Spielberg and George Lucas gave Harrison Ford (who had worked with Lucas previously in Star Wars) a unique role, as an adventurer and lover of the archaeologist named Henry Jones Jr. - known as Indiana Jones, or just Indy.
He works as a professor wearing glasses, but in holidays he adventurer does not know fear, with his hat. When the Nazis discover the whereabouts of the Ark of the Covenant (which will give them an unstoppable power), Jones must stop them.
In my opinion, the film has the best key I've ever seen, filled with a host of memorable pieces (such as Ford's giant rock hunt), by the great cinematographer Douglas Slokamp. In addition to John Williams who composed music nominated for Oscar, which was performed by the London Symphony.
Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the biggest box office film in 1981 and has won nine Oscars, including the best director. Winning the best art output, best editing, best sound, best visual effects and finally the best sound effects.
The cast on Ford is also good. With Paul Freeman, who plays the role of French archaeologist Ren√© Bellock, Denholm Elliott played the role of Jones' colleague at the college (Marcus Prodi). And 'Karen Allen' in the role of Habiba Jones (Marion Ravenwood).
The film also adds some humor. There is a fascination and vitality for this film, which Spielberg later admitted was 'the first film where I actually visualized without thinking.' Really attractive film. One of the best action and adventure movies, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is really fun as a whole.",8,0,0,21 January 2018

Dead Poets Society," Drama with a poetic flavor attached to the imagination
","This film, which inspired and changed the lives of many, gives us a story: about the English professor John Keating
(Robin Williams)
<ul><li>In a boarding school, the Wilton Academy, where the students are studying, the professor enters the life of the Academy students</li></ul>To inspire them to love life and change their lives forever, when it makes them think in a different unconventional way and with a lot of rebellion.
The film contains a collection of beautiful poetry quotations ..
Including the quote from a poem by the English poet Robert Helek:
'Gather the buds as long as you can, the old time is still flying, and the same flower that smiles today will die tomorrow'
The film also contains a lot of wonderful ideas .. Of which the professor said to his students:
'We do not read and do not write poetry because it is funny, we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race, and the human race is full of emotion.
Medicine, law, business administration, engineering .. is a noble and important character in order to preserve life
But poetry is beauty, romance, love, these are the things we live for. '
And the beautiful film also:
That he knows them on the slogan 'Carpi Diem,' which is Latin means 'nest your day'And teaches them how to 'extract the essence of life' from every moment, how to think for themselves and choose their own wayEven if he is uneducated or strange, to have the courage to defend their ideas and beliefs, to face the power that is trying to paintTheir way and their future without any consideration for their feelings and emotions.",8,0,0,19 January 2018
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight is a masterpiece of the past for present cinema
","When the director makes a masterpiece full of beauty and transcends the boundaries to be a mixture of violence and bold words and racist tyranny is undoubtedly a way out to carry out his imagination, a scourge of critics and Oscars.
Tarantino is looking beyond the crown and it is inconceivable that Tarantino is looking for the Oscars. The academic prize may be of specific standards and adherence to it will help win the nomination and win. This is not a match for Tarantino. He defies the standards of his unbridled imagination and makes him in a traditional boxed frame. Tarantino is his talent.Genius Scenario ..
The clever scenario in The Hateful Eight takes the viewer on a thrilling three-hour trip reminiscent of the films produced in the mid-1960s by the Western Spring director Sergio Leone.
Dialogue here can never be predicted. Tarantino's clever, intelligent dialogue makes the viewer puzzled and inquired and then smoothly and pleasantly brings together the parties to the dialogue to come as viewers to the heart of the story without any sense of amazement in the story. It is difficult to find dialogue in the film going in one direction is a dialogue full of side texts outside the main story, which is no less in the beauty of the original text.Acting is one of the reasons for the film's success ..
In each scene, there is mutual creativity, especially actor Tim Roth, who mentioned us in this film in the manner and performance of actor Christopher Waltz, and as a friend told me that the role was originally for actor Waltz before that Now assigns to Tim Roth. Samuel Jackson's outstanding performance, especially in Tarantino's films, was also known as violence does not care for anyone who talks continuously without interrupting dialogues and if anger uses his weapon without hesitation.
Let's not forget the ideal choice of actor Kurt Russell as the prize hunter because the actor's character and his image are terribly suited to Western fashion and here lies the beauty of his choice of role.
Finally, actress Jennifer Jason, who was able to perform a performance that impressed many critics, represented a difficult role to play, a role full of brutality, indifference and even insult, yet she took this role assigned to her Oscar nomination.Enio Morikoni and the Sondtrak.
Since the film begins, you will be back in time for five decades, as if you were watching a sixties movie, and do not forget that he was the same person who made that music at that time.Moriconi takes you with the capsule of time to the past. Classic music at a quiet pace was only a prelude to an epic of musical interludes. The musical interludes are reminiscent of the grand piano. During the long conversation between Major Marquez and General Smithers, Daisy 'after the' poison 'scene.
And most important of all is that wonderful music on the horse scene is dragging the cart, the lens of the output that focuses on the legs of the horses and then move beautifully to the faces of horses and behind the snow covered trees interspersed with sunlight .. At the beginning of this scene precisely and smoothly blends beautiful music with songs The sound of women has long been one of the foundations of the genius Inino Moriconi in his works, to become a scene that is not more than a few seconds one of the most beautiful cinematic scenes that I have seen in the cinema, and everyone who saw the film will undoubtedly admire this wonderful scene mixed between the creative cinematography and Saundtrak.
A musician who began to write music for the cinema since the end of the fifties and until now after the passage of nearly 60 years and the same tender with the same creativity deserves all respect.The unknown soldier !?
Have you considered those beautiful scenes in the film? How beautiful it was in terms of camera distance and angles.
All this is left behind by an unknown soldier who has always made many of these beautiful scenes in his constant cooperation with Tarantino, but he does not know much, and this is often due to the habit of many film lovers to focus on the director, actors and sometimes writers.
One of the most intriguing scenes in the film was nominated for nine Oscars and three of them, the cinematographer Robert Richardson.
Scenes of violence !!
Many of the many violent scenes in the film are the only negative point in the film in general. But the truth is that Tarantino is no longer just a shot of death, but a negation of the reality of the killing scene.
Who knows Tarantino well not surprised by the amount of violence repeated in the film because the history of the director has always seen his preference for violence as in the film Pulp Fiction and even inglourious bastards and finally Django.finally
The film is a masterpiece that has emerged in a time when films are no longer as they were before, the collection of successful film elements from many aspects, and make sure that The Hateful Eight will be one of the beautiful films that we are going back to watching as we do now with old movies.
Tarantino, through his works, assures us once again that he does not enjoy receiving an Oscar or other prize, as he enjoys seeing his imagination embodied on the ground through a film.",9,0,1,19 January 2018

American Beauty," Kevin Spacey how wonderful you're
","American Beauty(1999) is one of my best films everi like it too mush and specialy the great performance of Kevin Spacey !!The film has exposed the deceit, lies and hypocrisy of the American society that is trying to emerge as an ideal society
But at home is a torn society and a liar who cares only about false appearances and deceitful formalities
No one disagrees with me when I say it is the best film in the new century
Kevin Spicy also made his second strongest role after the Joker role in the Dark Knight
The film deserved every award and nomination for Oscars and awakened Americans from their sleep and And expose their community
I see that the film will not be forgotten and will extend its effects for decades as I expect it to be the classics of the century

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy(2004)
","I saw him yesterday and made me very puzzled in his assessment
Was the average level or good
Is the comedy in it good or boring
On the other hand, I am sure of the quality of performance and what I saw in the film
Is the emergence of most American comedy stars such as Ben Stiller .....
The story was pretty good and the script very coherent
Some of the footage was funny and full of humor
The performance of Steve Carl was the best actor knows very well how to make you enjoy all
A word he utters and every movement he makes and what saddens me is to give him the space he deserves here....bad thing

The Birds," The Birds
","One of the masterpieces of the brilliant director Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock has succeeded in making one of the creatures that are innocent into ferocious beings.
The film talks about a coastal city in San Francisco being attacked by swarms of birds for no apparent reason.
The film begins with a romantic character, with Tippi Hedren linking with Rod Taylor and Suzanne Pleshette in a triple love story.
Melanie meets Mitch at a bird shop where she makes a joke that led her to the Mitch family's home in the coastal city north of San Francisco to deliver gifts of love.
Then the film begins to gradually escalate, starting with the bird that attacked Melanie on her head to attack the birds for a children's party to quickly climb up to bloody attackers and the scene of the viewer in a state of panic and concern about the characters after being attached to them.
The cause of these attacks may not seem obvious but the bloody and frightening attacks, as well as the sound and visual effects, have raised fear and shock in the heart of the scenes, and this is certainly what Director Alfred Hitchcock wanted.
Despite writing a closing scene, I left the end open until interpreted by the viewer as much as he wanted. In addition to the cause of bird frenzy, which remains a question mark to this day, the film has become one of the most exciting films and mystery.
The Birds is Hitchcock's last best work (and hopefully not).",7,0,1,19 January 2018
The Martian," The Martian Damon died in a challenge inside and outside the film.
","The movie Mars may not be a logical or purely scientific film, but certainly succeeded in satisfying everyone as a film science fiction exciting. The film is directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon and Jessica Shastin. It is believed that Mark has died and left alone on Mars, and begins a struggle to survive while trying to communicate. On earth, in the hope of saving him, Marc remains without a thing in this planet, which is twice as large as the Earth, and there is nothing but himself and what the crew left before the forced departure.One of the film's problems that you may read about is the storm that led to Mark's departure in the first place. Mars's atmosphere is about 1% as compared to the Earth, so Mars winds, which may reach 100 mph 'which is rare in the Mars climate' would be like winds at ten miles an hour on Earth, Flying a paper plane in the sky not to fall humans.Beyond that film is excellent in almost all respects, since the beginning of the film can not stop stunned by what Ridley Scott of visual effects, and continue to amaze something something with the stages of passage of the film. The film begins in a desert desert similar to the environment of Mars, as we know from the images of him, red, arid, empty, filled with horrifying silence.The film moves to two stages. The film then moves to two sides, the psychological aspect of Mark being that he has nothing more than he can think of getting to his home and family, and the aspect that makes him one of the most responsible and discoverable people. Here lies the details, the film may not be perfect in writing. Both are in these two sides.When you see a movie that tells the story of the horror of loneliness, you have to think of two aspects (psychological and physical). The physical aspect I thought for a moment was that Matt Damon's work was a mighty example until I knew that the whole thing was just an effect on a computer, which increases visual dazzling and its effects and reduces The actor's creativity and sacrifices for the role.
In an interview with Matt Damon, he said he wanted to lose weight for the role, but director Ridley Scott stopped him. 'He talked to Ridley about losing weight for the role, because I had already done it for the movies, Almost a month ago I said that the time is perfect. I can lose 30 to 40 pounds and start shooting from the end scenes back to the beginning until I get back to my normal body. 'Riddle Scott' replied 'F * ck that'.As for the psychological side, yes, there was a conflict, and yes, Dimon was good at it, but it was not enough for me to see the dramatic dramas, being on Mars, knowing that you are 140 million miles from Earth, home, home, family. Because you will not see human beings after today in your life, it is very frightening once you think about it, so I had a desire to stress on a dramatic scene that would be screaming and whining and then supplication and crying. but it's okay.Some may notice the American championship in the film, or even the mathematical complexities, when we calculate the number of years between Mars and the Earth or the speed of Mark's or even attraction between the planets and others, but the film certainly did not make it more sophisticated than the movie Nolan among the stars, Understand some of them and do not mind their presence, because it will not actually stop them, in turn will increase the quality of the scientific background of the film, which puts it in a challenge with the scientists who will see it.The film is not the ideal film in all its analogies, but it is certainly interesting to the viewer, a victory for Ridley Scott the rest of the workers, from the voices to the visual effects and even fashion .. A poetic and objective film at the same time, and above all we can not but stand in hugs for the creativity of Matt Damon and his grandmother to portray The scene of the dramatic car and the rest of the film with complete creativity.
