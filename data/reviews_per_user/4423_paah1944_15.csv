Ford v Ferrari," Christian the pom
","Christian Bale born a pom the perfect choice here as the pommy go fast man of the 1960s. Matt Damon has never made a bad movie. Onya Matt. Surprise Henry Ford 11 gets a spot to expand his droll dour personna and does it well. I felt his shattering. The movie score superb I shazamed it. Ford V8 engines have always emitted the ulimate raunchy note by far european engines dont come close. Damon and Bale bounce off each other so well. The visuals pace vibrance super
Suport actors great especially Carrol Shelby main man. Thank you
Patrick
PS read a few purist petrol head reviews where away from escapism the Ford Motor Co was described as Goliath as in David and ...... Well Ferrari did sell out to a Italian socialist Govenment owned Fiat Motor Co
Who was Goliath free enterprise Ford or Italy Government Fiat Motor Co ?

Blade Runner 2049," A remake backfire
",Saw the original with Harrison F not a bad movie out there at the time different. The not needed remake w Gosling the wrong fit whole movie just convoluted and pshchedelic excess. Walked out. Tried it again years later on TV switched off. Wrong,1,5,8,3 August 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," My bestie
",Raiders was showing at the movies for months and i had no idea what it was about. Eventually the gos re Nazi bad guys got me in. I saw it in Sydney CBD. OMG best movie ever. I went home got my old dad and took him back to the same cinema to see it. Old dad OMG also 10/10,10,0,1,31 May 2019

The Patriot," Robin Hood??
","Watched the Patriot on TV. Mel G has a crack and good on him. I assume it is based on American history. Again & if so it brings home why the Yanks seek out a blue its in their DNA. Any one who picks a fight with them will hurt. Anyways our Mel well sort of our Mel does the usual overact thing. E.G. when he eats the apple. Was it really that tasty??. Heath i got to say was Heath. Forget the joker that was out there. The normal Heath is the normal Heath. The sister in law thing was soapy. Bad guys passable. Horses too good. A Robin Hood re run with a Sherrif of sorts. Besides the yanks eventually get to beat up the poms.Oxymoron. its like a pre civil war where they beat up themselves

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," QT viz Cohen Bros
","QT has delivered some giant entertaining stuff over the decades. Possibly like the similar entertaining skyscrapers the Cohen Bros he has eclipsed ????

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Boring
","I like Q T stuff so far. This one did not bubble my spritzer. Pitt looked far away. The Aviator man sort of got revved up. Long boring too slow a burn. They got the exhaust note right for Polanskis vintage MG which I think was a replica. I was sweating on a QT boomer however left after 80 minutes. Got to say Margot R looks hot. Movie i was not entertained or escaped.Oh and the Reynolds Tobacco Co excess bunger use. Product placement ?????

1917," Gasp
","1917 awesome epic of a thing. Todays youth should be made to view it. The cogent stench of death and arrogance is in your face. This is what transpires when peoples cut the dialogue off. The scene where the officer suggests to our runner soldier to have present some witnesses at the message delivery point is so apt then and now. Magnificient effort.

Caddyshack," Iconic
","Ted Knight & Rodney Dangerfield steal the scenes in this iconic laugh out loud gem. The peanut mars bar scene is legendry and most likely played out in real life in many back yard pools. The combo of players are all special even the CGI rodent. Loved it

The Untouchables," Classic
",The movie is a classic the benchmark for gangster flix. Mr Connery was a cert for a Oscar. Costner goes well as do all the Feds. Period cars guns garb spot on. Bad guys tip stuff. Not exactly accurate re black hat demise however well done appropriate popular execution.,10,0,0,20 October 2019
Enemy at the Gates," Earthy
","Clearly a 10/10. Hard determined informative no big heads. Gritty thought provoking it hurts. The acting gets you in super. The scene with the uber sniper and his girlfriend huddled in a bunker is .....
Wow. Full marks to all the participants. Ed Harris never lets up. A Russian hero good a refreshing change. Would have worked in black and white. Gutsy effort the poms always deliver a superior war movie warts and all

Midway," Independence Day
",Midway. The visuals sound camera work CGI asset display all v good. Acting sort of wooden. Then Woody Harrelson fronts with that mischievious face. Im not sure if Admiral Nimitz was of that personna. Harrelson saves the actors coterie here. The movie is a retribution thing without the sledge hammer. It is noted that the American military present in mostly drab khaki style not pressed garb. The odd smart white Navy dress up. As against the Japanese military very sharp dark contrast pressed uniform. The movie director would have engineered this. Why?Patrick,9,1,1,2 February 2020
