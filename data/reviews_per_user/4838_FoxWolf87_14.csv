The Rock," Nicolas Cage... Again...
","Sean Connery carries this movie. If any actor besides Connery was tried to star next to the Charisma Destroyer (Nicolas Cage), he would've failed.Despite Cage I actually really enjoy this movie. It has an interesting lead villain, great performances by Ed Harris, Sean Connery, and John Spencer; a good plot, and good special effects.It is a 'Turn your brain off' action flick, but the motives of the villains are actually interesting to think about (to me anyway).There is some stereotyping, but overall the movie is extremely entertaining...EXCEPT FOR NICOLAS CAGE!!! HOW DOES THIS MAN KEEP FINDING WORK!!! I HAVE YET TO SEE HIM ACT IN A FILM!!! Whenever he utters a line, I want to scream 'Shut-up Nicolas Cage!!! Leave!!! I want to see what Mr. Connery's doing!' (i.e. 'It's you. You're the Rocket Man...' - Worst... delivery... ever.) Thankfully, the movie doesn't focus on him all the time. There is sufficient diversion with the villains, the other actors, and the special effects to distract from Cage's performance.That said, Cage in a starring role automatically adds a -3 modifier.6/10. Good action, interesting lead villain (Harris), good performances by most of the cast, worth a look if you ignore Nicolas Cage, which you can easily do with everything else going on.A NOTE ABOUT NICOLAS CAGE - The -3 modifier will disappear if I see a film where he engages in the art of 'acting.' I don't know him, he could be a nice person, but I would like to see actors... act... or try to act... in a movie.",6,1,1,12 April 2009
The Hangover," Very Good Comedy Film
","I recommend this film to people who won't be easily offended, and want to see a good comedy film in theaters or on DVD with a few friends.This film is ridiculously funny with an interesting plot, memorable characters, and a fun story.POSITIVES - The central characters are all excellent. They are not just walking punchlines (although Galifianakis comes close), they actually feel like real people.<ul><li>The humor is excellent. This isn't a 'couple chuckles' movie. This is a 'laugh out loud every couple minutes' movie.</li></ul><ul><li>The narrative is excellent, making you wonder what the hell they did the night before and having you guess with the characters as to their actions (A favorite moment is when the chicken is walking around the room. All I could think while laughing was, 'What the hell did they do with that chicken?'). At the end of most of the scenes there's also a fun surprise twist; something you didn't expect to see, and makes you laugh at the same time.</li></ul>NEGATIVES - I'm really just nitpicking here, because the movie was really good. However, I didn't care for some of the shock humor. Shock humor is something like showing an old man's ass during a prostate exam (which they do in this movie). It wasn't used often, but it was irritating when they did it.<ul><li>Rob Wriggle and the lady playing the other police officer are very over-the-top, and don't really feel like real characters.</li></ul><ul><li>Some story threads remain unresolved at the end. I would've liked to see what happened when the Uncle saw the car on the return, and I would've liked some closure on other story threads, but it didn't really impact my enjoyment of the film.</li></ul><ul><li>Some of Zach Galifianakis' lines seemed forced, but even the forced lines are kind of funny, so I didn't mind that much.</li></ul>OVERALL - The film is ridiculously funny, and if you watch it with a few friends who aren't easily offended, you will probably have a good time.8/10 - Some flaws, but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the film.",8,6,10,16 July 2009
Star Trek," Nowhere Near the Old Star Trek... But It's Good.
","I really thought this one would suck. I'm a fan of the Star Trek series, and when I heard it was a prequel, I thought it was a terrible idea. When I heard it was a reboot, I didn't like the idea of just eliminating the universe I liked. I also read some of the negative reviews by other Star Trek fans and wasn't encouraged. But, it really is good and I would be lying if I said I hated it. It was actually very well made.No. It's not on the same plane as the other Star Treks. This one, is popcorn fun action sci-fi. The other series are concept and character driven thought-provoking morality plays and dramas (With some exceptions. There is a lot of God awful old Star Trek floating about too. {Season 3 of TOS, Star trek V, and Season 2 of Enterprise come to mind})But if you accept this as entertainment, and you don't get stuck in the rigid dogma of Gene's assumed vision (Trekkies), or the preconceived notion that Star Trek is for nerds (jocks) you will find a very entertaining summer blockbuster.STRENGTHS - The action is great. The effects are mostly incredible. The actors (with the exception of Chekov {But he's not that bad}) really nail the essence of the characters. The dialogue is good. The pacing is a little fast, but it's meant to be fast, and it keeps you engaged.WEAKNESSES - 2 very obvious ad placements. Strongly emotional events are happening, but the story moves too fast to focus on them. Sulu becomes a little bit of a stereotype. There are some illogical plot elements. And actually (I love the original Star Trek timeline but...) I would've preferred more separation from the original universe. SAlso some of the Enterprise sets look more like a treatment plant than a starship.However, overall, this is really good. It's not the same as the original Star Trek series', but that doesn't make it bad. I would've preferred that they stuck with the old timeline, but really, they didn't know what to do with it, and neither did anyone else, so they took the only logical course. A well-made reboot to appeal to a general audience.This is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone (not just the hard-core fans), but anyone who wants to see a good action film.8/10. Good action film. Some flaws, but not enough to make it a bad movie.",8,3,8,10 May 2009
The Birth of a Nation," No Excuses... This is Just KKK Propaganda
","A lot of people see this film as an artistic triumph. But the fact that it's well made doesn't redeem the underlying message. You can say that it was a different time... make excuses for it... But there are some films that are best viewed as a regrettable part of American history.This film is quite simply a justification for the genocide and subjugation of African Americans and a recruitment video for the KKK. It warps history and attempts to manipulate the audience into believing offensive racial stereotypes to justify white supremacy. It romanticizes plantation slavery in the south, when in fact it was a time of suffering for many. Most of the black characters in this movie are just white men in black-face, portraying extremely offensive racial stereotypes. It ignores the fact that many white individuals did not live this lifestyle, and lived in poverty during this time (another HUGE cause of the Civil War which is virtually ignored today)and instead tries to rally whites to it's cause by referring to it as an ideal time.The class I watched this with ALL thought it was ridiculous and completely offensive, regardless of race and gender. Granted... in 1915, it was a different time and a different culture. They viewed this film as a piece of art. But we're in 2009. Racial relations have changed. There is still an undeniable racial divide, but it is nowhere near the levels found before the first World War. It's time we stopped making excuses for films like this. This is nothing more than well made KKK Propaganda presented under the guise of history. I give it the 1 it truly deserves as a film that still exists in our society. However, I will give it this... Despite it's problems, it is important to watch this film from an academic standpoint: the ONLY reason being to understand our artistic history and the mistakes made. It should be viewed as a marker for how far we've come, and how far we still need to go to achieve true equality.",1,73,146,2 February 2009
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Non-Fan Perspective: Enjoyable, Fun, Family Romp
","As a non-Harry Potter fan (Have not read the books, and have only seen a couple of the movies), I had no expectations for this film. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was quite good. If you haven't seen it, think of it like 'Doctor Who' with wizards (Complete with a wizard Tardis). It reminds me of some of the better episodes featuring the 11th Doctor. That is not a criticism, by the way, I genuinely enjoyed the film, and I am not saying it is a rip off of 'Doctor Who,' I am simply saying that it is most similar to some of the adventures of the 11th Doctor, with magic instead of time traveling space stuff.Here were some of the highlights for me...ACCESSIBILITY - I like that I didn't have to know a ton about the Harry Potter universe to understand what was going on. It doesn't exactly hand hold you, which is good, but you can at least follow the story and enjoy it without being super familiar with the universe. (There are a couple things that seem like plot holes unless you know the universe already, but they're not severe, and if you go with someone who knows the universe, they can explain them to you. Like... why, for example the wizards don't just murder all the humans and be done with them. In the lore of Harry Potter, it is apparently established that it screws up your soul and messes with you magically when you commit murder. Not explained in movie, so I figured I'd mention it here.) CHARACTERS - All of the characters who are supposed to be likable are likable. The actors do a good job with the roles. It's always pleasant when you don't hate the protagonists and it's always pleasant when the characters develop and have arcs that follow logical emotional and motivational progression.STORY - I like that this film has well-paced story progression with climaxes and slower character building scenes that effectively create the universe. I also like that the action set pieces/special effects serve the story rather than existing simply for their own sake. There are a few silly moments that challenge suspension of disbelief (the big ol' reset button at the end), but overall, it remains consistent with its own internal logic and, most importantly, it tells a story with a minimum of plot holes (once again, so long as you suspend your disbelief).EFFECTS - They're good enough to tell the story.CREATURES AND FANTASY WORLD - I genuinely liked all the creatures, and I was genuinely interested in the dynamics of the fantasy world they created. The 20's era wizard society and their interactions with the 'real' world were interesting to see and engaging.PROBLEMS - None that I care to nitpick on first viewing. The positives far outweigh the elements I thought were overly silly.OVERALL - 9/10 - I highly recommend this film to general audiences. The logical story progression, the well-paced plot, the dynamics of the fantasy world, and the likable characters, coupled with the fact that you don't have to completely understand the Harry Potter universe to enjoy it, make for an effective and fun family adventure. It's not flawless, but it's still quite good.",9,5,10,14 December 2016
Die Hard 2," Good Movie
","I went into this thinking it wouldn't be that good, but I found it very enjoyable.This is a very good 'Turn your brain off and relax' action movie.For some reason, I actually enjoyed this one more than the first one.It does start off a little slow, and some of the characters are a little stereotypical, but it has an interesting premise, an interesting story, very good action sequences, and some great performances by most of the actors in the film.You can tell everyone was trying hard to make a fun, interesting film, and it shows.9/10. I recommend this to anyone who just wants to relax for about 2 hours and watch an entertaining action movie. It is a little slow for about a half an hour, but I don't feel it makes it any less enjoyable. You don't have to think about it, you can just relax and enjoy the ride.",9,1,3,12 April 2009
2012," All Effects. No Substance.
","Really the only thing I can recommend about this film is the special effects, especially a spectacular sequence of the destruction of Los Angeles. That part of the film is a technical masterpiece (and it's what they showed in the trailer for good reason). The first half of this movie is watchable just because of the special effects. Once you get to the halfway point, the effects start to slip a little bit (I felt the ice and water effects weren't that good) and once the effects go, the film goes.The story and characters are all bland clichés. You've got a several people trying to save their broken families and coming together or saving each other at the end, which has been done a billion times. You have the passionate scientist who cares about people against the dickish politician, which has been done a billion times. You have a bunch of landmarks getting destroyed, which looks cool, but it's been done a billion times. And you have arguments of humanity vs. survival which have been done a billion times, and much better than they're done here.When there are no special effects, there are one of two possible things going on. The first is broken families trying to survive (yawn). And the second is politicians arguing. Because when I think cataclysmic destruction of the world... my first thought is C-SPAN, and all the excitement of... watching senators, scientists, and yes-men getting annoyed with each other, making veiled threats, passionate speeches about what the other guy is doing wrong, and yelling about principles and matters of procedure which no one else really cares about.In all, I was really bored by this and the political BS just got on my nerves. It's really not an interesting movie. And I did start to nod off towards the end when it got REALLY stupid (they have the happy ending that defies all logic, just to have a happy ending).I could go into more detail, but I really just thought it was boring, especially after the half- way mark when the special effects started to look a little shabbier.3/10 - If you want to see some cool effects sequences, give it a look. Otherwise, it's just really dull.",3,4,5,5 December 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," It's not just people hating on it...
","When this movie came out, I thought all the nasty comments were just people hating on it without seeing it because it's a popular flick for young, teenage girls, and they wanted to look cool by trashing it before it came out.And then I actually watched the movie, and... SWEET Jesus... It is actually one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not just people hating on it. It is actually a really bad movie. I mean I feel like I've been mooned watching 'New Moon'.But, just to even things out, I'm a guy. So I'm not exactly unbiased when it comes to this movie. (I saw the movie because I work at a Drive-In theater, and it was a really slow night.)That said, I've seen love stories and fantasy love stories that I've actually liked, or I can respect for being well made, even if they're not my thing. And that's what I was expecting with this. I was expecting it just to not be my thing, but it made me frigging ANGRY to try to sit through this. I say 'try' because I couldn't sit through the whole thing!Everyone else has commented on the movie, but I'll add my two-sense anyway.ACTING - Mostly awful. The woman playing Bella is actually OK, but she's given horrible dialog, a horrible motivation, and a horrible story so it's impossible to get into her character.STORY - It's stupid. That's the only way to describe it. It's like watching a two hour emo-trip. Here's the story ***SPOILERS***Edward breaks up with Bella. She goes through a long... long... long... LONG over-dramatic period of mourning where she meets another guy and basically acts completely emo and sees Edward everywhere. Not just for a few days or a few weeks, but MONTHS. Which the film MAKES A POINT TO SHOW US BECAUSE THEY PUT UP TITLES SHOWING US THE PASSING MONTHS AS SHE STARES OUT A WINDOW!!!! And then she starts hurting herself and putting herself in dangerous situations because... life is meaningless. And you know, she's emo. Because her boyfriend broke up with her. And even though she's got other guys expressing an interest left and right... she just keeps crying over this one guy, who is kind of a dick. That's not romantic. That's a sign you need psychological help. And it is a terrible message for young women. 'If your boyfriend breaks up with you... act like it's the end of the world... because it is. Don't try to move on. Dwell on it. And get into motorcycle accidents.'DIALOGUE - Bad. SPECIAL EFFECTS - Bad. PACING - Bad. LOVE SCENES - Unbelievably bad. CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS - Ridiculous. ANY GOOD?Well... I will say the cinematography is nice. Some of the editing is nice. The girl playing Bella can act, but she's given bad material. And some of the scenery is kind of nice.But in all... the movie is really crappy. I didn't see the first one, and I don't intend to. Hell, I didn't intend to watch this one. I only tried to because it was a slow night at the drive-in movie theater where I work. But if you want to watch a good fantasy love story, there's better stuff out there. There's more well-made stuff out there. And fans of 'Twilight,' I'm not hating on you. If you like it, hey, everyone's got their own preferences. Watch what you want to. But I didn't care for the movie, and I, personally, didn't find enough good to give it a higher rating.1/10 - Only watch it if you're a fan of 'Twilight' or you're really into this kind of thing. To anyone else... I wouldn't even bother with it.",1,35,54,5 December 2009
Transformers," It's OK.
","I watched this again having seen the new movie, and not thinking too highly of the sequel, I found I actually like this one a little better.This is a typical popcorn fun blockbuster, but the human characters and the humor prevent it from being totally mediocre. Unlike Revenge of the Fallen, I didn't really find the characters annoying and I thought the humor was much more fluent (as opposed to forced) in this one.POSITIVES - I like most of the humor in the movie, and I got a few good laughs out of it. The action and special effects sequences are all excellent. Bumblebee is awesome. It sustained my interest throughout, and I liked most of the characters. In fact, none of the characters really made me angry, which is a definite plus because the new one had several annoying characters.NEGATIVES - Ad placements are everywhere. Granted, they're there to pay for special effects, but they are... everywhere in this movie. - Some of the Autobots' dialog was a little corny (especially Optimus Prime) but they're working based on dialog from the cartoons, so I understand. - The plot is pretty silly with everyone trying to get a cube and hiding ancient robots under the Hoover Dam, but, again, the original material is a little silly. - There are also a lot of plot and story logic errors in the movie (a problem carried to the second one) but it didn't make me angry. More like, 'That's just silly.' Overall, I feel the movie is entertaining popcorn fun. Not everything will appeal to everyone, and I felt a little silly at times watching it because I felt the plot, story, and some of the characters were a little goofy. However, it doesn't get to the point where I'm really mad or irritated by the movie. I gave this one a higher rating than Revenge of the Fallen because the sequel has moments which just made me cringe in disgust.6/10 - Recommend for anyone who just wants to sit back, relax, not think too much, and eat some popcorn.",6,2,3,10 July 2009
Inception," Very, Very Good (but not for everyone)
","'Inception' is an extremely well-crafted film, but it's one of those films that not everyone will like.Personally, I really enjoyed it. The story was extremely well thought out. The characters were very good. All of the actors did great jobs with their roles. The imagery was very interesting and the special effects were incredible. It has a multi-layered plot which keeps your mind engaged the entire time you're watching it, and even after you leave the theater, but it wasn't to the point where I got fatigued with it.I do disagree with some of the philosophy of dreaming in this film, but this movie is trying to express its own philosophy, not my beliefs, and just because I disagree with some of the philosophy, that doesn't make it a bad film. It's trying to tell its own story using its own philosophy, and I respect and enjoy that. I think it's a mistake to think that all movies should reflect your own philosophies, and if you want to see something that's going to reflect your beliefs to a T... you should make your own film, and not expect it from someone who doesn't view the world the same way as you. Seeing different philosophies and keeping an open mind are the only ways to grow as a person. If you don't expose yourself to new things, you don't really grow. You stagnate.I've seen a lot of critics comparing this to 'The Matrix' and 'Paprika.' I've seen both. This film is neither. While it shares common elements in some cases, it manages to tell its own unique story with those elements, and does a very good job of doing it. No film is going to be 100% new and fresh, and just because it shares common elements, like entering of the dreams of others, that doesn't make it bad. That's like saying 'The Empire Strikes Back' is bad because it has space battles and it deals with good vs. evil, which have been explored in earlier works. You really need to take the film as a whole and not whine about how individual elements have been done elsewhere.NOT FOR EVERYONE - While I really enjoy the film, I do admit it isn't for everyone. It has a complex multi-layered plot that requires you to be engaged the whole time to understand everything that's going on. This is not a 'run pee' movie. If you aren't paying attention, you could miss something that'll be important later on. And at two and a half hours, I can understand how some people might start to fade out, or how they might not want to sit for that long. If you don't like thinking too much about the movie, this really isn't for you, because you need to stay engaged the whole time to get all the nuances of what's going on, and it does require some work on your end to get everything. The ending is also very open ended, which didn't bother me, but it did bother some people in the theater (one guy saying 'f*** that!' on his way out).So overall, it is very good, but I can see where some might get turned off by it. I really enjoyed it, and I can't think of anything that bothered me about it... which instantly propels it to a '10' in my book.10/10 - Very, very good, especially if you like complex plots and thinking movies, but not for everyone.",10,2,5,29 July 2010
Lord of War," Nicolas Cage = Charisma Destroyer
","Ahhhh.... OK. I'm going to start out by saying I don't like Nicolas Cage. I don't think he can act. So I was biased going into this movie, but I tried to keep an open mind. It didn't help.From the get go you know this is going to be very preachy, anti-weapons hippie nonsense, which I can take.I don't mind trying to get messages across through film. But when you open with a BADLY CGI'd bullet going through manufacture just to shoot an African child in the brain, you know it's going to be unrelenting and unenjoyable preaching.Now.. onto the acting. Jared Leto, Ian Holm, and Bridget Moynahan are... incredible. I'm serious. Their acting is absolutely amazing in this movie. It's really too bad that Charisma Destroyer sucks all of the potential from their performances.Whenever Nicolas Cage is on screen you are distracted by just how bad his performance is. You can't connect to the character, you can't like him, you can't hate him, you just keep saying to yourself, 'Oh God, I hope Nicolas Cage shuts up soon.'And this movie really gives Cage a chance to shine in all of his glory as he delivers the same wooden performance in EVERY scene with EVERY line and EVERY voice-over.And even when the good actors are on-screen, you start to think... oh well maybe there will be something interesting with the drug abuse here, or maybe the gunrunner's wife will have a good character moment. NOPE!!! Cage needs to interrupt us with another voice-over.Have I mentioned my loathing for Nicolas Cage?Anyway... besides Charisma Destroyer, the plot is very preachy. Interesting characters could've made up for this, or letting us decide whether Orlov was right or wrong intellectually instead of giving us paper-thin excuses for actions THE CHARACTER knows are wrong. But no. It's just preachy. And Nicolas Cage is such an unlikable character, you are force fed the message that gunrunning is bad.2/10 - Nicolas Cage adds a -3 modifier to any film he stars in. This film could've been really good and really interesting with a stronger lead. It would've been perfect if it allowed us to choose whether Orlov was good or bad and Cage was gone. Instead we're force-fed this nonsense.SPECIAL NOTE ON NICOLAS CAGE - I don't know the man. He could be very nice. However, I have yet to see him ACT in a film, which makes me generally dislike him.",2,3,9,12 April 2009
Sherlock Holmes," It's Decent
","Just to give a little background, I have only general knowledge of Sherlock Holmes. I've read one story, I've seen references to it on movies and TV programs. So I really just have general knowledge of the mythology. That said, I though the film was decent. It's not great, but it's certainly not bad. It's just a solid decent film.Basically what they did is turn Sherlock Holmes into an Action/Adventure/Mystery Film. Purists of the stories might be a little turned off, but for the casual movie-goer, it's a good movie.GOOD STUFF The story is engaging and keeps you just curious enough to see what will happen next. There's a lot going on with the main murder-mystery plot, and several good character driven sub-plots.I think Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as Sherlock Holmes. I liked his portrayal of the character as an extremely intelligent social misfit who is respected by all, but has a general attitude of distaste for those around him (with a few exceptions). The rest of the acting is decent, and succeeds in getting you interested enough in the characters to see what will happen next.I really liked the creative uses of deductive logic, not just to solve mysteries, but in fight scenes and everyday situations. In this adaptation, Holmes is able to use deductive reasoning in hand-to-hand combat to create the best scenario for disabling an opponent. I thought this was an interesting twist and a cool addition to the character. I loved the way the deductive logic scenes were shot, too. It shows a slow motion explanation of everything Holmes is planning to do so that you can see the logic behind the actions. He calculates every move in advance based on his opponent's weaknesses, then he calculates recovery time and psychological impact on his opponent. After this slow-motion explanation, you get to see the whole thing in real time, and it's really f***ing cool to watch the logical explanation, and the process behind the fight before seeing the scene in real-time.The resolution to the mystery is satisfying, and it's exactly how you would want to see a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery unravel. I won't go into detail, I'll just say it's not ridiculous, and that it's based in logic and deductive reasoning.NOT SO GOOD STUFF While I liked most of the performances in the film, I had a hard time seeing Jude Law as Watson. I don't think its anything the actor did wrong, I just think it was a casting misstep. When I think Watson, the first thing that comes to mind is not 'ass-kicking bodyguard.' I was able to overlook it for the most part, but in the back of my head I was just going, 'That's not Watson.' It just doesn't seem natural to me.There was also an issue with me where the clues are not really given much screen time or attention. Part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it, and seeing how the pieces come together; but the way the film is edited, you really can't see the ending coming, and it's more just Holmes explaining rather than giving the audience actual clues to think about.The ending also threw me a little with the final confrontation with the villain. I'll just say on this that it gets a little cliché, and someone survives something without a scratch that that person really shouldn't just walk off without at least a bruise. However, it's not NEARLY as ridiculous as Indy's magical fridge of wonders.For the most part, the CG is cool, except for a few scenes at the end where you can tell it's not real. This is relatively minor, though.OVERALL The film is decent. It's worth a look if you just want to see a good, solid film that isn't too heavy or too deep. It's a decent Hollywood action-adventure comedy.7/10 - A few stumbling points, but overall decent. Recommend for casual movie-goers. Hardcore fans of the books and stories might get p*ssed.",7,0,3,30 December 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A Definite Improvement
","Having seen the last film, 'Revenge of the Fallen,' I did not have high expectations for this movie. I also heard a lot of bad reviews of this film. But having seen it, I have to say the movie was actually pretty decent and I think it's a definite improvement from the last one. In fact it's probably the best of the three. That's not to say it doesn't have its problems, but I did actually find myself entertained by this film and I do appreciate that the filmmakers tried to make improvements based on everyone's complaints about the last film.IMPROVEMENTS - Annoying characters are mostly dialed back and removed, and stereotypes are dialed back. That's not to say there aren't stereotypes, but the stereotypes this time around didn't totally offend or annoy me to the point where I couldn't enjoy the film. Skids and Mudflap are gone with no explanation (they needed to be removed from existence), the parents aren't in it as much, and John Turturro is far less annoying. The story makes more sense (at least for a popcorn fun blockbuster) and I'm able to understand what's going on without getting totally annoyed. There are no robot balls, and there is no close-up of John Turturro in his underpants (there is a close-up of Ken Jeong in his underpants, but it's played up for a shock humor joke which actually made me laugh for the big payoff so I can't complain. Others might find it offensive, though). Oh, and there is far less dog and robot humping all around.OTHER POSITIVES - Obviously the action and special effects. Definite props to the animators, the cinematographers, the stunt coordinators, and the special effects guys because they did an amazing job. Again. Plus I'm actually able to tell which robots are fighting in this movie, which is good. The jokes are a bit funnier this time around (not all big laughs, and not all tasteful, but definitely more hits than the last movie). There is better (not great) but better character development and I didn't totally loathe anyone. The pacing, the editing, and the music were also all very good. The elements I enjoyed all contributed to the story and added to my enjoyment of the film. The villains are also much more threatening because they have a definite goal and you see more of the damage they can cause (although the foaming at the mouth was over the top).NEGATIVES - There are a lot of unnecessary cameos and characters in the film who pop in and leave. For example, I'm not sure why John Malkovich is in this because he doesn't really do anything. He just comes in, acts weird, and leaves. They introduce him like he's an important character and then he's dismissed about halfway through. Kim Jeong will be annoying and offensive to some people, but he didn't annoy me so I really only mention this for the benefit of others. Bill O'Reilly and Buzz Aldrin make unnecessary and distracting cameos. And I love Leonard Nimoy, I think he had a good voice role in this film, and I love Star Trek and Spock, but the Spock love was totally distracting. They mention Spock a lot, show a scene from 'Amok Time,' make references to the Enterprise, and even have Leonard quote a famous 'Wrath of Khan' line. It's really very distracting. There are a ton of distracting ad placements in the movie (which, you should really expect if you go to see any Michael Bay film because they pay for the effects). Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a very sexualized, very stereotypical, very useless damsel in distress who may be offensive to some people (as one of only 2 major female characters in the movie). There are also still very noticeable plot and logic errors, despite the improvements, and some scenes that don't quite fit right.But, in spite of my problems with it, it did entertain me and I did enjoy it. It's about on the same level as 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' or 'Twister' and any problems I had are made up for by the improvements and positives. 7/10 - Some problems, but overall enjoyable popcorn fun. Recommended for people who just want to watch a robots and stuff blowing up movie without worrying too much about plot or characters.3DI don't like 3D anyway, but I saw this with a friend in 3D, and I do have to admit that the 3D was better than the last film I saw in 3D ('Tron Legacy'). It's not totally dark, and it didn't make me sick looking at it. However, the graphics popping out are still distracting, and I can't focus on some of the animation detail due to the blurring effect of some of the 3D graphics. If you go to see this I recommend 2D just to get the full details of the animations.",7,1,4,10 July 2011
The Island," Michael Bay's Best Film
","I really consider this to be Michael Bay's best film.STRENGTHSIt has an interesting and well constructed plot and a fascinating story (which may have been taken from The Clonus Horror, but that movie was so bad MST3K had to revive it. So I don't care.)The action is relevant to the character situations, often with the clones using what they have on hand to defend themselves.The acting is very good (for the most part) especially on the parts of Ewan McGreggor, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Ethan Phillips. Their portrayals actually make you care about the clones' plight, and Mcgreggor does a great job playing two versions of Lincoln. Steve Buscemi also does a good job with his usual 'dirty-minded man with a heart of gold' role.The special effects were excellent (It's Michael Bay), and the film rarely drags.WEAKNESSES There are several OBVIOUS ad placements which distracted from the story. Scarlett Johansen is often seen screaming 'Lincoln!' and adding little to the film. And there is a sex scene which comes out of nowhere and makes you go... WTF?However, there is much more good with this film than bad, and it deserves some attention. It makes you question the quality of human life and makes you feel for the characters in a desperate situation.Overall... I consider this to be Bay's best film. It's dark, yet somehow fun. It's thought-provoking, entertaining, and it really does have a great story brought to life with beautiful effects, acting and scenery.9/10.",9,0,0,1 July 2009
