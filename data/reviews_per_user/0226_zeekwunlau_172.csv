Ford v Ferrari," Look Great!
","It's been a long time since I saw such a great movie. The two starring actors are actors I particularly like. The characters portrayed by Bell are so good. The characters stand up soon after appearance. The look, tone, acting skills are really explosive, and Matt is also very good. I guess it is a change in history. I guess Bell will die, but I do n't know when it is, so I watched in the second half. I was afraid he would hang up without paying attention. Fortunately, after running the game, although it was best to compromise, it was also very good. His wife said that he had matured, and the carnival before he slowed down was probably the last time he was presumptuous before he matured. At that time, I believe he knew the pressure of his life and his wife and children to raise. Enjoyed great glory and became a great driver, but he still chose to do his duty as an ordinary father and husband, keep the job and support his family. Although he was put together in the end and did not win the championship, it didn't matter, at least all Everyone knows that he is the first. A person who does n't like the racing theme very much, it looks good, looks good, looks good!",9,1,2,1 April 2020
Blade Runner 2049," The warmth of the soul
","Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of the original in my heart, but it is a deeper one. It will be full of details and humanity that have not been flashed underground. It is more silent than a strong and straightforward science fiction scene. Department's discussion of thought and true self. The reason why the Blade Runner is known as the ancestor of Cyberpunk is actually not very clear to me. On the surface, the Blade Runner 's architecture was inseparable from the beginning, but unexpectedly and clearly extended the depth of thinking and creation: fine The 'future' sci-fi scene that is long, deep and unextensive, but ubiquitous. Compared with the rigid and direct display of the entire setting and the grand world view, the Blade Runner is like a monologue at the end of the film. It is a big The background story is a thin link, and this story is the corner of the torn page in this photo of 'Future'. Through the patchwork of details and scenes, we can find the blurry image of the entire future world. There is a beauty that wither itself. . Unlike the ordinary 'floating day', the microscopic is essentially a complete and scalable image of fullness, but the prospect story of the Blade Runner is probably rudely cut off from the universe due to cost issues and shelved. Reflecting the resonance of the inside and outside world is the monologue in the rain, which is broken and complicated:'I've seen things that you humans can't believe. I have witnessed the battleship burning at the end of the constellation Orion. I watched the C-rays shining in the darkness near the Don Wyeth gate. All these moments ... will end with time Fading away, just like ... Tears disappeared in the rain. 'This paragraph is not bad when it comes to emotionally clarifying the human nature and thinking. After reading several translated versions of the monologue, I have to insert a blade runner and translate it into a silver wing killer. The translation is really affecting people's feelings. In Taylor RFI, the translation of 'Everybody knows that my love dies in the heart of contrasts' is totally worth the money back to the album ... On the other hand, the memories of ROI also make a color fill for the outside world, despite the war Other than this corner, the space is still blank, but at least the world view is at least consciously connected with the whole story to form a thread. In addition to the hard sci-fi aspect of the world view, the Blade Runner preliminarily conveyed through 'De Card's pursuit of bionics and love for Rachel' that 'machine life is essentially no different from humans'. Decader and Rachel have humanity and love, and can correctly perceive all the meaning brought by affection and time. Ridley Scott 's style is fusion and remodeling. The corners are rough but cannot change the madness of the core of the science fiction story. Although weirdly born in the crowd of people, the simplicity ca n't hide this exchange of thinking perspectives. The subtlety of unity.The surpassing of 2049 is not to further promote the world view and story plot. After all, in fact, the story script is bound to the bionic man K and it is a sequel. It is difficult to escape from the entrapment and shackles of the original Blade Runner original. The road is fully paved. Waiting for choice, it is reasonable for most of the sequels to be difficult to surpass the original. Science fiction is largely based on photography technology. The color and light sense are successively rotated in turn. Under the large scene, everything is like a poem without words, written by the wild. There is no science fiction story's most common desire and youthful warmth. In the final analysis, the second most touching part is its romance, hope, and self-seeking. This is a downright tragedy, but at the same time it really puts soft science fiction in The thinking of philosophical and human relations is rendered to the extreme of true feelings.The first soundtrack in 2049 is 'Almost Human', the word Almost itself is a torrential rain, with a regretful temperature. The bionic man K and the virtual intelligent girlfriend Joi at the core of the story are another way of confirming the view that 'bionic people and people are really the same'. Compared with Dekad and Rachel who have firmly believed that they are human from the beginning of birth, The tragic colors and struggling traces on K and Joi are more obvious. A bionic person who thinks he is just a fake, a body that even entrusts himself with nowhere to look for. Joi is a broken neon in the virtual world that can be played by everyone. Ownership of all people occupies her and makes her extinguish, but this false emotion is forged by her, and even becomes the leader of all K's feelings and life. Believe it, the illusory heat and temperature when the steel body and the fluorescence touch each other will not make people sleep. K ... K's story is nothing to tell. His struggle is like chasing the sun on the wasteland. 'Covering the mountain, I found that the other side of the mountain is still the mountain.' Human nature burned more than fire in the steel body, hoping to burst, K's relief and exhaustion when he fell into the snow like a bird fell to the sea, pure white is the cold reverberation , Covering his monologue, and also giving him the echo of this world, struggling or falling, belief may be broken, but he poured all the regrets and shortcomings in the movie with heavy emotions, it is simply shocking to send out Sound.",8,1,6,4 April 2020
First Man," Make a biographical film into an author's film
","To say why 'First Man' inspired my desire to express so much, it should be because this movie allows me to enjoy the ample fun of interpreting the movie.
After watching the movie, I wiped out very emotional tears, and quickly hit the five stars. First of all, this film really touched me on the emotional level. Two nights after watching the movie, I turned over and over in bed to think about every plot and every shot to understand what the director wanted to express, and I think I got a more self-consistent logic. I found a sufficient reason for my touching.
In short, this is not my first attempt to decipher the hidden password in the movie, but this is my first strong urge to write something.
In the play-focus on the individual's heart from the background of the grand story
The outline said that the movie watching experience when watching 'First Man' reminded me of Rome. Both are focused on an individual in a macro era environment. The main line of 'First Man' is about the story of landing on the moon, but the difference is whether it is 'the story of the first man on the moon' or 'the story of this man on the moon.' The film obviously pays more attention to this individual and tries to ignore the entire human Category. For this reason, the film shows a lot of family dramas that have nothing to do with landing on the moon.
When it comes to family, it involves a theme of death in the film. The death of the daughter is crucial here. This is the beginning of Neal 's estrangement from the family and the world. In fact, he is indulging in a sense of absence. This feeling runs through the whole film, and the clues of the daughter have been embellished in the film, including the daughter The chain, seeing the swings that I knew before, and most obviously Neil stared at her daughter 's bed many times, and often dreamed that her daughter was beside him. Later, his colleagues' deaths also affected him to varying degrees. The key is that the deaths in the whole film also helped Neil step on the moon landing step by step, so the moon landing became Neil's A journey of mourning with death as a stake.
In the end, he landed on the moon, which is the most important scene in the film and the closing of the theme of death. The camera circled 360 degrees around Neil's endless void, the white and cold everything on the moon. At this time, he stood in front of a huge pit, just like the beginning of the film he looked at his daughter's tomb slowly, Tossed off her daughter's bracelet and gave it back to her, completing her final tribute to her.
Listen to it-Focus on the enclosed cabin environment from the infinite exploratory universe
In the movies of space, the display of outer space and spacecraft is often the spectacle itself, which is the selling point. In 'First Man', we can hardly see the magnificent landscape. The director used his unique set of audio-visual systems to try to go Wonderful space movie shooting.",7,0,0,3 April 2020
Vertigo," Fate
","Hitchcock completely subverted the narrative core of the two parts of the film, and the protagonist also changed from a woman who fled with money to a man who killed the woman. In this film, the eyes of the first half of the audience followed the male lead Ferguson to witness the strange behavior and traces of the female host Mullen after being 'possessed'. And as Mullen jumped down on the top of the tower, was judged to commit suicide, Mullen 's husband got the legacy, Ferguson who fell in love with Mullen was desperate, and as a witness confirmed that Mullen committed suicide by jumping off the building, everything seemed to follow The development of traditional film noir. Ferguson should find himself being used by his former classmates, using his fear of heights to help his classmates complete evil plans, and then he will have to work hard to find evidence and truth and bring the former classmates to justice. But Hitchcock did not use this hand-to-catch routine, but instead changed the audience's perspective from the male host to the female host, as he did in 'The Horror,' and the replacement bridge was love. So in the second half came a story of love tragedy (destiny) dedicated to love.It was Mullen who died in the jump, but she was already dead. Her body was thrown away by Judy, who pretended to be Mullen, and Ferguson, an old classmate who had been waiting on the roof of the building. The fearful Ferguson had already turned the truth away, so he took the illusion as the truth and blamed himself. Judy pretends to be Mullen to implement the plan only to get some money and a necklace, but the plan cannot keep up with the changes. When she fell in love with Ferguson, she was destined to never change back to herself. She dressed herself as Mullen at the request of Ferguson. She loved Ferguson, but Ferguson loved Mullen. Judy had to wear a mask to get along with the beloved Ferguson and had to live in the shadow of a dead woman. The movie at this time has completely entered the love story. Until the necklace worn by Judy exposed the feet of the horse, Ferguson took Judy up the clock tower again, and dismantled the conspiracy. Eventually, Judy was frightened by the sudden appearance of a nun who appeared on the side and fell to the building. Lun formed a fatal agreement, and Ferguson looked at Judy's body from the clock tower, as if he had cured his fear of heights. At this point, a series of elements that should have been the biggest suspense have been eliminated as to whether Ferguson 's old classmates have been punished by law, how Mullen was killed by her husband, and so on. Hitchcock turned the suspense movie into a love movie by changing the role perspective and narrative core, and used love to punish Judy and cure Ferguson.",8,0,0,26 April 2020

Scarface," What is the peace that the gang seeks?
","Al Pacino is a good actor, this is undoubtedly, but in this movie, I feel a little bit, I did not know where I saw a sentence before, saying that the real Italian gangster does not agree with Al Pacino From the point of view of acting, I am also a layman. I just feel that the self-expression in the film is a bit awkward. It may be related to the role, but not to the acting skills. The Cuban gangster is not the Italian gangster. I think another gangster actor is very natural and unintentional. By the way, when Al Pacino killed the boss, the last younger brother asked if he needed work. The actor's performance, the expression was really too good, and one thought that he was going to die, and then not only died but also got a job, that kind of sad feeling made people funny and sympatheticCuba 's exile of so many prisoners and refugees to the United States was heard in Luo Ji thinking before. I think every major event in history can make a movie, and it 's a different angle, such as this Department, in fact, he did not focus on describing this event, but put it in a specific personal perspective. I think he can be not Cuban, Colombian, Italian or other. Such a movie allows our audience to From the perspective of a gangster, if a person chooses to commit crime, what will his future be, and what will his life experience? When I first started watching, I was particularly worried about him. I was afraid that he would be caught by the police and afraid that he would not be able to move on. After seeing it, I realized that in fact, the director still has private goods. The criminal 's life will not have a good result. No matter what he has, his heart can never be calm, even if it can be superficial, maybe they will say something Moral conscience? Let 's go to hell, I just want to enjoy the moment, all I want is money, but when he sees his wife and children sitting in a bomb-loaded car, when he sees his brother who is close to him, and his sister, He will definitely understand that he is a gangster, he cannot do things without a lower limit, and he must not let his bloody hands touch his purest person.As a gangster movie, I saw the shadow of Martin Scorsese. The film was almost three hours long. There were no prominent villains or distinctive decents. Some were just cruel reality. Most of the time Alpacino was always one. In the image of paranoid, he will never be satisfied and never trust. What is he pursuing? I think the life he wants to pursue will never be possible, because he has embarked on a path of no return, he has no chance to choose a different life, so when he sees his sister walking into the ballroom, it must be very Sad, so when my mother scolded him, he accepted it all. Although he was angry, he didn't retreat. The director beat the audience from the side. Don't think that the dark spots are cool, don't think you are invincible, let alone do A bad guy, finally Al Pacino fell in the pool of blood. I think that moment is the tranquility he is after.",8,0,0,1 May 2020

Requiem for a Dream," Personal perception
","To the extreme, it is the most direct feeling after watching the movie. The twigs and branches of loneliness and desire closely intertwined the characters in the play. In addition to eating, her mother only had to chat on TV to comfort her. The sudden notice became a ray of light in her darkness, which pushed her deep into her heart and revealed her morbidity. After taking drugs, the mother wore a fisheye lens in a red dress and lipstick, shaking the magic, like a poppy flower swaying before the audience years ago. The real magic may be the refrigerator that was always thought to be blown, and it will only be destroyed by a sound.
Throwing away the coat of funeral, the film gave me a new 'experience' of drugs. I do n't think depression or nausea are enough to accurately explain the 'chic' of the film. It is more like a natural disgust and rejection after investigation. A series of shots such as drug powder, injection, pupil dilation, etc., the corresponding blood veins, manic anxiety and even unscrupulous means allow viewers to experience the dizziness, despair and hysteria directly through rapid editing and soundtrack. Behind the unusual editing and dazed soundtrack seems to be the manipulator of the puppet, making you struggle and nervous in front of the screen. Finally, there is a kind of 'see through' and resolute resistance. Such a rich level of editing and equipment compulsively makes this 'anti-drug movie' artistically unparalleled!
After watching the movie, I have been immersed in the depression of the characters in the play. They all have good wishes, the mother's arms, their own clothing store, and their family lovers, but they all embarked on the path of destruction. Is it the necessity of drugs? I do n't think so. I think the director wanted to insinuate a whole morbidity and frustration. After drug use, they started to have a bit of 'enjoyment' and 'satisfaction', which was beyond ordinary feelings, because maybe they had Happy satiety and sense of attainment. Mental barrenness and lesions are silent but pervasive in every cubic air of breath. As the medical staff at the end feeds the mother but discusses the winning or losing of gambling, perhaps the overall morbidity is more terrifying than the actual flu and the machine is lethal.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Your Name.," Your first name, my last name
","Through the setting, the movie had an explanation at the beginning. The memory after traversing decreases sharply with time, as the movie says most of the time, it can be understood as a dream.

Both Lisa and Jones were thrown underneath, surrounded by vipers. The wise Dr. Jones took Lisa to escape again, and the brave Dr. Jones wrestled with the Nazis.

Jones and Lisa escaped with their eyes closed, and then brought the Ark back to the United States to complete the mission successfully.",8,0,0,22 April 2020

Russian missile fragments hit the satellite and were flying towards them at a high speed. They came, and the scraps hit the female lead Beside the pillar, the pillar broke, and the hostess held the pillar and spun quickly. Matt said to loosen the pillar, the female host tried to loosen the pillar. Just keep flying like this. Matt rescued her with help.

The hostess's oxygen content is getting less and less. Matt is chatting with the hostess. Does anyone on earth miss you? Or will you see you? Anything to commemorate? The hostess said that my daughter died because of an accident. This is the most missed by the hostess. Matt has been chatting and hopes the hostess will persevere.

Se7en," Wonderful crime suspense movie
","This movie has a very bright religious color, and it is very difficult for me to understand the part about religion, but excluding the religious part, this is also a crime suspense film worth watching. The film as a whole is very depressing. The rainy city and the streets with sewage, the whole city seems to be covered by industrial exhaust gas, dirty, dark, noisy, JohnDoe carried out a series of ingeniously surprised murders in this background The case completed his self-considered martyrdom.

In the movie, the city should be in the rapid development of industry. People continue to pursue material satisfaction while losing a lot of spiritual wealth. JohnDoe He thinks that he is entitled to punishment based on religious belief, but in fact no one has this power. On the one hand, the film shows the disappointment of the depravity of human nature, on the other hand, it also shows the powerlessness of saving the spiritual world. When the last shot by police officer Mills, declared the failure of perfect justice.Brad Pitt 's performance in the film is excellent, and the old drama of Morgan Freeman has maintained a high level of performance as always.

Even if he drinks US $ 0.69, he has to write a cheque, but I will fill it in the bath Aromatherapy candles are like nobles.

Even if he is a rich man with a swollen face.On the other hand, Governor Ye, I really just wanted to earn his money at first, or in my opinion, it would be better to say that he never refused anyone 's request, asked for himself, and agreed without hesitation, as if there was no passing The head becomes a reflection. Just like the landlord asked him to give his performance a support, he was dazed and innocently promised, even if he often defaulted on the rent; his friend asked him to run away with money, he had been thinking about the safety of green nails and emphasized that she would She will be torn if the ticket is torn; the motorcycle goes away, he is anxious, shouting that the money is here, the money is here; the rich woman borrows belly to give birth, he is just spraying wine, facing the tracker outside Say, I just wanted him a child; everything seemed so reasonable, everything seemed so weird again.Walter applied a mask directly to his friend's ashes.

Fight Club," Life itself is absurd enough, so how do we exist?
","'Your job is not you, your bank deposit is not you, the car you drive is not you, the things in your wallet are not you, your khaki pants are not you, you are a pile of living garbage in this world. ''Fight Club' is a suspense film, which is different from the brain-rearing reasoning suspense film. All the details of the film are laying the groundwork for 'Jack is schizophrenia'. As Jack himself gradually realizes that Taylor is himself, the audience naturally understand That was a somewhat unexpected but reasonable answer-it turned out that it was all his schizophrenia.
Before the movie finally reveals that the male lead Jack is schizophrenic, there have been many hints:
For example, Jack 's shaking eyes always flash
As another example, Taylor appeared without warning on the plane. Then when he first appeared, Jack 's apartment was blown up. When he was homeless, he called Taylor somehow. Taylor's number paper for Jack is the same as Jack's number paper for the hostess. And during the conversation, without any prompts, Taylor knew that Jack's purpose was to live in his house.
And Taylor and the heroine will not appear in the same scene at the same time.
When Jack was negotiating with his superior, the part of beating himself and kneeling down to seek superiors was presented through the perspective of superiors (third parties), (Jack is playing against himself in the boss 's eyes), implying that Jack Behaving beyond ordinary people. This and the later revealed that Taylor was just a clever connection that Jack had imagined.From the beginning of watching a movie to the process of telling a movie, I was thinking, what is it trying to tell? Judging from the intuitive feelings of a movie viewer, the tones of the film are rotten and cold, the protagonist's behavior is beyond ordinary people, and some of the plots are funny and absurd. It gives people a not-so-beautiful viewing experience, it brings more soul and sensory impact
This movie is not presenting you with a suspenseful brainstorming suspense. It not only creates a suspenseful atmosphere and organizes stories for the audience, but also elaborates the philosophical proposition of 'the meaning of man'.
Jack has a job and an apartment. All his furniture is exquisite IKEA furniture. He is also a patient with insomnia and suffers from depression. He was bored and bored in the work of constantly reviewing and recalling car accidents. What a typical repressed young man in contemporary society. What does Jack often think? He felt the materialization of society when he was insomnia. When he was flying, he thought about how the aircraft would be destroyed when he was flying. It thought of suicide, and thought of things that escaped from the lives of normal people and the minds of normal people.If only pretending to be a patient can be valued and listened to, if it is only the achievement of Taylor in the split personality that allows him to be followed by many believers, what is the meaning of his own identity, the one of the general public?

Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","How does life find what it wants to do and should do? Or how to find faith? How did Kane decide to use the newspaper's voice, influence the current situation, and even implement reforms? I only saw the result, maybe it was just an accidental thought. Everyone is looking for what they want to do, even if they fail, there is no regret to struggle for this in life.Maybe if it were n't for his mother to make that calm and heart-warming decision, there might not be this legend at all. Some people say that he can make these achievements, which is closely related to him being in the upper class of society, standing high and looking far, and at the same time he can do things to defend the rights of the people because he is not a rich second generation from the beginning There were poor parents who loved him. If he did not get rid of poverty, the 'rose bud' would not become his missing heart fragment. He would have ordinary family feelings and ordinary small days, but there would also be missing, perhaps a dream that could not be approached, maybe not Love and so on. Life is inevitably lost or unavailable, wealth is rich and sad, poverty is troubled by poverty, his mother chooses the first one for him, what has happened to other people 's reproach or praise, what does it matter Just wish.When Kane saw Susan as a typical American, he also wanted to examine whether he was a typical Chinese citizen. How typical? A question that cannot be solved by oneself now. Speaking back to Kane, he found Susan 's small wish and tried to help her realize her wish. Unexpectedly, this 'extramarital love' was shaken out. Was it really 'extramarital love'? Li no longer has love, but for Susan, this simple and kind girl, not to mention love, may just be interested, devoted, and helping her, but this news will hurt Susan, so he Divorce and marry her can save her, but the strong noble wife does not need his rescue. Kane, who controls the media, was defeated by the media. This scandal trapped Kane's image of betrayal, lost the support of voters, failed to run for governor, and ended his political career. The people could not tolerate sand. They only wanted a governor with a good background, and Kane was hit hard when he ignored the post-service reforms proposed by Kane. After remarriage, Susan 's selfless help changed Susan 's nature, and she no longer slowly and steadily improved her. For her own reputation, she should be transformed into an opera actress as soon as possible, proving that he can really help Susan Dreaming, helping the American people dream, prove that he is still the original Kane.As for Susan who said she never wanted to be an actress in an opera, this was all Kane let do, but did she never want to sing? I still remember her helpless and lonely expression when she talked about her mother 's talent for singing, whether it 's Kane or us outside the film, it 's easy to read her desire to sing, and Kane as a helper The people who dreamed of her, supported her, trusted her, nurtured her, and maybe following the original path of Kane, she could be successful in small circles, and they were all happy. However, life is full of accidents. The scandal came out. This secretly supported move had to be put on the table for everyone to entertain. Kane accelerated the star-making plan, but Kane did not find out that she could no longer fulfill her dream Persevere in the brigade.Perhaps Kane 's attitude towards the American people was reflected in his attitude towards Susan. When he saw the people 's small wishes and set about to realize it, he even took the responsibility in the first person, 'I'. At first, the people faced this The big rich man who stood in his camp was rejoiced by it. The people (Susan) could not keep up with the pace. He walked too fast. The people (Susan) would rather stay in the original comfort zone than to take the wind. Rain. The turbulent situation in the process of rewriting the pattern will blind the eyes of the people, thinking that it is not as good as the original stable life. Adding a fire to the key point can continue to change, and pouring a pot of cold water can make the people quickly retract the comfort zone. The scandal is the cold water that wiped out the fire of trust.A stable family environment is so important for gaining the trust of the people. Kane may want to recreate this appearance after remarriage, but fails in the face of Susan 's fragility. Friends and people do not understand why he must let If the new wife succeeds, you can see that Susan will not succeed. Only Kane is confused and may not be clear. It may seem to him that helping Susan succeed will regain his prestige and at the same time prove that he will also succeed. When friend Li Rand could not bear to be caught between the false comment and the broken relationship of the friend, Kane let go of the friend's hand, which was good for both parties.Kane was unknown and unknown, is he a hero? Is the situation creating a hero or is the hero born in the situation? He played brilliantly in the role of media tycoon, but he was defeated in the role of politician. How would he evaluate his life, but realize the dream for the subject but ignore the subject itself? Never regret it?",8,0,0,17 April 2020

Inglourious Basterds," Un Amico
","In the movie, Susanna's death was too deep for me. The plot and soundtrack of this episode are absolutely amazing. Because of this paragraph I did not hesitate to give 5 stars.Susanna plans to blow up all the German seniors who are watching in the movie theater at Frederick's premiere, and plans to change the content of the movie before the explosion.Susanna put on the last film and finally came to the most tense moment.At this moment Frederick suddenly came to the screening room. Lengyan didn't persuade him to go away, but suddenly ran away and broke in.Susana suddenly turned around and asked him to close the door. When I thought she had a better way to solve it, she took advantage of the Buddha's turn and closed the door, took out the prepared pistol and fired three shots without hesitation. Ephesus fell to the ground.Until now, there have been a lot of sudden shots in the movie, without giving you any room, and there are a few that I thought had important roles without leaving room to die directly, so I have no strong accidents about shooting her.Susanna began to look at the cinema from the window. At this time, the lens was given to Susanna, and Foe was not in the lens. Susanna looked at Fo from time to time, and the camera gave it to Fo, so after repeating it a few times, according to the previous law, there may be a reversal at this time, and then suddenly nervous. Suddenly Cough coughed a few times, he was really not dead! Susanna looked back suddenly, he suddenly lost his movement, is he really dead, with this doubt. It was at this moment that there was a bgm suddenly and started playing UnAmico, Susanna started looking at him.This music is so sensational, and suddenly I feel that time has frozen, and I ca n't help but start immersing myself in it. She kills someone who loves her deeply. Did she react like me? Susanna walked over slowly. Under such music (UnAmico), she suddenly felt sorry for the pair.Just when she turned his body around, Fu shot the gun without any hesitation towards Susanna, and without hesitation, kept firing until she fell to the ground. I was taken aback by this reversal. I have n't come out of the last emotion. The song is still playing. Susanna, who is in a red dress, was shot with blood and was splashed. In the song of un, beautiful Unlikely, with a messy background, only one sentence in my mind blooms like a flower.Susannah fell to the ground and looked at Fo. I slowed down a little bit, and I was still struggling, looking forward to a reversal. As a result, Fer made up the last shot, and then the two left together. UnAmico was still there, until the next scene suddenly stopped abruptly.Before I saw this movie, I would only give 4 stars, but because of this episode, I decided to give 5 stars. This is the first time I watched Quentin's movie. An immersive experience, I fully felt his violent aesthetics. If you don't play cards according to common sense, even violence will make you feel beautiful. This is his charm. After watching the movie, it couldn't slow down. The style of this soundtrack in this section is very rare in this entire movie, and there is almost no, but it is not abrupt at all, because there is more abrupt music in the whole movie, and it always reminds you to keep you refreshed. And this paragraph made people have a point to stop and think. I wanted to give four stars at the beginning because although the whole movie's narrative has many bright spots in the middle, the overall narrative is relatively flat, and this paragraph is the entire There is a big point in the movie that makes people stop and think about giving you a head start.

The Great Dictator," Fight For Liberty
","The power of comedy can also be so powerful, and the whole article is full of irony, which makes people admire the incomparable courage and excellent ability of this comedy master.
The film was written and directed by comedy master Charlie Chaplin. The first audio film created in the context of the accelerated expansion of the German Nazi Party and the massacre of Jews after World War II was released in the United States on October 15, 1940. It satirized the ugly acts of the German Nazi head Hitler's massacre of Jews, and expressed the desire for democracy and freedom. The film's release date is the peak period of Hitler's massacre of Jews, and it was also the peak period after Germany's capture of France. Chaplin still insisted on creating under the dual pressure of United States and politics. In order to ridicule Hitler 's dictatorship, Chaplin 's courage and conscience are truly admirable. In the story, Chaplin is decorated with two horns. One of them is a Jewish barber. He was drafted into the army in the First World War and saved the Schulz chief (Hickler's minister). Become a barber again, dare to fight the oppression of the German Nazi Party; another is the great dictator Hickler, alluding to Hitler, who has the ambition to rule the world and has killed millions of Jews; The girlfriend is a Jewish Hannah, kind, brave, and never succumbed to the persecution of the German Nazi Party.",8,0,0,23 April 2020
Spotlight," The power of the media
","This is a film based on real people and real stories. The film revolves around the focus group in the Boston-based 'Global Times', in-depth coverage of the Geoghan case.Generally, a movie marked with 'According to Real People' always adds a layer of realistic meaning to the film, without the exaggerated shooting technique in the general movie narrative, the reversal of the plot, the focus on the lens and the story. Time clues can actually be regarded as a relatively bland movie. But when I watched the movie, I thought it was adapted based on the actual case, but it also made the characters in the movie come alive.The story begins with the new editor-in-chief airborne editorial department. The newly appointed editor-in-chief nominates the focus group to conduct an in-depth investigation into the Geoghan case and provide a comprehensive and detailed report. As the work of the team members unfolded, it was discovered that the case was only the tip of the iceberg, and the number of bishops who committed similar cases reached as much as 6%. Take the Boston area as an example, 1500 bishops. 6% is 90, the number is huge, it is staggering. What 's even more irritating is that the Archbishops and Bishops in the area have been aware of these things happening in the diocese, but they did not punish the criminal bishops. In the current parish, this practice has resulted in more children being abused. The reporters ran around and rushed to gather evidence at the node of time, before finally revealing the viciousness of the entire church system. They faced not just a regional religious belief, but a question directed at the Vatican. A person who preached in the name of God, a person who carried the faith of the believers in an entire region, was behind the well-dressed, doing things that are not as good as the beasts, and the entire church system was blind and indulgent. My faith was shaken and I was disappointed.God loves the world and becomes a joke.The film ended with a report of the ringing of the phone ringing in the focused office. With the support of public opinion, more and more victims chose to speak. The film did not give the actual ending of the incident, but gave an open end. After checking the Internet, after the Boston Times published nearly 600 reports, the church was forced to respond to public opinion pressure. All relevant personnel were jailed and the church fined more than 2 billion US dollars. The incident came to an end.This film is also a film focused on freedom of public opinion and religious power, and has a rare social depth. The reporter's persistence in justice and the maintenance of freedom in the film are also impressive. The most important thing in the profession of journalists is to have self-awareness as a public speaker. Use the pen as a gun, face the darkness, stick to the original intention, and dare to speak in the face of power. recommend!",8,1,1,6 April 2020

In the barrage, some people called Dad silly, and Dad pretended that he didn't give this family a good life. I have to say that the barrage of the barrage is really heavy now. But I think this is a good father, knowing to love his wife and children. He has always used what he has done to do his fatherhood and set an example for his children. I suddenly remembered my dad. He was the most taboo in his life to owe something to others, so if I borrow someone else 's money or things at school, he always quarrels with me: 'I do n't have enough money at home? As much as you want, we are not without it, we have to borrow it. ' I also have an older brother. Because of my marriage and buying a house, my parents' savings have been taken in. In the end, my mother borrowed tens of thousands. My mother knew that my dad would not want to go, so he went with his dad on his back. After all, the paper couldn't cover the fire. My dad knew that.

The Prestige," magic
","After reading it, I suddenly found that Tesla was like the role of 'Devil' in Faustry. He appeared as if he were a god. There is a loyal and strange servant and a piece of 'Cthulhu' or 'Vampire'. 'The ordinary mansion, abandoned by the world, gave Jackman who sought his help in pursuit of the ultimate magic, and let Jackman lay down countless lives for it. Now it seems that the Tesla device has some' matches ' 'Peng' taste. However, Tesla and his servant Andy seem to be the only unsullied male characters in this film, and even Kane has become Jackman's 'assistant' in the later period, such as helping him throw Bell into the coffin.There is very little description of magic in the whole film, and the magic that appears appears to be counted in one hand, so the whole film spends a lot of space describing the various conflicts between the two heroes around magic and life. The only thing to spit is that the two men It's a little too easy to dismantle the platform. You should consider not choosing 'male with beard between 30 and 40 years old' when choosing volunteers. Jackman 's role plays are relatively numerous in this film, and because of Bell 's secrets, the story cannot be told from Bell 's main perspective. Only in the late stage of the film can Bell 's plays be increased. Of course, his secrets are relatively easy to guess. The trick is too easy to be seen by slightly experienced audiences. This kind of covert performance also leads to this. Maybe Bell 's partner is more diversified and more diversified, but it is more difficult to guess? This is also the most powerful secret of the film, so many characters are only seen by his wife, and all other characters seem to be not noticed by his daughter.Because the story was told from the perspective of Jackman in the early part of the film, he was initially a slightly positive image, and Bell was the death of his wife for his 'selfish desires and overconfidence', and then Jackman's revenge also escalated the damage of the two. . Jackman was born in a musical, and he was handsome in a dress on the stage, so the film also made Jackman's stage performance exceed Bell. Bell's stage name is actually a 'professor', and still in London, Holmes will demolish the stage. Right. Of course, female characters are more vase-shaped and tool-oriented because of the times, especially Scarlett. I have forgotten that she has also played this film. It is beautiful and really beautiful, with many close-ups. Wife Bell didn't have much impression, it seems that she doesn't play blockbuster much later. When I saw Tesla, I felt so temperamental, because my impression of Baoye was still his thin image when he was young. The dress of Baoye in this film is very 'normal', without makeup and strange shapes. It is estimated that Bao He would n't agree if he did n't play TeslaTwo magicians are fighting, the only profit is probably the theater owner and the audience who have obtained a wonderful experience.

The Hateful Eight," So in the end, who poisoned the coffee?
","A movie full of men, but the biggest attraction is feminism
Quentin once said that at least three Western films have to be made before he can barely be regarded as a Western director. The Eight Wicks movie is the second western film he directed. Audiences familiar with Quentin will know that he has always been obsessed with filming films, from the debut film Falling Dogs to the recent Hollywood past.But what is different from Quentin's other works is that the Eight Evils used 70mm film for extravagant shooting, which made the movie's aspect ratio reach an astonishing 2.76: 1. Such large frames are often used to shoot large scenes in epic films, such as film star Nolan's interstellar crossing and Dunkirk after that.Using 70mm film to shoot a movie that is indoors 80% of the time is undoubtedly an arrogant act. In this regard, Quentin's explanation is that only viewers using 70mm film technology can experience the charming snow scene of Wyoming.In fact, I understand here, why the eight wicked people will start with a four-minute fixed lens, of course, to see the snow scene. The story of the Eight Evils occurred after the American Civil War, when the social order was on the verge of collapse, and the government needed to rely on the bounty hunter 's gun to maintain social stabilityRuth is a bounty hunter. He encountered a blizzard on the way back to the city in exchange for a bounty, so he could only avoid it in the middle, which is the men's clothing store in Minnesota. Outside the house is a borderless white desert and ultra-low temperature, and the passengers in the house are forced to live together in a room, and the contradictions are triggered in the narrow small space.Speaking of the 77mm film camera, although it is too small to use for indoor shooting, the effect of smashing the money can still be seen. The entire picture is larger and the scenes of the characters that can be installed are more. The suspense contained The details are of course more abundant.I have to say that it 's good to have moneyIn addition, the film The Eight Evils is a very expressive film, which is full of dialogues (broken mouths) and speech-style tables. Eighty percent of them are indoor dramas, which is obvious It's a very boring movie, but in Quentin's hands, it was tricked.Wars, laws, racial discrimination, and women 's rights are all included in the movie. Quentin in the play, like the legal war, has actually spoken through the character's mouth. So today we mainly talk about racial discrimination and feminism. As far as racial discrimination is concerned, the movie actually makes it very clear. After all, the background time was after the Civil War. Although the new American society had already emerged at that time, the old ideas were far from melting, and discrimination against black people was still everywhere.Maguire was a black federal soldier during the Civil War. He survived the Civil War, and he has the ability and wisdom beyond ordinary people. This is shown in the film, and I will not spoil it here, but even such a powerful black warrior, in order to reduce the vigilance of the white man against himself, actually forged a Lincoln letter. It can be seen how serious the problem of racial discrimination was.When it comes to feminism, I have seen similar reviews on the Internet. The view of that article is that this movie is not related to feminism. It is said that feminism is over-interpreted. I don't agree with this view, because in my opinion, the feminist taste of this movie is actually very heavy. As far as the characters are concerned, the female prisoner Daisy is actually a very powerful gangster. But in the whole film, it is the most vulnerable character. Whether it was suppressed by Rus before, or after being suppressed by Maguire and Chris, she did not really have the opportunity to show her ability. She was either handcuffed or pointed by a gun. Whenever she wanted to 'bloom', she would be suppressed by men.Whether it is Ruth 's violence against her or the woman 's innocence after Chris, they are actually reflecting the true attitude of these men towards women, even before them is a gang leader with a government reward of $ 10,000. The only time Daisy bloomed with herself was the part where she played the guitar, and it was also the most tense part of the movie. From the perspective of the audience, Daisy is an indiscriminate criminal, and Ruth is undoubtedly a spokesperson for justice or government.On the guitar and singing, the audience was nervous as they watched the cup of poisonous coffee in Ruth's hands. The easiest time for Daisy was the time when Russ was going to die. The poison coffee had been brewed and he was waiting to drink it.In the melodious guitar song, Daisy's small eyes kept peeking, which made the audience's hearts catch up. This is my favorite part of the whole film, but the fact is not what Daisy imagined. Although Russ died, Maguire pressed it up, even though Maguire 's gun was gone without a bullet. Chris fainted , Daisy desperately wanted to get the pistol, but was stopped by Chris at the last minute.Although Daisy should have strong strength, as can be seen from the government's 10,000 bounty, a powerful woman is suppressed by men again and again. If it is not mapping feminism, what is it expressing?When it comes to the guitar section, I have to talk about the guitar itself. The broken guitar in the play is actually a cultural relic. This guitar has a history of 150 years. The museum lent it to Kun to support the film business. Ting. The actor who dropped the guitar, Kurt Russell, was not informed in advance that it was a cultural relic, but Jennifer Jason Lee, who is good at playing the guitar, knew the true identity of the guitar.A female prisoner who didn't blink, but yelled at the moment when the guitar was dropped. In fact, this performance does not match the role. This guitar is more like a redundant sacrifice. Many fans justify itThis is the ruffian Quentin himselfQuentin is to inspire the actors to perform betterQuentin is also for the audienceBut fellow, he knew it was a cultural relic, and the museum did not authorize him to fallBut he fell and did not tell the actor the truth in advanceThis is not washable anywayAlthough in the end Quentin also paid for his actions, the reason why cultural relics are not sold in the window like commodities is because their meaning is far more than their value, such behavior is bad in any case. of.But one yard to one yard, the movies he made are indeed quite good, worthy of his name as a ghost.This movie recommends everyone to watch it, it is a very good western film. Whether it's the scene or the character's clothing, you can feel that turbulent cowboy era, and in all the western films, this eight villains can definitely be called a big coffee gathering, and can even be compared with the Avengers series of Marvel Universe. Comparable, it is simply a competition of the acting school.The only bad thing is the length of its movie. The eight villains are divided into four parts. The total length of the movie reaches 183 minutes. Coupled with the Quentin-style broken mouth dialogue, people who are impatient may not wait for the movie to climax Quickly exit. So I suggest that you make preparations for watching movies in advance, this is definitely a movie worth watching.So in the end, who poisoned the coffee?",7,0,4,6 April 2020
"I, Tonya"," Poor parents
","The following is just the first impression after watching the movie. I do n't understand figure skating or the rules behind it. There may be some places where the idea is immature. After all, it is a real event. You ca n't really understand the truth. Maybe everyone Due to his predicament, the movie makes a sound, trying to understand the truth!Everyone has their favorite movies, and then there must be movies that I do n't like. For example, I do n't feel much about this movie. I do n't understand why it 's so high. Or for other reasons? American directors are very happy, because many real events can be adapted into movies, these movies show us different views of life, different values, and there are many classics, such as Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Many are adapted templates!Let me talk about why I do n't like this movie. First of all, it 's acting. It seems that Margot Robbie was nominated for the best actress Oscar, but I found a problem, that is, when many movies show character personality , Most of them are smoking, no matter what you do, you must smoke, and that one is called a costume ×, I 'm not targeting this movie, it 's for all this type of movie, it 's really vomiting, you ca n't smoke less point? Is it okay to change a cigar? Or take a sip of a small wine glass? I feel choked across the screen. Maybe the director feels that women smoke is uninhibited, so the mother wants to smoke, the queen has to smoke, and the posture, method and tone are exactly the same. To be honest, I feel embarrassed! Yes, but not necessary. The only highlight of the performance is that at the end of the movie, Margot Robbie 's line to the judge 's verdict was painful, a wrong decision to bury a man 's half-life effort, I do n't know what else to say except to sigh!In fact, in such a society ruled by law, there is no truth in such a thing. Even the movie can't make the truth. Do you know that she knows? As Tonya himself said, go to the truth of tmd, she knows that it is unclear, even if the truth others will believe? People usually only believe what they are willing to believe, so the best solution is to not do bad things, and the movie is Tonya's story, so our perspective is from her, and naturally there will be empathy when making judgments. Let 's change the angle of view and put it on the attacked Nancy. I think there is no f ** k except for deserving it. Even if the sentence is very heavy, the final caption comes out to tell you that Nancy attacked him after being injured. The mastermind of Tonya 's husband, Jeff, and who, who, what, how, how would you think from Tonya 's perspective? Do you feel too much?There is another place in the movie that I do n't like, is its rhythm, is it light and pleasant? Even when his husband was playing Tonya, he thought it should not be serious, why is there such an illusion? Because the rhythm of the film makes you think that you are watching superhero movies, the fights inside are fake, it 's ridiculous, I do n't know how to describe it, if this story is not true, it 's okay to deal with it, violent aesthetics, all I have seen it, but this is a real event, even if the lifestyle of the male and female owners is like this, can't it behave like this? Black question mark face? ? ?Tonya's mother, I think she is a good mother. She uses her tofu to save all her savings to help her daughter learn to skate. Even though she is smoking, violent, and stubborn, she cannot understand when she was a child, but when she grows up, I must I will be very grateful, and the emotions between the mother and daughter in the film are very subtle, seemingly non-existent, seemingly thin, I am really confused, I understand that one mountain cannot accommodate two tigers, both are too strong, To be sure, Tonya is very strong. If she really does n't know about the attack, the ending will be unfair to her. Or maybe her mother has already seen everything and said at the wedding that you can go to bed with a fool, but no 'It is necessary to marry a fool.'",8,0,1,4 April 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The wild horse, the power to run away
","The subject of the film is a satire on the Cold War and nuclear deterrence strategies. But the film also contains many small themes, such as the destruction caused by uncontrolled power. In the film, the direct cause of the disaster came from a brain storm in General Ruipi. But the reason why his crazy plan was able to proceed smoothly was because he cut off all channels that could control and supervise his orders. He made his orders only from top to bottom, without horizontal checks and balances. From this, his madness was realized by the absolute power in his hands. And this one-way vertical power distribution has always been the traditional art of socialist countries. When a level of power is concentrated at one point, those in power at that point can easily deceive and conceal it, and this is often one of the main factors that cause the occurrence of disasters or the expansion of damage.",8,0,0,24 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," After feeling
","Personally, I feel that there is not much difference from the previous two. The music and sound effects are good, the plot is simple, and the relationship between the characters is not complicated. The one that impressed me most was the caged beasts on Tatooine and the big mouth of the execution ground. His first appearance was quite shocking. There is also the indigenous people on Endo Star, the panda's body shape, brown fur, so cute. Indigenous traps and jungle terrain also made the imperial soldiers lose more reasonable. And Leia, the dress when she was enslaved by Jabba, feels a little bit of fun, but she is really sexy.Luke was originally looking for Vinda for the purpose of transforming Vinda to the righteous side, but then Vinda said 'to me, it's too late', the phrase said so well! He was used by the emperor and did a lot of bad things. Even if he now wants to turn to the righteous side, can he write off what he did before? There is still a little kindness in him, but he also knows that what he has done is unforgivable, so he will say 'too late for me!'Satisfied with Vinda's ending. Luke refused to submit to his negative emotions, so the emperor decided to kill Luke. Vader watched Luke's painful moaning when he couldn't fight back. After struggling with his heart, he finally killed the emperor for Luke, but he was also affected by the attack of the emperor, and then died! Sacrifice himself to save Luke and kill the emperor again. After working for the terrible dictatorship of the empire for so many years, he did the right thing before he died, and then ended his tragic life ~ this is the best for Vida 'S destination!But I think this plot is not entirely reasonable. Luke had no need to drop his lightsaber. After he subdued Vida, he would just kill the evil emperor, and then decide Vida's fate. It's stupid to just drop the weapon and slap it. Luke can fight with the emperor. In the end, because Luke lost his strength to the emperor, when he was about to die, Vinda struggled with his heart and decided to stop the emperor from killing Luke.Then, a little bit of expectations, is to make a remake of the trilogy! ! The plot, human settings, set, visual effects, sound effects, actions, improvements in all aspects, re-polished this old masterpiece! It can regain the attention of the old fans and attract new people into the pit. At the same time, it also made up for the regrets left by the technical limitations at that time!Looking forward to this day!",8,0,1,26 April 2020
Pan's Labyrinth," A fairy tale dissociated between illusion and reality
","At the beginning of the story, the mother and daughter came to rely on the stepfather of a fascist officer, but in this secluded mountain village, hiding the people of revenge and mysterious residence, the tone of the story became low and uneasy. Ofelia found the maze with a simple and mysterious Mayan style under the guidance of the elf. Just like Alice got into the rabbit hole, her curiosity led her to step into the fairy tale door. The strange-looking Pan Shen tells an ancient story. The heroine suddenly finds that she may be the protagonist of this story. It is no longer a dream for Cinderella to become a princess. But there is no free lunch in the world, even for the princess. It is a task. Complete three tasks before returning to the hometown that has been forgotten for thousands of years.A wordless book, a piece of chalk, an hourglass, a fairytale adventure is going on, and brutal killing is going on. The stepfather becomes more and more cold, and only the child in the mother's womb is his concern. Ofeilia became more and more helpless, and only felt a little warm when she leaned on her mother to tell the unborn brother a fairy tale completely contrary to reality, and the desire to return to the kingdom of fairy tales became stronger.The unfortunate fate finally began. The greed of the child almost shattered the hope of returning to his hometown. The mother died of dystocia. The stepfather was frustrated and mad. However, luck and hope still favored this kind and beautiful little girl. When the stepfather's whistling bullet was shot into Ofeilia's chest, she seemed to see happiness that she had never seen, a splendid palace, and the father and mother welcomed her return Finally, she found her home with a happy smile.About othersThe story is bigger than the characters. The character of the whole film is characterless. Some impressions are the cold stepfather who plays with pocket watches and the doctor with the same expression. Pan Shen in the labyrinth is not only reminiscent of Minotaur in the labyrinth of Crete. It looks so weird, really worrying about Ofelia's safety. The architectural style in the fairy tale tends to Maya, perhaps due to the participation of Mexican companies in film production. For the entire film, fairy tale fantasy and cruel reality are intertwined. The lightness of fairy tales dispels the heaviness of reality. The cruel despair of reality reflects the hope of happiness in fairy tales. A good balance appears. It is no longer meaningful to discuss whether the story is a child's conjecture to escape reality or the real underground kingdom. The key is that the smile she finally hoped has brought her back to where happiness is.Finally pay tribute to the great Master Calvino",8,0,0,4 May 2020
Alien," Unknown things can't afford
","It's a great series of movies, and it was such a great film in the 1970s.In the future society, humans can easily travel through space and carry out commercial activities in space. 'Nuo Shimo' is one of many commercial transport ships. It transports cargo in space. On the way back to Earth, the captain suddenly received a series of strange symbols that could not be deciphered in a short time. According to the instructions given by the computer's mother, Northmore went to the place where the signal was sent to see what happened.Ripley is the third commander of the spacecraft, the first two are the captain and Ash, Ash is the chief technical expert. The three crew members were appointed by the captain to go to a strange planet to investigate the situation. One of the crew members found a strange walk that was propagating here, most of the aliens died, and the strange walk jumped to his face. Return to the cabin. Ripley never agreed to bring the crew back easily, because it was very likely to be infected, and the chief expert agreed to send him back. In this way, this buddy who was crawled on his face was motionless at first, and then the crew cut the shaped legs, and the blood that came out was more corrosive, and the entire cabin was burned directly from the first layer. See through. Soon, the crew seemed to be okay, and then ate, but the alien came out of his body, very small and very toxic.Soon, Ripley took the crew to look for aliens, and the aliens became big monsters like Venom, the full version of the aliens. The alien acted at the vent and killed the captain. Ripley wanted to figure out what was going on, and learned from the computer that the company asked the captain to bring back the alien, even at the expense of the crew. And the chief technical expert turned out to be a biochemical man, his task was to bring back the alien, he was killed by Ripley. Another man and a woman and two crew members were also killed by aliens. Eventually, Ripley blew up the entire spacecraft, and drove the rescue boat with the kittens away, but the alien was in the lifeboat, and the alien was sucked away by space. Captain Ripley began an endless journey of dormancy.",8,0,1,23 April 2020
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","The repressed desire of the taxi driver Travis in the film was the re-discovery of the film this time, which was the subject that I was most concerned about.It is actually quite obvious in the film: the unsatisfied desire makes the atmosphere of the film appear dark and heavy most of the time. In the previous movie viewing impression, I think it was because of the emotional dispute between Travis and Betsy, which did not pay much attention. This time it was the opposite. In the scene where Travis was on duty at midnight for the first time, the picture switched back and forth between the close-up of his eyes and the street scene-the girls under the street lights-and I finally realized it. I probably guessed the emotions behind Travis' eyes. He cursed the prostitutes-hoping that the heavy rain could wash the garbage off the streets-but he had been watching the women, his eyes entangled in love and sex.From the current point of view, of course, sex and love are two different things. Sex does not necessarily mean love, and love does not necessarily mean sexual happiness. They are not two in one. However, to Travis, he was obviously not aware of this at this time, but he had already noticed the contradiction of 'two in one'. His belief was broken when he took Betsy to an adult movie theater for a date. In fact, you can see that when walking out of the theater, Travis is quite puzzled about Betsy's resistance.When it comes to the ending, the performance of politicians has always been quite satisfactory, so according to the ending in the original impression, I can't understand the director's arrangement for him to be assassinated: Is it just because Travis' emotions are not irritated? Is the pattern of the big director Martin Scorsese (Martin Scorsese) so small? It turned out that in the end, the assassination was unsuccessful, the politician did not die as a result, and Travis had alarmed the bodyguard before he even acted. The audience unavoidably smiled when Kennedy was assassinated.The ending began to shift towards the end that was different from my impression; the end was reversed several times, which was unexpected.",8,0,0,29 April 2020
Shutter Island," Which one is real
","Is he a police officer or a psychiatrist? Although the previous doubts were rationalized in the second half of the movie, including who was the prisoner No. 67, the connection between Rachel who fled and Andrew Reddez, the picture of the little girl in her dream, and the scar on the prisoner's face Sources and so on, but will he be brainwashed successfully?The partner did not cooperate in the first half, the dean did not cooperate with the review of the prisoner, and others laughed at him at the meeting. Did the repeated headaches and dreams suggest that what he did at the time was half fantasy and true.The car was bombed, which is confirmed. But why should we blow up the car?Why did the partner disappear midway, only to show up at the last timeIs the interrogation process real? Is the run written by the prisoner real?Is Rachel's impossible escape from the prison implying that all of this is impossible, and that what is impossible in reality can be rationalized by imagination-directly setting her to escape, no matter how she escaped.In this way, the male lead is a mentally ill, and there is a high possibility of immersion in his own world.",9,0,0,11 May 2020
Life of Pi," There is no choice but to be afraid of human nature
","Would rather not read the meaningI have been watching this movie for a long time, but I have n't watched it because I thought it was an anime. Forgive me for easily giving the movie a genre definition that I would not be interested in just watching the poster and name.It's okay, I don't know when I'm on a whim and want to try such a movie again.The first half of the story is an ordinary teenager's home that opened a zoo. He wanted to be friends with the tiger, but his father used an antelope to let him see the terrible carnivores.On the surface is a story like Robinson Crusoe, because he accidentally needs to survive on the sea, but his environment is more demanding.Until I saw people from insurance companies appear, I thought it was a story of people and animals living together in extreme environments. In the middle of the island they went to, I think it was an illusion generated by the pie, and I still have some doubts whether Tiger Parker was also an illusion generated by the pie. The second version of the story appeared. It turns out that the truth is far more cruel than imagined. Human beings will of course choose to kill the same kind in the face of survival.For the setting of Pai and Parker, Pai is a man of faith, but in order to survive he eventually had to betray his faith. Parker is actually a representative school in a sense. First of all, their names are related. I have seen people think of tigers as the animal nature of the school. After his mother was killed and he was also facing death threats, he finally released his hidden animal nature. But he was actually kind. He once wanted to abandon his animal nature, but the animal nature was connected with him, and in the end he still failed to do it.This can also explain why Parker abandoned the faction as soon as he landed, because he has returned to the civilized world, and the animal nature will be hidden again.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
Interstellar," The biggest enemy is actually human
","Three hours is the limit of a movie's viewing time. Even if the plot is unsatisfactory, the audience nestled in the black box will be restless. 'Interstellar' just less than 3 hours, is on the critical line to exercise patience of the audience. In the last half hour, utterly covering his heart with his hands in prayer, Matthew McConaughey went further into the sky, and took a step back to lose all. The moment when I got up from the theater seats and finally returned to the earth after getting out of the cabin, I was generally terrified. In the endless time and space, we feel thrilled and tormented, with the protagonist wandering between hope and despair, exhausted. I very much agree with what the author in 'The Odyssey of the Abyss' said: 'The film contains a nesting metaphor for the film itself. From the ordinary life into the dark theater, and in the darkness through the screen to another life , And then in another life, suddenly embarked on a wonderful journey, layer by layer into the play and layer by layer, with the flow of people out of the theater, and not into the streets and turbulent In the vulgar. There are several layers of dreams, there are many galaxy. The high stars are not related to us, it seems that one day they will cover our daily life. 'Therefore, it can be said that' Interstellar Crossing 'is a mass participation. In the movie, I ca n't understand the wormhole, why Matthew falls vertically from outer space and can fall into a ridiculous five-dimensional space, although there is no ability and knowledge to analyze this hard science fiction from a physical point of view, But it does not prevent us from sitting on the seats of the movie theater for a long time, and using our own way to explain and understand. I 'm glad that Nolan played the finale of a magic stick without disappointment: the 'them' who inspired the exploration all the way is us, we are the 'them', and there are infinitely fragmented pieces in her daughter Murphy 's bookshelf In time, the father who regretted going to explore the universe returned to the point where the wrong decision occurred again and again to hint to himself. It's similar to the heroine who died several times in 'Terror Cruise' but couldn't get out of the game. In this way, five-dimensional space is just a concept, not difficult to understand. I'm not a fan of Nolan, but in my own opinion, 'Interstellar' is undoubtedly the biggest and most ironic movie in all his works and penetrates the topic of human nature. In the November file last year, I also watched 'Gravity' in Daguangming. If we simply look at the theme of 'survival,' the Nolan Brothers script would like to discuss the complexity of human nature and the mutual guidance of humanity in the collective subconscious reincarnation. The role is much more complicated than that of Sandra Bullock 's survival and jumping game; George Clooney faces the non-human suave and up-and-coming calm image of death in the vast universe, self-assured man in Matt Damon Dr. Eun looked vulnerable. There is almost no comparability in the text, but in terms of visual technology, there are exactly 80% gravity and 130% gravity Miller planet and hill planet, so that the actors do not have to float to perform, and it also saves a lot of later expenses. Rather than being played with by nature and the mysterious universe, looking at the biggest enemy in Interstellar from the surface is time, and then looking at the inner core, the biggest enemy is man himself. The universe is worn around, so innocent.",9,0,1,6 April 2020
Full Metal Jacket," Mickey mouse
","Perhaps the most ridiculous factor in war is that the people participating in the war do not understand why they are fighting. They gave up their lives and forgot their deaths. Under the admonishment of the instructor's cruelty, humanity was wiped out a little. With his equipment on his back and his gun on, all those who fled everywhere were the Communist Party, and those who did not fled in place were all trained Communists. They embarrassedly set foot on the land of Vietnam and slaughtered the local people unscrupulously, but only because it felt strange that there was no horse there. This funny battle was performed by a group of funny people like a stage play.Kubrick borrowed the background of the Vietnam War and wrote this masterpiece full of satire on the war. From the initial 'Curse of Motherhood' to the later choice of life and death, the meaning of war is the topic that the director wants to discuss repeatedly. The United States waged war in the name of liberation and freedom, but it cultivated murderous machines with unhuman training. The instructor's tragic death also marked that the United States will eventually be repulsed by it in a series of wars waged for its benefit.Perhaps the most appealing part of Kubrick 's film is his wide range of themes, the peculiar expressions, the soundtrack selection, and the unexpected conclusion at the end. With the singing of Mickey Mouse, these soldiers who were confused by the war seemed to have won the victory, but when they recalled the fighting on the ruins, they would think, what are they for? As the person interviewed on the camera said: 'I think we are on the wrong side'",8,0,0,30 April 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Is it because we do n't have God, so it does n't matter how we hurt each other?
","If I really want to say this genre, I think it is not a drama or a tragedy or a comedy. It is more like a warm farce combining the three. What must be said should be the main drama, although it has a tragic comedy color, but the theme connotation it has to express is always upward. It is very different from the rules of Chinese film, and its ending is not determined to solve the case, but to the determination to resist sexual assault. This movie is actually a cloak of revenge, and the theme is salvation. The first is the salvation of personality. Director Willoughby 's three letters reveal the true face of each character. Dixon escapes from the fire and truly understands Director Willoughby 's expectation of himself when he knows about alien sexual assault When the author could not enforce the law, he put down the lost badge. The second is self-redemption. Dixon met Reed in the hospital. Reid still put the orange juice beside the bed; he and his mother became allies and went to Iowa, but said 'not really'. They did not find the murderer in the end, but they achieved their liberation. The third is personal salvation. Every character is torn and distorted. Mildred, whose marriage is unfortunately incompatible with children, is extremely stubborn; the only thought in the family is still Dickson, who wants to eliminate the old mother of color He misunderstood what the director thought 'help' and threw Red downstairs. He was unruly and discriminated against black people. Willoughby director he could not find the truth and could not bear the pain of illness, and chose to commit suicide to avoid everything; but Mildred is persistent It was the nationals who valued sexual assault. At the end of the restaurant, he dropped the wine bottle that he was going to smash to his husband; Dixon went to Iowa with Mildred in order to get the criminal DNA and endure the beatings; Director Willoughby and Mildred talked about 'baby' after hematemesis; they were all marginal characters in the play, each representing their own injustice, representing the injustice of the United States against people of color; the arrogance of law enforcers and the distortion of personal character, but in the end they Have achieved self-salvation. The characters they are in are tragic, but they hide the tenderness of tenderness everywhere. They did not find the murderer but gained self-liberation. So it is more like a warm farce.
The first impressive segment was that the black director appeared to be expelled. The suppression of people of color in the southern United States has had many metaphorical ironies in shaping Dixon. In the former case, he suppressed Mildred by suppressing people of color, so he did n't want to solve the case. After the death of the chief, he threw Reid out of the window in order to 'revenge' the chief. He roared at the black man at the door of the police station. The chief appeared the first step to dismiss Dixon, and he also received a letter from the chief after expelling Dixon. At the same time, because of the black chief's relationship, he had to enter the police station late at night to see that the letter was just attacked by Mildred's fire. . These are no coincidences, but the deliberate design of the screenwriter, which suppresses the black people to appear from the black people to change characters, and finally puts the police badge in front of the black people.
The second episode is Mildred 's accidental payment of no money to pay rent. Reed actually compromised here. He gradually began to fear the intimidation of the law enforcers. At this time, the occasional amount of money made Reid unable to refuse. Who knows that this money was also sent by the law enforcers After renewing the rent, the Commissioner passed away, and the billboard was burned. Combining a high degree of contradiction, and finally cracking one by one absurdly, the billboard was actually burned by her ex-husband, and it was the victim of the billboard who continued the money.

Forrest Gump," I know the meaning after running
","The correct life is generally experienced by 'running'. When running continuously, you can see the end point or not see the end point. You are advancing as much as possible. Every time you encounter a post on the way, you can choose to pass by or Staying, each choice may lead to countless results, just like you cannot predict the taste of the next piece of chocolate, and every time you think, there may not be an answer. As in the doubts mentioned in the movie, do we each have their own destiny, or Like a feather, drifting in the wind. The time background of the film is modern America. Some details of the era are seen in many details of the film. Some historical events have been moved to the screen. The film can learn about the reputation of Forrest Gump, because in many historical events He was left in the middle. The story that was asked to be quoted during the filming process must be an event that actually happened, and all of this has been done realistically, including the editing of some shots, which are all materials that once existed. This is a very serious production. A-Gump almost ran a whole movie. He experienced life and death parting all his life, and ran through many places. Every time he stayed at a node, there was a small turning point in his life. This turning point would prompt him to continue running, as if Life can no longer stop. Every time he started his long-distance running, he must be wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and a khaki trousers, and later a cap and a pair of running shoes. These shoes have been in the movie for a few seconds. The close-up shot of has now become a fashion trend leader and has been loved by many friends. A-Gump also treated everything he insisted on with a serious attitude. He could even say that he had done two things of persistence and seriousness in his life, because these two things made him hit by mistake and reached many unexpected achievements. He did not feel any difference at all, because in his consciousness, he is himself, not others, his purpose is only to be himself, even if he does not understand how to be himself, he actually understands, in him After running through so many corners. Finally, when he sent his son to the school bus, the scene was like his own childhood. At this time, the child was wearing a blue and white plaid shirt, a red cap, and a familiar look. When the father and son were fishing together by the river, the son tilted his head to the left like A-Gump, this is the same gesture. The connection between them has been expressed through many lenses. Forrest Gump may want to convey his spirit to his son. He does not need to do a lot of homework because he is not very good at it, but he will give his son a subtle influence. Son In the future, he will become a person who possesses his character but is smarter than him. I believe it will bring greater honor to his father.",9,1,1,19 April 2020
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Faith for survival
","'The questions and answers between the judge and Jeanne are clearly recorded. After reading it, we will find a true Jeanne, a simple and humane young woman who removes her armor and died for the country.
This seemingly religious film has a very different narrative at the beginning. The whole passage does not involve the concept of God at all. Instead, it focuses on one word, that is, 'human nature'. Say it is the 'belief' in human nature.
Over the past few hundred years, the image of Jeanne d'Or has long been mythical. She is a national hero of France and a goddess in the mouth of people. But it is ridiculous that such a Catholic saint with a strong religious meaning was due to political purposes. Burned to death for religious reasons. Such a fact makes people wonder: Is religion so ridiculous in some ways, and does God really exist? It can be said that at least in this film, the role of God is completely missing, and the close-up shots are very clear and belong to human faces. In the first half of the film, what we saw was just a face of a series of ridiculous interrogations, filled with desperate images of poor Jeanne, and the opposite, the laughter, ruthlessness and enthusiasm of most of the judges around indifferent. The atmosphere of extreme despair made people unable to catch a trace of God's existence. And halfway through the film, the three soldiers' ridicule and playfulness towards Jeanne reached its peak. The saint in the mouth of the people is being bullied like an ordinary prisoner of war, an ordinary woman at this moment. The crown she regarded as a sacred symbol was now reduced to a plaything above the sword in the hands of soldiers. When the only outside light on the floor was blocked by the shameless judges, all the divinities disappeared at this moment. In addition, in addition to a few distant shots of the perspective shots in the film, most of the angles of view come from the up shots. In other words, they belong to the angle of view that cannot belong to God.
However, when God seems to be gone, facing the persecution of power, is there no way as an individual, not so. 'True salvation is not a victory after fighting, but a strength and peace of mind that can be found in suffering.' So we saw in the second half of the film that the flinching, weak Jean was gone, replaced by a pair of stern eyes, an unyielding response, and a soul full of faith.
'I totally love and respect God with all my heart'
'He claimed that I was sent by the devil'
'That is not true'
'In order to make me suffer, the devil sent you'
'with you'
'And you'
This refusal, with all her power, sent out to the judges. It's just that this power does not come from the dead God, but from her own, from a person's inner, unbreakable faith. At this time, it is no longer important to whom the object of the belief is, and more importantly, this belief and the power it carries are burst out of a person and the heart of the person after the object has long been destroyed.
Although Joan of Arc had been shaken in the face of the upcoming fire punishment, it was the saint and the faith that never burned down in the fire. The director then expressed the scene that the French people were called by Jeanne d'Arc and immediately began to fight the soldiers, simply visualizing this power.
Since the two industrial revolutions, mankind has shouted the slogan of God 's death against the background of rapid technological advancement, but with it comes the heavy fall of souls from generation to generation, and the human spirit seems to remain after God 's departure A huge gap was added, and then a series of things that filled this gap added greed and sin that were left after the rapid development of many material civilizations. Maybe God is indeed dead, or not, but what mankind really lacks at this moment is not just an unknowable unknown force, but more importantly the faith, or rather, the faith itself.
Finally, the status of this film in film history is also commendable. Although the use of a large number of close-up shots is a reflection of the director's personal style, but the win is to win in the movie itself and the theme is very suitable. This film with almost no plot focuses more on the characterization of the characters, and the close-up shot becomes the optimal solution to achieve this goal under this condition. In addition, there is a very important point, the film was filmed in 1928, at this time, the sound film has just been born a year has not yet been popular. Instead of relying on the dialogue presented by the sound, the audience's attention is completely placed on the picture itself. The superb performance of the characters + the use of close-up shots + the clear-cut editing (the front and back contrast or the corresponding combination of pictures are used in the film many times The rendering of emotions) + the background music of the piano music constitutes the expression effect of the history of this vertical shadow. I have to say that this is really an art that belongs only to the silent era. The film fully embodies the unique charm of the film as a 'dumb art' and truly achieves the so-called 'silent wins with sound' effect.
'When the flame rises to the sky, it engulfs Jeanne's soul, Jeanne's heart has become the heart of France, Jeanne will be remembered and cherished by the French people forever.'",8,1,1,16 April 2020

The mother also forgiven his elder son in the end.At the end of the film, the hostess 's eldest son looked down at his mother 's grave with his hands down, just like the subtitles originally shown in the film, his heart was already burning.This tragedy occurred because of different beliefs, and this is the fate of the people of the times. Humans who could have lived with peace of mind, because of endless disputes and endless conflicts, dragged alive people into the dark vortex.To make a digression, just like the recent epidemic, the relations between countries are complicated and complex, and countries are like people. There was a cold war or a hot war in the country, which was equivalent to the indifference and fight between people. From a higher perspective, this behavior of human beings is extremely naive, and people can be friendly and complete. But the 'evil' in people's hearts has caused this kind of tragedy to repeat itself until mankind produces higher wisdom!",8,1,1,4 May 2020
The Godfather: Part II," Never unite outsiders against your family
","No matter how stormy it is outside, the family is always the warmest haven.The new and old godfathers are family-oriented, loyal and dedicated, but their endings are different. The wife married by the old godfather is a Sicilian. The woman there is pure and kind and cares for her family, and she lives in a mafia, so she can accept her husband's career. And they are supported by the trouble and together, so the relationship between husband and wife has been very harmonious. The old godfather is a person with a great sense of family responsibility. The original intention of the struggle is also to make the family better. No matter how much trouble is encountered outside, it is always a breeze to return home. Go to the theater to see beautiful women with friends. Friends said that the actress is beautiful. He said that is what you think, in my mind, only the wife and children are the most beautiful. So he will educate children, men who do n't take time to spend with their family, not real men. He will ask Mike if his wife and children are doing well. In his mind, no matter how big the outside career is, the family is always the most important. Why the godfather is a must-see movie for men to grow up, indeed, learn from the old godfather how to be a real manThe new godfather, under his father's words and examples, also paid great attention to the family. So he will fight back when his father is stabbed. After the death of his brother, he took the burden of the family, even if his original intention did not want to go this way. When Fredo helps an outsider talk about him, he will be very angry and say that you will not be allowed to unite outsiders to fight against the family, never. This also helped Fredo to betray the family several times, and finally he was buried and buried. Mike and Kay feel more that the two are suitable to talk together, and the elements of love are quite few. Kay called and asked Mike to say that she loved her, but Mike never said. And he fled to Sicily without saying a word, and never contacted him later. Perhaps he had always wanted to marry a wife like his mother, so when in Sicily, he would fall in love with the Sicilian girl at first sight. And soon a wedding was held with the girl, why many people talked for a long time but couldn't get married, and can quickly marry another person after breaking up, it is important to meet the right person at the right time. Unfortunately, the two were together for a short time, and the newlywed wife was killed by the bodyguard. Since then, the girl has always been a cinnabar mole in his heart. Mike came back to Kay only a year later, when the family was in a precarious situation, and Kay was the most suitable wife. Because they knew each other well, Kay also loved him. After all, he waited for six years, so the two got married. But the two of them did not hold a grand wedding in the movie, maybe the form was forced at that time. Kay is a native American. Her education and religious belief made her unable to accept Mike's triad family and even less understand the business he did. Therefore, the two were in conflict, and eventually moved away. Later, Kay killed Mike's child and said some unsympathetic words, completely breaking Mike's heart. So when Kay wanted to leave without keeping, Mike secretly closed the door when he secretly visited his children to leave. Like the last scene in Godfather 1, the door between family business and her. If the first wife is not killed, perhaps all three will be happier. Kay can find a thorough American marriage and establish a happy family. The first wife will be like Mike 's mother, praying for him to have children, taking care of the family, and not afraid of blaming him for his career.

Fargo," Cold will
","The runaway and 'cold' that the Cohen brothers want are in place
The protagonist's motivation is a little problem. He is obviously a man suffering from society. How can his IQ keep up with the kidnapping of Chinese elementary school students who played a self-directed kidnapping. Fortunately, the IQ is consistent and the hairstyle and performance are very small.
It is out of control rather than accident because of the difference in expression. The difference between 'accident' and 'out of control' is reflected in the degree of control. It's an accident that the bird droppings hit you on the head. After the same thing happened several times, you decided to prank your friends, but it hit you on the head again. This is out of control.
The angle of the Cohen brothers is mainly based on the role, and the natural loss of control is a more accurate description. The accident in the 'Death is Here' series has reached such an extent that you can feel that it is nothing to do with design and accident. In the end, I just want to see how the character dies instead of 'Ah, life is really precious, I want to live a good life.' 'Blood Storm' does not have such a strong sense of artificial design, naturally you can start to sigh the greatness or ordinaryness of life.
'cold'
'Aha' and too many seemingly embarrassing and alienating scenes are not actually to make you feel humorous or bored, but to make you feel as cold as the ice and snow outside the window, and the relationship is cold. The relationship of all the characters does not involve the emotions we think of in nature but is external, including the ending, the sudden warmth, which does not dispel the coldness, at most it can be warmer than drilling.
Whether life is dominated or designed is not a question that the movie can answer.",8,0,0,8 May 2020
Léon: The Professional," The mutual salvation of two souls
","Loneliness is often the life state of one person, love is the fireworks that two people collide. When loneliness meets love, then his future is destined to be extraordinary. The film tells us the wonderful love story between the lonely killing anion and the little girl Matida, to write a wonderful drama for us to break the lonely ice with love.The power of love is extremely powerful. Long-term loneliness makes people alert, wraps themselves in a sleeve, does not dare to communicate with people, holds a high degree of vigilance for anything, and leads a lonely life for a long time, which is also important for Lyon to become a cruel killer The reason, when Lyon met Matida, for a long time, she had a guard against her to protect himself. He used cold appearance to reject Matida 's good intentions, and the director also used multiple faces. Close-up to show Lyon's inner fluctuations. Deep inside Lyon is actually full of love. Matida, who also lost her younger brother, could feel this love. She used her bold expression to break the high wall in Lyon's heart. When Lyon decided to take Matida, a long-range lens in the film was presented to the audience with far-reaching significance. The film did not directly express it in lines, but used this lens to illustrate that Lyon accepted her, a tall and strong man and a weak can not help but wind The little girl walked out of the street, this picture looks very uncoordinated, but it actually shows the beginning of the lonely killer encountering love.The film tells a story on the surface: a killer helps the little girl at the next door to get revenge. In fact, it tells the story of two people redeeming each other.Why do you say that? Lyon is a killer, and his life is calm but full of danger: 'Cleaning up' will be fatal if he is careless. He has never slept with a peace of mind. There is no family member but Tony who is the boss to communicate with him. But the name of the film tells us that the killer is not too cold. Although the protagonist is cold-blooded and monotonous in life, he has a pure land deep in his heart. He also yearns for and loves beautiful things. From the potted flowers he raised, the infatuated expression when watching movies in the cinema, it can be seen that he is cold-blooded, tired of the world and immersed in some good, sincere and pure, these actions do not require him to communicate with other people, so with His killer character is not against. But in any case, he could not go further and pursue those good things, and he himself has become accustomed to it. At the beginning, I thought that the relationship with the little girl was just to show his friendliness, not really want to establish a relationship with the girl or others.Needless to say, the little girl's problem is that she smokes, skips class, lacks parental care, and is a problem teenager. The little girl also needs to change, but the change happened passively at the beginning, and caused her to lose her favorite brother. The girl is eager for revenge, but how does revenge and her life go? There is no answer.What is appealing about the film?Created a combination that is unexpected and continues to promote the development of the plot. The killer and the girl seem to come together at the two extremes. This is not a rigid combination, nor is it necessary to take each one, but they all need to heal each other's inner scars. In the evolution and enhancement of this demand, we even expect this unusual emotional relationship to be at a loss.The purpose of the little girl is very clear, that is revenge, and she can only achieve it by establishing a relationship with Lyon. Getting along for a long time quickly brought the relationship between them closer, and the girl even realized the warmth and happy time that she never had in her home. The uncle originally wanted to save the girl, didn't want to live with her, and didn't want to avenge her, but the girl's strength forced him to make concessions. She couldn't lose her anymore.The behavior of most girls has always pushed their relationship closer. As the plot further developed, the two began to gradually approach the original purpose of the combination, which made them tighter and gradually threatened them. Your own safety. At the last moment of the crisis, between life and death, Lyon saved the girl, and he embarked on a better road to salvation. After cutting out the passage of life, Lyon let the girl go down alone, the girl did not listen to life and death, Lyon must convince her to go down willingly, thought that the unspoken uncle would only say 'believe me', 'I will go out alive and there will be nothing wrong' With such guarantees, at this juncture of life and death, if you don't speak your heart, you may have no chance. So Lyon finally spoke the warm monologue. The little girl asked Lyon to regain her longing for life and longing for a good relationship. Even if this kind of beauty was not finally obtained, I think Lyon must be at ease when he finally died with the bad guys.After losing Lyon, the little girl can only go to Tony, and the latter allows the girl to return to school. In the end, the girl should return to normal campus life. This is the best ending for the little girl. Compared with the spiritual salvation of Lyon, the salvation of the little girl is the salvation of life. During the revenge stage, the relationship between the two people has matured her a lot, and she has achieved revenge and found the root, and it is equally important that I start her real life. She no longer broke the jars of life like before, she chose to plant Lyon pots to commemorate Lyon, but also regarded it as the beginning of serious life. Holding him. The same is planted with hope and goodness, let them grow up with the girl.",9,0,2,20 April 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," A movie worth watching
","In the 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the mortal dust that falls into it is not star-studded, but in a flash of glory, it engraved the most beautiful soundtrack and sang the world.When you are immersed in the pain of real events and cannot extricate yourself, the virtualized comfort of the movie and the compensation for the injured heart are simply a waste of money. The love and loyalty of the Queen is the starting point of the chasers' dreams and the beginning of the nightmare of some people, but the reality is cruel. No matter how you compare and restore, everything that has passed is the most memorable past and tolerance. The memories and enthusiasm of too many people, like the slaughter of the jab, disillusioned the beautiful.However, the film 'Bohemian Rhapsody' did its best to complete the beautiful shots, using the form of a feature film to create a semi-documentary look. Reduction is the best tribute. Bit by bit, nostalgia, it seems to be reproducible. Those indescribable subtleties, happy hearts, bitter glasses of wine, the support of friends, the love's hundreds of thousands of times, the feelings Choices, gender lingering, thinking in the works, historical lenses, they form a life in minutes, even if they can't be pieced together again, they can still be re-engraved in their hearts because they miss and don't want to let go of each A memory is a precious thought.I have never been a queen enthusiast, for the sake of completeness, I simply read some information. When I watched the movie, I experienced more, but when I turned the biography, I was more moved. In reality, the characters that are alive are more flesh and blood, more moving. The Freddie Mercury in the film is quite charming, but this charm has a stronger sense of interpretation, a good casting ability, and a high degree of completion of the role, but the gap between the overlap of the characters is a bit large. After all, the real Freddie Mercury In my opinion, I am actually more handsome and have a stronger sense of whites. Lamy MacRae does n't know why it always makes me feel more mulatto, or because of the treatment of hair. In terms of time and feelings, it is a bit strange, but of course, the performance is still best.For me, the best movie in the whole movie is actually guitarist Dr. Mei.But watching movies in China still feels hurt. Although the film was introduced, various classic shots were cut out by Kaka. I kept watching in the cinema after watching the whole scene, and I dared not take a sip of water, but in the end I found that a few classic shots were directly cancelled. For example, the section where Freddie Mercury told his companions that he was infected with AIDS, and the section where Freddie Mercury kissed Jim who met him. It wasn't until a long, long time ago, that I glimpsed in the moving world, and I realized that there was such a beautiful moment to start memorizing. If not, I thought the two people in the movie didn't have much intersection at all, so Freddie Mercury was invited as a memento at the end of the film, and Jim Going to the concert scene is a bit inexplicable. In such an important series of movie clips, the classics are always deleted. It is also a feeling of helplessness.In other words, is it that the same-sex stories are always bruised by harsh conditions?After a long time, many stories don't remember, but some pictures and pleasant melodies will always stay in your heart.Many of the goodnesses sent by heaven come to wander the world, morning or night, fulfill their own duties, leave a legend, and return home. Perhaps the earth uses these inscriptions to mark the scale of the civilization. One day they will become legends.",8,1,2,3 April 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beginning
","The Lord of the Rings is a story about the ring. The most memorable thing is probably the famous scene of Guru. My ring, my baby, Guru's weird shape and eager lines, instantly burned into the depths of my memory.The main task is actually very simple, destroy the Lord of the Rings. But the setting of the Lord of the Rings is very invincible, he will always be extremely powerful, and he will tempt to erode the owner's heart. The original simple task became an almost impossible task because of this setting.Fortunately, there is a kind Hobbit, and eventually the Hobbit has become the protagonist of this series.Although the Lord of the Rings is a hidden danger, no one is willing to take on this thankless burden, and no one has the confidence to resist the temptation.Eventually formed a team to escort Frodo to destroy the Lord of the Rings. Once he embarked on the journey, he found that the difficulties were far more than expected. The white robe wizard has been bought to help Soro to stop them, they have to repeatedly change routes to choose more dangerous or unknown.There are contradictions in its own team, elves and dwarves, and little friends who walked and sacrificed. Although the foreign enemies are terrible, because of the temptation of the Lord of the Rings, the most feared thing is that the teammates around them suddenly changed their faces and snatched the ring.In the end Frodo decided to go on his own. This may be the most resonant point of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Frodo is more than a little weaker than those of the elf dwarf, but he chose to resist this one. Mission, use your heart to fight the Lord of the Rings.Many settings in Middle-earth are very interesting, various unimaginable creature spells, beautiful fairy elves, fierce fighting scenes, but I think these settings are all explaining one thing, a strong heart is the most strong power.",9,0,0,12 April 2020
The Thing," You never know if the person around you is the 'the thing'
","The story is very smooth. From the beginning, the Norwegian drove a helicopter to chase the dog for thousands of miles, which caused suspense. Why on earth was such a big deal? And at that time, I discussed with the male ticket that this dog's behavior is not 'dog', and seeing people do not wave their tails also has a sense of alienation. This question was quickly answered, it turns out that this is not a dog at all, but 'the thing'
Behind the monsters gradually showed a fierce look, using psychological warfare to kill the scientific research personnel one by one and make everyone self-endangered. The picture is also bloody and full, there are many classic monster deformation lenses, and even some unique beauty. The scene of the doctor's electric shock to save people really shocked me. It was a completely unexpected scene.The blank space at the end is also just right. Is the black team member who returned suddenly a monster? The tired protagonist was paralyzed on the ground, thinking that the monster was finally resolved, but did not expect despair to strike again.And I think the settings of this film are more frightening than aliens. For the aliens, I always have a sense of separation from reality, because the spaceship / alien looks / story background and other settings let me always clearly know that this is not true and will not happen. The strange setting is that the monster will absorb you, imitate you, and eventually become the real you. This setting makes it very easy to extend, what if the monster escapes quietly? Is it true that there are many 'the things' lurking in the society that are gradually eroding human beings, if our surroundings are already occupied by such monsters? We never know. This is the biggest fear this film brings to us.",8,0,0,8 May 2020
The Revenant," Sickness of ice and fire
","This film was once again directed by Alessandro Gonzalez Inaritu, who won the Oscar for Best Director Award, and once again won the Oscar for Best Director Award. This film also won the Oscar Best Best Film Award. In fact, this film can also be named the soul reviver or the soul of the dead.
The film tells that Grass was seriously injured by a bear while hunting, and was then taken care of by fellow Fitz players. He took over 300 dollars and took care of it. He carelessly killed Glass's son and tricked Jim away. Grasse. Later, Grass survived stubbornly and insisted on looking for Fitz 's revenge. Finally, with the death of the captain, he succeeded in revenge on a river.
The beginning of the movie begins with a series of long shots that are extremely difficult to shoot. The Indians besieged the team of Grasse, the setting of natural light, the fleeing of water, smoke, horses, and dragons. A racial and alien killing is being staged . The five-minute fight with Bear in the woods is also a long shot that the director is good at. Every time the bear attacks, every time the Grass groans, this sense of reality makes the viewer 's heart beat, knife. See blood. The scenes shot in the movie are magnificent and magnificent. They are vast and magnificent nature, mysterious and dangerous ice fields, and high and distant mountains, set against a small person, and constitute a picture of the confrontation between man and nature. Man and life The epic of struggle. The climax of the film followed the survival of Grasse. Grasse, who was seriously injured, climbed out of the grave, burned the wound with gunpowder, and dived into the river to escape the pursuit of the Li people. After such torture, he survived, returned to the camp, and officially began his revenge. The violent aesthetic mixed with the film is not violence for survival, but an instinctively weak meat and strong food. Grass 's lines are very few. Basically, it is a unicorn drama, especially in the endless ice field. The lonely is not only the loneliness of the body but also the loneliness of the loss of wife and child. The expression of Grass seems to be a line, speechless and deep, and the viewer has pity for the pain of survival. His belief is the narration that runs through the film many times in the dream. 'As long as you can breathe, you must fight and continue to breathe.' The reason for living is revenge and faith.
I noticed the images used in the film: the birds flying out of the chest after the death of my wife, the death knell in the dream, and the sky flashed through the sky and fell into flames. At the beginning, I thought that the kind of bird was a crow, which represented the messenger of death. Later, I thought that it could also represent the freedom of death. Because of the suffering in the world, I was happy after death. This can also explain that when Grass saw his wife happy Image. The death knell can also be regarded as the death of a son. The moment when the falling sky fire appeared, it made me think it was 'Icarus' in ancient Greek mythology-with a pair of waxy wings, flying to the sun, and finally falling, he represents the pursuit of faith, which should be in the movie It also refers to the passing away of Grasse's faith, and should also represent the demise of the tribe represented by his wife and children and the Poni people who saved him. All three images can be regarded as death or the loss of an existing thing. This is a part of Grasse's confrontation. This part-death belongs to a powerful and irreversible nature. Grasse's life is as small as a mustard. Under one kind of contrast, it became more and more small and could not withstand a blow. Highlighting life and life 's revenge is not worth mentioning in such a natural environment, so that the phrase 'The revenge is in the hands of God' that flashed over at the end of Glass 's revenge on Fitz will not be abrupt. This kind of person struggling with swords and arrows and cold snow and ice, fighting a shot hanging in the line, tells us that life is paid and impermanent. Grass 's instantaneous understanding of God seemed to him that he had to follow suit. It was like a mission, like a gift from you against nature.
This film is about the life of ice and fire. With the help of people's understanding of life, it can resonate with the soul of the viewer. In the art, sound effects, shots, and narrative, you can pick it out separately. The best Oscar film is really named Return.",8,0,1,5 April 2020

Integrate the film title in the form and the film itself (the early film titles only have the role of account and hint)The north-north-westerly opening title transitioned from an abstract grid background to a Manhattan building, and finally the impact focused on the crowd. This small paragraph itself is also a dismantling of the meaning of the building, that is, the conflict of people under the cross line.2.

In the last scene, the male host takes the female host's hand, and the next second shot is on the train! (The hint that the train enters the hole is also absolute!However, the details are still very obvious.

Hugo," Movies are dream machines
","I think this video is too beautiful and too romantic. It feels like fairy tales and strange dreams I saw in my childhood, and all the similar, strange and mysterious dreams. It is a world that seems to be true and illusory in childhood. Everything has a certain meaning. Wonderful, but confusing.The fairy-tale fantasy of the movie is not only the fantasy brought by the sophisticated machinery and rich and beautiful colors in the picture, but also the fantasy in the character setting.A boy who travels alone in a large and magnificent, mechanically constructed city and in the clock tower, he is like a teenager who ventures alone, exploring and surviving in a strange and strange city. He is precocious and lonely, he keeps a secret, he is persistently working hard for the common wish with his father.The policeman patrolling the train station admires the girl who sells flowers.

Merrie, who has a bad temper, was moved by his persistence after making trouble for Hugo, and set Hugo's requirements Going back to the task of the notebook, making toys, turning magic, all have fairy-tale colors.The women who kept dogs on the street and the men who were chased and bitten by dogs did not feel unnecessary and meaningless.

The robot is dreamy and mysterious, and as an excellent mechanic, Hugo is also a magician and a dream maker.Regarding emotions, in addition to love for dreams, there are other places that touch people. At the end, the policeman grabbed Hugo and said, 'A child must have a home,' Hugo begged the police to let him go, and said, 'I don't understand why my father is dying, why I am alone, and this is my chance, Rebirth ... 'The loneliness, confusion and struggle in life made me almost cry ... Another place, Hugo told the girl that he and his father used to watch movies, To dispel my miss to my mother. At this time, Hugo only maintains contact with his father by repairing the robot ...This film recalls the feeling I have forgotten for a long time-as a child who is full of confusion and curiosity about the world, that novelty, amazement, mystery, strangeness ...

American Beauty," Live in the world, that should be cherished
","This is a good-looking movie, why do you say that? When I watched it, I didn't pay too much attention to the progress bar, and when I reacted, the film had reached the end. It is very rare for a film to be immersed in it. 'American Beauty' is quite natural and fascinating. After watching it, it can't help but wonder. It is no wonder that it will win five Oscars and 2000 Oscar Awards. 3 nominations.This movie mainly describes 7 characters and 2 American families. Perhaps many people hate the male type of Leicester, but my favorite character is him. He is indeed 'dirty' at the beginning of the film. He was obsessed with his daughter's girlfriends, and was in a dire situation. He faced resignation, became hot and cold with his wife, and became estranged from his daughter. However, after realizing that his daughter's girlfriend Angela was not disgusted with himself and wishing to keep fit, he became quite active after he met the new neighbor, the drug dealer Richie, who was a classmate with her daughter, and started taking drugs. Came alive from a pool of stagnant water.Although the motivation and reason are not pure, the optimism, cheerfulness, and positiveness of the male lead Leicester have infected me. In the movie, there have been two changes in the male lead. The first time is his obsession with Angela and drug addiction. This change has transformed him from a middle-aged man with a middle-aged crisis, unemployment crisis, and family crisis into a new confidence in life. , Gradually recovering the family who actively pursued love, but at this time he was still quite selfish and morally misplaced; the second change was when he had Angela at his hand and worked hard to get it back, he found that Angela was At the time of his virginity, he felt a sense of protection for Angela and suppressed his desires. He regained morality, cared for his daughter, and the responsibility of a father and husband. His inner integrity became straight.The transformation of the male host is complete, and the film seems to usher in a relatively good ending, 'The male host picks up the goodness of life, improves family relations, finds a job, etc.', but a gunshot sounds and the male host suddenly dies and paints the film. It came to a not-so-complete but perfect period. To quote Leicester, 'I guess I should be angry when I die, but the world is so beautiful, I should not be angry all the time.' This is the charm of Leicester in the film, calm and optimistic, always with a smile. Compared with the other six characters, I found that perhaps the person who was the most abnormal at the beginning was the most normal at the end.The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Photography and Best Film Editing, and the reasons can be glimpsed from many of the lenses. The performance of the two discordant families in the film is described by a three-person long lens. The Leicester family eats at the dining table. Leicester, his wife, and her daughter sit upright, and the ritual is full, but The distance between the triple rooms is very far. As the camera zooms in, the distance gets farther and farther. Although the three people have a dialogue, but there is no lens conversion, this kind of unharmonious expression is most vividly expressed.Neighbor's house, a family sitting on the sofa watching TV, a very small sofa, there should be a half position between the two, the same three-person lens, the same sense of alienation, no need to describe too much, the internal relationship between the two families The tension was conveyed to the audience.A lot of symmetrical picture composition is used in the film to make it grand and magnificent, but also give people the visual enjoyment and beauty. The 2.55: 1 aspect ratio is easier to see if it is a symmetrical structure. The house, the movements of the characters, and the symmetry have always appeared. I was impressed by a scene. Leicester came to the daughter 's room to secretly call Angela. The daughter came out of the bathroom. The male owner slipped away from the door. The two doors were in the middle. One is on the right, what to do with asymmetry? The director installed a mirror on the left, symmetrical the door on the right to the left, and created a symmetrical composition.The use of Richie's camera in the film is unique. I can see these two points. The first point is to use a camera to show Ricky 's love for her daughter Jenny. There is no way to say that Ricky likes Jenny in the film, but the audience is convinced. why? Because many times in the film, Richie was shooting Jenny with a camera, constantly zooming in, and putting Jenny 's face to the maximum. Even though Angela was doing various provocative movements, Richie 's lens was 'invisible'. The second is that when Jane and Rich talked about hiring Leicester, the camera's implementation of the imagery showed the expressions of the two people facing the same picture, using a lot of picture-in-picture and even making the picture-in-picture symmetrical. Of course, there are more than these. When Rich's father stormed Rich at home, the camera also played a role, so I will not list them here.Before the end of the film, the dialogue between the male lead Leicester and Angela in the living room was the climax of the movie's soaring acting skills. This was the second change of the male lead and his sublimation moment, a 20-second shot, It is all interpreted by the male facial expressions, 'I'm fine,' said the male host's sadness, and awakened his love for home.After the male host was shot, many cross montages were used to explain that the male host 's wife wanted to kill the male host, so the audience had the illusion that the male host 's wife killed the male host, but the male host was clearly affectionate when he was killed. Looking at his family photo, how can his wife get it? I was puzzled. Sure enough, with the monologue of the male lead, a group of pictures with the same scene and the same direction of movement were superimposed by crossing the empty mirror with the reality. Three shots were fired. Six other characters were in the event. The last shot revealed that the murderer was a neighbor-the father of Rich.It is beautiful to live, just like a plastic bag fluttering in the wind, trying to live as much as possible. This movie makes me feel a lot. It seems to be just telling a story and reflecting a reality, but it contains something else. Leicester: 'You must not know what I am talking about, don't worry, you will understand one day.'However, this movie reminds us that if there is a misunderstanding, we must clarify it as soon as possible, or do not lie, because it may even cause the death of a life, let relatives go to prison, and the family broken.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Warrior," Every time I remember crying and laughing, I change my mind for another minute
","The protagonist's parents divorced, and his younger brother, the devil, followed his mother to leave. The male lead follows his father, and many years later his elder brother marries his wife. The younger brother, the devil, went to join the army after cooking his mother's funeral alone. My brother's family suffered a misfortune, and the financial difficulties not only caused the house to face the sealed daughter but also became ill and had no money to heal. Brother decided not to fight as a teacher. Although this is dangerous, money comes quickly after all. The most important thing is that the elder brother has the protagonist aura, he will not lose any attempt.The Big Devil saw the news that the actor was playing, and he signed up. If the purpose of the elder brother's game is to keep his own house for his daughter to see a doctor. Then the purpose of the Big Devil's competition is to vent his dissatisfaction. The great devil felt that the whole world owed him. In particular, seeing the actor have a wife and children, both of them are even furious.But on the day of the real game, the big devil was completely dumbfounded, and he discovered that the hero had a halo of protagonist. Therefore, after playing for a long time, the male protagonist was unscathed. Not only did he not knock down one arm of the other's big devil, but he was also dislocated. At this point the big demon king has gone, but he refused to admit defeat. The referee did not matter, why not directly declare the victory of the actor. The actor also deliberately put off water to delay the time, and finally the actor begged the big devil for forgiveness. The Big Devil was satisfied before he confessed his surrender.After reading this story, we understand that the world simply does not feel the same about it. It is impossible for others to experience the pain you have experienced since childhood. It's like the temperature of the water in the bath.

Judgment at Nuremberg," Not the kind I like, but it 's very exciting
","The tone is very high, and I thought it would be a preaching movie, but in fact the whole story is still very delicate, the characters are slightly complicated, but the main perspective is very good. The trial accounted for most of the film, but many of the most intense and exciting confrontations occurred outside the court. There are many elements in this world. Although I am not willing to admit it or believe it, sometimes you have to compromise for reality and make sacrifices. When the American judge listened to the consideration of his colleagues and looked at the German judge outside the window, he found that the one outside the window was the same fellow who cherished his sympathy. He had the same justice execution ideals and the same cynicism. It is a pity that not all questions have an accurate answer. From the perspective of hindsight, everyone can become a saint. This is a ridiculous world. Justice is at most a pursuit and never a state, not a second, because this world is not black and white, or either. One judge goes to judge another, and looks at the world from the standpoint of another person. This is the virtue of man, because the world is full of people's evaluation and judgment of others, but no one comes from the future. Comprehension and love are the solutions of this world, not the answers. The trial is just a conclusion, not justice, and the answer to justice does not exist. After receiving the harsh verdict, the German judge realized that he was trying himself, so in the end he thought that he had received a fair trial and asked to meet with the American judge. Here is the last sentence the American judge said to the German judge, It is not only the concentration of the whole film, but also the most subtle turning point.",8,0,0,14 April 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A passionate heroine, a ruthless enemy
","That robot is a liquid robot that we used to say when we were young.It was an afternoon, and I went to play with my little aunt's house, and accompanied by the children of his family, I watched the film together.Each character is very good at showing what his character should do.The little boy is naughty, rebellious, and likes to show off, but many times his mind is clear, he can detect the sudden change of the adoptive mother, and immediately wants to understand where his mother is going. He uses his own technology to break through the blockade and get the key. He is almost a child. It can be done.The heroine is very handsome, that muscle, and fighting against the fat man with double intelligence, and the double attack of the governor, work together, you go to hijack the car, I come afterwards, not a big vase. Especially the last few shots are really handsome!The governor, a robot with temperature, which is why the last thumb is so fascinating, because a robot can suddenly feel what tears are and begin to have some emotions.Liquid robot. It 's so cool that he did n't want to. He appeared with the governor, especially the little friend who just looked from the first one. Who can know that such a handsome guy is a bad guy? The ability setting is also quite buggy, so that various imitations behind, but it is difficult to surpass.Even Xiao Hei 's self-sacrifice is also a researcher. In such a short time, he can completely turn around and reflect on what he has spent so many years studying. It is not harmful, not that some film researchers know that the results are not good for the research results. It takes a lot to jump in one rib.The suspense setting is great. The sudden counter-attack of the adoptive mother is so shocking that even when you see all the strangers coming out, you will feel that you will suddenly give you a sword.This kind of film is really enjoyable. There is almost no free time in two hours. I feel very nervous. It is much better than giving you a countdown in the third part, because there are so many hours left, blabla, But we all know that in the end we can all be completed within the stipulated time, which is boring.And the setting of the venue for the decisive battle is very coincidental, because the car was chasing, and it happened to be at the steel plant.",8,1,1,22 April 2020
Dangal," I am proud of you
","The movie is adapted from a real story, perhaps placed in our reality, such a straight male cancer father will be vomited: You can't accomplish your dreams, why do you impose on your daughter? But that was in India. In that country, women were destined to marry people when they were 14 years old, and they could only keep giving birth to children and do housework. The father who appeared to be a tyrant imposed his dream on his daughter. In fact, it also forcibly changed their life path destined by this society.
Father's trembling hand sent us to the big world that he had never experienced, and he fully expected everyone to understand us and care for us like himself. How he wanted to put us under his own wings forever, until, until we could reach an impeccable state. But his father was only his father. He had no more abilities. He could only watch his children stumble toward this world full of temptations and traps.
We left the small town at home and came to the so-called big city. We saw more, learned more, and the world of flowers shook us so that we could not open our eyes. The appearance of the so-called friend brings everything you have never seen before, just strange. Gradually, you will lose yourself, thinking that you feel the wind of the world and touch the tip of the world. You disdain everything your father told you, you forgot the rule of being sure when you were young, and you said to your father, 'Your old set is out of date, and no one does that now.' Just like Gita told his father, it is not popular now. Wrestled like this!
We are growing up, and old and new conflicts will eventually occur. Some people say that parental love refers to parting love. They send their children to grow up, and children send them to grow old. For decades in a lifetime, there is only a period of intersection. What should I do when the children are rushing out, and their parents are afraid that they will fall and they will fold their wings? Only anxiety remained.
Gita and his father had a PK on the wrestling field when they were young, which gave me the climax of the whole movie. I clenched my fists tightly, and my tears couldn't stop flowing. I knew that the father needed to lose because of the plot-because the parents never really won their children.
In a wrestling, Gita used the 'pop' skills taught by the coach to fight against his father's 'old-fashioned' experience and eventually overwhelmed his father to the ground. What I saw was a battle between a young cheetah-like wrestler and an old wrestler from Maifa, and it was also a conflict between her daughter and her father. Not surprisingly, a young wrestler will win, and her daughter will also win. She flicked her hair and told her father, 'Look, your suit is outdated.' From childhood to the age, he has been trained by the father's devil, and the girl who loves beauty is forcibly cut off her beautiful long hair ... At this moment, she has spent her childhood. Shadow, defeated the mountain-like giant who oppressed herself, she should have a big sigh in her heart. His father was lying in the sand, gray-faced, like an old, bearded black bear. There was no remorse on his face, no anger and anger, just a little bit, so sad and helpless.",8,0,0,13 April 2020
Apocalypse Now," Self-revelation in modern apocalypse
","Here I just want to briefly record some of the lines shocked by this film, and some of my inspired ideas.From a technical perspective, the soundtrack, filming, editing, light and shadow, each can come out and praise. But in terms of content, it has reached an unmatched height in other war films. I never thought that war films could be shot like this. Unlike the previous war films, although they are all criticizing the behavior of war and the impact of war on people, they are rarely raised to such an extent.The name Modern Apocalypse is also wonderful. How many people will be revealed to the people who have watched this film.The reason turn Kurtz to insane
Why does Kurtz go crazy until he destroys himself? Or how did the war destroy a 'good' person? You can get a glimpse of the other two or three languages.In the war, all the human moral concepts are subverted, and you will start to fight for yourself, good vs evil. Although people will encounter many similar situations in their daily lives, the existing social rules and moral standards will restrict your every move. But war is different. Under such special circumstances as war, the rational conscience and moral concepts you believe in will be broken, and your self-struggle will not be as simple as before The temptation will be unimaginable. Therefore, once you reach your endurance limit, the inner evil side is likely to explode. After all, under the special conditions of war, it is too painful to continue to be kind, to become a evil person, or to live more easily without psychological burden.2. Why US lose in the Vietnam War?
I feel that the whole theme of the film is actually, why did the United States lose the Vietnam War? The answer given by the movie is: Why fight?There are two kinds of American soldiers. One is that they do not know why they are fighting. Even if they live on the battlefield, they still live like the muddled appearance of their time in the United States. For them, it was just a different place to serve. The other is just fighting for a concept called Biggest Nothing in History. They have a lofty ideal, that is, to fight communism and spread the concept of democracy, which will make them occupy the so-called 'moral highland' in this war, and will cause most Vietnamese to eventually move towards them. Therefore, they may not need to do too much to make the Viet Cong defeat. Among these two kinds of people, there is even one kind, the war-weary represented by Captain Willard. As soldiers, they had to obey the orders and came to the battlefield. But in their hearts, they are tired of war. After all, after World War II, the United States has been actively participating in or launching various wars around the world, including the Vietnam War, and has also fought for more than 10 years. Status. In this war, Americans do not have the concept of winning.On the other hand, the Vietnamese soldiers clearly know why they are fighting. They fought for their own land, for their own family, for all they had. What they are fighting for is something that can really be in their hands. Once they lose, they will face an unknown future, and the power of this fear makes them take up arms without hesitation. . In addition, their nationalist sentiment has aggravated their concept of winning. Even if they have differences within themselves, on the most crucial point, that is, they are Vietnamese and they want to fight for Vietnam, they have no doubt at all. When the Americans thought they were attacking communism rather than the Vietnamese, the Vietnamese thought that the Americans attacked Vietnam. So they are fighting for Vietnam, not those so-called doctrines. At this point, they have the belief that the American soldiers cannot defeat the victory.3. Nature of War
In fact, the movie doesn't say much about the essence of war. It just shows the cruelty, cruelty and dirtyness of war in one or two lines. The most silent thing is that we clearly know that the war will never end.4. PTSD of the War
In fact, this part of the personal feeling is closely related to the first part why Kurtz finally went crazy. People trapped in war always endure the trauma caused by the war, and most of these traumas are actually negative and negative. The most uncomfortable thing is that the more sober people, they will fall into the impact of war until they are destroyed.I wrote some of my immature little thoughts.Finally, pray for world peace.",8,0,0,23 April 2020
Dunkirk," Lucky mission
","On September 1, 1939, a white lightning struck the Polish sky, and a group of demons who claimed to be 'excellent races' began their atrocities. They created death and panic at an alarming rate, and greedily enjoyed this sinful feast made of blood and tears. The flames of war spread to more than half of Europe, and the originally peaceful and peaceful land was all included in the evil territory by them.This tragedy called 'World War II' was the darkest period in human history. It's hard to look back, but it can't be forgotten. Those cruel facts still look shocking today. The good and evil in human nature are exposed under the scouring of blood. There are too many aspects of World War II that are worth exploring and thinking, and the clues are hidden in the smoke that spans more than half of the earth.In the early days of World War II, the German Fascist blitz was invincible and invincible, and no one could stop it wherever it went. From Poland all the way north, swept through Norway and Denmark, turned west, swept through Belgium and Luxembourg, and rushed into France. The Anglo-French forces jointly guarded the last line of defense in the European continent, but the balance of victory was still dumped on Germany. Within days of the battle, the Anglo-French coalition was in desperation. 400,000 people were trapped in Dunkirk in northern France, with a trace of hope for survival, eager for God's assistance and mercy.Dunkirk, retreat soon. This was a frustrating escape, but it was also the first potential turning point in World War II. The film honestly retells this history, selfishness, ruthlessness, lies, discrimination, nowhere to escape. So many sins filled the story, but no character can really make people hate.Frightened by the explosion, he missed the pilot who killed George. Does he hate it? Hateful, hateful that he killed an innocent life, but how could he hate him when he flew to death and flew through the rain of bullets? The French who pretended to be an Englishman and wanted to escape on a British cruise ship, could he hate it? Hateful, hateful. He defrauded the trust of others at a critical moment, but how could he not be grateful if he opened the escape hatch for the soldiers of the whole ship and extended his helping hand again and again? Do they hate the young soldiers who want to occupy the Dutch merchant ships and return home? Hateful, hateful to abandon others at a juncture and ignore them, selfishness. But war is destined to be accompanied by death. Someone can return to the motherland, and some people want to die. Who is not greedy for life and death? Think of it this way, their behavior is also worthy of compassion and forgiveness.The cruise ship with the national flag sailed into the port again and again, sailed again and again, and sank again and again. Hope to ignite time and time again, and to be destroyed again and again. At the end of the line of sight, at the sea level, is the motherland, not the broad English Channel, which has become an insurmountable obstacle. Those men who are in their prime are helpless like children, waiting for the judgment of fate in desperation.Fortunately, the Germans suspended the attack at this time. Fortunately, the civilian ships requisitioned by the government arrived in time. Fortunately, fortunately, most soldiers can return to their homeland, Dunkirk has not turned into a hell on earth.When the two feet set foot on the land of the motherland, there was no expected joy or luck for the rest of the life. Traveling with confidence, but forced to retreat by powerful enemies, even if they survived? Not a loser yet. Near the dock, many residents prepared bread and beer to treat these young people who fought for the country. As the train left the station, the crowds along the road stopped and waved to express their respect and gratitude. The atmosphere is joyful, but should the heart be sour? The more friendly the people, the more guilty the soldiers feel?Everyone knows the history behind. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the Pacific battlefield ignited smoke, the world anti-fascist alliance was established, the British and French coalition forces landed in Normandy, and reopened the battlefield in Western Europe. Germany was backed by enemies and defeated again and again. The victorious balance has quietly changed its tilted direction. And the group of surviving young people when Dunkirk retreated was also a powerful force in the counterattack of World War II.It is not only lucky to survive, but also a mission. The sourness and guilt at the beginning were transformed into the courage and power to charge, and the motherland behind him was a belief that he did not regret.",8,0,0,4 April 2020
The Intouchables," Fortunately, you didn't give up on me
","The soothing piano music runs through the whole movie from beginning to end, echoing the beginning and end, the same story and music.I think this movie impressed me the most. First of all, there are countless humorous and funny humor of Driss and Philip.Driss is low-interest, low-educated, loves pornography, and likes to use violence to solve problems. But this does not hinder his innate self-confidence, the whole person is full of tension and vitality.In contrast, Philip, who was born and lived in a high-level crowd, showed that he was different from Driss, but he was very eager.They redeemed each other, helped each other, stumbled and walked through each other's most difficult time.Everyone will get sick sometimes, and philippe will choose Driss at first because he thinks he has chosen a relatively irresponsible person who can ignore his life indifferently. As a result, in the process of getting along with him during the day, he found that the passionate, sunny, and informal boy was changing him.For most people, a person who has been in and out of prison all year round cannot gain the respect of others, but he regards Driss as a confidant and takes care of his enthusiasm carefully.As a wealthy man who loses his mobility, he will not feel inferior in his heart. When facing a girl who has a good impression on him, even if he is gentleman, funny, rich and connotative, he will still feel confident in the straightforward words of others drop. Since then, the line of defense in my heart has completely disintegratedHe forced Driss away and lost the friend who made him optimistic, as if life had become boring. So in the end Driss came back to make him smile again and hope for life.So many times, when disasters and sufferings come, we have no choice but to face optimism. Don't give up hope of survival.It turns out that people are destined to become more lonely and get smaller in the circle of living, because noisy people are tired of coping, and a few like-minded people are enough.Love is like friendship. There are more people who have heard and fewer people. But in fact, the emotional world is often fair.

Aliens," Science fiction movies are powerful
","First of all, the plot of science fiction action movies is not static, and the intuitive feelings for action movies are only really narrow. The strength of this film has surpassed most of the science fiction films of today. The plot is not static. On the contrary, it is somewhat like a disaster film. It can die at any time. The movie viewing experience is also excellent. It makes people admire the ability of James Cameron. It 's not a joke to set a large set of books. The fantasy of various firearm computers is also very cool. Except for the armored vehicle, it is very unscientific, the chassis is so low and it is not practical. As a chariot company of alien colonists The mountain can't adapt, how can it be applied to the army. This movie made me truly awesome about American science fiction movies. Before watching 'Interstellar', I found that the theme is very good, but in fact, after returning home, I found that my child is aging (old death). The plot is in this movie. That's it, feelings under fantasy are really powerful. In this movie, it seems that I have also seen the inspiration for many works. The 'Alien' series is really a milestone in science fiction.In fact, the difference between the first part and the first part is quite big. The first part focuses on horror and horror. This one is an action shootout. Many places nowadays look at it and want to call it addictive. The first part is a team that has no hope in space, and finally did not return to the earth, giving a sense of depression. This part is from the military 's disdain to extreme fear to being annihilated to reflect the strength of the alien.The ending is too hasty, and it really ends after 'beating the bad guys'.",9,0,0,25 April 2020

The racial issue has always been a pain in the hearts of Americans. Although we have seen progress from the liberation of slaves to Martin Luther King to now Obama, we have seen many innocent lives and lives on this difficult journey. The painful soul was trampled and trampled. From the teachings of Wen Ya's father to him, he can fully see the deep-rooted discrimination in some white people. When he reflected on himself from reality and reassessed his previous value judgment, the contradictory resentment accumulated by the two races for many years made the tragedy come again. We don't know what kind of entanglement will make him choose. There is still a long way to go before trying to eliminate the suspicions of race.
Looking back at us, it seems that ethnic contradictions are not so sharp, but is this really the case? I am a protected and sheltered instant gainer. Tibetans and Xinjiang people have no way of knowing their inner feelings, but they can understand their anger or helplessness even from very sporadic messages. What is more terrible is that we cannot sort it out as slowly as the United States, and gradually repair and make up. We can only watch everything happen and fall to the abyss with everyone.",8,1,1,21 April 2020
Spirited Away," A good anime
","In Spirited Away, the cute ten-year-old girl, Chihiro, strayed into the ghost world with her parents, whose parents turned into big pigs because of gluttony. In order to save the whole family, Chihiro had to work for the mother-in-law Tang who was in charge of the baths in the spirit realm, and at the same time gave up her name-which also meant giving up on herself. In fact, most of the people working in this bath are lost children, giving up self, only seeing money in their eyes, or the desire for life represented by money.The happy ending of the cartoon is not unexpected, and the relationship between Chihiro and Bailong is also reasonable. But I don't think it's a movie about emotions, not even Chihiro's extraordinary courage. What I see is a return from beginning to end, a return to innocence, a return to childlike innocence.I always feel that the bath has a special meaning in this story. The bath was originally a place where the dust was cleansed to purify the soul. The huge river god was moved by Chihiro 's innocence in the bath. He washed away the pollution before giving her the god of river; His true colors. And the reason why Chihiro can not be moved by desire from beginning to end is because she can maintain the precious innocence from beginning to end.Innocence is valuable because it is not stubborn, or persistent, changed by the external environment. The biggest difference between adults and children is not the soundness of the mind and the clarity of the mind, but the growing loss of possession and happiness. Because there is too much temptation in the adult world, adults often judge themselves based on what they see in others' eyes, whether they should be successful, and whether they should feel happy. In the child's innocent heart, the entire world is rewarding itself, laugh when you are happy, and cry when you are sad. Live simple, so happy. Chihiro's salvation and salvation all come from her innocence. Even if she is in desire, a childlike heart can always lead her out of her confusion. So this return to the self is not only because of the courage of Chihiro, but also because of her innocence from the heart.",10,1,1,20 March 2020
The Usual Suspects," No one is perfect
","The plot of the very suspect is ups and downs, but when you look closely, it seems a bit illogical. There is a gangster boss, a legendary person, why do you have to spend such a big circle to kill a person, and finally expose your own appearance , It seems illogical, but if there is no worker who survives, is all this perfect? The lame is undoubtedly Caesar, there are not so many conspiracies, all this is just a negligence of his, let the worker survive, and his own shot is only Caesar's style of action. After all, no one is more reliable than himself, and it also makes Caesar more mysterious. Even if the appearance was exposed, the police did not have enough evidence to prosecute him, so this was a perfect crime. But something unexpected.",8,0,0,20 April 2020
Inside Out," Imaginative movie
","A very imaginative film, with Lele in the brain returning to the brain headquarters, and Riley outside the brain running away from home as the main line, both story lines are very exciting, anthropomorphizing the emotions in the mind and each Functions.What I like most is the story line in my head, very imaginative. The dream factory shows how dreams are produced, just like making a movie, there is a complete crew. Abstract thinking is also very interesting, vivid Explained what is dimensionality reduction. It seems to be omnipotent in Fantasyland. The final turning point is very interesting. Lele 's favorite core memory (that is, the part where Riley is with his teammates) is actually triggered by worry. Riley didn't hit the most critical ball that day and lost the game, feeling very frustrated and sad, so teammates and parents came to comfort Riley, Lele saw only the second half before. Lele saw, only then Feeling worried is not just a burden, it is also indispensable to Riley.The 5 emotions (happiness, fear, anger, disgust, anxiety) in the film were proposed by the psychologist consultant Paul Ekman of this film. In fact, he thinks that people's emotions are also surprising, enjoyment, etc., but it is not good in the film Show. I did not find Barbara Fredrickson as a consultant. She believes that people have 18 emotions, the most important thing is love, but this is difficult to anthropomorphize.The film also shows the positive effect of negative emotions. Finally, Riley, who lost all emotions, can go home, just by worrying. Negative emotions are also useful. For example, when encountering dangerous things, they will be fearful, prompting people to escape from danger; Feeling angry when being violated, being able to attack or demonstrate to others; sadness can make people cope with the loss of important people / things, can also get comfort from others, etc.However, too much negative emotions can lead to depression, too much positive emotions can cause people to underestimate danger. Negative emotions and positive emotions, the two should reach a balance, Barbara Fredrickson has a metaphor, positive emotions are like a boat For sails, negative emotions are like anchors. For large sails, small anchors can only be rotated in place; for small anchors, large sails can easily turn over.",9,0,0,6 May 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers Assemble!
","Eleven years later, global fans finally waited for the final chapter of the 'Infinite Legend' of Marvel Universe, moved, recalled, humorous, unwilling to show all of them in front of the audience through this movie at a time. This is not only the end of this stage, but more like a beautiful knot to connect all the previous movies one by one. Therefore, when we re-examine the past clips and scenes, we will not only sigh how the legend became a classic, but also lament the time. In an instant, 11 years have passed, the beauty is late, and the hero retires. The soundtrack of this ending piece gave me a deep feeling, just as the story slowly expressed the emotion he told. At the same time, the director also spent a certain amount of space to describe the deeper emotional description of the first generation of six veterans, so that in the end, as long as you are a person who grew up with the MCU, you will be moved. At that moment when all heroes appeared on the trumpet of the final battle, everyone would witness this immortal legend. In the end, I personally feel that the director should focus on portraying the scenes of the final battle. After all, this is the ultimate battle. More should show the cooperation between the heroes, all the previous discord and differences will be turned into nothing, and the enemy will go forward bravely. Also, if you can do a better rhythm in the rhythm of the literary and martial arts, the whole movie will have a lot of appreciation. As for the BUG on the time and space most discussed in this film, I remember that Mr. Hawking also said before that as long as time is involved, there will always be many relative paradoxes. Since human beings can't explain this problem now, we don't need to find out, sit down and enjoy the movie. Sincerely, a legend of ten years has come to an end!",8,0,6,13 April 2020
Gone with the Wind," After feeling
","The classic old film, once watched the last episode on the movie channel, this time was able to watch this 200-minute feature film. Appreciated the wonderful performances of the famous two starring Fei Wenli and Gable. Unexpectedly, the 1939 film was still in color.This film is an epic blockbuster based on the American Civil War, and is described from the perspective of the failed South. Although there are black people, there is no description of the change in the status of black people. Or through the main line of emotion through the film.To be honest, I personally prefer Melanie in the film. Indeed, as Reid said, it is a perfect woman, virtuous and virtuous, and noble and kind. Although there is no outstanding personality, it is the type I like. I don't really like Scarlett's beautiful and lively but too profit-driven type.Wishes are often not as good as people want, do their best to obey the destiny.",7,0,0,8 May 2020
No Country for Old Men," This is a film about existence. People who are concerned about 'good or evil' may not see the point.
","Denial and repression seem to give people a sense of presence, but do n't look for repression in the sense of evil. It seems that the sense of evil can also give people a sense of presence, but that may be more repressive of themselves. Perhaps in sunny weather, people and people 's nature Get along, that's the feeling of beingBefore killing, you need to find a reason. The reason is the connection between people. When the connection is not found, the movie character will anger the other party, or find an excuse that does not seem to be excuse, and let him complete the next step. Feeling, but that feeling will make him more depressed. Maybe he can only get what he wants from this mode. Just like the child at the end helped him, he thanked the child, the natural connection between the two people is no longer dependent.And the old sheriff seemed to have nothing to do. Before the huge evil faced, his working identity might have given him a reason to exist. Perhaps he had also chosen the identity of a policeman in order to find a reason. He felt keenly, The other protagonist of the film needs help (the other person in the film is also said that he does not need help, but he helped others at the beginning of the film, and he still cares about his wife) but at the end of his film, his father seems to give him guidance However, he woke up and was unable to achieve it, but on the one hand, the thing that led did not necessarily exist. His father rode a horse but did not speak, and bowed his head to the front to wait for him. That might be his dependence. So at the end of the film, his father told him that even if the person who shot him was released from prison, he would not feel much. But his son couldn't let go, maybe the old sheriff himself regarded this sinful cleansing as his dependence, but in fact his father also told him that he could do little. This is the case itself, but the old sheriff still can't let go, he can't put it down, maybe at the end of the film, his dream, his father does not talk to him, maybe when he was a child, his father talked to him more, just fine Too. Or he and his father would talk more later, and the old sheriff went to find his father, but it seems that they did not communicate much (because he did n't know his father 's habit of drinking coffee), or his father Because she is a sergeant and relatively tough, when she communicates with her son, she often goes straight, denying the most criticism (because his father is also very cruel to himself. The father has a lot of cats in the film, indicating that the father is lonely. The living environment is not very good. At the same time, when the son said that the coffee is all the same, he still drank) His father also showed it at this time, and he was not very dependent.The old sheriff 's difficulties in his relationship with his father gave him a feeling of being independent, and at the end, his identity was removed (to complete things that would not necessarily be perfectly completed to him The feeling of powerlessness) also brought him back or reminded him that he was still in this state, so he wanted to ride a horse with his wife, or help with housework, with the intention to be so dependent, and then talked about his dream after retirement.Therefore, perhaps a rough summary is given, both good and evil are tools, and neither can be given to others. Good and evil are not content in themselves, but the real content is dependent, or the word 'depending' is not used, and What this content is, maybe you can see that if the father is right, he will no longer go forward silently, which is a kind of content.",8,0,0,7 May 2020
Batman Begins," Justice and Revenge
","Nolan is really a top student in the film industry. Commercial films have deep thinking and so deep.The 'Bat' element has always been used to the extreme in the film. Whether it is a shadow of fear in childhood or all the elements of Batman, it is very natural and ingenious.In addition to the topic of fear, to overcome fear, we must first face the fear directly, or the fear itself is the fear itself. What I am most interested in is the discussion about justice and revenge.The so-called justice and vengeance in the movie are to achieve inner peace by violence and violence. It is good to maintain the world and save yourself. In fact, the actions are almost the same, but the intentions are different. Therefore, it can be seen that justice and revenge are just different standards of measurement, and this standard derives from the fact that justice is abrupt, and revenge is devastating and endless.In addition to the inner measurement criteria, there is the last point of kindness and whether or not to stick to it. Whether it was Bruce's desperate efforts to save at first, or even the fate of the whole city, he could not kill Duka, but he would not save him.The splendid action fighting scenes and the racing scene beyond imagination are all amazing. And what makes people smile the most is that when the people of the city are in panic and confusion, attack the Batman group.",8,0,0,3 May 2020
Saving Private Ryan," War does not talk about human nature
","When watching the last battle of bridge and defense, I kept silent in my heart from time to time, when did it end. This film looks very crying. In fact, it is not. Desperate to the point where it can't be dispersed in the circle of heart, but it can't cry. When it is hit, it is like a loss of appetite.From big to small, from whole to individual. This drama is the kind of history book I want to read. After reading it, I think if the history teacher showed me the film at that time, maybe my history score would be 50 more points. World War II is a war of faith. Faith is not good or bad. It may result in eight stories that save one humanity first; it may also become a plot that vents people to death. The issue of human nature should not be within the scope of the war film, because human nature gives birth to the enemy and the enemy, and at most ends with different positions. But I still want to ask-fight for freedom. So what is freedom? I think even if they survived the war, the people who deeply participated in the war have no freedom. They are the beasts locked in the death of the war. Once the flood gate of the inner beast is released, they can only give themselves to other people. Man (God) may be able to be redeemed. That must be for the freedom of most people. These freedoms are symbolized by the American flag after the film, but for decades, has freedom really existed as they expected? I do n't know, death is with regret and hope, maybe alive, is despair?Recalling the sentence in the film-perhaps in this damn war, saving Ryan is the only good thing we have done.Speaking of individuals. It can be seen from the captain's state that he is a very good soldier. I think he is a portrayal of the excellent characteristics of soldiers. The military deployment is unclear and the most powerful is his calm calmness and the gentleness deep in his eyes. Dynamics are soldiers, and statics are teachers. Noisy and hyperactive in a cruel environment is the most needed and the easiest, shouting for freedom to rush up to encourage morale around, but this 8-person team is stunned, like sleeping in the grass The beast, if it doesn't move, is killed, and when it's out, it's killed. This is inseparable from the personal character of the captain, besides life and death he has his hopes and beliefs. There is a person who can advance the hope for the future. He sees not only the present, so he saw the glorious human glory of the national leader from the act of saving Ryan, over the red sea and the broken body, look Hope after the war.Earn this, earn itAlso impressed is the sniper who believes in God, hi, this guy is really too cool and can fall asleep with the bed. I think he has absolute warrior traits. It is fearless for the people in the war to give himself all to God. But if in the peaceful years, I have little way to imagine how he might be, maybe the same as the father in Educated? Until the moment when the muzzle is facing him, I want to know what he was thinking at that moment, for whom to fight, for whom to die?The last details that particularly touched meBlood stained half of the coast, but that was only the tip of the vast sea. Just as the war passed with time, who was responsible for the grief? I think it may be the sand on the coast, because blood water has penetrated into the sand, and finally became the nutrients of the sand.Don't shoot, let him be burned to death. What does an angel and a devil look like?There is actually a department dedicated to making death notices. Looking at the girls' typing, there was no expression on their faces. I was really scared. I couldn't type the wrong words. I was found out and I didn't work.Saved the old man for a long time, a bullet passed through his head and disappeared.In the last battle, the Germans in the tank were burned, and the soldiers upstairs gave him a shot to end him.

The Chorus," Ordinary and glowing
","The film uses a retrospective approach to retrospectively trace the past through an accidental visit by Pierre Peppino to Pierre.
On the outskirts of a small town, there is such a junior school full of strict systems. The students in this school are basically a group of uneducated children who can only use force to solve problems. However, no one knows that in the young minds of such seemingly hopeless children, one by one, the wonderful dreams are quietly sublimating. With such naive dreams, they met someone who was arguably enough to change their destiny-he was Matthew. It was he who discovered the strengths of these children and let them find their own 'spring'
A group of children thought to be abandoned and laissez-faire regained hope and found their own interest in singing; those paper planes with children's blessings of separation appeared at the right time; the one waiting at the door from the beginning Dad's Peppino finally found 'Dad' on Saturday. When Matthew left alone, the hand that only stretched out the window and the falling note made the audience impressed.
Matthew may not be a good musician, but he is definitely a good teacher. He gave the children hope with music, guided them back to the right path, and saw their own 'spring.' The power of art expressed in this movie is so great that it can save countless stubborn souls.",9,0,0,28 March 2020
The Grand Budapest Hotel," On the establishment of an independent illusion world
","Watching 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is like pushing a layer of secret doors into a parallel world of real history carefully driven by memories of emotions. Through the vocabulary of this world, we see the thrilling resistance and self-struggle of the weak human civilization under the 'barbarous slaughterhouse'.
Narrative structure
'Symmetry' aesthetics not only appears in the composition, but also uses a loop-lock structure in the narrative. Tombstones, young writers, conversations between young writers and old Zero, and Zero's memories are repeated in reverse after the memories are over, like piling up precious gifts layer by layer. After attracting people into the play, the spirit that naturally throws people in the world of illusion is guided away. The subtle realization of the 'purification' effect of Aristotle's 'tragedy' gives people an excellent and satisfying impression.
Narrative rhythm and audiovisual language
The unique narrative rhythm of the film and audio-visual skills jointly build this independent world. The ubiquitous sense of rhythm creates an unexpected comedy effect, and the serious theme and a serious line of content constitute drama irony. The actions and expressions of the characters, like stop motion animation, enter fast-forward mode when in motion, but also play an extremely prominent and accentuating role when at rest; if the former brings overall ease and humor, then the latter creates a stream of water The rugged rocky reef lurked in the fortress, and was hit at the climax.
Abnormal colors such as pink and the overall dream-like toning atmosphere are spread in the guiding composition; the music is relaxed and eager and has a certain era style. These three are unified in the creative impulse and personal style of the director under the strong emotion of recollecting that particular historical period, which maximizes the illusion of the general 's film and counteracts the reality of setting the world. . For example, Mr. Gustav took a deep breath and leaned slightly after a close-up lens with a side face. The rhythmic and psychedelic music sounded, and the main character walked through the screen with the same rhythm. . This means that Mr. Gustav enters his service role, and also means that the audience enters the specific world constructed by the director.
create character
An important pillar supporting the unique stylized presentation of this film is the symbolization of characters. The placement of the nickname 'Killer', Zero's 'doorman' identity throughout, and Mr. Gustav is the embodiment of the classical European noble culture. Behind the story of the encounter between Mr. Gustav and Ozawa Roze, it shows the survival and reaction of a certain spiritual form in a certain environment-a bit similar to the 'scenario' concept proposed by Mr. Sartre. 'The world maintained by Gustav has long since passed away. He relies on strong personal charm to maintain this illusion as much as possible' is the most obvious expression. The film constructs the character itself through the various reactions and habits of the characters in the whole story, and let him die together with the story.
Stepping out of the story and looking back at the Budapest Hotel, which has become synonymous with depression, loneliness, and perseverance, the last curtain of the classical aristocratic culture came to an end.",8,0,0,7 April 2020
The Favourite," Female perspective, exquisite halfway
","In the film, the director uses a large number of wide-angle lenses to shoot the corridors and rooms of the palace, so that the characters in the space are always in a strange and distorted environment, showing the strangeness and distortion of the aristocratic ecology. In addition, while showing the ecology of the upper nobility, the film also shows a way of thinking about women: their struggle with each other is more about jealousy and contempt for dominance dominated by emotional thinking; and the queen shows The result is a mixed image of 'feminine dominated by perceptual thinking' and 'power offenders without female thinking'-she switches between the vulnerable heartbreaker and the powerful power , Showing weakness, controlled obedience, and strong ruthlessness in taking up power after injury, as well as tangle in expelling female nobles. Regardless of what kind of political animal it becomes, women are, after all, the existence of emotional thinking and subjective emotion. This film can be said to be a thorough 'female movie'.But unfortunately, there are actually male politicians in the film-the opposition party leader tried to use Stone to probe the queen's political decision, so the script can also include political and gender-related content, and can be perfected into a film version The 'feminine perspective' possessed can also be combined with the concept of 'darling'. However, the play still stays at the level of emotional entanglement between women, and stops at 'make the level of female entanglement the most delicate', and becomes a kind of exquisiteness.",8,1,2,2 April 2020
Lawrence of Arabia," Self-identity
","The opening chapter begins with the death of Lawrence. It makes sense to make his death an opening chapter. A hero always starts with his death. The bronze statue of Lawrence was placed in St. Paul's Cathedral, and his deeds also began with this bronze statue.The beginning of the film explained the background of the big war: the Arab tribe Bedouin attacked the Turkish fortress, and a war was about to begin. When Lawrence received this news, there was a classic picture-Lawrence extinguished the match with his bare hands. This picture has an indelible effect on the entire film and the personality traits of Lawrence. When William Porter asked about the mystery, Lawrence replied: 'The secret is not to care about pain.'Lawrence is such a person who doesn't care about the pain. At that time, another officer, Mike George Berhart, said to Lawrence, 'You will always be in trouble once, but only flesh and blood.' Yes, looking at the whole movie Lawrence wanted to join the racial independence and national independence of Arabia as an ordinary person. He doesn't care about the pain, he has the will to fight and lead the people to win the war, but he is always an ordinary person. All of his composition is nothing but flesh and blood. He will always be in trouble. The 'outbreak' mentioned here may be what Lawrence called 'outbreak' as a historical tragedy.Then let's take a closer look at the embodiment of the tragedy of Lawrence in the whole movie. What I want to say most is the part of death and self-identification. Of course, the entire film as an epic work also talked about politics, survival, ethnicity and even some gay themes. But I will focus on the few deaths of Lawrence's experience and the destruction of his self-identity.The background of the character given to Lawrence in the film is that he is an illegitimate child, which is not consistent with history. The addition of such a background to the film provides a reasonable internal explanation for Lawrence and his heroic feats to a certain extent. That's why Lawrence wanted to gain personal respect for his identity as an illegitimate child as an officer did in Arabia to seize national independence for the Arab people. After arriving in Arabia, the first problem Lawrence faced was national identity. Lawrence broke through this disagreement through the death of the first person. This story happened when Lawrence entered the Bedouin tribe and they wanted to attack Akbar from behind. On the way, an Arab fell off the camel, and Lawrence turned around to rescue him despite the obstruction of everyone. You have to know that if there is no strong sense of direction and a coincidence with fate in the desert, he will never come back. But Lawrence did. When Lawrence returned to Bedouin, he said: 'Nothing is destined.' But it was also the Arab who was rescued, Lawrence fired the first shot. This is because the Arab killed another tribe, Lawrence needed to use his death to calm the conflict between the two tribes. Otherwise, the military operations against Akaba will be lost. So this life saved by him was eventually killed in his hands. The first death was that he entered Arabs as an Englishman in search of ethnic identity.The second death was his servant in Arabia. When Lawrence led the two tribes to capture Aqaba, he needed to report the news to the British army and obtain their military supplies, so he needed to cross the desert. During the crossing, one of his servants, Du De, was buried in the desert because of the quicksand. When he arrived in Cairo, he met the British generals in Arab costumes. So we can think of this death as Lawrence wants to be recognized by Britain.Later, his other servant, Faraki, could not be transferred with the troops because of the detonation tube. Lawrence ended his life with a pistol. So far, the two servants whom Lawrence first knew to take care of his life were killed. But Lawrence's identity as an Arab leader was not recognized by these tribes. When the Damascus campaign was finally launched, Lawrence picked up a pistol and shot the Turks. At the same time, the faith he held in his heart, the respect for life was also shot by him. He shot this time to enable the Arabs to personally recapture their capital. He wanted to integrate into the Arab tribe to gain their spiritual identity, not identity. But in the end, the government still did not recognize him, and he left just as he had just arrived in Arabia.We looked back, when Lawrence was sent to Dyden, Arabia, and he said, 'Great things start from a very small beginning.' Lawrence led the Arabs to national independence. This great event was sent to him Arab started from Lawrence's desire to gain his personal approval. Similarly, we can say that the Arab Revolution started with every spiritually independent Arab. This film has created a hero and a tragic hero. Lawrence led the Arabs before Allenby launched the battle to seize the capital Damascus, but this provisional Arab government he establishedLawrence could not be truly recognized. The tragedy also lies in the fact that for this battle and for the final result, he personally shot the beliefs he insisted on. So at the beginning of the film, Lawrence drove a motorcycle and died in a car accident on a country road. It is precisely the way of death in this tragedy.Lawrence is a hero or an ordinary man. His death made a conclusion about his life.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
City of God," Human Purgatory
","In the 'Cidade de Deus' where principles and good and evil are lost, the real harm to children is not poverty and gangsters, but the complete loss of opportunities to establish normal values.

In the 1960s, adult citizens of the City of God provided refuge to the 'Juvenile Trio' of looting. In the 1970s, they also actively participated in Xiao Qiao 's drug trafficking network.

Avengers: Infinity War," 10 years of finale work
","This is a reversal of the previous two 'Avengers', this time obviously did not complete a story, but left the suspense. The broken relationship between Captain America and Iron Man has not been eased by the coming of the Bully. Just because of frequent patronage, it seems to work hard to protect the earth together. From this point, it is not difficult to see that Marvel is still worried about the separation between the American elite society and the grassroots society. However, due to the second generation of Thor, the desolate god, it is not ugly to let the Avengers split. But on the whole, the Avengers in this work did not play as a whole, but divided into two teams to fight each other, which also led to the destruction of the bully.Judging from the battles in this work, Thor, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and even Black Panther still play a larger role. Here, we see the role of the Avengers 'elite' alliance, and the role of the Avengers 'grassroots' alliance is mainly in the sensational and clear soldiers.Raytheon, as the second generation of the desolate god, has experienced the tragic situation of his girlfriend running away, the whole family dying, and his home destroyed. The son of Odin, who was once reckless and arrogant, after having no father and no weapons, after cleaning the lead, finally took on the name of Thor, and he was relentlessly looking for the opportunity for revenge, and he was almost Succeeded. Every hero may be carrying a tragic past. But by being unyielding and tenacious, he eventually became a hero. The image of Thor in this work is quite perfect, even surpassing the traditional Captain America. This also expresses the director's expectations of the 'elite' with Thor in the background. Iron Man Tony actually wanted to be a dad, perhaps because of his love for Spider-Man. Let him realize that he is no longer, that young master who can do whatever he wants. The life of the rich second generation born with the golden key has also experienced inhuman suffering. Under the bright appearance, it is still full of danger and fear. He is thinking about all the time, what a powerful alien army will bring to the earth. It is this sense of responsibility and care for his juniors that made him have no hesitation in the face of the onslaught. It is also the closest time they have collided with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man. Unfortunately, the restless Star Lord broke everything. This is not to blame the recklessness of Xingjue, after all, he is not yet a good commander, or just a restless big boy.On the other hand, Captain America, a 'traditional hero', can be said to be pitiful in this film. It has not shown its previous command role, and has also published too many exciting words. Perhaps Marvel wanted to weaken the American team's role in order to attract more young audiences, or it may be to pave the way for subsequent heroes. On the whole, this hero who has been in a position to 'treat the crime' has not been vindicated, and the mainstream will inevitably not promote a 'criminal' too much. The role player Chris Evans may also give up playing the role in the future, all of which have led to the marginalization of the role of Captain America in the film. To say that the most outstanding in this work, there is no doubt that the villain tyrants. This wise man pursuing the so-called 'balance' seems interested in the slaughter. Of course, every villain must have a set of philosophical theories. This time it is the so-called master control of the collapse of the world and the response to the exhaustion of resources. Marvel's classic villains always like to use these 'strongman tyrants'. They are ruthless, crazy, and overbearing. This tyrant is no exception. Not only did the Hulk Hulk stay down, but he also adopted his daughter Kamora as the material for the sacrifice. Destroyer relies on his hard-working style, without alliances and without any effective assistants, he has gathered 6 gems and opened his fingers. Still under the layers of siege of the Avengers, escaped dashingly. Facing the ideal sunset, he showed a fatherly smile. The Avengers met the strongest opponent. It seems so impeccable, especially after winning the wish, it should be matched with the song 'How Lonely is the Invincible' to reflect his status as the boss of the rivers and lakes.But when we look back, he is indeed lonely. No one understands his so-called mission and responsibility, and no one supports it. In particular, his carefully cultivated daughter 'Kamora' became the person who hated him the most. I do n't know if I should call him an 'idealist' or an ambitious person. After deciding to give up his daughter 's life, this figure with contradictions in his heart will inevitably go further and further on the path of the husband. And if a person has the right to destroy with a single finger, the general life of the universe. How should he manage himself? The bully used people's emotions to get pieces of gems. From the beginning, Rocky, who wanted to protect his brother, to Kamora, who wanted to protect his sister, and Dr. Strange, who wanted to protect Iron Man, and the Scarlet Witch, who wanted to protect Vision. Any one of them, the heart of the heart, the dream of tyrants to collect gems, may be broken. But anyone can make mistakes, and the protection of family and friends cannot be regarded as complete mistakes. It's just that ordinary people will not be shameless and use their emotions to make transactions. Perhaps when you use emotions to make transactions, you are not far away from the achievements of bullying.The movie stopped abruptly after the destruction of half of the entire universe. Leaving us a bit of a question, such as whether Iron Man and Captain America will join forces? For example, can those people who disappeared eventually be resurrected? Another example is why Dr. Strange would surrender to the Iron Man, and surrender the gem of time? Can even Dr. Benny become the Hulk? All these questions, like the last egg, are full of reverie. But in the face of such a huge market, Marvel is bound to earn more eyeballs and money. This work can be said to have jumped out more successfully. Before that, there were concerns about 'superhero' fatigue. I believe that before the end of this tyrant series story, fans will still have a very high enthusiasm for the Marvel series, so let us wait and see.In the end, 'Avengers 3' as the finale of Marvel's 10 years, fully reflects the unparalleled advantages of the American film industry. These American-style 'superheroes' help the United States promote their 'American-style culture' around the world. But thinking about it in depth, what is the difference between this so-called spread and the tyrant? After all, a diverse world is a beautiful world. Any civilization and culture has its own opportunity to choose its own existence. But the aggression displayed by American culture makes people shudder. Therefore, if China wants to maintain its own autonomy, it must produce its own superhero to fight against the possible invasions. Of course, this first step may still be a reference.",8,1,2,13 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," a lot of interesting little details
","What do you think about when you think about Hollywood in the'60s? A Raucous, fast-paced Promo, a big star interview, is the beginning of the film. And, of course, the vibrant American Spirit, the perpetual parties, the strobe lights, the car radio, the spinning gramophone, the Vanity Fair, the human connection... in Quentin's eyes, Hollywood was as expansive and inclusive as the West, on the surface, there is a bleak human nature, complex emotional interweaving, everyone can pursue the dream of film. Quentin tells the story of a 'making a Western' , using fan material and the story of a movie Dream Star and his stunt driver to piece together the old Hollywood dream of a Western's texture and spirit. It was as if he was using nostalgia to express his dissatisfaction with the state of Hollywood. 'This is Hollywood, ' he shouted with unrestrained emotion. 'What Are you devils up to?

Later, according to the clues on the scene, it was found that it was not an ordinary disappearance, but more like a murder. Husband.Then the husband also began to understand that his wife was not really missing, but a bureau set up to frame himself, in order to revenge himself for cheating.The wife thought that the layout would be seamless, but encountered a thief halfway and took away all the money. Because it was to create the reason why she was murdered, she could not turn to others, so she sent a message to her predecessor to let him help her. At the same time, in order to wash away evidence that was not good for him, he began to create a good husband image on TV shows. The wife has always been following the news through the media. When she saw her husband say something, she was a little touched. She wanted to go back to her husband again, so she set up another bureau and framed her predecessor. Suddenly appeared in front of her husband. When the police asked what was going on, his wife used super high IQ to direct the evidence of the murder that framed her husband to the predecessor.

Although the husband knew all the secrets of the wife, there was no evidence and the wife could not be convicted. In the end, he could only come back with his wife and play a good relationship.After watching this drama, I really feel that the heroine is too terrible! Maybe every woman who faces derailment will have the urge to kill her husband, but this series of layouts of the heroine feels more black than the degree of murder . Let her husband go to jail. When he knows all this, he will always be condemned by conscience in the prison. It is far superior to killing him directly. All of the layout is also due to her being a talented student at Harvard. So, reading more books is very useful!There is a line in the film that I like very much. It feels really about the state of modern marriage

The Theory of Everything," 'Prove with an elegant equation that time has a starting point'-the movie 'The Theory of Everything'
","The film tells Hawking's experience from his youth to the publication of 'A Brief History of Time' in the form of a biography. His relationship with his wife serves as the main line of the story, satisfying people's curiosity and prying eyes, and also revealing a beautiful but regretful love.'I have loved you.I did my best.'The story starts in Cambridge in 1963. Hawking and partner Brian are racing bicycles on the street. The two came to a secret tavern at the end of the cycling race and pushed open the wooden door, which was filled with young people who were listening to songs. Here, Hawking met his later wife Jane for the first time.The two exchanged physics on the stairs.-'What does the cosmologist believe in'-'What do you believe in?' Uses a unified equation to explain everything in the universe.-'is it'-'Yes'-'What equation''The problem is here' This question is very good, I don't know yet, but I want to study it 'They exchange contact information, meet in the game hall, and participate in dance parties as each other's partners. They enjoy every day like ordinary lovers. In the conversation, the difference in belief between the two was also reflected. Hawking is an atheist. Religion believes in miracles, but miracles and science often cannot coexist. And Jane is a devout believer, and God is one of her spiritual pillars. Such a contradiction of faith has also become one of the fuse of their end of marriage.At Cambridge University, Hawking was recognized and admired by his mentors and classmates with his extraordinary ability.Unfortunately, after a coma, Hawking was diagnosed with a rare amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and was told by the doctor that there were only two years of life left. However, Jane did not leave him. .In a conversation with Hawking's father, Jane faced Hawking's father's rational advice and said, 'I don't think I'm very strong, but I love him and we must fight together.'The couple's married life is beautiful but full of challenges. As the three children grew older, Jane's life pressure also increased, she had to take care of the whole family alone, while studying for a doctorate.In the choir of St. Mark's Church, she meets Jonathan Jones, a kind and passionate man. Gradually, Jones and Hawking's family moved closer and closer, and in close contact, Jane and Jones developed a romantic friendship. Hawking was keenly aware, but reluctantly accepted the reality because he felt that his wife and the family needed help. And Jane and Jones strive to maintain friendship in order not to let broken families continue to be broken.After the pneumonia was cured, Hawking lost his ability to speak, and the heavy pressure of life forced Jane to come to the nanny Elaine. The arrival of Elaine became a special part of Hawking 's monotonous life. He showed humor in front of Elaine and never before Jane after getting sick. They wrote books together and read the magazine 'Loft' together. Elaine helped him Cook everything. Hawking showed a childlike smile in front of her.This became the fuse of Hawking and Jane's marriage.'I have loved you. I did my best.' I have loved you and I did my best.At the end of the film, Hawking danced with Jane in a wheelchair. Jane was invited as an honorary partner of Hawking to accept the Queen's reception.'Your glasses are always so dirty'At the May Ball many years ago, Hawking and Jane, who did not dance, discussed physics, poetry, and religion.'Do you want to be religious''I don't believe in this kind of god who controls everything''Why study medieval Spanish poetry?''Probably because ... I like to travel through time and space''At the beginning of creation, there was only heaven and earth;Chaos of the earth, no stereotypesDarkness hangs over the abyss 'I will always remember that you do n't love dancing but dancing with me. You have clear eyes under your dirty glasses. I loved you, I tried my best.We have all seen each other love each other, and we have seen each other love each other. We all tried our best.Hawking 's academic research is relatively small in the entire film. His legendary life proved the singularity theorem and the black hole area theorem of general relativity. He proposed the black hole evaporation theory and the unbounded Hawking universe model. Two basic theories-Einstein 's theory of relativity and Planck 's quantum mechanics-an important step forward. Sitting in a wheelchair, tapping the typewriter with three fingers, writing fifteen books.'We humans are nothing but advanced primates, living on a small planet, orbiting an ordinary star, there are hundreds of millions of x galaxies outside the galaxy we live in. However, since the birth of human civilization Since then, people have never stopped exploring the fundamental laws of the world. What is the boundary of the universe, there must be a special answer. But is there a more specific answer than no boundary? Similarly, there is no boundary for human potential We are all different, no matter how hard life is, you will always have your own way to shine. Life is endless, and hope is not limited. 'Hawking's life is looking for a beautiful equation to prove time and prove that the universe has no boundaries.",7,1,1,6 April 2020
Frozen," Frozen
","The film tells the story of a pair of princess sisters forced to separate and meet again. Elder sister Elsa is born with snow magic, but after she accidentally injured her sister Anna once, she had a fear of her magic and could not overcome the magic. In order not to hurt her loved ones, she hides and escapes, but this makes her heart more lonely and fearful. The lively and cheerful Anna, who is always looking for true love, always shows her the most honest side. She does not know why her sister always hides from herself. The film actually follows a classic story path-pushing misunderstandings into the abyss and then filling it with love. In fact, the emotional bond between the sisters has never disappeared. Even if they have not spoken for several years, even if the two are apart, they all firmly believe that each other still cherish each other. When Elsa ran away to the top of the snow mountain, the song 'LET IT GO' she sang pushed the film to the climax. She abandoned all her worries and worries at this moment. When she created a ladder to the top of the mountain with magic, and when a snow castle was miraculously built with the melody of music, every audience seemed to put The depression and unhappiness in life from my own mind are put aside. Let it go, let them go! Let the heart untie the shackles! In fact, Elsa created two snowmen with magic: one is the little snowman Olaf who longs for summer, and it greets Anna in the jungle; the other is A terrifying and fierce snow giant, it drove Anna out of the ice castle. Olaf was inadvertently created by Elsa and Anna when they were children. It is also a symbol of the friendship between the two people, and the Snow Giant is a manifestation of Elsa's fear and resistance to the world. It is worth mentioning that in the end, the film really fulfilled Olaf 's desire to enjoy the summer. This incredible also made every audience feel the magical power of Disney animation will dream to achieve. Aside from the digression, Olaf reminds me of the domestic animation 'Snow Child' because the snowman is always used to express friendship, and this intention can only be sublimated when it melts. The power of true love is powerful, it can wake up the cold heart, and this true love has the biggest true love besides love is affection. It seems that the film uses this as the central idea to create a warmth in ice and snow. The pursuit of true feelings and the pursuit of warmth, even Olaf is also dreaming of the happy scene in the summer, such creative imagination abounds Yes. The warm and true love praised by the film is also in line with our modern world view. Human nature is kind. Many of the coldness and hypocrisy hidden in the heart are passively imposed, but they are ultimately dominated by themselves. Those souls stationed in the body tacitly guide our words and deeds. Love, emotion, kindness, truth, each element is part of the composition of the soul, it can change the environment in which we live and affect the space in which we live. Let love more every day, we will live happier and warmer every day , The environment in which we live will change as we please.",8,1,2,7 April 2020

","Freedom is to have a kind of expectation and hope for human nature, that is, to believe that heaven is not elsewhere, it is in our hearts.
The story takes place in Berlin, East Germany in 1984. The people of East Germany are controlled by one million state secret police. The National Security Agency's eavesdropping methods control and control people's ideas like spider webs. Our male lead David is an outstanding military instructor and a ruthless inquisitor. He is savvy, rigorous and meticulous in his tasks. He also has in-depth research on criminal psychology.

Good Will Hunting," Non-yoke
","It is not a tragic movie, but it makes people tearful; it is not a friendship movie, but it makes people yearn for true friendship; it is not a psychology documentary, but it makes us think about the general psychological predicament of contemporary people. .The movie, like its name, can salvage the softest part of the human heart, just like Professor Rambo told Will over and over again, it tells us: a lot of things, not your fault.People who are intelligent and sensitive in their hearts are good at creation and accumulation at the same time. In Will's heart, too much bitterness accumulated, first abandoned by his parents, and then sent to foster care four times, three of which were severely abused. The broken childhood shaped the sensitivity in his character. He used the harshest words to ridicule the world, but he did not want to open his heart to the person he loved.As Gu Chengshi wrote, 'In order to avoid the end, you avoid all the beginning.' In order to prevent others from touching the scars deep in his heart, he refused the treatment of the psychologist. This separation between the subconscious and others from the very beginning makes him not believe that his girlfriend, Scella, really loves herself.Accepting your own imperfections can reap the inner lightness; embracing the incomplete past can open a brand new future. It is often impossible to predict in advance who we meet in life, but who we establish contact with depends on ourselves.No one can be flawless, Jia Pingwa said: 'The genius has its strengths and weaknesses, and his weaknesses are extremely short. The peacock also exposes his butt when it is most beautiful.' But who we choose to let us enter our world is to allow others to come in through their own cracks and defects. The mind should not be a shackle, but a key to open each other.But Will is lucky. Beside him, there is a mentor called Shane, who told Will: 'It is those small flaws that make you meet the right person.' Everyone has some small flaws, which people call 'imperfect.' 'But Shane said, '' It is them who choose to let us enter our world. 'Therefore, perhaps none of us need to be disturbed by the intimate relationship being established. You are not perfect, but some people are willing to accept your imperfections unconditionally, and you are perfect for each other.",8,0,0,1 May 2020
Room," Room with only one skylight
","An irritable woman, a little 'girl' with very long hair, a messy room, just some food that can only be eaten. Opening a movie without reading the introduction, to be honest, I have a lot of prejudices. At that time I wondered why she didn't take her children out, why did she have to rely on that man to have food, is it not good for self-reliance? Look, without knowing it, I arbitrarily assert.
Fortunately, curiosity suppressed my irritability, wondering when she would take the child out, when she could live on her own, and continue to watch the movie with my prejudices. When I really saw the iron gate and the little skylight, I woke up. It's not that she didn't want to go out, but that she fell into real hell. The life in captivity forced her to only dream with her children. For seven years, I could not imagine how she persevered. She used her efforts to create a normal childhood for her children, using necklaces made of eggshells and patterns made of cardboard to let children read and watch TV. Finally determined to let the child understand the truth, because the child could not accept them for a while, they had a strong dispute and had a cold war for a while. Pretending to be sick, pretending to die, and constantly training, the child finally had the opportunity to be taken out of the wooden shed as a 'corpse'.
Mother kept telling the child to crawl out of the rolled blanket and jump out of the car after the car stopped. When he met the first person, he asked for help. Before the age of 5, he had never seen a third person, thinking that those on TV were fake, and everything in nature was fake, because his pet dog was also fake. When his mother tells him the truth of this world, he needs to identify the true and false of people and animated people. They were finally reborn and saved. A 17-year-old girl was imprisoned for seven years. Is such a person worthy of being called a person? In a straightforward manner, the evil in this world goes far beyond this. And the movie did not end after they were saved. Life is not the perfect ending, so it can end. In seven years, everything outside requires her to accept and adapt again. Everything around will not stop because of her disappearance, time will not stop because of her disappearance. Holding a photo album to see friends at that time, their lives are still the same, this is the biggest blow to her. I can't understand that when they were interviewed, the host repeatedly forced her to recall the past, and still questioning why she didn't release her child for freedom earlier. I have a hard time understanding how it is a fault to depend on each other to survive. In that situation, all her methods are not wrong. This is not measured by right or wrong, no one can truly empathize. The fact that the authorities are obsessed with bystanders is not just a warning to those in it. Isn't there a warning to be onlookers? It is wrong that your sobriety does not mean that the person who is truly experienced. What we lack is not only empathy, but also a sobriety of being self-righteous.
Fortunately, they finally said goodbye to the room and really came out. Maybe this shadow is difficult to erase in this life, maybe in many midnight dreams, waking up in a trance. Fortunately, they were finally saved. I thought it was just my mother who said that he was a boy in order to protect the child. As a result, he was a real boy, a brave man.
The disparity in strength has made women, children and the elderly naturally belong to the disadvantaged groups. How to protect themselves has actually been talked about a lot, but there is little education for the truly powerful. I hope that each mother can do her best to cultivate a real man, not a murderer with a decent appearance.",8,0,0,5 April 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Soul poisoned by the Lord of the Rings
","In the play, Smick is a typical image, depicting an image that benefits from the eternal life of the Lord of the Rings and is poisoned by the Lord of the Rings. His friend picked up the Supreme Lord of the Rings while fishing. He killed his friend in order to snatch the Lord of the Rings, and he may have been bewitched by the Lord of the Rings from the beginning. In the next 500 years, he was continuously poisoned by the Lord of the Rings. Half of the soul had its own original shadow, and half of it was completely dark thinking. He was controlled by the Lord of the Rings and severely tortured by Sauron to reveal the whereabouts of the Lord of the Rings, making Shire and Baggins dangerous. He took Frodo, who had the Lord of the Rings, as his master, and when he was unable to snatch, he would guide them to the magic capital. On the way, he provoked Frodo and Sam's relationship, and introduced Frodo into the spider hole, in danger. When Frodo planned to destroy the Supreme Lord of the Rings, he stepped forward and snatched it. Finally, with the heart of the heart, the Lord of the Rings merged into the magma.This is a very unique character. By portraying such an image and deeds that have been in close contact with the Supreme Ring for 500 years, people can feel the horror influence of the ring. Make a good footnote for the main line of destruction of the Lord of the Rings.The film is rich in imagination, tree spirits, monsters of various races, elf queen, king, princess, dwarf kingdom, dragon.Very good movie.",9,1,1,12 April 2020
The Elephant Man," Mixed feelings
","The doctor later wondered if he and the circus boss were the same kind of person, but he changed the place of detention into a ward, and still used elephants as objects in the exhibition to meet his professional needs? The doctor does profit from it. After all, Xiangren is a rare medical record in medical history, but the doctor 's profit is not based on Xiangren 's pain. He is trying his best to help Xiangren. This is him and the circus. The boss is different. I do n't think this is a hypocritical kindness. It is normal for people to pursue their personal interests. The so-called kindness is not to sacrifice oneself, so the cost is too high and unsustainable, as long as you can make profits while you can Just hurt others and try your best to help others. I don't think there is any need for cleanliness in moral matters, nor does it need not be selfless.
It is said that this is an adaptation of a real event. I even think that for Xiangren, birth is painful, and what he carries is the real original sin, and I will always pay for things that are not caused by myself. Moreover, although it is a bit murky to say this, I believe that many people who sympathize with elephants will be the first to feel unhappy and hope that he will return to this tragedy if he can really become ordinary.In fact, if I see a person like a person in reality, I dare not say that I will not be afraid and disgusted. I think this is actually normal, but I will not let these emotions show, but take one In an attitude of equality and respect, he communicates with him. I feel that morality does not have to overly blame the self, but it should try its best to prevent the self from revealing and harming others. This is civilization.Xiangren is looking at the demon mirror to see what kind of demons and ghosts are in the bones of gentle gentlemen.In addition, the two starring John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are really unrecognizable without looking at the cast.

Amadeus," God's darling
","The life of a genius described by Mozart's 'enemy', but the genius is not a rival. This Austrian court musician, who led the genius to the road of destruction, has always regarded Mozart's work as 'God of God'. The person who 'sounds' is also the one who can most appreciate and understand Mozart's music.The person who knows you best is your enemy. This is a genius and a necessity for most people.I think that people who can be called 'geniuses' are definitely people who are beyond the time of the time and are not understood by most people. So instead of saying that Mozart was destroyed by Sayeri, it is better to say that this is the fate of genius not understood by the world. However, we found that Mozart, like a child, is particularly easy to manipulate.The three-hour film focuses on the peak 10 years of Mozart 's creation in Venus and the last 10 years of his life.

Call Me by Your Name," Blue Sky
","This is the most sensational movie I have seen in the recent past, and I recommend everyone to watch it alone.After watching it, I can't calm my emotions for a long time. It is not the kind of emotions that can be released. It is very vague and difficult to express with words. This feeling is wonderful. As if you were close to them, and surrounded them like a transparent person, and experienced that unforgettable summer together. In those days, Elio was blessed to have such enlightened parents, because in that relatively feudal era, in the face of such a special relationship, it took more than love and courage.When you are truly immersed in this story, you will feel that Elliot is like every adolescent teenager. The careful temptation between love and love and sex will be attracted by the shining people and be moved by him. . What deserves to be treasured is the purity of love, the simplicity of love. In this short summer of love, Oliver is at the relatively rational end. In a sense, Elio loves Oliver more than Oliver loves Elio. The long shot at the end of the film says it all.I have to say that summer in Italy is really attractive. Sunlight, villages, bicycles, fields, creeks, peaches, guitars, pianos, it seems like all the beautiful things in summer. Play guitar and compose in the shade, swim in the creek, ride a bicycle on the field road, drink soda on the roadside seat, read books, and wait for winter to come together. It couldn't be more romantic.Nothing feels more profound than these words of elio's father:
'When you were most caught off guard, God slyly found our most vulnerable place. You just have to remember that I am here. Now you may not want to feel anything, maybe you never want to feel anything, or maybe you are not willing Pour these things to me, but please feel what you feel. You have had a wonderful friendship, maybe beyond friendship, and I envy you. In my opinion, most parents would like all this to disappear and pray for them. The child let go, but I am not such a parent. In order to heal quickly, we stripped ourselves of too many things, so that at the age of thirty, our relationship was bankrupt. Every time a new relationship begins, we can give The less it is. But in order to keep myself from feeling and not feeling, how wasteful. I may have approached, but I have never owned what you have. There is always something blocking or blocking me. How? Living your life is your own business, you just have to remember that God gives our mind and body only once. And before you realize, your heart You are exhausted. As for your body, one day, no one wants to look at it again, and no one wants to approach. Now, you are full of sadness, pain, don't let these pains disappear, and don't lose the happiness you feel . 'These words apply not only to love between the same sex, but also to love between the opposite sex. The way to spend your life is up to you. Let it cry when you want to be sad, and laugh when you want happiness. You have the right to love someone, as long as it is reasonable and legal, no one is entitled to interfere. Same-sex love or heterosexual love is in essence the love of a person, love is not right or wrong. As spectators, we should respect each individual's right to pursue their own happiness.",9,1,3,3 April 2020
Gran Torino," Ambitious
","Do you wonder who I am? I can also tell you that I am a retired veteran who does not like people and only sweeps the snow in front of my house.I am swearing, cynical, and eccentric. I hate all the people around me, so I have few friends. I look down on this increasingly hypocritical world and I cannot forgive myself.I used a gun to intimidate the Miao gangsters: 'Killed you, I went home and slept like a baby.' But after the war, I was often awakened by nightmares, and the corpses of the hands and things on the battlefield flashed from time to time.The two sons who drove the Japanese car were not close to me, and now my wife was gone. The only one who accompanied me was a medal and a classic car. By the way, I also kept a dog. They are all for the rest of my life.I thought my distressed year would be so dusty, but the newly moved neighbor gave me another way of living. After the US troops withdrew from Vietnam, many Miao people fled to the United States, and this family is one of them.The Miao girl, Su Neng, is very eloquent and speaks fluent English. I met her. She led me to visit her people, they are simple, clean and speak the mysterious Eastern language. When they saw me as a white man, they looked natural, polite and polite. Of course, they also have their own beliefs, which seems out of place with me as a Christian.Boy Tao showed inferiority. He was encouraged by the Miao tribe to steal my classic car. After the incident was revealed, I was punished by a volunteer to work for me, but I never thought that he and I would become good friends. I encouraged him to take the initiative in pursuing girls, for which I generously lent out the classic car that pulls the wind. I asked him to follow me to learn the dialogue between men and understand the balance between politeness and atmosphere. I told him which repair tools are necessary. Under my recommendation, he found his first job in life and became a modern worker.Someone said: 'Everyone will have a strange old man in his life. Only when you touch him will you find that he has so many stories.'I trusted him, so I started telling Tao my story, from war, faith, family, to being a man, and even repairing household appliances. He is also willing to listen.Tao gradually became more confident, and at the same time, the assault of the bad guys became more reckless. Finally, after I warned one of the bigwigs, they swept the home of Tao and me with a machine gun, and Su was raped without a human face.'It's time to end this battle.' I think.On the day of the incident, I took care of my own affairs, smoking for the first time in the house, asking someone to shave me for the first time, wearing a suit for the first time ... I did something that I was 'shame' thing.I even went to the 27-year-old virgin priest who was over-educated as a 'son'.'Father bless me, I am guilty. In 1968, at the Christmas party in the factory, I kissed Betty Jablensky. Dorothy was with other women in another room, and I kissed. I sold a small boat and a motorboat and made 900 yuan. I did n't pay taxes. It was the same as theft. In the end, I was not very close to my two sons. I do n't understand them. I do n't know why. That 's all. They have kept me at rest forever. 'Everyone can see that I am perfunctory and perfunctory the priest. Forgive me. This is the first confession, and of course the last.In the end, Tao, who had planned to go to revenge with me, was locked up by me. He was full of anger, but when I told him about the murderous feeling, he hesitated and his eyes were full of fear.I told him: 'My hands are stained with blood, I have been defiled.' This must be done by me alone.In the middle of the night, I came downstairs alone. They looked at me ready to go, and I looked at them without fear.I insulted them, despised them, and pointed at them with gesture guns.I also ate the cigarette leisurely, and then reached out to touch the lighter in my chest, and they loaded it up cautiously.Suddenly, I quickly pulled my hand out and took out the 'gun', but their gun was faster, dozens of bullets passed through my body, and I fell backwards and died.I pulled out the most beautiful gun in the world, but died under the most ugly gun in the world.I pulled out the gun in the most popular way of the era, but ended my life in the most ordinary way.If someone asks me now why I always see dissatisfaction in my eyes? I will tell him because I hope my country is better.If someone asks me now why my eyes are always full of vicissitudes? I will tell him because of my deep love for this land.",7,0,0,8 May 2020
Coco," Dreams are to be pursued, and family members are to be guarded
","I originally thought this was a cartoon to pursue my dreams, but on the way to my dreams, I saw the greatness of family.
The beginning tells about a Mexican boy Miguel. People here sing and dance, but their home is an exception.All this stems from Miguel's great-grandfather. In the past, he abandoned his wife, Miguel's great-grandmother, in pursuit of musical dreams, which made her very sad, and since then great-grandmother has banned any music in the family.But Miguel inherited his great-grandfather's gene for music. He secretly imagined that he would one day become an famous musician like an idol Cruz.
On the day of the Mexican Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally entered the world of the undead. In this world, he saw his long-dead ancestors. In order to get guidance on the road to realize the dream of music, Miguel decided to go to find his Idol Cruz's undead, he found his great-grandfather,I don't want them to be sent to a big pit by Cruz.
In fact, many years ago, his great-grandfather and Kreuz were a pair, and they wrote many songs.For his musical dream, he stayed away from his wife and daughter. One day, his great-grandfather missed his daughter very much, so he resolutely decided to go back. It was useless to keep Kruze, so he took a glass of poisoned wine, poisoned his great-grandfather, and wrote all the music composed by his great-grandfather. According to his own, became a world-renowned musician.
Seeing the film here, I think the plot is a bit bloody. I was also worried about their future because if the boy did n't go back before dawn, the boy would die.Suddenly a big cat with wings and his great-grandmother appeared in the sky. The great-grandmother burst into tears and asked him why he had abandoned her and her daughter. She hadn't waited for him all her life. The little boy said that when his great-grandfather wanted to go back Killed by that Kruz, he always wanted to go back, he loved this family. The great-grandmother finally forgave him with tears.The little boy and great-grandfather were rescued. But the photo was still in Kruz's hands. They decided to look for the photo and had a desperate fight with Kruzi, but the photo fell into the water unfortunately, and the great-grandfather was dying.If no one remembered him in this world, he would disappear in the underworld. The great-grandfather felt that his daughter was about to gradually forget him. The sky was almost dawn, and the little boy felt despair because he could not save his great-grandfather. Blessing to the little boy, the little boy returned to the world.He thought he must save his great-grandfather, so he found his grandmother and tried to awaken her memory. He sang a song on the guitar and I still remember you. Grandma Grandma remembered his dad and took out a corner of the broken photo, recalling that beautiful childhood. The great-grandfather can finally survive in the undead world and reunite with his family in another world.I think death is not a farewell, forgetting is. Some people remember you, you still have concerns in your heart, this is the great happiness and meaning of alive.After watching this movie, I understood some truths. When we were young, we did n't want to go the path paved by our family. Those who once stumbled wanted to pursue their dreams. But in the end it was found that family reunion is the happiest. In the world, relying on blood ties, they often deduce family stories that are both happy and sad.The shorter and shorter is life, the deeper and deeper is family, the less and less is time, and the farther and farther is a dream, I saw the once rebellious me in this movie, once desperate If you want to break away from your parents' arrangement, disregard the world's fetters, and pursue your dreams, you'd rather choose to climb to the finish point instead of being helped by someone to reach the finish line. I think that dreams are to be pursued, but family members should also be guarded.",8,0,0,26 April 2020
1917," some observation
","My friend introduced me to the film, and stressed that I should pay attention to feel the shooting skills and expression of the end of a shot. And I did. And followed the messengers on their mission. I'm thankful that the director and the photographer used different angles and scenes. It goes up and down. Give me a chance to catch my breath and balance my cerebellum. Some of the shots really dazzled me, especially the quick frontal shots. I can't keep up. But my millennials love it. Movies are like video games. It was fun. Maybe it was because I couldn't focus on the visual effects to get the feel of the scene, so the plot was dragged down. I'm not impressed. I don't think some of the plot lines make sense. What is this story really about? The cruelty of war? The goodness of humanity and the hope of peace? Then can you paint the plot more deeply and reasonably. Let me be able to 'empathize'",9,0,2,31 March 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Hope there is no war in the world
","War is always a heavy topic.Orphans, prisoners of war, and worldly relationships, and the relationship between people can also make absurdity normal, cruelness normal, and selfish, greedy, indifferent, indifferent, and merciless because of this special background. I always think that comics and animations are not as prejudiced as the current Chinese society, but only for children. These do not require real-life interpretation, but some animated characters interwoven with lines and colors. It is often easier to portray a world that is more profound and cold than real-life participation, and this form is also easy to express. For the author, but also for the audience. The details in the animation are vivid. The departure of the mother, the selfishness of the relatives, the survival of the siblings, and the operation of the society are all so natural. I mean what happened is so reasonable and orderly. The death of the mother did not overwhelm the brother, and the aunt told the sister the truth of the mother 's death, but the brother 's tears burst into tears; the death of the sister made the brother tired of life and suicide, and when he learned that the father in the war had failed, the brother 's last hope The foundation stone also collapsed, although the castle full of memories of previous life has long since crumbled. He walked so naturally, against the background of the re-development of the city and the country, because the superior or the countless dead souls under the wheel of fate.The first time I was depressed for an afternoon because of an animation.",8,0,0,24 April 2020
Brave," A little bit after feeling
","When the incident began, Melida got a bow and arrow from her father as a king, but her mother as a queen did not agree with the gift from the king to Melida. She thought that Melida as a princess should be a lady. Here is the story It has buried the contradictions behind Melida and the queen. After receiving the gift from the king, Melida accidentally shot the arrow into the depths of the forest. Melida saw the whispering elf during the search for the arrow and led Melida to find the arrow and go home. Road, but after Melida saw the king and queen, they encountered a bear monster, and the bear monster was the main clue to the unfolding of the following story.As soon as the picture turned, a vast and rich coastal country appeared in our sight. The picture was very exquisite, showing us the beauty and strength of a country. A beautiful girl with curly red hair appeared in the picture, which was Melida when she grew up. From here, the story also shows us the contradiction between the queen and Melida. The queen hopes that her daughter should be a princess of a country. Be able to understand etiquette, speak without stage fright, behave decently, eat too much food, and learn skills should not be archery. But from Melida 's weapons and her resistance to the Queen 's preaching, she can be seen as a free-spirited girl who loves freedom and has some rebelliousness. She has her own ideas but lacks thoughtfulness. The queen is a representative of observance of etiquette, noble and elegant but also humorous. I like Queen Eleanor very much, thinking about her children, protecting them, and teaching Melida about life, but she also has many The common problem of adults is that they do not understand the child's resistance and rebellion. The way to deal with it is also lack of communication. Forcing my own love for the child but not thinking whether the child can understand the parent's I am for your good love. It is precisely because of this misunderstanding that the contradiction between Melida and the queen reached its peak after the queen arbitrarily recruited Melida. Melida was furious that the queen had laid down a route for her future without telling herself, but Melida still compromised with the queen and met the king and the queen who came to the kingdom. The eldest son brought by the lord. But Melida did not find her favorite person in the lord 's eldest son, so she defeated all the suitors in the archery competition in the back. Melida thought that she proved that she was more excellent than the suitors. You can refuse this recruitment, but the queen is angry about Melida 's behavior, and the princess of a country is angry at the impoliteness of the guests and beyond Melody 's behavior. When Melida thought her behavior was correct and the queen thought that her daughter had lost the princess style and did not give the guest a face, the conflict between the two broke out completely, and Melida cut the queen's office with a sword The embroidery of the family portrait, and the queen threw Melida 's favorite bow and arrow into the fire in her fright. Both the behavior of Melida and the queen deeply hurt each other, but there is a detail here, Melly Dar was unbelievable after seeing his bow and arrow burned, and fled the palace, and the queen regretted deeply after seeing her daughter running away, and quickly took out the bow and arrow burned by the fire. One is not to believe that she would treat me like this, and the other is not to believe that I actually did such a harm to her. Perhaps this is also the reason for the age and the role played.Melida met the whispering elf after leaving the palace, and led her to the witch's shop. In the witch's shop, Melida bought all the wood carvings with her necklace and exchanged a magic spell that could change the queen- A cake, another foreshadowing here, Melida did not hear the witch's attention. After returning to the palace, Melida saw her queen worried, and the queen told her that she could slow down the matter of recruiting and give Melida time to choose, but Melida did not change her mind when she heard the queen. Hou still decided to give the queen a cake. The queen thought that it was a good cake and ate it, but after feeling uncomfortable, she returned to the room and became a huge bear. Melida was frightened, but she found that this was her mother in order to find her mother to change On the way back, he took his mother to find the witch, but found that the witch had left, and if the queen had not changed back by the second sunrise, the curse would continue forever. Here Melida continued to use potions to contact the witch because she couldn't believe her mother would become a human, but when the house was blown up, the queen held Melida in her arms with the bear's body to protect her. In the following relationship, the queen gradually changed her original thoughts on Melida because she saw that Melida loved freedom and what she was good at and did not show that side to herself. Because of this change, Melida was able to tell her thoughts in front of the three lords. The lord also found that her eldest sons had the same ideas as the princess, and they wanted to pursue their true love and freedom. But when everything was better, people found the queen and mistakenly thought the queen was the bear monster who wanted to kill him. In the process of preventing the king and the lord, Melida appeared as a real bear monster. The queen stepped forward to fight the bear monster and saw it under the boulder when she saw the bear monster hurt her daughter. Because Melida repaired the embroidery and put it on the queen before coming out the next day, the queen was able to return to humanity.The ending ends with a happy reunion. The story is not so much about Melida 's bravery, but rather about the story where a mother and daughter 's conflict has been resolved, and the reason for their conflict is the lack of communication. After making mistakes, Melida worked hard to solve the mistakes she had made, and she did not escape when she was in danger. She tried to rescue her mother, and the queen stepped back to her after gradually learning the wishes of her daughter. For a mother 's love for her child, and for the mistakes made by the child, the queen is also tolerant after calming down. When facing her daughter, the queen also gradually let go of her own dignity and changed herself. Lida has to do everything she can, and she protects her without regard to danger when in danger. The name of the brave legend feels not that Melida is alone, but also the courage that Queen Eleanor is willing to change for Melida. The share of the two in the face of danger does not fade.",7,0,0,8 April 2020
The Imitation Game," A little bit of movie watching
","Regarding the advancement of the plot, the film uses three time periods to narrate the story, mainly in the period of World War II Turing cracking the password, supplemented by the student period and the middle age period. Although the three time and space switch back and forth, but the plots do not contradict each other, but instead take care of each other, the connection is very perfect. The movie begins with a mysterious monologue in the interrogation room, 'Are you paying attention to listening' 'If you don't listen carefully, it's easy to miss something' 'I won't say the second time' plus Juan Fu gloomy 'S voice, the soundtrack full of suspense colors, gave the audience a strong sense of anticipation, and this mysterious beginning certainly has a perfect correspondence with the ending.The characterization of the characters is also quite in place. Turing's game with the general during the interview for the secret position allowed us to see that although Turing spoke a little strangely, he was clever and courageous, and then gradually told the audience that Turing was a bit through the scene of the car accident between him and his partner. The out-and-out 'weird man', his own way, no one in his eyes, confusing words and deeds ... In short, in the eyes of others, it is a nasty ghost who is difficult to get along with. The story slowly reversed, gradually telling us why Turing is Turing. This process also caused people to have compassion for him. Later, the appearance of the heroine helped him get along with his partners, and it made people discover that Turing was not an annoying person, but he also liked some places. The setting of the heroine made the character characterize And the development of the plot is more reasonable. All in all, when portraying the image and character of a character, it is not only vivid, but also the reasons for the character.There are many profound topics in the film, the theme is divided into two, one is to reveal the cruelty of the war bit by bit through the process of a group of geniuses to crack the German intelligence, and trigger the audience to think about the war. When the password is deciphered, the brother of a partner will be sacrificed and the whole movie will be sublimated there, which has a profound philosophical significance. Another theme is the autobiographical narration of geniuses. 'The greater the power, the greater the responsibility.' Although this is said, but the glorious surface you see is easy to make you take for granted, but you don't know the cruelty behind the characters. Growth process. These two themes also lead to branch topics such as campus bullying, sexism, and injustice suffered by homosexuals. The various branch topics seem to be unintentional actions in the main story of the protagonist, but they are actually intentional. The time when the various branches of the topic unfolded was up to the point.",8,0,0,7 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," After feeling
","The whole story line is a story of revenge. The protagonist was killed by a killer organization when he was newly married, including even unrelated persons such as the priest and the priest's wife. But the protagonist was not killed. After spending four years in the plant form, the protagonist woke up and recalled that day, so he started his own revenge plan.The movie uses a flashback technique. The movie first tells the plot of killing the second person, then talks about how to restore consciousness, and then kills the first person. The whole movie is dominated by fighting. Almost 80% of the plot is spent in fighting, but there will be some small details revealed in the fighting, sublimating the movie.For example, when killing the brunette, the two started to fight from the moment they met, and when the daughter of the brunette came back, the two couldn't help but stopped. When the daughter of the brunette entered the door, they both put the knife away. , And then started talking about homely. The child's heart is innocent and not bloody. Although they have grudges between each other, they try not to bring them to the child. Although the protagonist was still seen by the child when he killed the brunette, he still brought the color of blood to the child's world, but the protagonist told the little girl: 'If the future hatred cannot be calmed down, I am waiting for you to take revenge. 'The protagonist 'Bill' in the movie's name, although he didn't see his face throughout, he can see Bill's evil through many details of the movie, allowing masters who don't cast murderous swords to spend a month to kill Bill Cast a new knife, talk to the blindfolded woman, etc.Finally, the film dubbing is really cool!",7,0,0,11 May 2020
The Dark Knight," Justice and demons are not absolute
","A really great hero movie. In the end, Batman changed from a hero to a chased criminal. Tears, he is not a hero, he is just a guardian. So he can be a heroic totem or a just chase.
I like the plot where the two ships test humanity. The reason why humans are humans is precisely the bottom line of humanity in our hearts. Empathy and order have not collapsed. If it collapses, we are indeed not worthy of being redeemed. At that time, we were just beasts out of order.
Batman put a sonar monitor on the people of the city, and Gordon used Rachel as a bait for justice. That is really terrifying. If one day is for absolute justice, the sacrifice needs to be taken for granted, and the killing will be carried out for peace Is this justice what we need?
Absolute justice and absolute evil are mutually reinforcing. Like a clown, he exists because Batman is too dazzling. But in fact, most of this absolutely does not exist. Both justice and evil are actually inclined. There will be no pure villains as pure as the clown, and no absolute justice. Even Batman is not absolute justice. Each of us is actually more likely to be like the ordinary people 's boat in the movie. We will have selfish desires, and there will be evil hopes that others will die, and our own living evils, but in the end, most of us in this case are actually empathetic and respectful of order.",9,0,0,11 April 2020

Until the appearance of Buzz Lightyear, this cool appearance and advanced performance toys attracted the love of the small owner. Hudi was left out, so he was jealous and jealous, and he planned to drive Buzz Lightyear away.Later, due to yin and yang, Hu Di and Buzz Lightyear both went to the outside world, and were taken away by a child who likes to abuse toys, so they went together and escaped to the little master.At first, Hu Di was very selfish, because jealousy repeatedly targeted Buzz Lightyear, and later because of his shame, after finding out that Buzz Lightyear did not die, he was eager to bring Buzz Lightyear back to show his innocence to everyone, so Both yin and yang were caught by the neighbor's children, and their feelings gradually increased during the attempt to escape, and they gradually became good friends.It is worth noting that the proud Buzz Lightyear has always firmly believed that he is a space mount police and can fly, and his mission is to protect the universe, but when he realizes that he is really just a toy as Hu Di said, and is trying Flying but broke his arm fiercely. This slow motion and soundtrack, as well as the main perspective of Buzz Lightyear's fall in the sky, the window that symbolizes the hope of freedom, is close but out of reach, he The heart is frustrated and desperate.

You see, even if you are not as dazzling as others, you still have your own sparkle.The last twenty minutes of the film are really wonderful, the rhythm is very fast, very exciting, the feeling that the two protagonists help each other and sacrifice each other is very touching, and the reversal time after time has to be amazing.In fact, there are still a lot of warm little details that touched me, and I have only written so much for the time being.",8,0,0,13 April 2020
Singin' in the Rain," Some thoughts
","Admittedly, for someone who has little contact with song and dance films, 'Singing in the rai' is still amazing to me. It is said that this film is a classic of song and dance films in film history.
From this film, you can also see the decline of silent films. The film is set in the background of Hollywood's transition from the silent film era to the sound film era. In 1927, Tang and Linna were a famous screen couple in the silent film era. With the rise of sound movies, Linna fell into a huge dilemma. Although she has a beautiful face and a plump posture, but she does not have a good voice, she is very different when making sound movies. In order to give Linna a good voice, Tang introduced Cathy to the production team and asked Cathy to voice Linna. Cathy's voice and Lina's beautiful appearance made Linna's popularity soaring; however, Linna, who was blinded, did not recognize Cathy's credit. Linna's approach caused dissatisfaction from other production staff. In a performance on the stage with the film, everyone designed Linna to be a big ugly.
I actually do n't really like singing and dancing movies. In the plot, singing and dancing always seem very lengthy, but when watching this movie, I can watch this movie peacefully with a smile, but the song and dance movie is always a decline Genre, pure song and dance films have already entered the current film in other forms and with another element. Perhaps song and dance films are no longer suitable for today's era, just like the era of Chaplin's silent films is incompatible with the current sound era. In the film, when the sound film appeared, everyone can't wait to cast into the embrace of the sound era.
However, what I want to say more is that this is Hollywood's self-deprecating work. In a fundamental sense, this is to put a movie in a movie, make a movie in a movie, and in the movie, it clearly shows us the Hollywood at that time. The way of filming can even be said to show us without scruples, the gossip and inside story of the star's life.
Of course, the classic dialogue in the film can touch my heart all the time, maybe in our fashionable words, Tang He is too provocative. In the film, although it is raining heavily, the mood is not wet, because of her, so You can sing and wander in the rain wantonly. Even though there is heavy downpour, you can gently put down the umbrella in your hand and sing in the rain wantonly!
When it comes to this, I have to talk about a personal rainy complex. Whenever it rains, I can't help but put away the umbrella in my hand and hum gently: 'I am singing in the rain'",8,0,0,29 April 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The deepest secret
","I think this is a rare movie. There are in-depth performances on such subtle and difficult-to-describe topics as consciousness and subconsciousness, but they are not fragmented and unknown. With the help of memory and sober consciousness, explore the boundaries of consciousness and subconsciousness. Even though I have fallen asleep and intend to accept the cleared myself, consciousness seems to be somewhat subjectively active. The clearing of the 'antagonism' memory in the subconscious is also in the battle between the different desires of the conscious and subconscious, and it seems to slowly understand what they really want to do.The feelings that will happen and that will happen, even if the memory is erased, because people have not changed, maybe it is destined to happen, so the feelings that will happen are also a fate. If you want to get rid of a relationship, you really need to change, maybe it is the various tendencies and habits of this 'I', otherwise when you choose, if you feel mixed with habits, you will still follow the same path. This may be why even The memory is cleared, but the characters in the film repeatedly like the same person. But the running-in of these relationships has always had such difficulties.It is an interesting plot setting to hide Clementin deeper in consciousness in order to retain her memory. This process made Joel and Cle go to his childhood and consciousness about the shame, and also learned his deepest secrets together. Here, because I want to forget, but find that I actually don't want to forget, I move towards true intimacy. My imaginary love should be nothing to hide from the other party, even because of this relationship, go to the corner of myself and the other party has never been inside.After watching this video, I shared some thoughts with my roommate s, and shared some clips of my relationship with him that I felt shame again. Some feelings that I didn't even realize were reappearing. Maybe I have been longing for intimacy from a certain angle in my heart, but in reality, the relationship with all kinds of people encountered is the same as Joel and Cle. There are vibrant parts, but there are also difficult to reconcile. Is it willing to take the next 'cooking' as the answer to finding love, it may be an open proposition, if you choose 'yes', you must accept the wonderful and coexisting compromises day after day. If it is 'no', there is no need to clear the memory.",8,0,0,28 April 2020
Once Upon a Time in America," In dreams and reality, there is no winner
","For the classics in this classic, many people will read it again and again, and I am no exception, because it is so beautiful. Looking back, I suddenly saw the man who had watched the imported film in the dim shadow hall at the foot of Snake Mountain. In a day's time, I read the full four-hour edition twice in a row, and every time I saw it, I could see new details and new discoveries and feelings.This is a great movie that I can't talk about for days and nights. I will just talk about them and them in my eyes.Noodles, a gangster that is not like a gangster, loves reading when he is alone when he is a teenager, and thinks when he is quiet, but thinking has nothing to do with money and reputation. Noodles are ordinary people with love, just like his name 'Noodles'. They are ordinary but practical, warm, soft and reliable. He loves brothers, Deborah, friends around him, the soft love of noodles and the incompatibility of a bloody and violent real environment in which he is in a strong contrast, and also makes him in the gang world There has always been tangled, contradictory, silent, unhappy. He couldn't put aside everything he cares about and truly be himself. His contradictions, weaknesses and worries, and his goalless and principleless personality doomed his tragic fate.From the time of sexual germination, the noodles were deeply obsessed with and fell in love with her friend Fatmo's sister Deborah. When the dear brother Dominic was killed, he did not hesitate to rush up and revenge for his brother. The word 'yi' took the lead, and he did not look back, completely regardless of his own safety. However, the same word 'yi' also made him in Among the only beloved women and brothers in his life, the brother was the first choice, and he put his thick emotions deeply in his heart. At this time, he is weak again. He will never declare loudly to everyone, 'Peggy, you are mine' like his brother Paihe. His character determines his destiny, and he will never invade his individual repeatedly at Max. Emotions, bottom line, principles, make any meaningful resistance or confrontation. In this way, he stepped into Max 's quagmire step by step with his brother 's contemplation for Max, and finally, before the person who did not meet Max The eyes are shining, they bring their own leadership temperament, they are brave and conscientious, they can take the little brothers to eat together, and they can read books and fall in love.In the last and only official date with Deborah, the noodles finally boldly showed their love for Deborah that they had not spoken for more than ten years. This is when Deborah went to the angel in the eyes of noodles. The goddess Deborah is so indecent, beautiful, vanity, and cold. She admits that she has always loved noodles. When she was a child, she did do things that seduce noodles because she was involuntarily. However, she also thought more clearly from beginning to end. , Her love for noodles is just a ridiculous instinct, she can not accept the existence of this instinctive desire. At the dining table, her words and words are both relentlessly pulling the distance between the two, highlighting the difference between the two, implying that she has knowledge, knowledge, pursuit and ideals, he is ignorant, vulgar, low-spirited, and chaotic. When I danced, I loved the noodles for more than ten years. I finally waited for the affectionate hug that I finally waited. I did n't feel it. I raised my head like a wood and opened my eyes. The soul was not attached. From here, anyone can see that she does n't love at all. In her arms, she does not have any attachments and feelings. Not only does she not love noodles, but also herself. The attitude towards the lingering time that is gone forever, and the noodles that have gone green, showed her ruthlessness and indifference, but the poor noodles stuck his face on the face of the only woman he loved in his life. To the indifferent and stiff face next to my ear, completely intoxicated in his love, we can probably see that this woman will not really fall in love for a lifetime? She is like a cold diamond, gorgeous, noble, but hard and cold. She proudly thinks that she and noodles are not the same kind of people in the same world at all. How could I fall in love with such a vacant boy? She was as cold as a surgical operation, excluding noodles from her life, and she announced that she was going to Hollywood to develop, leaving this non-influential person.Before breaking up, in order to show that she had no return to the noodles and loved her comfort and compensation for more than ten years, she took the initiative to kiss the sad and silent noodles around her, which made the noodles suddenly wake up. Time is like a wheel flying forward. Before a few years of love, love will soon be separated. The last parting will go for twelve years, and this time, maybe it will be a farewell. He ca n't just let Deborah go. He has the last hint of hope, fantasizing. Deborah may still have a little love and reluctance for him. Love or not love, the body is the most authentic and honest, how can noodles not understand, even if you are determined to leave, you can always make a break and commemorate this love in the most direct way, but the noodle dream It was completely smashed, and if there is any trace of emotion for this man who has been obsessed with himself since he was a teenager, if he has a little bit of love for the man who claims to be the only one he likes, at the time of separation, in the noodle Under the request of sorrow, she will not be so determined, until there is no slight hesitation and emotion from beginning to end. At this moment, noodles have to finally accept this cruel fact. She really does not love, not only does not Love, plus hatred, she hated this humble servant who bowed at her feet, even violated her, defiled her, the door opened, the noodles climbed down like a hollow shell of the soul, completely desperate, he knew, In this way, he ended all the intersections and possibilities of the two of his life, and it was completely over. Since then, the noodles have fallen in love with opium, and their eyes have lost their light, Mu Na is sad and more silent.At the station where Deborah left, Noodle secretly stared at Deborah again. I read it several times, thinking that from Deborah 's point of view, she should be able to see the noodles coming, but she was still expressionless. , And handed down the curtains of the car window, decisively cut everything with noodles.Thirty-five years later, Noodle and Deborah had another meeting. This time, the noodles sat in the theater to watch Deborah 's performance for the first time. In the dream, the goddess is still the goddess, and he is old. In the dressing room, the two met for the first time after 35 years. At the beginning, Deborah was still on the surface, showing that she did n't care about the noodles. She maintained a sense of distance. Extremely unfriendly, but just as the conversation between the two continued to advance, Debola became more and more flustered in the noodles one by one, and the movement of constantly cleaning her face to remove makeup was getting faster and more chaotic, she She kept rubbing and rubbing, but she couldn't wipe it clean, her face was a mess, just like her heart, it was a mess. The mask is entangled with the face, and the truth and the false are also mixed together, a little messy, but it does not matter, be careful, be careful, you will be able to distinguish clearly. In the end, Deborah finally collapsed. She simply gave up the masking action and used her embarrassed face to tell the noodle a little bit of warmth in her heart, and persuaded the noodle to leave. However, the noodles are no longer the original noodles. After 35 years of precipitation, he will not give up when he comes back this time. Deborah uncontrollably exposed her hysterics and anger before the scandal. This proud and vanity Women want to show their success and nobility everywhere, but how can you be with that hypocritical and vicious Max? That is the lover you have been trying to abandon noodles? Do you feel embarrassed to be a ungrateful betrayal of a betrayed brother, a cold-blooded shameless man who treats women like playthings? Do you think noodles come to see your joke? Finally, Deborah, who removed her mask, was no longer the goddess of noodles. 'Friends and wives can't lie.' The common betrayal between her and Max is terrible and unforgivable. At this time, the noodles 35 years later, the best The choice is not hate, but to keep the distance politely and restraintly, what do you do with me? Put it down completely. Next, he also faced Max who tried to be redeemed with the same attitude.Simply talk about Max, he is a perverted villain, I saw him from the first glance, I didn't like him for no reason, his whole body carried a sultry atmosphere, the first glance at the above article, I couldn't help saying Taking noodles as their own, and imposing narcissistic self-righteousness on the noodles, a point of view is that noodles cannot live without him. The worst part is that he has never really regarded noodles as friends and brothers, possessiveness is abnormal, in short, shameless, he and noodles and their brothers are like the story of the farmer and the wolf. In the end, he didn't end well, just like the noodles once said, 'How do they treat them now, and how will they deal with you and me in the future' into the evil cycle, no one can escape. His evil went deep into the bone marrow, and he did n't let go of the noodles until he died. He knew exactly where the noodles went and how sad he blamed himself, but he ignored the whole thirty-five years. Chess piece, if he needs to leave him, let him go, if he needs to come back, he should come back, and before he dies he must pull noodles and be buried for him. His mistress is simply ridiculous.

Alice in Wonderland," Alice takes us to dream
","A fantasy adventure telling the story that happened 13 years after Alice's last time in Wonderland. Alice, 19, went to a manor to a party. Alice chose to escape, and she followed a white rabbit into a Hole, came to 'Wonderland' again.
This is a weird childhood story. The soundtrack is gorgeous, and the most important thing is that the Queen of Hearts has a fragile and twisted heart. The scenes of childhood flashbacks are too amazing, especially the white roses are dyed red. As for the White Queen ... it's a completely hypocritical guy, Alice's clothes are dazzling, and Johnny Depp's look is also great.
The details are exquisite. Good fairy tales have a sweet but not too sweet feeling. The degree is just right, a little evil but not too evil.",7,0,0,24 March 2020
La La Land," Symphony of Realism and Romanticism
","A changeable and free creation who once loved jazz, but chose to compromise as a keyboard player in order to give his girlfriend a stable life. One was a waiter who used to envy others in a convenience store to resign and wrote his own role. The script, and later became famous. Sometimes the path of chasing dreams is not so 'romantic'. Dreams need material support and spiritual encouragement.
When the two sat together and played the city of stars, it was actually the beginning of their upcoming separation. This song is not only a summary of the period from acquaintance to love, but also the sense of fatality that will eventually leave. From the last sentence ' i dont know where i go, i think i wanna to stay '. The most touching thing about this song is that while he points out love, he also expresses the sense of parting fatalism. There is another more wonderful point, that is, the embarrassment of the embarrassing dream chasers. When I saw this three years ago, I simply thought that the song was nice and the love was beautiful, but there was no such experience at all.
Another hidden theme-the sympathy of dream chasers, but this is what contributed to their love. This friendship of Bole is obviously more profound than love. It is also what Chamion wants to discuss.
Chamion had studied jazz drums for ten years. In high school, he met a very strict teacher, which brought him a lot of inspiration and help in jazz music. It was equivalent to his Bole. At that time, Chamion himself His dream is to become a jazz player in the future. It can be seen that jazz is simply integrated into his bones, so many people may not know why there are so many jazz elements in the film, even very professional aspects. In fact, it comes from his own experience. . His movie audiovisual language is very good, and his movie language is very rhythmic, so it is very sensation to watch the song and dance films he directed. The rhythm of the film comes from the subconscious consciousness of a drummer.
The film uses a lot of long shot scheduling. The most admirable thing about him is that he can shoot the long shot rhythm. The stage scheduling of the stage drama really makes me want to applaud in situ.
At the end of the film, the director spent a few minutes fulfilling everyone 's dream. If they did n't miss it for the first time at the beginning, if later they encouraged each other and support each other, then it 's them who built the family together today, and it 's them who have the children, They are going to play together, it is a happy ending. However, reality always lacks 'romanticism'. Reality needs idealism but often does not become idealism.
Looking at the whole movie, my favorite clip is that the male host drove to the female host's house to tell her that there was a casting interview. The female host told him that she had had enough failures, and the male host firmly said 'you can'. This kind of trust and encouragement is another kind of rebirth switch given by God. It is not perfunctory, but tells you the facts-you can, you will take this role.
In addition to the content, the film's photography and color use are simply stunning, especially the color matching is really beautiful, and it is the ultimate enjoyment of the senses.
Finally, to those with dreams, you will have city's stars",8,5,6,4 April 2020
3 Idiots," Taste life through stories
","The film is a classic work of the famous Indian actor Amir Khan. It criticizes the cramming education of India by rote and emphasizes the importance of interest education, diligent thinking and breaking conventional thinking. The protagonist of the story is Lancher. Because of the need to complete his studies for a noble son, he came to the famous Imperial University of Technology. This university is a dream place for everyone. The students in it have excellent grades, the principal is very strict, and also a very accomplished. However, the principal 's teaching method is grade-only theory, which may be similar to the Chinese saying 'only reading is high'.Lancher had just arrived at the school and said he was going to have a newcomer's gift. The other freshmen took off their pants to reveal their ass. When it was Lancher's turn, he wisely used the principle of urine conduction to tease the teacher who forced him to take off his pants. Everyone understands this physics principle, but few people apply it. The so-called theory seems to stay in the textbook or in the brain. At the opening ceremony, when the principal held an aviation pen to tell its origins, Lancher asked why the astronauts did not use a pencil. This question left the principal speechless. It can be seen that the stereotypes will not only limit the students ' Imagination, even the principal who has made a name for himself is no exception. Lancher's unique thinking gradually attracted everyone's attention and began to affect the entire school.Lancher soon met two friends, Fahan and Raja. The two agreed with Lancher's thoughts. The three of them have a unique style of work and often sing the phrase 'Everything will be fine.' Their lives It is full of freedom. However, it is precisely because the three people are doing things uniquely, which violates the traditional education of this university, making the university full of enthusiasm. How much do their methods differ from school education? Among the students was a Chartu who studied hard, and he worked hard. Every time before the exam, he would recite a lot of knowledge. Of course, there is no harm in memorizing the textbook knowledge, but Chartu does not understand whether he is learning for interest, and I do n't know what this knowledge means to his life. He delays thinking, and book knowledge becomes his mindset, divergence and innovation. Thinking is severely restricted, and knowledge can not be used to learn and use. No matter whether the problem in reality is simple or difficult, he can memorize a concept in the book proficiently, and then the teacher will praise him for his intelligence. This is what the university advocates. Educational model. I remember that during a class, the teacher asked the students to answer what the concept of machinery was. Chartu stood up and recited a large section and was recognized by the teacher. When Lancher answered, he only said that the machine was a convenient device and used the pants door. The front zipper made a demonstration, saying that the zipper is a simple machine. Because his answer did not correspond to the concept of the textbook, the students all laughed. The teacher also criticized Lancher and asked him to answer in 'terms'. Then he said a large number of The mechanical theory, the teacher did not understand, asked him how to say so complicated, he replied, just tried to use a simple method to explain, and it did not work. Another time, the headmaster of Lancher got angry and was asked to give a lecture on the podium. Lancher wrote an English word on the blackboard and let everyone sitting in the dictionary look up in the dictionary. Who can find who wins first can be imagined. It 's time, and everyone did n't find the word. Lancher explained that this was a combination of the names of his two friends. Everyone was busy looking up the word, but they did n't think about why they wanted to check it, or whether they had a passion for knowledge. And longing to check. Obviously, everyone's mindset limits their enthusiasm for knowledge.The education of Imperial College of Technology is a one-color education, and everyone uses the same set of standards to investigate. I remember a student who liked to make airplane models very much, but when he was about to succeed, the principal discovered that he was angrily throwing away his airplane model, and also called his elderly father to tell him to drop the student. The student spent everything at home for the children to study, but was eventually ordered to drop out because he was interested in flying. The family members could not bear it, and the student could not accept it. As a result, he chose to hang himself. The pressure killed the student, but the principal felt confident that he was innocent. Lancher 's two friends also had their own interests. Lagar wanted to be an engineer, and Fahan liked photography. Their interest was not understood by the school and family. Their family conditions were not good. When Lagar was ordered to drop out of school, He also chose to commit suicide. Fortunately, the encouragement of Rancher, Fahhan and his family made Raga wake up. This time he no longer chose to escape, he dared to face himself and pursue his own life, and finally succeeded; Fahrenheid This time he asked his parents to study photography, but they were all opposed voices. After the events in Laga, Fahan once again expressed his determination to learn photography. This time, his parents softened and understood his son. In the end, Fahan became a famous photographer. The principal's children used to commit suicide because of the huge learning pressure. Lancher always insisted on his interest. That is why he chose his major. His thinking was flexible and he would not be constrained by the rigid system. Therefore, he always achieved the first major and finally became a scientist, with more than 400 invention. The principal's change of concept occurred when his daughter had a difficult birth, when it was raining heavily. At the moment of life, Lancher used his knowledge and reality to quickly come up with a way to save the mother and son. The principal held the newborn grandson , Saying 'Do you want to be a football star in the future?' This sentence breaks the headmaster's way of thinking in the past. He believes that interest education is the most important thing. He also sent his treasured pen to Rancher, indicating that Lancher was the best student he met.Lancher chose a major according to his own interests. He had a sincere love for knowledge, flexible thinking, and opposed duck-feeding education. He was able to link knowledge and real life, and achieved world-renowned achievements in the scientific community. Lancher also influenced other students, enabling them to pursue their dreams courageously, and he also influenced the entire school education system. In contrast, China's education system actually has a lot of disadvantages. It is basically the same as the exam-oriented education, lack of interest education, and insufficient innovation ability of students. Perhaps China should carry out education reform, cultivate talents in all directions, and reserve a new generation of troops for the country. However, the environment we live in is more difficult to change or slower. At this time, we may need to make changes ourselves, so that we can start with a passion for knowledge and a strong desire to choose the direction we are interested in and remain flexible. The way of thinking connects knowledge and practice well, keeps thinking and innovating, and finally realizes our dream.",10,0,0,13 April 2020
Life Is Beautiful," Thought-provoking
","Just after watching beautiful life, I cried sparsely. I don't usually get touched when watching TV movies, because the so-called tear-sweeping stories that are now full of screens are either Korean dramas in which one of the heroines and heroines who died after suffering together died of terminal illness, or single parents raised hard with hardships Non-natural children and their biological father or mother suddenly appeared in the domestically produced TV dramas with various logical disputes after the child grew up.

Up," May you come out of your life and you will be a teenager
","Because of the entanglement of love, they put aside the adventure of traveling around the world. The stream of water is old and old, and the life of each other has been completed, and it can withstand any dream miss. Because of the stumbling block of memories, even if she died as a photo on the wall, even if he had changed from a young boy to a stubborn old man, he would have to take a once-used common hut and set sail for their childhood aspirations. The hut is the carrier of cherished memories, and the shackles of the closed heart. The adventure is a dream to get what you want. It is also a rebirth to reminisce the past. Because of a journey that has not been lost, this old man who has fallen into solitary life because of his love and death has experienced a new partner. The occasion, found a new fulcrum and new sustenance.
The first ten minutes of the film described Carl's most of his life and Allie's life. I think many people's lives are similar to the first part of the film. When we were young and ignorant, we all cherished dreams of ignorance. Slowly, we are slowly worn away by life's expectations and dreams.As Wang Xiaobo said, life is a slow process of being hammered, and finally it becomes like a hammered cow.Their love is always with them, no matter what happens, the two are snuggling and accompany each other.Ordinary life, but they live unswervingly, this is the simplest appearance of love. In fact, in addition to love, there are friendship, affection and nature's love. These are the seven emotions and six desires that run through a person's life. We all have to face, Carl handed over the answers to his life questionnaire about love.Yes, Carl has become an old man, but with his love and dreams, his heart is full of blood, he was still the dream chasing boy. I think, as long as people remember their original dreams, it's never too late to start. May we run away for half our lives and return to our youth.Regarding adventures and dreams, an old man talks about the story of a young maniac, and the dream youth and memories of an adult. The ten-minute short film and the adventures and love of Carl and Ellie throughout the film are enough to become classics, making the main line of the film seem bland. Life is an adventure, the end of this journey is not a great spectacle, but walking with you",8,0,0,11 April 2020
A Clockwork Orange," Feelings
","From the beginning, it was extremely impactful, with a lot of naked sexual organs and violent scenes. The four guys who wanted nowhere to vent had robbed, raped, madness and restlessness to form a collection of four evils. The film is so unordered, chaotic streets, and sky-rocketing rooftops. The human-made evil is described undisguisedly. The audience seems to have fallen into the dark and treacherous abyss of hell, facing the death of blue-faced fangs. The most evil of the four is the protagonist. His beautiful face, elegant taste and actual action form a strong contrast. Goodness and beauty become the masks torn off, and the true face of the fierce and evil shows fangs.I feel mixed with good and evil. After the male host was successfully treated and released from prison, the victim who had been violently treated became the perpetrator. The male host could not resist, he became a thing that could not be violent or sexually intercourse. (Based on the partial absence of human beings, and called things) The basic desire is suppressed, and the once evil collection becomes the collection of the forced lack of evil, and the good is not reflected in the film. So it caused me to think: What kind of person is a person? The violence that we fear and sometimes hurt us is indeed a part of people, and even a very important part.In a sense, social operation can be called regular operation. There are strict procedures in the prison, and every action is nothing, and the rules become a huge pillar and a chain of operation.The political issues discussed in the film are obvious and need not be repeated. I am more concerned about the state of the male owner. He has always been like duckweed, riding with the wind. I think evil is an essential impulse that is difficult to discipline. Good is an acquired constraint is the so-called moral ethics. A very old proposition is whether humans are good or evil at the beginning. I have no answer. The fact is that I didn't blame the male host or even sympathize with him. Compared with the fullness of viciousness, it's more pessimistic for me not to be a person.",8,0,1,28 April 2020
Reservoir Dogs," A well-planned robbery with a complete failure
","Several people, several rooms switch, several guns, but a thrilling robbery show is full of performance, the entire movie is also a model of a small-cost movie, no formal robbery scene appeared, the ups and downs of the plot is enough to make you admire The story is wonderful.The gang boss, Joe, called six people who didn't know each other to prepare a diamond settlement. His gameplay is very interesting. Six people can't talk about any personal privacy issues. Everyone uses a color for the name. The robbery After careful planning, but ambushed by the police, he was embarrassed and failed. Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown became the soy sauce directly. Mr. White rushed to the meeting place with the injured orange. Pink got the diamond and hid it in a place to come to the meeting. The gold kidnapped a policeman and brought him to question. They wanted Find out the truth and want to know who is the inner ghost?According to the linear narrative, this story is nothing more than an ordinary robbery, but the director chose the way of flashback and interlude to make the whole story look ingenious. The performances of several actors are very exciting. Mr. White, played by Harvey Kettle, is the most loyal brother of Jianghu. He thinks that Mr. Orange 's injury is related to himself, so he desperately maintains when the last pink is accused of being undercover. He, this is a bohemian-style character in a Hong Kong film, plays Tim Rose in orange. Everyone is more familiar with his 'Sea Pianist', the 1900 he starred in, in this movie he Join the robbery gang by saying a line, complete the undercover mission, pretend to calm yourself, and brag about how calm and calm you carry drugs in the toilet in front of the four policemen and a police dog. Gold is a pervert, but he is very loyal to the old father and son. He listens to music and abuses the captured policeman. He never forgets to be cool. Mr. Pink is Steve Bussim, who I admire for his acting skills. After seeing his 'Sky Prison', he can express the mental appearance of a perverted killer with one look. In this movie, he is the most chattering and the most. The role of the chicken thief only cares about his own interests. He lived to the end and swallowed the diamond alone.The name of the movie is 'Luo Shui Dog', which is actually full of irony. When several people dressed in black suits and wearing ink mirror images of the characters in the Hong Kong gangster film came out of the wind, it seems that the big brother of the rivers and lakes has actually fallen to a water dog The ending is full of black humor. Life is so ridiculous, it seems to have made a fortune and become rich, and ran towards a better future. In fact, it is a busy one. No one can grasp their own destiny. People are imagining a river and lake, thinking that they can quickly avenge their enemies. In fact, in the end it is not at all like that, there is no romance, only cruelty.",8,0,0,26 April 2020
How to Train Your Dragon," Growth is the best gift
","It talks about a weak juvenile hiccup that is different from the mainstream of the society, and finally reached a reconciliation with his father through peaceful dragon training, achieved the favor of the girl he liked, and also merged two conflicting social groups, human and dragon stand up.
The story takes place in a place called Bock Island, a place where the Vikings lived for generations. Bok Island has 12 days of desperate cold like the Arctic, and the Antarctic cold dying. The originally peaceful life here is often broken by fierce dragons. In order to resist the evil dragon, the strong Vikings naturally regard the dragon as a professionThe protagonist is Hickap (hiccup), he and the tribe have lived on Bok Island for seven generations, his father Sturly is the leader of the tribe, and the Bok Island has been attacked by dragons for generations.Hickap wants to change his life in detail. He thinks that as long as he kills a dragon in two minutes, he can become a real Viking and even pursue a favorite girl. He has no strength in his hands, and he cannot fight the dragon unless he is reborn.
Because hiccups are weak, his father told him to stay in the house as much as possible. In order to prove that he is also a real Viking, he can also slaughter the dragon. Cannons are used to catch dragons.One night, Hiccup shot a Yesha (the most powerful and mysterious race among the dragons) with his cannon and fell into the forest not far away. Much damage. Father complained that as soon as he went out, disaster would surely come. Hickap, who was ridiculed again, wandered alone in the mountain forest and met Yesha who was hit by him the night before. He thought he could finally prove himself, but he did not kill the dragon at the last minute. Later, he fished the injured Yesha, and also named him 'Toothless Aberdeen.' Slowly they trusted each other and became more and more tacit.In order to make hiccups stronger and learn survival skills, his father finally agreed to let hiccups participate in the Tulong class for training.
Half of the caudal fins disappeared when the toothless babies fell into the forest. Hiccup made an artificial caudal fin for the toothless babies to fly. Through continuous improvement, with the cooperation of the two, the toothless babies Fully mastered free flight.Through getting along with Toothless Aberdeen, Hiccups mastered the skills related to how to get along with dragons, thinking that dragons are not dangerous creatures and there is no need to conquer them by slaughter. In the following Dragon Slaughter class, Hiccup proved the point with the skills he learned. Taming the dragon all the way instead of killing the dragon, finally went to the final class-the slaughter of nightmares (a race of the dragon family), through After that, they are eligible to become real Vikings. Hiccup, the way to conquer the dragon, was welcomed by most Vikings.
However, Astri, who was also with the Dragon Taming Squad, discovered the secrets of Hikap and Toothless Aberdeen. After seeing Wuyazai, Astrid was frightened and planned to run back to the village to tell everyone, but Wuyazai caught her, and Hickap asked Astria to give him a chance to explain. So they rode the toothless boy and went for a ride together. On the way, they accidentally encountered a large group of dragons, and were flying to their nest with the captured prey in groups. After following them to the nest, they found that the prey caught by the dragons was not eaten by themselves, but was all fed to a bigger dragon in the nest as food, and if the dragons did not bring food back, they would be caught by that. Eat a big dragon.
In order to protect Toothless, Hickap didn't tell his father about the Dragon's Cave. In the Dragon Slayer assessment, Hikap put down his weapon and tried to tell everyone that the dragons were not as evil as they thought, as long as they did not harm them, they would not attack. Due to the dispute between Hiccup and his father, he was reluctant to slaughter the dragon and was almost killed by the nightmare. Fortunately, Ziya had arrived in time to save Hiccup. The Vikings, out of fear of Yesha, captured the toothless boy alive. In order to prove the innocence of Toothless Adolescent, Hickap told the father in a hurry that the dragon's lair was found and that these dragons were also innocent victims. The matter became more serious, and Sturik planned to take them without teeth to bring them to the dragon's den.
Hiccup's father learned from the quarrel with his son that there was a dragon nest nearby. Under his leadership, the Vikings tied Toothless Aberdeen on the boat as a guide to find the dragon nest. However, when reaching the dragon's nest, the dragon was alerted and the Vikings suffered heavy losses. All the ships were on fire, including the one that bundled the Toothless Aberdeen.
At a critical moment, Little Hiccup led her little friends to ride the flying dragon to the Dragon Nest to rescue the besieged Vikings. Little Hiccup rescued the toothless baby with the help of his father. Little Hiccup and his father reconciled. He was very proud of having such a son. Hiccups rode a toothless man and started a thrilling battle with the dragon. Hiccups almost died. Fortunately, Hiccup was saved by the toothless man. Unfortunately, Hiccups lost his left foot and lower shin.

Beauty and the Beast," Childhood classics
","The film is based on Disney's 1991 animated movie of the same name. It tells the story of a girl Belle living with the prince cursed into a beast to rescue her father, and finally defeats magic with true love.
When I was a kid, I really loved this cartoon and felt that the characters are so beautiful. Although the monster is a monster, he is not afraid of him at all. Of course, I have to check out the newcomer edition, and it did not disappoint me. Many of these movies are afraid of destroying the original, but this one is really good. The prince has become a monster without love because of some things, but in fact he has love in his heart, but just needs someone to warm him. Belle unlocked the prince's knot with her love and beauty, and the moment when she returned to the prince was really handsome.

Some Like It Hot," After Monroe, there are no more elves
","Monroe, as always, canary-style performances. Full of enthusiasm, sexiness, sweet voice, and grinning smile. However, the screenwriter of this movie is quite reluctant, the male protagonist who is dressed as a woman is not recognized, and then he is not recognized as a man. This ridiculous screenwriter has made the actors and directors no matter how hard they try. This film is inevitably attributed to mediocrity in the long film.However, I think most people will not pay attention to these details, just looking at the little elf Monroe is enough. This is one of the last films in her short life. The thought of the stunner's death in a few years will inevitably be sad.In fact, this film has a lot of highlights, for example, reflecting the Chicago gang fight, which is the prelude to the gangster film in full swing in the future. Almost all the characters in the future gangster movies are this image. And the public officials who always keep an eye on the gang are also an excellent addition to this movie. I mean, this movie, which is not a gangster film, raises the benchmark of gangster movies to a relatively high level.The years are really long, the three of those years: Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Monroe. One by one passed away. If Monroe did not die that year, we would eventually see an old woman like Taylor. And this contrast is simply unforgivable. Monroe used her premature death to freeze her beauty in our hearts!",8,0,0,14 April 2020
Pulp Fiction," You and I are passers-by, lonely and boring soul
","The narrative of the whole story is ups and downs. Hold the audience's attention very well. Each character has different meanings in different stories and seems to be shaped into different personalities. From beginning to end, the characters haven't changed, but we have seen more of the characters' stories. It can be said that Quentin's understanding of the script and the lens expression has reached a certain height.In fact, from the structure of the film, it is understood by individuals. Ah, echoing from beginning to end, very powerful. Elementary school students know that the composition is echoed from beginning to end, and play in a loop. So to take this bragging, I think it is insulting Quentin's level.When I watch this movie, I see Quentin's understanding of the characters. Gangs, boxing, drugs, underground culture. These things that seem far away from the lives of ordinary people have been put on the screen. The first caught the eye, but it looked vulgar. In fact, the characters have their own principles and abacus. No bad guy is stupid, and no policeman is just.So the whole movie has a lot of dialogue. Dialogue is an important code for explaining information, and it is also an important way for the audience to understand the characters. So Quentin worked hard on the conversation, the conversation in the restaurant, the conversation in the car, the conversation during the murder, etc. All dialogues are expressing the character's character, and not only the dialogue is used to express the speaker's character, but also the dialogue is used to shape the character of a character who has not yet appeared. All these conversations endow the characters with soul. It so happens that they are all interesting souls. In the real world, there are many people who are lonely, and there are few interesting souls. So, how attractive should these people on the screen be to us. And the weird advancement in the story doesn't seem reasonable. But after understanding the dialogue information, all these non-common senses seem to be explained. After all, there are few normal people. It can be said that they are all weird characters. The weird director made great works again.In the end, for the audience, we are all passers-by in the restaurant. We eat in the restaurant while enjoying these stories away from life. The most indispensable group in the world is the group that eats melons. In particular, the more fresh the story, the more we cannot bear our curiosity, and the more I want to know what will happen next.Of course, this is just the appeal of the story. The story comes from the script, so I say the script of this movie is great. Quentin's grasp of the rhythm and structure of the film is excellent. Only under the combined effect of the two, did this excellent work.In short, is the story too exciting, or are we living too ordinary.Like a lonely ant, peeping into the sparrow's eyes.",9,2,2,19 April 2020
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Turn absurdity into reality
","This movie is undoubtedly brilliant, no matter the plot concept, shooting skills, voiceover settings are inherited works. But after watching this movie, my biggest feeling is that the director not only told a wonderful little character counterattack, but also involved the absurdity of human existence as a social animal.
Human society is built on the group of people, but each individual person has an independent consciousness. This makes it almost impossible for individuals in a complicated social group to master the complete situation, and everyone is analyzing and even taking actions through their own logical judgment, which undoubtedly complicates the relationship again. Absolute authority can be established to combat repression, and on the other hand, mutual benefit can be achieved through cooperation. And once the relationship breaks, the real existence that those people think will be wiped out in vain.
The reason for the existence of dramatic scenes in this movie is that the interests of money establish the connection between these people. The 'big men' control and squeeze the small people through violent suppression, and the collection of actions of the small people at the same time eventually leads to the reversal of the entire event. The turning point is the decay of human life. Therefore, the key basic point is that the means by which human beings establish relationships, if the relationship is established by 'death to death', then there will be a 'people not afraid of death' and take risks, if the relationship is established on the basis of relative relaxation and mutual benefit There may be completely different results, but this is inevitable. So maybe human nature cannot be taken seriously.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
Les Misérables," People should be kind
","This movie is the happiest thing I have seen this year.
All those places have its ugly side, which we despise; at the same time, it also has its outstanding side, which we respect.
It is love and redemption.
The summaries of all the commandments are love, and those who love others will have the law complete, and love can cover up many sins.
In the two and a half hours of epic epic, I shed tears heartily, God's injustice to Jean Valjean's youth, and Jean Valjean's confession to God. Fantin degenerates step by step under the pressure of life, and the explosion of Anne's acting makes me cry without restriction. How tragic the world is, the kindness that is crushed on the streets of society can't breathe, and it can barely be supported, but only the love for the loved one in the heart.
The injustice of fate, in this huge epic, only hope to sigh the savior and hero.
However, redemption itself will redeem each other, God redeems the priest, the priest redeems Valjean, Valjean redeems Fantine, Cosette, Marius, and even his righteous enemy, Javert.
Jean Valjean, with a kind heart, finally redeemed himself. Although his inner conscience will make people haggard, it will still make you permanently radiate humanitarian charm and make people admire.
The love in it also impressed me. The dialogue in the rain really came from three people. The heroic sacrifice in the rain is the one who ca n't wait for death to find company. Any love falls in love at first sight.
Poor and fragile in front of me, but this time it was right.
Too many occasions cater to the characteristics of musicals. I have been enjoying it for a long time, and I am hungry and thirsty.
I love every character in this movie, even if there are dirty liars, all this is epic.",9,3,3,8 April 2020

A Beautiful Mind," Logical charm
","A thousand reader with a thousand hamurate. In my opinion, mind here refers to the brain.At the beginning, I was immersed in the atmosphere created by the movie. The male host was always embarrassed, lonely, and funny but eager to be liked and praised. He and his loved ones stepped into the palace of marriage. I also have a successful career. In my opinion, everything is normal and warm. It is a normal direction of biographies.I never imagined that his roommate, his boss, and his roommate's little niece were all fantasies, and I didn't feel it at all.

The Departed," Imitate purely for imitation
","I always think that the Hong Kong version of Infernal Affairs has reached the peak of Hong Kong movies. I figured it out countless times for this.Before I watched the American version, I thought Martin Scorsese's skill would surpass this classic. A lot of people in the comments were also better than the Hong Kong version.Objectively speaking, there are excellent places, and the application of cross montage is very exciting. For the Hong Kong version, the soundtrack is more emotionalBut returning to the story of the movie itself, the whole is not as good as the Hong Kong version.I will list a few points for this.One, characters.The most important part of the narrative level is the character.Let me talk about the Hong Kong version first. The beauty of the Hong Kong version is the delicateness of the characters.Liang Chaowei was tired of undercover life. Because his promotion is a 'three years and three years' promotion. Even when facing his ex-girlfriend (Xiao Yaxuan), he could not recognize his true identity. It further highlights his helplessness. When Huang Qiu lived and died, the silent performance fully showed the helplessness of the characters and the motivation for the next action.This is not so delicate on the undercover played by Xiao Lizi. When Diggman satirized Xiao Lizi at the beginning, he did not show his determination as a policeman. The old policeman just said 'do it again, for me.' What? Who are you? Why? Being undercover is desperate. The cooperation with the police has always revolved around 'I will die if I catch the undercover and catch me.' The source of his actions is not clear. And at the end he just wanted to eliminate the previous guilt and get money. He could not take this undercover, or he had more money as a criminal than this. Regarding details, Liang Chaowei 's trust in the female doctor is that she can sleep peacefully and tell the female doctor that he is a police officer. And the trust of Xiao Lizi, who was also insomnia, slept with the female doctor. If the West does n't care much about this bed relationship, why would Little Lizi trust her, but she can pretend to be like everyone else and continue to discuss marriage with her boyfriend who has been in love for four months?Let 's talk about the second character, Matt Damon, who plays undercover.The Hong Kong version of Infernal Affairs provided Andy Lau 's motivation to be a good person, and he is more likely to improve on the police side. There is a clear lens that shows himself wandering between good and evil. The Matt Damon police arrested the boss just because he suspected that he had been betrayed, out of self-preservation, and when the boss said he had not betrayed him before he died, he still killed the boss. Also in the movie theater, Brother Chen ridiculed Andy Lau, 'So you are worried about yourself, Officer Liu,' and in the US version, Matt Damon said, 'You are so bully * What do you want me to do, you have to tell me 'Come', the former shows selfishness, the latter shows arrogance. The final decision was to give Brother Chen the phone. Brother Chen did not take him to play, he was born with a sense of crisis. So Brother Chen called Andy Lau and found the ringtone. When Brother Chen died, he did n't have a word. Smiling shows his conclusion. Before deciding on his position, Matt Damon also called to advise the boss not to go. The boss yelled and ordered him, so he decided to remove the boss and not only a lot of ink in the process of killing the boss, but also tell the boss woman 'We lost him' is superfluous, and the characters change too fast.The third character, the villain boss.Zeng Zhiwei's boss is a sinister and cunning but decisive person. He chatted with Huang Qiusheng last second and set off the table next second. His eyes revealed cunning, and his words were full of irony. He was cautious at the first transaction, but the operation transaction failed, and the police knew he had committed a crime but had no choice but to take him. The American version of the boss, an elegant old rogue, suits and leather shoes full of swearing, Matt Damon ordered him, he compromised. When dealing with the Chinese, they were more reckless and more spicy, but the meticulousness was insufficient and the transaction was still successful. The police knew exactly where the transaction was, but they dared not catch people because of surveillance problems and let them go. Brother Chen knows that there are inner ghosts, and he suspects temptation one by one, while the US version of the boss knows that there are inner ghosts, only to test out the newcomer Billy. And the boss in the US version also added some content. First, selling chips that endanger national security, such a big thing, came one or two FBI, and then added an unnecessary criminal motive, Billy asked him the reason, not lack of money or women, when the boss is in like.The fourth character is a female doctor.I personally think that this is the worst. The Hong Kong version is two female characters that do not interfere with each other. The US version is a female doctor who connects two undercovers in series. This formed a chaotic relationship between men and women. I was even thinking, who is the child the female doctor is pregnant with? Especially at the end. The female doctor became the only person who knew the identity of the undercover on both sides. Little Li Zi left her things unanswered. The last shot was to sign Xiao Lizi's name and put it in the drawer. For Matt Damon, he just ignored him and did not provide a direct lens to indicate what she might do next. . BTW: How did Diegman find Matt Damon, did not provide direct camera clues. Became the ending for the end. Leaving aside followers of Infernal Affairs 2 and 3, the bad guys in the original edition of Infernal Affairs Hong Kong are still pretending to be saluting, which is even more ironic.Finally, let me talk about other minor characters.After Diegman resigned, he apparently became a character in the play that was put on hold. But he was the policeman who had the information on the undercover. That undercover says it doesn't matter? The boss said that if he wanted to do it, he wouldn't do it. He had only one action from resignation to reappearance, which was to kill the police undercover. This viper figure is completely absent in the Hong Kong version, but another senior policeman who knew the undercover identity in the Hong Kong version died as soon as he appeared, so it strengthened the importance of Huang Qiusheng.There is a small person in the Hong Kong version. Du Wenze played the stupid strong. When Liang Zhaowei was found to be undercover, he showed his loyalty in the underworld and protected Liang Chaowei, which was a passive action. Silly is not stupid. On the other hand, when the American version knew that Xiao Lizi was undercover, it was the bad guy A who took the initiative to test him. This section is not in the Hong Kong version. He told Xiaolizi 314 that they were actually at 344. Then he did not tell others, and finally he questioned him, not far away from other members. The little plum is just downstairs. If you walk from the joint to the end of a street, and pass 314 before you reach No. 344, and walk here to see the dead person, it's fine to stop. This temptation is not rigorous and superfluous. There is a suspicion of imitation for imitation.Second, the echo of the plotThe Hong Kong version echoes a lot. Liu Dehua and Liang Chaowei met early because they bought audio. There are also common hobbies and pursuits. Echoed the identity of both undercover. At the end, the evidence was sent by the way when the sound was sent. This is not in the US version, but the female doctor directly peeked at the privacy of his boyfriend. You might say that it is not important, ok, let 's move on.At the beginning, a policeman who knew Liang Chaowei's identity died. At this time, Liang Chaowei, who had been undercover for many years, watched the funeral convoy in the alley and performed a police salute. So at the end he only said the phrase 'I'm sorry, I'm a policeman' when he caught Andy Lau. At the end of the US version, Matt Damon said, 'No one knows, what are you?' Nani? Someone knows ~ Digman the neglected knows. Although he left for the time being, he was still an insider without dying.The most important echo is also a cause and effect relationship. The transaction between Brother Chen and the Thais failed, and they found out that there was an inner ghost. In the US version, the police came directly to say that they had an undercover, and Matt Damon reported to the boss, which was very straightforward. On the police side, the reason for not daring to act is that the camera is not installed properly, and then Xiao Lizi directly told the police that there is an inner ghost through the dialogue, and there is no direct evidence, only that there is surveillance here. Isn't such a thing as a monitor so conspicuous in such a barren building? Even if you know it, wouldn't it be checked from the person who installed the camera? And Xiao Lizi said on the phone the method of providing false intelligence, but the poisonous snake Digman did not bird him at all.Let's just say another echo, Andy Lau 's CIA sent someone to follow Huang Qiusheng. After Huang Qiu 's death, the people in the serious case complained about Andy Lau, so the last arrest and resentment against Andy Lau did not cooperate. Andy was commanded by Huang Qiusheng 's revenge. After those people, the final action was successful, these police applauded him for approval. In the US version, only Digman was the one who complained about Matt Damon, and he was even opened. When Matt Damon was looking for help, I found the undercover in private, so come and help me. At the end there is also a lens of applause, but this meaning is obviously not as interesting as the Hong Kong version of applause.Three redundant c",5,0,0,22 April 2020
Psycho," On the Misleading of Details
","The movie art of the 1960s was set against a black-and-white screen with a high-level texture, which also justifies the suspenseful atmosphere.Regarding this movie, I would like to talk about the detailed hints of the film and the functions of these hints in the movie. Of course, if it is more true, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is explicit.Because the language of the camera has always been a must-have reminder to the audience: This person has problems and this place is not right.Where is the specific problem and what's wrong? Read on.Let me talk about Cran first. Since Cran decided to run with her boss's $ 40,000 cash, her character traits have become prominent. What is it? It is 'panic'. And this 'panic' has been running through her character until the moment before she died.On the way to escape, Kran spent the night in the car and was woken up by the patrolling police early the next morning. Her panic look instantly caught the attention of the police: a beautiful woman who parked the car by the road alone overnight, although she insisted that she did not encounter any problems and did not need help, but was very resistant to the police. ask.When the car dealers traded for the old ones, the car salesman had planned to spend a lot of money on the sales. As a result, Cran rejected the proposal to test the car, asked the price straight away, and did not make a counter-offer. There was only one request, and the driver was delivered immediately. This even led the car salesman to suspect that her own car was coming from a wrong direction.The heavy rain was unable to move forward, and Cran had to choose the Bates Motel by the night. At this time everyone knows that the feature film is about to begin. why? Because the audience can guess without any effort, the hotel owner Norman will not only officially launch as a transitional group performance, but as a major player identity.Regarding Norman's character traits, the director didn't hide it, and three or two lines and shots came out. The masked gentleman with a sensitive and emotional instability hides the meaning and is dangerous.So when he peeked at Klein's bath, the audience wouldn't be surprised, because this behavior was in line with Norman's character.However, when it was discovered that Crane was killed in the bathroom, his performance surprised the audience.At first he appeared a little panicked, this is the normal reaction of ordinary people. But the duration of this panic is very short. He calmed down quickly, and quickly packed the scene, the corpses disappeared, a series of actions, too smooth and skilled!But this time, back to the topic I want to talk about. Before that, I have been analyzing the details and hints. Now I can talk about the clever and misleading part, because the audience's sense of violation appears.The murder happened, the next step is to confirm who the murderer is.Who is it? The motel is equivalent to a closed space during a downpour night. In this space, there are only three people, the victim tenant Cran, the motel owner Norman, and Norman's sick, but full-hearted mother .The audience's first impression was that Norman was first ruled out, and the murderer could only be Norman's mother. why? Because we all heard, Norman's mother didn't like Cran, she had the motivation to kill.Drawing such a judgment means that the previous details hint that it has come into play, and the audience is misled unconsciously.However, there must be evidence for convictions, and we cannot guess by sentiment alone. So the audience looked down and found out that Norman 's mother was an elderly person with no mobility and resistance. How could such a person kill a young woman and a middle-aged man with a knife What?By this time, the audience actually had a vague guess as to who was the real murderer, only to wait for the movie to explain why the murderer did this and how.Finally, we know who raised the knife, but we are not sure who the murderer is.",8,0,0,21 April 2020
There Will Be Blood," faith
","There were three times of blood in the film, the first time under the initial small-scale oil well. At the beginning, all the participants were similar. Daniel was also a passionate young man at that time, and he did everything in his own hands and went deep into the danger line. Some film introductions say that Daniel used H.W to deceive the villagers. I think this is an irresponsible statement. The mine friend had an accident with him and left a child. Daniel may not have worried too much at that time. He was also lonely and unmarried for a long time. When he was not developed, he also tried his best to treat his son. Many efforts have been made for his son's deafness. Of course, it was full of reluctance to send his son to the train. The blood at this time symbolizes the young man's initial heart of striving for progress, even willing to risk his life for a better and happy life. But his son's deafness was also a watershed. Daniel rescued H.W. and went to the so-called fire fighting, but people with common sense knew that water could not save the fire of oil, let alone his professional household. He just wanted to appreciate and protect his wealth. Before the huge oil field unprecedented, Daniel began to walk away from his family.The second time Daniel shot the fake brother. Just as Daniel judged himself, his sense of competition is superior to ordinary people, and he also isolates himself from ordinary people, so he can also identify fake brothers through details. Looking back at H.W 's arson, I wonder if the clues were discovered by looking at the photos in my brother 's diary, and all the originals also disappeared in H.W. 's silence. Daniel has achieved great success, subjectively and objectively overriding others, and the poor Mr. Tief (the person who originally wanted to acquire Daniel's land) is only a cannon fodder. It is attacked by Daniel's speculation on family education. How is Daniel possible Give up your hard-won wealth? Religious ugliness broke out at the same time. Father Bandy discovered Daniel 's murder, but he just wanted him to be baptized. What 's even more ridiculous is that the content of baptism confession was to abandon his son. Ugly showed a new height in the newly built church.The third time was of course Daniel's mansion. Daniel pronounced Eli's death in Eli's way. He played the role of God himself, causing the fierce Eli to kneel down to the ground completely. Recalling Eli slapped Daniel as a priest in the church, this magical contrast makes drama and reality a perfect combination, and also a series of Eli's ugly faces: Negotiations on the dining table when Daniel first arrived at Sand Ranch, Daniel 's request before the drilling began, the bizarre performance of the devil in the church, and the madness of going home after being defeated by Daniel ... Daniel also completed one of his previous visions-leaving the crowd, he drove away the only relatives and stuck to himself Castle. Without having to go down the oil well again, he quietly transformed the young blood into oil in the thirty-year period, so that others could not take away his wealth, and his son was no exception. Eventually, he and the oil merged into one, regardless of each other.In general, this strange (music) and dark (picture) film has gone slanted, criticizing and criticizing everything it brings, and talking about the oil of the last century, but it is all in line with the present.All people have faith, some people believe that others give, and some people believe that they created. Think about how the farmers of Sand Ranch with low knowledge and limited knowledge can live the good life Daniel promised them. Or not convinced by Eli 's ecstatic exorcism? In ancient China, if there is no faith, give you faith, and Confucianism or the call to action is a very contagious shackle or weapon. In modern times, there are a lot of Chinese people who believe in Buddhism in statistics, but I think this kind of letter is a kind of request letter: look at the usual burning incense to pray to the Buddha to pray for peace, but rarely hear the use of Buddhism Moral standards self-requirement; those who charge the incense and ring the bell, and the master opens the light to ask for help, is the money also collected for the Buddha; Rather than preaching for meditation ... Whether inside the temple or in the dust and hustle and bustle, the door was opened to ask for help, and the hermit almost became an addict. This knows no boundaries, and the godfathers revealed in 'Focus' even use the faith and tolerance of the masses to secretly desire! Of course, there must be very devout believers, but it is destined to be less and less, because the living conditions are good, the candlestick in 'Miserable World' seems to be extinct, and the rich material conditions have diverted the attention of ordinary people. There is no exception whether it is the core of film and television works used for ridicule, or the focus of talk in the intestinal path. The injection of capital makes the original rustic style no longer. Now more faith and trust are gathered on the material wealth. You would never emphasize how to buckle in front of a group of people who have already buckled the first button of their life? The weakened religious system that emerged in China (even if it is lively, kowtows to the RMB) gives me reason to believe that in the communist society described by Marx, religious beliefs will disappear and the prophecies will disappear (it is certainly not a complementary relationship with material desire). Admittedly, I cannot deny the positive role and influence of religion in today's world. Doesn't capitalism make the United States temporarily a brother of the world?Desire must live longer than religion. There is no doubt that religion is also born of people, and people are afraid of growing up in desire. Conversely, I do n't want to go to the extremes of Daniel. I do n't know if Paul is a method or greed, but who can guarantee his future path?",8,0,1,7 May 2020
To Kill a Mockingbird," To Kill a Mockingbird
","This is the best film about racism. The movie was released in the early 1960s, and the story is told in the background of the Great Depression of the United States in the 1930s. During that period, people were unemployed and bankrupt, the middle class fell, farmers were poor, and the entire society was in a state of turmoil. People are anxious and confused, and various social problems have become more prominent.Gregory Pike is my favorite actor in the golden age of Hollywood. He has a gentleman temperament and is particularly charming. In this film, Parker 's lawyer Finch 's image is nearly perfect, brave, tough, and upright. After serving as Robinson 's defense lawyer, he faced great pressure, and even his children were threatened. Finch did not flinch. , Adhere to their own principles. But the social environment at that time could not allow such justice. Even if there was sufficient evidence to prove Robinson 's innocence, the jury found him guilty.Scott and his brother Jeb also have a story line in the movie. They are the story of cloth and cloth, and cloth is also a victim of social prejudice. He is misunderstood and demonized. He has a kind heart and he likes children so much. , Will quietly give them gifts, and will always secretly protect them.The whole film cuts in from the perspective of children and tells the story through their perspective. Children are the most innocent and simple existence, they can be educated, nurtured, and guided to grow. In the film, you can see how successful Finch 's family education is. I sincerely hope that our society can be less prejudiced and more tolerant. We received the correct ideas and grew into a better future.",8,1,1,30 April 2020

Life ends here too easily, and many of the happiness we ordinary people think may be mediocre and insignificant in their eyes, but this kind of suicide destruction will only make the civilization backward and make the world more sad.

Whiplash," There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.
","This film mainly tells the story of a teenager who is determined to become a top drummer when he meets a strict teacher. Under the teacher's devil training, his skills and willpower continue to improve, and he finally completes a perfect work on the music stage.
The director is very skilled in the use of light. Different lights further explain the situation and inner emotions of the characters in the film like the audience.
At the beginning of the film, the method of pushing the lens is used. At the end of the dark corridor is a practice room. As the lens continues to move forward, the scene of the picture gradually becomes only the practice room. A white light illuminates the The teenager who is seriously practicing alone in the practice room is completely immersed in his own world. He is the best drummer here. At this time, the teenager has some pride. The teenager suddenly stopped the drum hammer, as if he found something. As soon as the picture turned to the teacher standing opposite the teenager, let the audience know that the promotion of the camera was actually the promotion of the teacher 's perspective, and the teacher stepped forward step by step. As I walked, my slow steps seemed to imply an examination of the teenager. The teacher stood in the dark and asked the teenager to walk. The light was shining from the top of the teacher's head. The solemn and majestic image came out. At this time, the light on the teenager was not as bright as before. Leaning forward, subconsciously swallowing, and anxiously answering questions before the saliva is fully swallowed, all show less emotional tension and anxiety. After thinking that he had received the teacher's acquiescence, he showed himself in front of the teacher, and the teenager's face showed bright lights. He was to be praised by the teacher, but he got a ridicule from the teacher. When the teenager concentrated on drumming Close the door and leave, so that the light on the teenager's face dimmed again. They suddenly opened, and the teacher came in. The young man thought that the teacher had changed his mind. Maybe he still had a chance, and the lights appeared on his face again, but the teacher just came in to get the coat. The young man 's face was bleak again ... After the teacher left, the angle of view switched, for everyone It shows a panoramic view of the practice room. The whole color is turquoise. The large practice room is only a young man sitting next to the drum, and the thousands of lights outside the window make the younger more lonely. In just four minutes, the director not only explained the identity, relationship and personality traits of the two, but also showed the psychological changes of the teenager through the lighting, showing the ups and downs of the character 's innermost heart, and tightening the audience 's heartstrings and tense atmosphere Come out spontaneously.
The film also appeared dark green light tones many times. The first time when I was alone in the practice room, the feeling of loneliness and disappointment blended with the green. The second time was when the three drummers were trained by the teacher in turns and blamed for nearly three hours. On the way home, the dark green light shone on the tired face of the teenager. The third time was when the teenager went to the show, the bus tire of the bus punctured. When the rental car arrived, it was discovered that the drum hammer had forgotten to the car rental company. On the way back to the drum hammer, a car accident occurred. The teenager struggled to climb out of the car, regardless of the car over the ground. Disregarding it, he ran to the scene of the performance in a bloody head. When playing on the stage, the screen lights were dark green, and the teenager was unable to complete the performance normally due to physical injuries and was unable to handle it. The film was edited at a fast pace on the way to the scene when driving to the scene and on the road back to the car rental company. The young man's heart was like a tight drum surface, nervous and hesitant. The use of the green light three times showed the uneasiness and depression of the teenagers, all of which appeared when the teenagers experienced negative emotions, and could cooperate with the psychological feelings of the teenagers.
At first, the teenager was very self-respecting, with a little pride in his heart. He kept the videotape where he was playing drums when he was a kid, and choked with his family at the table, saying that he would rather live a successful life, even if he could only live to the age of 53 Asked to live to the age of 90, he thinks he can be a great and top drummer. He is a confident and confident child. But when he joins the teacher 's orchestra, he always receives insults and abuse from the teacher when he trains with the teacher. He even beats him and throws him a chair. The teenager slowly begins to recognize himself, but he is unwilling to accept the spirit of losing and wants to correct his name. The wish made the teenager work harder. The arrogance of the teenager was dulled. He wanted to be a strong person like a teacher. The light on the teenager shone on the teacher. After reconciling with the teacher in the bar, the teenager was invited by the teacher to board the performance stage again, only to find that this was just a conspiracy. It was the trap set by the teacher for reporting his own revenge. After a long period of training by the teacher, the teenager's willpower increased. Not only did he not leave in a hurry, but instead he went on stage to forget to play, and brought his level to the extreme. The teacher was gradually shocked by the teenager. At this time, the bright lights were transferred from the teacher's body to the teenager's body, and the teachers and students also resonated. This video uses a camera shake to quickly express the passion of the teacher and the students, and the success of the teenager's performance with the teacher's excited movements and expression.
The theme of this movie is that there is no madness and no survival. Finally, the hearty performance of the male host and the teacher's expression all indicate that the male host has reached a kind of ecstasy, a kind of ecstasy.",8,0,0,22 April 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Elite balance
","It took patience to watch the movie for nearly 3 hours, but I think the essence is all in the lunch chat between Jordan and his first Wall Street colleague at the beginning.To work in a world financial center and at a high price, you must be energetic, understand the overall situation and manage every detail. The money you handle every day ranges from millions of dollars to more than hundreds of millions of dollars. You must also be proficient in various trends, various model predictions, various legal regulations ... Such high-intensity and high-pressure work requires everyone to devote themselves to it. When working, everyone must lower their emotional level and carefully study every detail. However, the body and spirit are always in a state of hyperactivity, but the mood is low. Therefore, every elite must learn to balance and do things that can easily release stress: flying a plane, drinking alcohol, looking for prostitutes, taking medicine, and throwing money. Of course, maybe not everyone will do everything to promote the release of dopamine.Many people will set up a self-discipline plan for themselves, and can't stick to it for a few days, even if they can get the expected benefits from those things, such as getting positive feedback such as better results. However, the average person can't hold on for long. Because the road to self-discipline and the end point have to be happy to be long, no one can avoid the simple road of dopamine.Your desire is very strong, you want to get a lot of money, get a high reputation, get a lot of power. At the same time, you are energetic and clear-minded. However, you let yourself be a saintly gentleman, let yourself be poor and indifferent, and let yourself be a moral role model. Congratulations, depression will visit you sooner or later.However, excessive dopamine release also damages the prefrontal temperament of the brain. Addiction to dopamine makes you lose your judgment and is in danger but unable to escape the danger. If you indulge in this simple excitement, you will end up with nothing. Just like Jordan, he couldn't listen to his father's words to confess guilt and pay a fine, because he was already addicted, and the corporate culture he created was his biggest source of addiction.Life is balance-not afraid of your own desires, solving your own desires, but not letting yourself indulge in desires.What do people pursue in this life? The ghost knows that it's okay to live really.",8,0,0,6 May 2020
The Green Mile," 'A very touching story'
","I think this is probably my favorite movie in the past six months.
The three-hour period is not boring at all.The picture of the whole movie is very soft and light in warm colors. Whether it is the beginning of the film, the old people 's kind eyes, full of wrinkles in the story, or the pale yellow eyebrows, soft faces, and compassionate eyes of several kind jailers. It's golden leaves and large meadows of grass ... It's the old healing English movie I like.
The picture of Dell's execution showed that my whole heart was pulled up, just like the electric current running through Dell's whole body. Sadness, sympathy, fear, and anger also penetrated my whole body. I seemed to feel a part of Dell's pain. This movie also made me feel the death fear and the confession of my crime before the execution of the death row prisoner. The jailer except that Pell, the other people are not like I saw in other prison films. Be violent and abuse the prisoner. On the contrary, they are very kind. They call doctors who have broken their fingers. They whisper in order to take care of the emotions of the criminals. They are very caring for the little mouse 'Mr. King', and will be punished a few days before execution. The inmates who spent the money went out to start the drill ... Admittedly, Paul asked John Kofi to rescue Mrs. Melin, which made me feel strange to him. But I believe Kofi is willing. After all, he is so kind and feels the same about everything in the world. The picture of Kofi saving Mrs. Merlin is also very touching:
'What's your name?''John Coffey, homonymous with coffee, but spelled differently.'I really love Kofi. His eyes have always been compassionate, tender, pitiful and a little scared. There is so much pain in the world, but you can feel the same, you are working hard, angel.",8,0,0,21 April 2020
The Lion King," The one you want to be in the future
","The whole process of the film is easy, the whole process is like a comedy, but the character of Simba, but let me see an adult world-compete for power and profit. At that time, I was thinking in my heart, what kind of person would I be if I leave my parents and my hometown after that? Am I going to be that little lion?Now when I grow up, I understand that everyone has their own emotions in their lives. It's just that we will be aware of ourselves consciously, and better use our emotions to develop our advantages. When Simba saw Mufasa leaving, he was desperate, and he roared loudly, 'No'. Such scenes made me cry, and I really felt that my mother was so great. Later, I realized that between children and parents is responsible for each other 's lives. Raising children is a responsibility and life experience, not deliberate. If you want your child to repay yourself, you should not impose your unfulfilled life aspirations on the child. More should be to let go, and let go more and more every day until you can only see his back.Looking at 'The Lion King' again, what I saw is no longer the same. When I saw Xiao Simba, I always thought that I had killed my father. When facing this pain, he chose to use the method that everyone would use-escape . I don't want to start in front of others. I have to suffer every time I have to go through it. This may be the way most of us deal with problems in reality. When faced with a problem, I want to avoid it, instead of thinking about the result I want, and what can I do to solve the problem.Choosing to escape will only become an unfinished experience. Pain will live in your body forever. When you touch it, it will hurt. We can only truly face our unfinished experience, discover it, and experience it. Will really take away such pain.No matter when, what we need to do is to face all the problems bravely, accept everything happening, live a good life every day, look forward, no matter whether your past is good or bad, the achievements are today 's you, that You want to be you in the future.To borrow the most classic passage from 'The Lion King': Some people live to the age of 75 but never stop at the age of 25; some people play countless ways of life, some people copy the same day countless times. Therefore, growth and suffering should bring 'results', not 'consequences'.",8,0,1,22 April 2020
Inception," Inception
","A seed planted may change his life or destroy him. I am deeply impressed by this sentence. Perhaps this movie is a seed planted in our hearts. He will take root and germinate and grow long leaves. Maybe we will one day doubt the truth of this world, just like the person who dreams to wake up. We cannot distinguish between reality and dreams, but we can know that in reality there are walls everywhere, but dreams are comfortable, always in comfort is like always living dreams, when you really wake up you will find how cruel reality is, Don't let yourself be depressed in comfort, this may destroy everything for you. When you are used to living in a dream and getting used to that kind of life, you will start to escape suffering, but facing and accepting the depression of life is something we must learn. The real heroism is still after seeing the essence of life. Love life!The superimposition of every layer of dreams in the movie is amazing. When you do n't know that you are here, you may be dreaming. Where did our dreams start? Is it reality or dreams? The answer may not be found. I remember that the dazzling heroine woke up from a young dream to make up for the regrets of the past. The male master could not wake up from the dream because of obsession and guilt. In the past life, we have always been accompanied by various distresses. These subconscious minds that will enter us begin to haunt us. I know that it is very difficult to forget the pain of the past, but don't let it restrain you, you have to keep looking forward!For family members, I think everyone may long for love, just like heirs. He hoped to get his family's affirmation and support. Perhaps the motivation was not simple, but it also gave him a good ending and a relaxed smile. It turned out that my father was disappointed in me, hoping that I would become a better person!",8,1,2,10 April 2020
WALL·E," robot
","They do not speak, they have no thoughts, they have no carnal desires, they do n't have to worry about the house, they do n't have to care for the elderly, they do n't need luxury goods, and they do n't have to worry about all the burdens of having children.So after pulling away from all that, what is distilled out is the purest and most primitive desire. But in order to hold a hand, he went to outer space and followed closely. She was the only one in her eyes. Everything but her was not a problem, let alone considered, it was the original intuition of love.
Thousands of mountains and rivers, the waves are turbulent. At the last moment of paralysis, she still insisted on helping her complete the task.He would n't say, I love you, only quietly stretched out the little arm, and at the moment of fall, shy and lost, drawing small circles underground.He can't do much better than her, and can only find everything that can please her. Rubik's cube, light bulbs, musicals, small plants. Although she often blasted mushrooms everywhere, making him worry that Xiaoming would never have any time, he still bravely pursued it.They used that pair of manipulators to draw the simplest picture of love, beautiful and impeccable.There were urges to cry several times.
When he called her name, eva. Silly, always illegible, reading a little harder. When he always stretched out his hand carefully and retracted carefully. When she protected him and tried to fix him in a panic.about love. It was discovered in the movie that what we lost was not expression, but bravery.
We are not brave, but we are not brave for a person's love. Everyone is thinking about the sea once, forgetting it in the rivers and lakes, but look down on those who want to live and die, and resist the entanglement. How cowardly weeping, how shameful weeping for love, there will always be the next better and more suitable person, there are so many things in life that are worth bravely enjoying.We have become more likely to survive, our hearts have become harder and narrower to accommodate another person, and our love has become more ambiguous, free and easier, neither of which is the same.Men and women, just become strong and weak.
The strong is the mind, the weak is the heart. The more people grow up, the more they rely on mind and experience, not intuition. Regarding love, it is hard to escape this fate.My friend said to me, to judge love or not, just give it to the flesh. For the joy of the heart and the joy of the flesh, one can meet across thousands of mountains and rivers.

The Shawshank Redemption," I feel a lot
","Different people may see the same video differently. Regarding my current inability to change the status quo, the deepest feeling after watching this film is that talent and perseverance are the best way for anyone to be free in any situation.
The young banker in the film, with his proficient knowledge of bank finance, not only won his life safety and a little freedom in prison, but also gained material and spiritual benefits for his inmates. It is also because of his mastery of finances that the actor finally defeats the cruel and insidious warden in the end and gives himself material freedom.
On the other hand, look at the weekly application letter for six years, the application letter twice a week for N years, the tunnel that was dug out day by day with the stone axe that 'cannot dig a tunnel for 600 years,' The sewer pipe smashed with stones, the rotten sewer with a length of 500 while vomiting and crawling ... all these draw a word deeply: perseverance.
Anyone who wants to finally get the freedom under the blue sky and white clouds must have these two kinds of talents--excellent talent and tenacity.",10,1,1,20 March 2020
Parasite," Thought-provoking
","There should be such a journey in the course of everyone's life. It allows you to calm down and feel yourself and understand life. 'Aunt' is not so much a comedy movie as a warm road movie. In the tenderness and tenderness, Xu Yan described the anxiety and wolf howling in the middle-aged man as a last resort and wolfberry in a thermos cup. Teacher Huang Meiying, who plays her mother, is both acting and funny. Every move makes people shout 'It's too subtle'! The most amazing performance is the part of Yuan Quan. After she separated from Xu Yiwan, the wife she played was wearing a trench coat and leather shoes, striding among a group of exotic faces. That was both the liberation and rise of a woman, and the best ending of the whole story. I really like this adaptation of Little Lady. As a kid (actually until growing up) I was obsessed with why Jo and Laurie were not together. Because it's too long apart, I can remember very few details, except for two places, one is Laurie's tassels on Jo's apron, and the other is the secret code of their pillows.
Greta edited the conversation between Jo and the publisher in parallel with Professor Jo Yuzhong, giving the director a personal explanation: this is the needs of the times, and no romance wants the heroine to end with an old rich spinster. And I asked my question in a publisher's tone: I can't see why she wasn't with her childhood sweetheart? I feel like Greta and I have the same confused childhood. (Well, because of this I'm willing to give this movie five stars, even if it doesn't meet my expectations in a few places.) Once again, I would rather embrace such an open ending. I accept that protestanism influenced the interpretation of American novels during that period, but I do n't accept whether I went to their puppy love and said that the professor is the most suitable person (to his sequel).
The genius of the film is non-linear narrative, which distinguishes the past from the present with different hue and light. Some transitions were very genius, especially the comparison between Beth's first scarlet fever and his last death. Jo was also awakened but the right thing was wrong, and it really made me cry. It struck off the deteriorating section of Beth's body in the book, which kept me upset. And using intensified continuity editing directly blasted the result like a heavy tear gas bomb (also Beth said write for me. Amy said Beth is the best of us). Through a story, it deeply tells the social reality, and will make you automatically, think of more social reality, and make you dissatisfied with all the rich and poor. Its ability to arouse empathy and extend the association has been achieved. What you and I come into contact with every day in our society and experience every day. What this movie does not talk about, all broke out through the perception of this movie. This is the real power of this movie.
The film finally leads to a very sad ending. In the end, fate returned to zero, and all changes returned to the original point. After getting his father's Morse code, Jiyu vowed to make money and then bought the house in an attempt to make his father see him again. Of course, all this was realized in Jiyu's dream, but can it really be realized? Not to mention whether it can make enough money, even if it is done, can Jiyu's father really see the sun again? Isn't it a real cage waiting for him? Don't forget, he is a murderer.
You will find that the real scary part of this story is why Jiyu's father, driver Jin, finally killed President Park. The social phenomenon of inequality between the rich and the poor has made the poor intolerant, but the internal grievances are extremely deep, in this psychological and mental state. The slightest disrespect of the rich will cause a chain reaction of torrents and tsunami. He noticed that the uncle who rushed out of the basement waved his butcher knife towards Kiting, and driver Kim, after his middle-aged uncle fell, had nowhere to vent his anger. He eventually inserted the knife into President Park. However, killing President Park can really eliminate his anger? Can he reverse his fate? I'm afraid the answer doesn't need me to tell, everyone already knows.",8,0,2,18 March 2020
Rango," Who am I ?
","This is a movie suitable for teenagers and adults who are struggling to live in reality.We are all chameleons who love flower shirts, will shed their skin and change color, and are keen to play the heroes.We are greedy for the beautiful mask, and all the glory and enjoyment it brings. We kept changing colors, disguising and dreaming. Facing a thousand kinds of personnel, we have a thousand faces, a thousand forms, and a thousand dreams. We use countless lies and daydreams to weave a grotesque world-a fragile space that is all-encompassing.However, after wearing the mask for a long time, it is not the true face after all. There are too many lies, and you can't tell the truth from the truth. A beautifully crafted false world, no matter how beautiful it is, is ultimately false and unbreakable.Lango 's ivory tower was smashed by a traffic accident, he began to shed skin, began to change color frequently, began to disguise as his envious hero, and began to fabricate a big lie actively or passively; our tumultuous years gradually passed away, as if being stripped We have scars on the shelled shrimp, we are crazy to find new shells, and we gradually become what we once hated.Lango is looking for water, what are we pursuing? Lango found himself on the other side, and we once asked ourselves, who was I?'Regardless of the level of insight, a person can deeply organize his heart, this matter is very charming in itself.'I think knowing who you are, where you are coming from, and where you want to go is the first step on the right track of life. We are not born with the vision to see through the essence of things, nor are we naturally born with the ability to tolerate and accept our own defects and shadows, but at least we should have the courage to dare to see through. Ability can be cultivated, courage, but it is difficult to find it again.Should you be tired of the flamboyant Lango, should you also do it, watching the success or failure, the indignant owl?The story about Lango's opening after he recognized himself was more like another laugh from the director. Is he smart? No. Has his ability greatly improved? nor. Like the first half, his success is basically blessed by luck. Chicken broth has some perspective: Recognizing yourself does not bring a particularly intuitive benefit to life. Work hard on the ground so that this ideological storm will not become a joke.Let's talk about the other characters in the film. The mayor controls everything in the town, and absolute power leads to absolute corruption. If water can make me profit, then I will take it for my own use; if the people issue doubts, then I will make some stupid people's policies; what should I do if I have a prickly head and do not listen? I continue to incite public opinion and let the stupid people isolate you. The trick is pierced? It's okay, I'm violently repressing, letting you a few farts live or die.It is not difficult to find that many townsfolk fell into the trap just at the stage of the policy of stupid people. They have no big ambitions, but only water that can survive. Alive is their only pursuit. The mayor gave them a little sweetness, and they were grateful to Dade and convinced. Lango showed his skill by luck, and they vigorously pursued it.However, life, how uncertain and illusory. Maybe tomorrow will die of thirst? Even if there is water, can you keep your braid up if there is any accident? When the subject of life is left alive, they will lose their basic judgment and thinking, so they support the mayor, so they closely follow the footsteps of Lango and indirectly become the accomplices of the lack of law, the loss of morality, and the family of officials and bandits. , How sad.And who is isolated and regarded as a freak? It is a little mistress who often froze. For her, living is second, and continuing the vitality of her father 's farm is her lifelong pursuit. Although this pursuit seems ridiculous and extremely outdated in the context of the background, compared with the former, the level is much higher.It is precisely because the heroine not only pursues alive, she has a belief or goal more than others, so she first notices the clues of the bank and can see the disguise of Lango and dare to question the mayor. She's so dumbfounded that even though she is constantly derailed from reality, she sees life better than those who are sober all day long.In the chaotic world, there are heroes, bullies, revolutionaries, drifters, and naturally there are water-stealing thieves in the fly camp. But are you too good to condemn them? It's really difficult. In the face of survival, everything has to give in.Let 's not say that the life that ca n't live is suffering. In ordinary life, are we too deceived and squeezed too much, questioning too little resistance? Is it also tempted by fame and fortune to do some things to steal chickens and dogs? Faced with difficulties of all sizes, should we be silent or fight bravely?This is really difficult to choose. After all, I can't wait for a hero without a halo of protagonists, and I can't be a famous hero. However, this does not prevent us from restraining ourselves, seeing things and seeing people better, and being more transparent.'Everyone can't escape their own story.'At first glance, this sentence seems to be talking about the fate we talk about all the time.There is an excuse to say that fate is the weak, and luck is the humble word of the strong. But I am even more convinced that each person is born to have life, to be born to have luck, without distinction of strength or weakness, without distinction of height. Calling it destiny is worse than calling it ego, calling it the ultimate pursuit of the soul. That is the truth that can never be violated. Maybe some people don't know what they are pursuing for the rest of their lives. Or perhaps, many people have pursued too many things, go round and round, but eventually return to the original point.As mentioned above, knowing who you are is the first step in life. With this ability, we can see things around us more macroscopically and more thoroughly, and see the world in which we live. I do not seek to make this world perfect, but I want to live a clear and transparent life, and be worthy of the world. Even if it is ugly and unbearable, we can embrace it as hard as we embrace imperfect ourselves.I love this chameleon.May we all know who we are, where we come from, and where we want to go, may we all embrace the world vigorously, and may we all find our soul in the west.",7,1,1,10 April 2020

","As a reasoning film, Hannibal 's intelligence to Agent Starling is particularly intriguing. The lines between the lines are all points of the Buffalo Bill, which are worth scrutinizing. As a horror movie, Hannibal 's escape from prison in the building and the brutal killing of the two guards formed psychological fears, especially one of the prison guards The belly was hung on the cage like a butterfly, which deepened Hannibal's terrible impression of a high IQ cold-blooded killer.

This is a growing and full of contradictions. The role of Nolan is really good at describing human nature and choices, with black as white background. I admire Bruce's high sense of social responsibility, super repressive self-discipline and persistent adherence to principles. I am very touched to see the ending of his successful retirement. The righteous side, if you want to maintain the system or rules, you need to rely on a stronger force beyond the system or rules, but you ca n't just rely on this external force. More is to stimulate the endogenous power of the system or rules, and be firm The confidence of the internal group is mainly aspired to the humanity of truth, goodness and beauty. Most of the villains in the film insist on being inseparable ... Deeply speaking, there is no need to distinguish between right and wrong, and each other is a mirror. I think it is more worthy of reflection that the process of ideal establishment and continuous experience through life experience Correct and implement it with a high degree of self-discipline and perseverance. What we want to learn is this spirit. BTW. When the law or system disappears, people's original selfish desires start to swell, and only a high sense of morality can serve as the last barrier, sticking to good intentions to be human!",8,0,0,25 April 2020

","Almost all black actors, this is the biggest feature. There is no regular white or white superhero, the audience has a delay in acceptance, and the panther's superpowers are not very strong.The contrast between extreme intelligence and backwardness, a sharp contrast between modern technology and indigenous primitives, but they blend together very well, without surprise, the ending is as expected, the superhero wonAfrican symbols and human relationships.

Blade Runner," Creator's Philosophy
","The rise of science fiction movies in the 1980s, 'Blade Runner' is one of the most far-reaching films, creating a new film style-cyberpunk. Influenced many later famous movies.The label of science fiction movies is cool and gorgeous special effects. However, there are not many special effects in Blade Runner, but it has created a unique dark style. Almost all of the film is a night show: crowds of people come and go in the rain, showing the end of the city with the background music.One of the reasons why this movie is famous is because of its unique theme and style, so that it was too advanced in that era and was considered 'bad film'. It brings us a lot of thinkingThere is no complete decent and villain in the movie. The man-made people revolted because they did not want to succumb to their destiny. They had more power and wisdom than humans. They were sent by humans to the universe to survey new homes. It makes no sense. So they want to resist. In fact, the artificial people in the movie are just like the human beings just born, seeing the beauty of the world, and embarking on endless exploration. Nowadays, mankind has become the 'God' of man-made man, but he is not as kind as the God who created mankind. Mankind has always carried the arrogance of the Creator. Man-made humans have done too much work for humans from birth to death, but humans have not stopped their oppression. In the human world view, man-made humans are slaves. When man-made humans request developers to modify lifespan, they are ruthlessly rejected . However, at certain times, artificial humans are more humane than humans. At the end, Roy's monologue filled the film instantly, and the pigeons he flew seemed to represent that his soul was finally free.Now that AI technology is developed, there are always some problems: should robots have independent awareness? How should robots serve humans? What is the relationship between humans and robots? ----- 'Blade Runner' brings us reflection on the Creator.",7,0,0,6 May 2020
Toy Story 3," Everyone will grow up
","As we grew up, toys gradually left our lives, leaving our homes, and time was spent learning, not having time to play with toys. I'm very happy that toys can have new owners, treat them well and cherish their owners. Andy is really a good host. It's a waste to put it in the attic, let Bonnie help take care of them. There are new friends. Sunshine kindergarten is not sunny at all, and children do not know how to cherish toys and destroy them. The pink bear didn't expect to be so obsessed, the hatred was too deep, people saved you, but you avenged the hatred and deserved it. When it was clear that the button could be pressed but not pressed, I was really disappointed and disheartened. It vented its dissatisfaction with its owner on other toys, engaged in unfair class rule, and cheated on the doll. It is too selfish to let other toys go back, and it is difficult to imagine how much hardship they have experienced before returning home, only to find that the owner has found a new toy. The prison break of Sunshine Kindergarten is very exciting, and the seemingly beautiful places are also oppressive and dark. The period of changing clothes between Barbie and the male doll is very interesting. It reminds me that I particularly like to change clothes for the baby when I was young. The life and death of the junkyard, the three alien dolls are awesome, Buzz Lightyear matches Tracy as well, and Spanish Buzz is also interesting. Woody is smart and open-minded. When everyone was holding hands together to face the fire, they felt particularly tragic and not so afraid. This is the power of group unity. The friendship between toys is much deeper than I thought. I really hope that each of my toys is conscious and can choose its own owner or life. I have n't played with toys for a long time. At most, I hugged the dolls by the bed. My childhood is farther and farther away from me. My childlike hope is still there. I use children's imagination to give toys special meaning.",8,0,0,10 April 2020
Trainspotting," Becoming an ordinary person is not ordinary
","Drugs bring pleasure to the adolescent Renton, and even imagine that a beautiful sea is under the dirty toilet, and the death of the baby unveils this seemingly beautiful mask, nightmare of promiscuity, drug abuse, fraud, robbery. The hallucinations and fears in Renton 's detoxification reminded me of the little confusion in Wit Prison Life, no matter how much he loves Zhiyuan, he ca n't escape the end of relapse into prison. Renton, who has successfully detoxified, lived the life of ordinary people, and the arrival of Begbie and SickBoy broke this kind of calm. The indulgence and sinking of adolescence seemed to enter the life of Renton again. The £ 16,000 transaction dramatically prompted Renton to choose the path that most people recognized. Parents always want to teach their children their experiences, so that they can avoid detours, but the road is their own.

This movie is interspersed with various stagesThe glory of youth is bright, the applause of flowers contrasts with the bleakness of old age,It makes people feel desolate, sigh, there is a desolate feeling that everything is overwhelming
There is another place that makes me feel very deep, about family, about love.Eddie was forcibly taken away by her father when she was young, and survival was their biggest problem at that time.Once, she looked at a doll in the cupboard with envy. How dare she hope that a father, who seems to her to be grumpy and weak, will never pay her any attention to her? Can only bow his head silently.But, on the night she left, she gave the answer. She remembered that her father one day pulled out the doll from her pocket that she had been watching at the counter for a long time. She was very happy.From the original 'It turns out that not all fathers are the same, they will own all their children' to the end of the film, I really realized that 'All the fathers are the same, they will all own all their children.'

Jojo Rabbit," Composition Art and Metaphorical Symbolism
","In the lens of Taiga Viditi, there are not only the colorful world of spring, but also the magnificent and wonderful fantasy. If the former promotes the development of the plot as a hint of emotion and rhythm, then the latter is metaphor and symbol. Freedom Kingdom, the strangeness and indifference of Taiga films made me choose to examine the latter topic, and the reason why I juxtaposed 'composition art' and 'metaphorical symbols' is based on this understanding-Taiga In addition to the pure expressiveness of visual aesthetics, composition art has another connotation of metaphorical symbols, which is also its poetic nature.However, I think the charm of metaphor lies in its openness. Everyone can put forward different views. In the metaphorical world and the symbolic kingdom, there is no right or wrong, but only cleverness and beauty. However, the standard of this judgment is extremely Personalized, just as the beauty of the mirror is not that it reflects much of the world, but that everyone can reach its own ideal state through it, so unmistakable instructions and well-founded arguments are just a thousand paths. This article does not intend to enumerate the path taken by the author, but only provides a number of pregnant intersections for visitors to choose and follow. In other words, the author thinks that the image is the image. The value of the metaphor itself is far higher than its interpretable meaning. The gift that has not been opened is the most potential and therefore the best.",8,0,1,1 April 2020
Amélie," Her world
","There are many touching pictures in this movie. What impressed me was when Dominique walked into the telephone hall when he heard the phone ring and saw the scene behind the tin box next to the phone. It is undeniable that personnel changes and years of washing have the ability to make people forget to forget. As the movie lens turns to Emily hiding in the dark and watching carefully, I will also worry about whether Emily has found the right owner, Dominic Will he forget the childhood treasures, will he put it back in disdain ... As the camera slowly approaches Dominic's face, he slowly lifts the photo, takes out the model of the little biker, his eyes move, his eyes look When fluctuating, I know that Emily's efforts are best explained.
Admittedly, Emily's kindness and perseverance are admirable. What moved me more was that Dominique's tears when he saw his childhood collection. The middle-aged man walked into the slow-moving camera calmly. From his gray hair, tight eyebrows, and serious face, he could see that he had experienced the vicissitudes, had experienced the time, and the world had changed. Weary and heavy-hearted, but when we face the childhood treasure, we know that he still has the young man, the young self, the excited him, to drink to commemorate, his temples are like a cloud, like Waves, he and Emily's eyes burst into joy.
Maybe angels have this intention to send surprises to others, or maybe Emily would like to observe people's reactions.
Another detail that touched me is the contact between the two angels. When Nino followed the arrow signal Emily left him, he looked down and saw the arrow formed by Emily using pigeon bait, and he smiled knowingly when he looked up. Both of them like to observe and pay attention to observation. Nino can glue the pieces of the torn photos one by one, and no one can lie on the ground enough to help the broken photos under the camera cabinet. Similarly, Emily will observe Nino in detail, just as she observes the world in detail.
Because most of the shots of the entire movie are showing the world in Emily's eyes, from childhood playmates to hanging pictures and table lamps that can talk in youth, they are actually things in Emily's world. Is it fantasy? Is it difficult to understand? Who can deny that he had no illusions in his childhood, and who can force imagination to belong only to children? It is our own deprivation of this ability that gives life to surrounding things. Emily lives in her own world, but she will also quietly walk into the world of others to punish evil and reward good. If it is difficult to understand, it is actually because we have difficulty entering Emily's world.
In his childhood, he hoped his father would hug him. Without friends of the same age, Emily would find fun in her life, change coins, draw pictures, and eat strawberries. In her childhood, she witnessed her mother's death because she was hit by a person who fell off the building. Her father escaped into her own world. Emily was still growing up, still kind, imaginative, and smiling. Konggu has Youlan, which is not a fairy pond. Even if there is no warm Yang Fu, Ting Ting Fang years.
Is n't everyone in their own world? You and I are either on the streets of the cross, or in the fields and the countryside, looking at the same sky, not all clouds will be born in the heart, and not all will rain, but who will not try to interpret the world, How about turning it into a habitat for your life?Talk to the lake, hold hands with the wind,
Hiding under the blanket made by Luoxia, flying in the summer night sky,
Whose figure brings a reunion with the past,
In whose world dew will sing, moonlight will flow",9,0,0,28 April 2020
The Sixth Sense," Helping others is fulfilling yourself
","I thought it was a horror movie, and the result was a splendid and warm-hearted film. The reversal of the ending was unpredictable, but it was really wonderful. When I saw the ending, I burst into tears.Malcolm is a child psychologist. One day, he and his wife celebrated the social achievements they had just achieved. Then he met a patient who was ten years ago and asked him why he gave up treatment. Then he shot the doctor in the abdomen. Afterwards, the gunman himself killed himself with ammunition.A year later, Dr. Malcolm met Cole, a young patient with similar symptoms. Lonely and indifferent, it is always considered a freak by others. With the loss of the young patient in mind, the doctor decided to work hard to help the boy and make up for his inner regrets.At first boy Cole resisted uncooperative, but slowly the interaction between the two increased. Cole realized that the doctor really wanted to help him, and finally opened his heart, telling him that he had a secret and could see the dead anytime, anywhere. ghost.At first, Malcolm thought that this was a fantasy caused by mental illness, and felt that he could not give Cole professional treatment. Later, he had thought of giving up on Cole's treatment because his wife was more and more alienated from him, but recalled to the patient He treated the tape, and realized that Cole said it seemed true. So firmly continue to accompany and help Cole. And recommended Cole to help those ghosts. As Cole did, he also gained new confidence and calmness.The ending is not here spoiler, it is really exquisite design. Immediately recalled the ending of 'Passenger' starring Anne Hathaway.I have a lot of thoughts about watching movies.
To believe in children, you should not question them just because their perspective is different from that of adults.
To believe in love, you think that the other party is alienated, but you have forgotten your giving.
Choose bravery, even if the other party makes you uncomfortable, you must listen hard, give it the best kindness, and ultimately gain your own inner peace and strength.
To choose goodness and help others is to fulfill yourself.",8,1,1,8 May 2020
Rear Window," We are also voyeurs in front of the screen
","This drama may feel sparse and ordinary if you only watch the introduction, but if you watch it, you will be attracted by the dual perspectives inside. There is no place in the show that is violent and bloody, but as an audience, I always hold a heart It 's like riding a roller coaster. This is the unconventional technique. To go deeper, the peeping from the rear window is not only about the role of the movie, but also about us in front of the screen. Perhaps this is also a metaphor for the movie. , We also want to peep into the photographer 's inner world through a movie (a B station up master analysis said that Hitchcock first made us realize that we are all voyeurs like the male host through the establishment and destruction of the identification relationship)What is the back window? Undoubtedly, most people will think of themselves standing by the window and watching the surroundings and even spying on the neighborhood. This is human instinct. Peeping is a manifestation of human curiosity, but from another perspective, watching movies is not It is also a kind of prying? We spy on the framed scene in the screen, just like the protagonist of this movie, secretly spying on a section of the neighborhood life in the window.What's interesting about this movie is that it gives us two perspectives. We are both onlookers and participants. The first half of the male had to spend time at home due to leg problems, so in order to pass the time and his photography addiction, he began to observe the neighborhood. We are bystanders in this part. In the second half, due to the discovery of the murder, the male host started to interact with the world outside the window by calling and handing a note. Even when we saw the female host being caught by the murderer over the window, the whole heart was crumpled, especially the last murderer. When I was aware of the situation, I went upstairs to find the male host. The heavy footsteps were more real than the fear caused by the visual spectacle of all the horror movies I have seen. At this time, we are a participant in the story. , There is a positive interaction with the surroundings.To make a digression, the hostess is too beautiful to look unreal, like the girl in the pictorial.",8,1,1,22 April 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end of the journey
","The reason the Lord of the Rings is so long but so many people love to watch or even repeat it is probably because you are really tightly touched by the plot. According to the routine of watching movies now, there is no urine point. I am afraid that the next scene will be the first story.I think this is the best setting. You do n't die in the hands of men. When you look at the front, you do n't even think that the original pen was buried so long ago.Even if it is a disparity in power, in order to defend its homeland, it will certainly not take a step back.Although the war is very enjoyable, it is true that no matter which forces participate in the battle, they will not get the benefits.In this part, Sam is really the best spokesperson of the partner. Even if he was driven away by a friend's misunderstanding, he came back to save the friend. In the last section, Frodo has no way to continue to move forward, because the ring is not only a burden on the soul, it also has The effect of gravity bonus is added. Sam 's sentence, I ca n't help you bear the burden, but I can bear your tears, such a burden is to help Frodo bear the burden of the task!The temptation of the Lord of the Rings is almost that you will come out in the next moment of reassurance to prove to you that its influence has always been there, even Frodo is still tempted at the last moment, unwilling to destroy the ring. In the end, he lost his finger to destroy it, although it cannot be said that he destroyed it. Therefore, the existence of Guru is difficult to define. According to the plot I have read now, if there is no Guru, it is really difficult to say whether the Lord of the Rings can be successfully destroyed.Back to the original starting point, Bilbo did not kill the greedy and timid grunt from the beginning, and Frodo let him go when he could kill him. This reminds me of Gandalf 's follow-up but did not stop him from the first part. He said that even a wise man cannot decide the life or death of a person. This sentence may also be a deep and deep foreshadowing. Right.",9,0,0,12 April 2020
The Matrix," Life choices in the Matrix
","For 1999, such a movie is undoubtedly extremely avant-garde. Even if it is put into the present, it is a masterpiece that is impeccable in content and shooting style.The thing that strikes me the most is actually their clothes. The theme of hacking, sunglasses and reflective leather jackets give people a shock from the inside out. It is completely beyond my knowledge. There are only three words_too much. The image of the man in black is the first in the era. As long as these three words are mentioned, my mind will automatically emerge.Back to topic life choice.
This is a very important point for me, let me understand why Thoreau said that the pursuit of truth is painful and happy. There is a character in the Matrix (I forgot the name). He lives every day after being chased by the enemy. He can't find the direction. He can't see the so-called real hope. So he decided to compromise with that virtual world, and with things that at least he could hear and feel and enjoy. He would rather give in than live too tired ...I think this is the same as our current situation. We know what happiness is most satisfying for us, but moths surrender voluntarily at the feet of those short-lived happiness. We clearly know what is the best, but we can't stand loneliness and loneliness, and the mentality of holding a broken jar is completely sinking. If you do n't have a firm heart and blindly follow your most current desires, then your life may be very happy, but there are very few things that can be recalled before you die.Is that really happy? We need to ask ourselves.Is this enough?Are we here to enjoy it?Clearly knowing that the juicy perception is false, why should we choose that fake beef?can not be like this.This is the reason for delayed happiness.What is happiness? Probably the pursuit of truth, the pursuit of refinement.",9,0,0,19 April 2020
Heat," Fate and loneliness
","A strong taste of Hong Kong-style gangster films.The lens seems to be immersed in the deep blue sea, the night view of the city in the distance, and the endless sea outside the window of the protagonist's house. All the scenes reveal a sad and fateful feeling of loneliness. The film jumps out of the binary opposition between right and evil, depicting the protagonist's process of continuous tearing between the family and individual choices in the rivers and lakes, and each character is full of tension.What is interesting is that the policeman played by Al Pacino is crazy and arrogant. Instead, he is like a criminal on the edge of the society. The sense of justice in his heart is like a parasite. He continues to grab his mental power, making him The pursuit of justice is alienated into an animalistic stubbornness. The leader of the gang played by De Niro, Bin Bin, is polite and gentle, but like a senior white-collar worker in an office building. The contrast of the temperament of the two characters is also one of the film's dramatic tensions, and at the same time expresses the director's perception of the complex aspects of human nature, making the film's ideology more diverse.In the first half of the film, the rhythm was dull, and in the second half, the feeling of conflict from the official confrontation between the two was more intense. It reached its climax in the final duel of the forbidden two. At the end of the two, I was defeated, The emotions that had been foreshadowing broke out. Although the director still used the genre film to tell and lay out one at a time, the cold and swaying lens texture and the actor's personal charm made the film have a clear stylistic tendency, which is one of the attractions that attracted me.",8,0,0,4 May 2020

Ran," Ran
","I think one of the more prominent aspects of this movie is the treatment of death and some major changes. Before death and some turning points, there was no preparatory work, but this thing happened naturally in a seemingly flat tile. . For example, the protagonist's sudden death, before this, there was not even any sign. Sometimes life and change are like this. Shaking people's hearts in peace is the power of real substitution. Although some deaths and accidents were sudden, they were calm. However, this does not mean that the film lacks a close-knit, but that his close-knit is more reflected in the changes in the relationship between the characters in some events. Death is also very dramatic, but his dramatic treatment of death is unconventional. Death should be a relatively important node in our previous drama concept, and it is also a more vigorous and tragic thing in our life concept, but when we return to life, death often occurs, not as we have agreed in the past. Roaring accompanied by tragic and accompanied by all predictable foreshadowing, death and even other things as usual, just a certain event, he may have a huge impact different from other things, but before and during and After it happened, it might not be like the fanfare we imagined. This conflict between the abnormal planning and treatment of the dramatic state and the previous mass perceptions has caused very large psychological and logical effects. Everyone saw the passing of a life in a tile, and suddenly, despite the calm, it contained a stronger force than the hustle and bustle, the sudden death of Xiuhu, the sudden death of the three sons, all these issues were handled in this way, It makes people feel impermanence in the absence of God. However, in order to avoid the tiredness caused by this sudden tiling process, Kurosawa adopted exaggerated colors and stage effects to deal with colors, and the form and content were highly rebelliously merged, becoming a classic of film and television.",8,0,0,5 May 2020

He is good at weaving Xiao En Xiao Hui Xiao Xiao into a shabby but durable rope, and set it out, always getting some benefits back. In his case, there is no way out. Even if there is no job, the weight of the 26 hot dogs will at least be enough for him to collect 50 dollars.On the contrary, Tang (Mahshara Ali), as a well-established musician, does not touch the spring water with his fingers, and the ornate residence on the top of the theater, plus a high throne, is enough to exaggerate his identity and glory. Such a person is self-denying and elegant. If he wants to eat, he must lay a napkin of good quality.Such two people who couldn't beat each other in life were tied together for two months because of the employment relationship they needed each other.Everyone looks down on each other.

The Great Escape," Prison Break-Great Escape
","Good luck!Thank you.The famous Steve McQueen is known as the first tough guy in Hollywood, and the Great Escape is his masterpiece.The story is adapted from real events and escaped from the German Nazi concentration camp. This is the goal. How to do it? Some pretended to be lumberjacks, some were hidden in the truck that transported the branches, and some came to the blind spot. They all failed and were confined.McQueen's character always likes to pick up a baseball catching glove to play baseball after being caught.One person 's plan is often full of loopholes, but the plan of a group of people is much more rigorous, digging three tunnels, division of labor and cooperation, joint effort to escape, plus Steve McQueen 's private escape during the arrest and gag, the movie looks vivid and interesting . Specific to how to dig a hole, how to discard soil, and how to avoid landslides, this can only be thought of by people who really have escape experience. Making musical instruments, making wine, making uniforms, and living in concentration camps are also quite rich. Of course, some people died because of their escape.The Nazi portrayal is not rigid, some of them are very good, some are very bad.To shoot a jailbreak movie, you really need to dig a tunnel, and you really need to prepare the tunnel. This is the fun of a movie with facts. You have to face the problem of how to leave Germany, so you have to falsify your documents in advance and learn German well. After escaping, some people took the train, some people stolen bicycles, some people hitchhiked, some people rowed boats, some people grabbed planes, McQueen snatched motorcycles.Only boaters and cyclists managed to escape, others were arrested and 50 people were killed. After McQueen was arrested, he was put in confinement, and he started playing baseball in the confinement room. It turned out that Hollywood was more than Shawshank's redemption.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A little experience
","This is generally counted as the fifth in the entire series. Imagination is still amazing.Unfortunately, the plot is a bit rough. Taking the beginning of the movie as an example, Luke was stunned by a white bear-like creature at the beginning. As in the previous one (1977), he was suddenly stunned by the desert clan. As another example, as a skywalker, Luke was the largest rebel army Hope, because the people in the night are hard to resist, they will not go to the rescue, but the mentality of finding people the next morning is like knowing that Luke will survive; and Han Solo actually took off his mask on the way to luke After seeing a person lying on the ground at a long distance, he knew that it was Luke, and he let Luke get into the belly of the rider to keep out the cold.

Braveheart," Freedom-the will to die
","After watching the movie, I can't wait to find the information and want to get a more real and detailed understanding of the history of the national war in Scotland at the end of the 13th century.After reading the information, I found that there is a big discrepancy between the film and the historical facts, but this does not affect the film as an epic blockbuster with profound nationalism and political connotations. I do n't care whether the real William Wallace is as iron-blooded tenderness or bloodthirsty as depicted in the film. Whether the 'Brave Heart' originally refers to King Robert Bruce 's 'Bruce Heart', I do n't care if the script itself has I do n't extol the history and narrate the characters and narrate the characters. I care about the Scots 'chest pillow against the slavery that guards their homeland. What I care about is that the men who are eager to fight freely and bloody. The brave heart that belongs to all the protesters and takes freedom as a persistent pursuit of faith is the real 'brave heart'. It is in every detail of the Scottish blood vessel, and it runs with the red blood Return to the heart.The melodious bagpipes wafted in the endless deep blue mountain peaks of Scotland, and then drove down slowly, swirling slowly, drifting into the white misty canyon, and blowing into the secluded lake with the wind. When seeing the beautiful homeland being trampled mercilessly, every civilian rose from the bottom of his heart with anger, sorrow, and the purest heart of the naked child from within. This kind of red heart is similar to a simple natural passion. It is made of heavy and irregular pebbles in his arms, small stones in his hands that can accurately hit the enemy, and trees made in the land of his hometown. Rough spear. The ancient Scottish bagpipes played melancholy music, and the whispering song told the hearts of the people who lived under the huge gray sky.William Wallace, a hero, a myth, as a pioneer of the National War of Independence, together with thousands of bloody and sacrificed warriors paved a bright tunnel to freedom for Scotland, no matter how far the end is, bright When will it come. He was like the hardest unyielding stone among them, and his faith of freedom shone in the darkness with a stubborn glimmer. Some people like to discuss the reasons for his uprising and the reasons for his failure in textbooks. In fact, we are not qualified to judge his limitations from a historical standpoint. I prefer to stand in the perspective of humanity and feel the civilian hero Patriotic feelings. As Queen Elizabeth said, he is a careless man. The motives of his uprising, he naively believed that nobles, all because of his pure nature, and the purest faith that always hangs on his lips. Freedom, the will to die. In this film, he is called William Wallace, and for another reader, he will be pronounced the soul of the nation.",8,0,2,26 April 2020

Compared to a real person, Samantha is simply a perfect lover: always online, always back in seconds; absolutely understanding, never raising unreasonable demands; there will be no disputes; more knowledgeable and smart than everyone else; independent Personality; jealousy, thoughts, anger, and other human feelings; romance is more romantic than all women.Of course Samantha has no body, but is it important? In a way, the body is really nothing.Martina Roseblatt did not call this name before. At the age of 40, he decided to transgender into a woman.

Hacksaw Ridge," A war film with embellishment of faith and love
","A few days ago, a friend shared with me and watched this movie. After two days of delay, I just watched it when I was free. In short: Wow, I'm so touched, this movie is great.
Expand to talk about feelings, there are the following aspects
1. In terms of freedom of belief. I like the quote at the end of the film 'I think any behavior that interferes with the beliefs of others is wrong.' The belief of the male lead in the film is really difficult to understand and has an impact on others and even yourself. But the principle-driven spirit of the male host is hard to follow. Dare to ask you in your life, when you encounter other people's incomprehension, and when people around you persuade you to give up your obsession many times, can you be brave and say no? I might be hesitant. It's a lot. It can be really difficult to insist on self regardless of everything.
2. Love respect. The love of the male host is also very sweet, full of love from all angles. From the ignorance of the male host when he fell in love at first sight, to the regretful wedding scene, the dialogue between the female host and the priest when the male host was absent. Priest: 'Sometimes men will flinch' Mistress: 'Some men will, but my Desmond will not.' There will be follow-ups when the male host is stubbornly imprisoned, the female host backs up, I think this is inseparable It is also a good point to see the true feelings in adversity without giving up. The ending paragraph was also very touching. The male host was injured and was put on a stretcher. He still remembered to blow up the bible sent by the female host. About this Bible throughout the movie, it is faith and love. Perhaps the sentence of the hostess: 'I think you put me in my heart' or the 'I'm waiting for you to come back' behind the hostess's photo, all support the male host to go through every moment. With the victory of Gang Saw Ridge, the stage of seeing Wu Siren finally came to an end.
3. War aspect. As a war movie, there are definitely many details about war. From the perspective of the male father, from the male father 's father borrowing wine to visit the sacrificed comrades, to the helplessness of the father when he saw the male brother wearing the military uniform, and then to the male father 's father to put on the military uniform again to save the male father. Perhaps the understanding of war seems to be changing quietly. From the perspective of the male lead, from volunteering to be a military doctor, to insisting on self in the face of other people's incomprehension, to the end to save the wounded regardless of his own safety, these deeply moved me. The pinnacle lies in the silent line in the mind of the male host when he saves himself: 'Help me got one more.' This sentence reminded me of the medical staff and many beautiful retrogrades who faced the epidemic and ignored the danger of life. Perhaps it is the phrase 'Let me save another one'. This selfless spirit is sublime and respectable.",8,0,1,5 April 2020
Gladiator," Tragic legend
","The film began in the winter of 180 AD, according to the prologue of the head of the photo. At that time, the Roman Caesar-Marcus Aurelius, hereinafter referred to as the old emperor, after two decades of war, Rome reached the peak of power. To North Africa and north to southern England, the beginning of the film is the old emperor led the army to the Germania of Armenia, the Germans are retreating, the latter is already a war in the urn, and the general of the northern Roman army Maximus Maximus prepared for the army in the early morning. , Ready to give the Germans a final blow.At the beginning of the film, the first shot was given to Massimos 's hand. Even if it was watched for the first time, the audience subconsciously could reflect that it was the protagonist 's hand. The person in the shot was walking forward while stroking the wheat ears in the field. Wheat is the most important crop in the Latin region of the Mediterranean. That person must be on the farm. With light and sad humming, people subconsciously reflect this story as a tragedy. Next, I immediately switched to Massimos dressed in a uniform, with a snow-covered back and a cold wind, and the fur cape on my shoulders couldn't help but flutter. It was a flat shot. Generally speaking, the shots we give to heroes are usually Looking up, the shot for the villain is usually looking down, but this plain flat shot makes people understand the director's style: I am just a narrative person. And the war is imminent, why is this person absent-minded and his eyes flickering? Next came a bird flying away. The person stared at the bird and showed a pleasant smile, as if envious of the bird. The above are all foreshadowings. When I watched the audience, I suddenly realized that the director had explained the most warlike general in Rome from the beginning. He didn't like to fight. He just wanted to go home to farm. He was a very simple soul.The troops are ready to attack, everything has been arranged properly, and only the soldiers who persuaded the surrender to bring back a message. As always, Massimos observed his troops in the trenches, on the one hand, to observe the status and morale of the soldiers, and on the other hand, to tell the soldiers that he was by their side. When the soldiers saw Massimos coming, they all stood up, and they all showed relief smiles and respectful eyes. From here, they knew that this general was extremely prestigious in the army, and won the respect and trust of the soldiers. In the soul. Even though he was so tired, seeing Massimos came, he still had to stand up and put on a ready look before the general, so as not to disappoint the general. After reviewing all the way, Massimos came to the deputy and told the deputy that the troops were tired and hungry and no longer wanted to fight. The implication was that if this were the last battle, the troops might not be able to sustain it. It took too long. Here again shows that Massimos has a very rich experience. After a few observations, the status of the troops can be known. Then the adjutant said that the range of the catapult and the front sight were not set in place, and it might hurt the cavalry around by mistake. Massimos said that this error was acceptable. Next, we saw why he personally led the cavalry around. To put it this way, he not only has rich commanding experience, but also has a lot of experience in battlefield charging. He knows how not to be hit by his own catapult during the charge, which is within his control.The persuasion soldiers had their heads cut, and the Germans came out of the woods to call for battle. Massimos immediately realized that the persuasion failed and immediately prepared to charge the cavalry. First, it was a routine, to encourage morale. Don't disperse the formation, don't be afraid of death, you are doing glorious things, and the tone of the soldiers makes the soldiers laugh, which also confirms that he finally said, 'They said that the god of death smiled at everyone, all you have to do is laugh back.' Then from the rear The Germans were plagiarized, the battle continued for a day, and the Germans were wiped out. In fact, from the comparison of the lineup of the two armed forces at the beginning, we can see that there is no suspense in this battle. The old emperor sat in the rear army all the way, and after the battle came to see Massimos, 'What should I reward the greatest general in Rome?' 'Let me go home.' Massimos confided his voice, which was also his The goal I hope to achieve throughout the article has never been achieved. The old emperor did not immediately answer him. Such a good general, the emperor must have a heavy trust. How could it be possible for you to go home? Massimos gave his reason: 'This battle is over and no battle is over.' It means that I am a soldier, and I should have gone home if I did not fight. The emperor also gave him the reason: 'There are always battles', which means that he has more and more important things to entrust to Massimos. Over the years, the two have had a tacit understanding, Massimos understand At this point, I do n't know what the real intention of the emperor Lao Er is.Space is limited. Forgive me, I will only talk about Massimos, not to talk about the prince Commodus, the empress Lucia, and the emperor Lucius. After returning to the barracks, Massimos first thing was to go to the tent to see the wounded soldiers, and chatted with the military doctor. Here we can see that he cares about the loss of troops and horses before and after the war. He is not like the elders. A politician is not like the royal dignitaries. He knows the essence of the war, and he knows every trouble in the middle. Back at the celebration feast, the prince Commodus invited him to serve for himself, and wanted to win him over. Massimos did not give a clear answer; the senator told him: 'You hold a heavy soldier, you will have considerable political power to speak.' Meaning The army listens to you alone, don't you have any ambitions? Want to 'share great things with him'. However, Massimos did not reply directly because of the occasion. If he was on the battlefield, he estimated that he would have killed these chewing people. From here we can see that on the one hand, Massimos is in control of the overall situation on the battlefield and is invincible, but politically he knows nothing at all and does not want to participate in these things. In his logic, the soldier is a soldier, It's okay to fight the battle well. There are so many broken things.Early the next morning, Massimo groaned with his brothers at the camp, but he could not have breakfast with his brothers today. The emperor summoned him this morning and asked him to go to the emperor to camp. From this, it can be seen that his military career was spent with his own grass-roots soldiers, which explains why the soldiers have such a good relationship with him, so listen to him. After seeing the emperor, the emperor was still writing his own diary (Marco Ole remained in his own twenty-year Rongma career and has been writing a diary, sometimes as a memo, sometimes as a dialogue, this diary is right Later generations have a profound influence, whether it is important for future generations' life, or historical archaeology.) The old emperor pretended to be mysterious and asked him why we came here. Massimos did not understand the meaning of the old man. In this regard Massimos will not work anymore. The old emperor's political attainments are also estimated to be extraordinary. He has a clear level of speech and sets up many institutions. Fortunately, the old emperor liked Massimos. If he wanted Massimos to die, Massimos probably died without reacting. Massimos replied: We are here to conquer the land and glorify Rome. This is a very orthodox subordinate answering the tone of the superior. The old emperor obviously did not let him report to work, so he set aside the first layer of cloud and began to suggest to the topic, roughly meaning: 'I am old, Massimos, In the twenty-four years of my reign, I only brought four years of peace to the people, and the remaining twenty years of war. What will people think of me in future generations? Does my life make sense? 'Massimos probably does not hear the emperor for the first time. Tucao was born, and he knew that what the emperor wanted to say was coming, so he planned to follow the emperor's words. The emperor interrupted him and went to bed, meaning that we let go of our fears and opened the skylight to speak brightly, but not ourselves. Say, let Massimos first say that political literacy is evident. Massimos goes straight, you let me say, I said, 'I brought five thousand people, but two thousand could not go back, the rest Thousands of them died after a half, and they fought for Rome. 'He narrated his beliefs, as well as the beliefs of the troops. He thought all this was meaningful and did not want the emperor to doubt himself. The emperor gave a new question: 'What is Rome?' Massimos further said: 'I have been to many other places, dark and savage, Rome is like light.' From here, Massimo Si is truly loyal to Rome and truly recognizes his motherland. This is the old man testing his inner loyalty to the motherland.Then the old emperor began to enter the real purpose, let Massimos talk about things in his home, this is not a dialogue between the king and the minister, but a dialogue between men. As soon as Massimo talked about this, he smiled, and his eyes were shining. This seemed to be the topic he was most interested in. Here, seeing that the thing he cares most about is his wife and son, he was absent-minded before the beginning of the war and was thinking: 'This It's the last battle, I don't want to overturn the boat in the gutter, I haven't gone back in a year, I don't know if my son will ride a horse, I don't know my wife ... 'And the emperor Obviously he heard the answer he expected. After testing wheth",8,0,0,23 April 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," father and son CP
","Needless to say, this is a successful commercial movie, which combines all the essential elements of commercial movies.
The director is Steven Spielberg, one of the screenwriters is George Lucas, starring Harrison Ford, Sean Connery, Rui Fan Phoenix.
Although I do n't like certain commercial movies very much, this lineup is also quite high-profile, but it 's all floating clouds for me. Anyway, I came to Lord Sean Connery.
The plot is compact and coherent, the logic is rigorous, and it is done in one go. The fighting scenes and the chasing scenes are also very exciting. You ca n't stop watching if you want to stop.
The beginning of the film is a very classic train chase and fight plot, Rui Fan Phoenix's performance is quite brilliant, many people think of the Phoenix River forever.
This movie has added comedy elements, making it into an adventure treasure hunt comedy movie.
This film can basically be summarized as the story of Jones and his least tacit dad and pig teammates adventure treasure hunting. The father and the son took risks and laughed along the way to seek reconciliation, and the pig team dragged their feet behind to deal with bad things friendly. Of course, in the end, there must be a happy ending. After watching all the comedy, no one wants to end the tragedy.
The film once asked Tom Stoppard to rewrite the dialogue between Jones and his son, no wonder that the dialogue between them is humorous and interesting.
The comedy bridge and laughs of the entire film are focused on the relationship between Dr. Henry Jones played by Sean and the curator played by Denholm Eliot and the father and son of Jones.
I didn't expect Sean to have such a strong talent for comedy. Henry Jones was all smiles. Wearing a round hat, matching glasses, plus a leather bag and an umbrella, this outfit is also amusing.
When Old Jones appeared, he treated his son as a Nazi, and later distressed that the porcelain of his son was broken. After discovering that it was a fake, he laughed and laughed. This father is really no one. When his son discovered that his father was not distressed, he was filled with that helpless disappointment.
So the father and son embarrassed and did not tacit understanding of the adventure began.
The son asked his dad to use a lighter to burn the ropes that bound them, and the result was a self-defeating fire, which triggered the fire while avoiding the fire. The father and son sat in front of the turning door and looked at a house of Nazis.
When there was no way to escape, my dad shouted and said that he would sit down and think about it, which just touched the exit mechanism, so his son crawled to the exit. I have to tremble with a smile when I write here.
When his son cleverly got rid of the Nazi chase on a motorcycle and looked happily at his father, he hoped to get a response, but the old Jones wiped his glasses boringly. He didn't feel anything exciting.
The son dragged his dad away, but the dad always slowed down.
Finally, he and I got into the airship, and finally the father and son could start the warm chat mode. The dad sat with his eyes wide open and waited for a chat with his son, but the son found out that he really had nothing to say to his dad. He could only talk about work.
The gap between their father and son is that the father thinks he knows his son very well and thinks he is the second himself. The son does not need him. The son felt that his father had never cared about him, and he always ignored himself.
In the end, Old Jones changed his name to 'Indiana' instead of 'Junior' in order to wake up his son.
Although it is the father and son with no tacit understanding, it is definitely the best father and son CP.",8,0,0,3 May 2020

On the way, he inquired that the guardian god of the forest, the mountain beast god, could resolve this curse, and he set off to the forest. On the way, he rescued two people who transported iron ore to the valley and met Shan for the first time. These two people were from the iron smelting plant in Abercy.In the iron workshop, he unveiled the cursed fan of the wild boar god: Abbey attacked the forest with a musket, and the wild boar god guarding the forest, the god of Nago, became a demon because of hatred after hitting her musket.

The sound I made was the same reckless and disobedient. Thanks to Sister Wachowski for contributing such a wonderful script. This movie is one of the few movies that I have to go back and listen to the lines several times and then check the words. (Especially in the section where V introduced himself)Seeing Evey fooled by V, but using life to guard so little integrity, really made me feel until you find something matters more than life, dont die.'Because in this world if I were to invite I desired I would undoubtedly find myself without home, let alone a tv show' Talented people serve the political machine, so sad!'There is a face beneath this mask but it's not me, no more that face the muscle beneath it or the bones breath them' Privacy. She implied that in a big data environment, in the Internet age, under the premise that everyone's heart is monitored, part of the possibility of a person is in their privacy.I saw anarchism, a political state that was not oppressed by totalitarianism. Revenge of V, complete his mission. And it was Evey who pulled the trigger, and revolutionized her future.",8,0,0,6 May 2020
The Godfather," Man's bible
","I did n't understand when I was young, but I was not mature enough at the time. Now it seems that it can indeed be said that it is a man 's Bible.In the United States in the 1940s, the mafia represented by the godfather Corleone fought openly for the benefit of their families, full of men's scams and conspiracies.The godfather Corleone is one of the mafia leaders with political resources. Because he refused to expand the drug business with other mafia, he was excluded by other gangs. People in the family were killed one after another. Corleone was almost killed, but he Always keep to the bottom line of non-drug trafficking. After the death of Corleone, his youngest son, Mike, took over his father's class. He was calm, cold, and even cold-blooded, and he was vicious, gradually letting the family grow stronger and become the godfather of the new generation.In the film, the director showed the image of a man who is a godfather. He has good insight and sensitivity. He is concealed, knows to adapt to the current situation, knows the good and evil, and also has a bottom line to take care of the family. It has excellent educational significance for men in troubled times or in today's peaceful age.Baunasala 's opening request for help reflects that in the United States in that era, the law and the police did not fully represent justice, and people had to seek the Mafia to provide so-called justice. Even in the face of investigations by federal detectives, the Corleone family did not take them into consideration, because the good relationship between Corleone and politicians made the government not good for them.Corleone has three sons, a daughter, son-in-law, and an adopted son. The eldest son Sonny is a typical son-in-law, and he doesn't understand politics and power. Because of his unfriendly attitude towards his sister-in-law, Carlo leads to collusion with the killing of outsiders. The second son, Fredo, was cowardly and became a playboy because of his involvement in the family's casino business in Las Vegas, but he was still timid. The daughter-in-law had not been planned into the family business, but Carloine killed Sonny and was also killed by his younger son Mike. Mike is Corleone's favorite son. Through Mike's composure to deal with the murder of his father in the hospital, the courage to enter the Tiger's Cave, and the later performance of taking over the family business, it should be most like Corleone. Corleone should be the earliest to see Mike's potential And he loves him the most, but Corleone did not want Mike to be involved in the family business. Because of the conflict with the drug lord Sorozo's business, there were too many accidents, and Mike had to take over the family business. Adopted son Tom is also a good player in politics, calm and calm in the event, and is loyal to the business of the Corleone family. The arrangement of 'being out' after Mike took over the family business is estimated to let Carlo show the original shape.After his gunshot wounds improved, even after his son Sonny was killed, Corleone did not concentrate on revenge and did not have full emotional affection. Instead, in exchange for a solution to the conflict, he promised to escort the drug business. This is really not easy. It is not what ordinary politicians can do.Mike takes good care of his beloved woman, and although he will also find another couple, he will never get rid of flowers. Sometimes she used good faith lies in exchange for her wife 's trust, so that she would not fall into the fear of gangsters.Movies and books are called men's bibles, and there are indeed many places that I should study and learn from. However, after all, it is still the Western 'Bible'. Our ancestors also have a lot to teach us, which is more worthy of all of us to understand and learn.",9,0,0,12 April 2020
