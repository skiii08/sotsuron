Saturday Night Fever," Disco Inferno Is Burning! (And this is before 'Boogie Nights')
","Wow...another cult classic film!  I've seen quite a few movies from the 1970's, and next to 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', this one is the best. John Travoltra is an excellent dancer and I thought that this movie had some of the greatest and unforgettable dance moves ever thanks to the guy who choregraphed every step that John's character, Tony, danced to.  The Bee Gees are some of the greatest song writers of all time, and you can't help but be impressed by the sound that they add to this film!  'Saturday Night Fever' is one of the best films from the 1970's!",9,0,1,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: It's Truly OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!
","I went to see this movie alone, because no one in my house, but me, likes Star Wars.  What I love about Star Wars, both the old ones and new one, is the vivid immagination and effort George Lucas puts in this movie.  In my opinion, I don't know what the critics were thinking when they gave this movie a bad review.  But hey, everyone has different tastes!!!Anyhow, this movie was very impressing.  I was at the edge of my seat when I was watching when the war went on.  Four different fights all rolled into one part (Whoo-hoo!!!)!  I really enjoyed Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace as much as I did with Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Backs, and The Return of The Jedi.  I can't wait for the others to come out.  And to be honest with you, with the new technology they have in movies like Star Wars, I honestly think it was better than ever.  It was great in the three original, but it really brightens up the screen when you watch this.THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE! What were you movie critics thinking...giving this movie a bad review!?",10,0,1,22 June 1999
The Mummy," It Was Okay
","I fell asleep to this movie.  I thought it was going to be really good, but I found it just the opposite.  Plus, the beginning of the movie was really gruesome and the movie itself was kind of freaky!  I didn't enjoy this movie, and basically the only thing I enjoyed were the special effects.  I must admitt, the effects were awesome, but the movie...it was so boring!!!",Null,0,0,19 October 1999
Romeo + Juliet," Shakespeare Goes Modern I See
","William Shakespeare is one of my favorite writers of all time.  He was a true master at what he did, and his work featured every element:  Romance, drama, comedy, fantasy, you name it!  And it's not a big surprise that his work is made into films.  I've seen two versions of Romeo and Juliet in film. One was the one starring Oliva Hussey (Juliet)and Leonard Whiting (Romeo) which dates back to 1968, and this one starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Daines.I liked both versions at the same level, because they are both great in their own ways.  In this case, this one takes place in modern time.  For example, Verona, Italy is now Verona Beach, and the Prince is head of a police squad.  The famous balcony scene takes place in a swimming pool, and there are guns rather than swords and daggers.I loved this version of the classic play by Shakespeare, not only because it's more up to date, but because it is creative and besides the modern elements added to this film, not one thing changed compared to the original play (unlike what they did to 'Great Expectations' starring Ethan Hawke, which is a disappointment)!  An excellent piece of work and a true masterpiece!!! :o)",10,2,4,30 July 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," A Hilarious Remake of Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew'!
","Shakespeare's works are being remade into films these days.  Some stick to the same old plot while others are remade to fit today!  '10 Things I Hate About You' is not exception!Like it's original version, 'The Taming of the Shrew', '10 Things I Hate About You' is about the Stratford sisters, Katarina (Julia Stiles) and Bianca (Laris Oleynik).  While Biance tries her best to persued her anti-dating father to let her go out w/ the conceited Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), Katarina (aka the Shrew) holds her little sis back from ever going near Joey.  Yet someone else has his eye on Biance Stratford - new student, Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).  The only problem is, the Stratford sisters aren't allowed to date.  Soon, the rule changes:  'You can date...when she (Katarina) does.'Katarina, herself, has no interest in dating until she is fixed up w/ Australian born Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) thanks to Cameron, his AV friend Michael (David Krumholtz), and surprisingly - JOEY DONNER!!!  As love blooms for Patrick and Katarina, so does Joey and Cameron's love for Bianca - who finds herself in a bizzare love triangle!This is a great movie for everyone for all ages...even my mom loved this movie!!! :D  It's hilarious with a simple plot of finding love.  This movie is a definate MUST SEE!!!",10,0,0,26 March 2000
American Pie," OUTSTANDING -- The BEST Teen Movie Since 'The Breakfast Club'
","Well...that is my opinion.  But the truth is, I haven't seen one teen movie that could match the joy and excitement that 'The Breakfast Club' (1985) could ever offer a movie viewer!I saw this movie last night, and while watching it in the beginning, I thought it was going to be boring, because it started out very slow in the beginning.  I was thinking in my mind, 'Please don't make me disappointed!'Plus, I thought that I would end up rating this movie a five instead, but as the movie extended from the beginning to middle to end, I began to think differently.  It was really hilarious, outrageous, and fun!  It brings a lot of laughs and attracts attention to all movie lovers and of course, teens.What I loved best about 'American Pie' was that it had a mixture of romance and comedy and friendship.  It shows the excitement of being young, happy, and free especially when it is your senior year in high school. 
I truly did enjoy 'American Pie'!  It's a light hearted, bubbly, fun, and hilarious comedy that not only teens can enjoy, but also adults (just don't take young children to see this movie...you'll see what I mean)!This is my favorite teen movie of ALL TIME!!!!!!! - 'The Breakfast Club' comes second...of course! :o)",Null,0,0,27 August 1999
Grease," Musical - That's What This Is
","I didn't really think that 'Grease' was as good as people I know say it is, but it's okay.  I mean, it's better than most movies I've seen before. It's fun to watch, and the chemistry between Danny and Sandy is all so innocent. It has really great musical numbers sung by Olivia Newton-John, John Travoltra, and the rest of the cast, and it became a cult classic film, which will live forever.  Even today, the 'Grease' legacy lives on!  Not bad.",7,0,1,3 August 1999
American Beauty," ...Look Closer...and You Will Get One Strange Yet Intense Movie! :)
","Okay, this a very strange movie.  Usually in films, they have characters who start off with a complete downfall, but things turn out better in the end. Well...this movie presents just the opposite of that! 
First, here's the MAIN plot:  Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey who won an Academy Award for Best Actor) and Carolyn Burnham (Annette Benning) are the idea husband and wife...well, that's what people think.  On the outside they are happily married and totally devoted to each other, but deep down inside, their marriage is falling apart quickly and their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is anything, but 'daughter-of-the-year'.  As Lester's marriage to Carolyn shatters into pieces, so does his life.  That is until he meets Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), an teenage aspiring model and daughter Jane's best-friend.  Since meeting Angela at the school's basketball game, Lester has dreamed of Angela with a blend of rose petals and sexual fanatasies.  His obsession with Angela may boost his confidence...a little...yet fate is still after him!Well, that's the main plot.  There are a few branches added to the plot. Here they are: - Carolyn Burnham is miserable with her marriage to Lester and her career as a real estate agent isn't all fun and games anymore.  For pleasure and happiness, she turns to her bussiness rival, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), and starts to have an affair with him, which suddenly turns not only her marriage, but her own life upside down! - Jane Burnham is suffering from the oddest problems a typical, all American teenage girl could ever have:   Her parents hate each other, her father is obsessing over her friend (and not to mention, Angela, herself, is willing to return the pleasure to Jane's dad), and the new boy next door, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bently) has developed a major crush on Jane.  Ironically, Ricky and Lester have formed a friendship, which makes Ricky's homophobic father (Chris Cooper) believe that they are 'more than friends'.  Ricky has it tough in life...his father rules the house with an iron fist and often takes his anger out on his son.  As misery full fills Ricky's life, Jane's feelings for Ricky changes from hate to love.Okay, those are the plots to this story.  Tempting...isn't it?  Well, I must say, I thought this was an excellent film for good laughs, but is also filled with surprises!  Although it's not the best movie I ever saw in my life...it is a movie that was worth renting!!!  And for those who haven't seen it and want to see...it's definately worth it!!!  With unforgettable performances by Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Thora Birch, Wes Bently, and Mena Suvari, 'American Beauty' is an unforgettable, intense film that will make you not want to move an inch away from your seat and soon become an instant classic!!!",10,0,0,2 July 2000
54," Unique, Interesting, and Excellent
","My oh my!  I loved '54' very much!  The film was very unique, very interesting, and different than most films!  I loved the set of the night club itself and I loved the attitude and nature of the characters in this film.  What I was a little disappointed about was the fact that they didn't really have a lot of the celebrities that went to Studio 54 back then such as Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Halston, Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, Cher, just to name a few.  And where is the other owner of Studio 54, Ian Schweggar (or however you spell his name)?  The movie I guess you could say highlighted the lives of the more common people rather than the big stars and icons who were at 54 every night during the late 1970's.  My cousin, Jimmy, went to Studio 54 back in the late 1970's when he was a teenager.  I think he was the same age as Shane during that period.Yet I give this film a lot of credit.  It was very glamorous, very exciting to watch, and above all, it was so much fun to watch!  Ryan Phillepe is a great actor, very talented, and he is soooo cute!  Reese Witherspoon is a lucky girl!  Mike Meyers wasn't the best Steve Ruebell, but I can't really imagine anyone else to play the part of the famous S.R.!This movie is a must see!",9,4,9,1 July 1999
The Exorcist," Interesting Plot...Interesting Film! :)
","(Fictional) Actress and single-mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), loves her daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), more than life itself.  Yet mysteriously, young Regan becomes 'sick'.  She's doing wild things that she's never done before and saying things that Chris could never imagine.  What's the cause of this all?  Captain Howdy, of course!  Now, Chris and Regan's only hope is Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), the exorcist himself!I saw the re-release version (w/ the never-before scenes) in theaters (as well as on video).  I remember my two friends being scared before watching and they were huddling together in the theater.  I personally didn't find this movie scary at all even though the fact that being possessed by demons is possible.  Yet I must say that I think this is by far, the freakiest movie I've ever seen in my life.  Interesting too, because there was never a movie like this before!  And of course, afterwards, other movies about possessed victims have followed (i.e. 'Stigmata' starring Patricia Arquette as the helpless victim).  Yet nothing could ever repeat the errie horror of 'The Exorcist'.As a matter of fact, there were some funny parts of this film! (he he!). When Linda Blair's character, Regan, is possessed, prepare for very funny cursing lines (especially when the two priests come to visit), but also rather painful parts (when she's attacking herself with a crucifix...lots and lots of blood - **ouch**).But anyways, this horror cult classic is one of the best movies I've ever seen! :)  It's even great watching it on the silver screen w/ the re-release version! :)",10,1,2,3 October 2000
The Princess Bride," This Film Could've Been Better
","This movie didn't do a thing for me.  It wasn't as good as I thought it was and it was nothing that I expected it to be.  I thought it would have more to it rather than just a simple and innocent fairy tale that you'd see in a child's book of fairy tales.  Plus, I was hoping something would come and turn this movie around and add some spice to it, but it didn't happen, so that was disappointing.  Little kids would probably enjoy this movie, but I didn't enjoy this movie at all.  Big disappointment!!!",1,23,78,13 July 1999
Velvet Goldmine," All that GLAM!
","In the song 'Changes', David Bowie sings 'Turn and face the strange...'. Well, I got to admit, this movie does make you face the strange.  This is one of the best movies I ever saw in my life.  It's artistic, graphic, and very creative in so many ways.  It was confusing one point to another, and can be hard to catch up with if you lose track of the movie (which I did at a few points) or don't know what it is about.  What I love the most about the movie is the artistic stride of the fashions, the music, and glam rock icons themselves such as Brian Slade, Curt Wild, just to name a few.  To be honest, Brian Slade didn't really make me think of David Bowie's famous character, Ziggy Stardust, but Mandy Slade did remind me very much about David's ex-wife, Angela 'Angie' Bowie.  Toni played an excellent Angie-like Mandy Slade, and Jonathan did a splendid job as the strange, but wonderful Bowie-like Brian Slade.  I give credit to all the actors as a matter of fact! :o)I highly do recommend this movie, but just one thing you should know:  The sex scenes in this film are very, very extreme, so don't watch this movie around children or anyone who doesn't like watching sex scenes in movies.",8,12,23,22 June 1999
Schindler's List," A Haunting & Brilliant Masterpiece of the Most Horrifying Period In the 20th Century!
","'Schindler's List' is one of the best movies of all time according to the people who write the reviews for this site, which isn't a big surprise.  I happen to be one of those people who voted 10, but some didn't enjoy it and I know a few people who wouldn't watch this movie, which is understandable due to what this film is about.This is a truly brilliant film, and I think it's the best film ever directed by Steven Speilberg.  It's powerful, it explains a lot, it has a solid cast. Liam Neeson gives a brilliant and Oscar-worthy performance (it's disappointing that he lost) as Mr. Schindler himself.  What I thought was interesting was how every bit of detail was explained and how the movie is black and white rather than color (which is a terrific idea if you ask me). There are a lot of interesting things about this movie, and that's number one reason why I loved 'Schindler's List'.  This movie never fails to amaze me!There is not one part in this film that I dislike.  I can't say anything bad about 'Schindler's List'.  If you see this movie, you might just be as impressed by it as much as I was! :o)",10,9,13,16 July 1999
Meet Joe Black," Wonderful!
","I always knew that this film would be good, but I never saw it in the movie theatre and that was pretty disappointing for me.  Yet when I first saw it out on video, I just grabbed it off the shelf before anyone else could. Anyhow, at first, the movie is a bit confusing, but you pretty much do get the whole idea later on in the middle.This movie was wonderful to watch, and very impressing.  It's three hours long, but it didn't feel like three hours at all while watching this.  I enjoyed every minute of this movie, and I highly recommend this movie, so have fun!!! :o)",10,0,0,24 April 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Fascinating...Impressive...What an AMAZING Film!!! :)
","Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film, 'A Clockwork Orange', is the story about an aggressive young man named Alex DeLarge, who has a strong passion for ultra-violence, rape, and (believe it or not!!!) Beethoven.   As the leader of his so-called droogs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim), who share the same passions as he does, Alex and his three droogs have terrorized futuristic England...raping and beating helpless victims until he is captured by the police and sentenced 14 in jail for murder.  To shorten his jail sentence, Alex goes for aversion therapy to cure his violent ways.  After being released, Alex's passions for ultra-violence, rape, and Beethoven have all, but faded away.  Soon, Alex finds out that being cured isn't all that is cracked up to be...and his former victims are all ready to turn every bit of pain and agony he has caused for them over to him.  Like they say...everything you do, always comes back to you!!!I always was eager to see this film...even though it is ten years older than I am...but after seeing Stanley Kubrick's final film, 'Eyes Wide Shut', I was impressed by the strange and yet fascinating characters Stanley Kubrick's films have featured.  Alex DeLarge is an unforgettable character played by Malcolm McDowell...his brilliant mind, but horrible passions have made the film itself unforgettable.  Stanley Kubric once said, 'If Malcolm hadn't been available I probably wouldn't have made the film.'  Malcolm McDowell has brought a light onto the screen portraying the strange Alex DeLarge, and I don't think anyone could do better than Malcolm did!  What I also loved about this film was the interesting twists and turns in the film. 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the best films ever made!  Any movie lover would love it!!!  It's one film that is definately worth watching!!! :)",10,1,2,21 June 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Keep Your Eyes Wide Open And Witness the Haunting, Exotic Images of Kubrick's Final Masterpiece
","'Eyes Wide Shut' is the final masterpiece by the great Stanley Kubrick!  His many films bring unforgettable, strange and twisted images that will leave his audience spellbound and in deep thought!  'Eyes Wide Shut' is one of them many films that could never be left out!  Stanley Kubrick's final work is a stunning film, starring Tom Cruise and wife, Nicole Kidman, as a wealthy NYC husband and wife.  Once Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) confesses she had a fling with another man, her husband, Dr. William Hartford (Tom Cruise), is left in deep thought and soon goes on a wild journey of moral discovery and mystery after attending a secret erotic masquerade filled with sexual fantasies and activities.  Yet after attending the masquerade, he soon finds out that attending the private party threatens not only himself, but everything he loves as well!!!I was captivated by the plot, and when I saw this movie, it wasn't what I expected it to be!  It's better than I ever imagined!  Yet also hard to keep up with if you take your eyes off of the screen.  So, keep your eyes wide open when watching Stanley Kubrick's final erotic masterpiece....but keep your children's eyes shut tightly!!! :)  This is one film you DO NOT want to miss seeing!!!!",10,0,1,25 May 2000
Pretty Woman," Romantic Dream Come True!!!!
","From leather to fur, from costume jewelry to fine jewelry, from LA streets to high class parties, and from prostitute to princess, Julia Roberts lights up the screen as Vivian Ward in the beautiful and romantic comedy,'Pretty Woman.' This is one of the best movies of all time!  Julia and Richard Gere make a great team!  Can't wait to see 'Runaway Bride'!!! :o)",10,0,3,20 July 1999
Titanic," King of the Movie World
","Well...everyone saw this movie!  Maybe not EVERYONE, but mostly everyone! I was impressed by this movie the first time I saw it in the theatres, and thank God I saw it in the beginning when it first came out before the movies became crowded by Leonardo DiCaprio and movie fans.  I loved the portrayal of the real-life wealthy passengers like the Unsinkable Molly Brown, the captain, John Jacob Astor, the Countess, just to name a few.  The set was amazing and took my breath away!  This movie really explains a lot about the whole experience of the famous Titanic, and when I see pics of it lying there under the sea, it's pretty freaky and scary.  It's like a ghost ship under sea, but above sea, and for those who were there, the ship was a real wonder!I thought it was very generous of James Cameron to have that special moment of silence at the Academy Awards back in 1998 when he was accepting the award for Best Picture, and who knew that a movie such as 'Titanic' would ever come alive on the big picture.  This movie is dramatic, romantic, funny (in it's own way), sexy, and magical all together.  It's every genre mixed into one!  That's why I call this movie the best movie I ever seen in my whole life!",10,1,2,1 July 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A Timeless Classic!
","This movie isn't one of my favorite movies of all time, but it is one of the GREATEST movies I ever seen in my life.  It's powerful, funny, dramatic, and impressing.  Jack Nicholson gives us a brilliant performance as the strange and hyper McMurphy, who just loves to have the attention focused on him and of course, in many ways, puts a smile on every one of the patients' faces. 
Jack Nicholson is the ONLY actor who can really fit the bill as McMurphy and who could forget Louise Fletcher's moody and cold hearted character, Nurse Ratched, and the thought-to-be dumb and deaf patient, Big Chief.  Every character in the movie is natural and has all different types of personalities, which makes them all very special and better yet, unforgettable.I read the book by Ken Kesey, and in my opinion, the movies better!  A must see for anyone who loves movies!!! :o)",10,1,3,14 August 1999
Scream 2," The Legacy of 'Scream' Continues
","Twice the fun!  'Scream 2' was better than the first one.  This time, it's less predictable, more suspensful, and more fun to watch!  This movie is becoming a true cult classic already!  I thought it was odd to have Tori Spelling playing Sydney in the fake film, 'Stab', because obviously, Tori is not Neve.  But after all, this movie's legacy continues on and on, and who knows what shall happen next in Sydney's adventures in life!",10,0,0,5 August 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Dark Romantic Tale
","I like 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' just the same as 'Interview With the Vampire', because they are both different in their own way.  Anyway, about 'Dracula', I kind of view it as a dark romantic film with a strange twist of horror.  This film is kind of like taking the romantic elements of a William Shakespeare tragedy (such as 'Romeo and Juliet') and adding a big taste of something dark yet beautiful, somewhat like you'd read in an Anne Rice novel.  I loved the vampire graphics with the blood and the many looks that Gary Oldham has to bring his character alive.  Winona Ryder's character, Mina, was second best next to Gary's.  It was a really good movie!",8,1,2,16 July 1999
Scream," The Best Teenage Horror Flick Since 'Halloween'
","Well...it's really as good as 'Halloween', but like 'Halloween', it's fun to watch and maybe start a series of classics.  Neve Campbell is the new heir to become the next 'Scream Queen'.  It's one of the greatest movies of all time!  Hmmmm...maybe a whole new sequal will come twenty years later from 1996...it could happen.  It happened to 'Halloween' w/ 'H20'.",10,0,0,5 August 1999
Carrie," Torture Leads To Terror!
","Usually they say that the first film is better than the sequel, but in my opinion, the sequel was better.  I liked 'Carrie', but it was strange, because this one is from the the late 1970's, and the other is twenty years older.  And since the 90's is my generation, looking at the 70's one was strange.  Chris, Nancy Allen's character, has Farrah Fawcett hair, John Travoltra looks the same only younger, and Amy Irving (who returned in the second one as Sue Snell again) looks the same, only her hair wasn't as curly.  Also, since it's the 90's and technology has improved, the part when Carrie's anger destroys those who have teased her wasn't as graphic as the second one.  Yet don't get me wrong, I liked the first 'Carrie'.  It was great, but not as great as the second one!",5,0,3,14 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," BRILLIANT...Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!!
","I am so SPEECHLESS!  I was totally BLOWN AWAY by 'The Sixth Sense'!  It is such a fabulous movie with heart pounding scenes with such an astounding plot!  It went so very slow at first, but it got better as it went a long, and I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed, thinking, 'Why did I even chose to go see this movie in the first place?'Yet later on, my mind changed, and I thought, 'It was so worth it to see this!'  And it was, it really was!  I just got home from seeing this movie, and I am absolutely impressed and totally speechless by the brilliance this film has offered it's millions of viewers and the twisted, but creative imagination surrounding the film!I give lots of praise to Bruce Willis (Malcolm Crowe), Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear, Toni Collette (Lynn Sear - Cole's mum), and the rest of the cast and crew who made this movie possible.  Yet most of the praise has to go to it's brilliant director and writer, M. Night Shyamalan.  I don't know what made him come up with such a creative and brilliant film such as 'The Sixth Sense', but whatever it was, it earned him success and cheers everywhere around the world!If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST see it, especially if you love movies.  I never wanted to see this movie at all, because I thought it was boring sounding.  What made me go was the excellent reviews that the movie critics gave this film, and I thought that I should witness it myself.  I'm really pleased that I did!  This was an EXCELLENT movie, and if you didn't see it, you must go!  You'll be impressed by what the film itself has to offer, but I think the coolest part was the ending when.....Oh, you probably didn't see it yet, whoever is reading this review now.  But I won't tell you what happens, SO you are going to have to see it for yourself!!!! :o)Don't hesitate to see this movie yourself!  This is movie WILL without a doubt BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!",10,0,0,29 August 1999
Final Destination," Something Different That Defines A Teen Thriller Flick
","Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a special (yet bonechilling) gift.  While aboard a plane with a handful of his fellow students, Alex suddenly predicts that the airplane explodes.  Only Alex, his friend, Tod (Chad Donella), Carter Horton (Kerr Smith), Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), Billy Hitchcock (Seann William Scott) and teacher, Ms. Valarie Lewton (Kristen Cloke) are the only survivors from the school feild trip. One by one, since the plane crash, each survivor has died tragically.  The only way to save their lives is to cheat death itself.Freaky....isn't it? :)
FINALLY!  A teenage horror flick that doesn't involve some goofy dude dressed up in a stupid costume, going around killing people like they had in 'Scream', 'Urban Legend', etc.  Something that involves the mysterious supernatural, and involves even more heart pounding adventure! :)Also, the foreshadowing is very clear in the flick with the John Denver tunes and the dark shadows that lurk from behind them.  Interesting graphics and effects make this film an excellent flick! :)If you happen to watch the DVD version of the movie, you will also get to watch some deleted scenes to the movie, which I found interesting.  Also, an alternate ending to the whole film.  Personally, I liked the alternate ending much better than the one they had on the film itself.  But oh well!Overall, 'Final Destination' is a great film!  You would not want to miss this one! :)",10,0,2,1 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Flashback to 1977...
","I love Star Wars (but I'm not obsessed) and of course, this is the movie that started the magic.

George Lucas puts a lot of effort in his Star Wars masterpieces so that everyone can enjoy!",10,0,0,2 August 1999
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," A Dark & Sophisticated Tale With A Special Message
","One of the greatest things about Anne Rice is that when you read her material, she has all this strange symbolism hidden and tucked away in every corner of her stories.  And like she says in the beginning before the movie starts, this movie is about us, and not just vampires.  In truth, I didn't really quite understand that, but I guess now I have a distinct idea of what she means.Anyhow, I love 'Interview...' for it's haunting message and the sophisticated and old fashioned image that surrounds this film.  Vampire films are usually like this, and they are also romantic in their own way. This movie isn't as romantic as 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' (I mean the 1992 one), but like 'Dracula', it's dark, it's haunting, and very suave.  Anne Rice has a very sophisticated imagination, and who knows what runs though her mind to expand her creativity.  Whatever it is, it turns her work into masterpieces.For me, reading Anne Rice is like staring at a painting.  When you stare at modern painting in an modern art museum, you try to figure out the meaning behind the painting, and when you read Anne Rice, you try to figure out the meaning behind each story she writes.  Of course, you can expect that from 'Interview...'.I loved the set to this film, especially the Theatre Des Vampires, and the costumes are just brilliant!I thought that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt gave wonderful performances as the playful Lestat and the gentle Louis.  The film also stars Kirsten Dunst, who plays the angel-faced vampire child, Claudia.",8,1,2,17 July 1999
The Breakfast Club," A Classic Teen Movie
","Teen movies such as 'Can't Hardly Wait', 'Cruel Intentions', and 'She's All That' are bigger than ever thanks to stars such as Rachel Leigh Cook, Freddie Prinze jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt, just to name a few.  Yet before these movies and these stars, there was the 80's brat pack which featured Tom Cruise, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, just to name a few, and movies such as 'Sixteen Candles', 'The Breakfast Club', and 'Pretty In Pink' caught the attention of teenagers around the world.The movie I am reviewing right now is 'The Breakfast Club'.  Before I saw this movie, I heard it was excellent, and it was, it really was!  And it kind of showed something in which all teenagers should learn, and that is to know each other before they judge each other.  In this movie,  you have the teen with a very high IQ, the outcast, the athlete, the basket case, and of course, the golden girl.  Spending just one Saturday together in the school library together without knowing a thing about each other let them form an everlasting friendship even though they are different from each other in so many ways!  And I guess that bond gave them the freedom to open their hearts to each other to search for some understanding, which they did.This is one of the greatest teen movies ever, and teenagers from both the 80's and the 90's, I think, can not only relate to this movie, but can also easily enjoy it.  And from what I've heard, they do really enjoy it! I'm an eighteen year old girl, and I must be honest, I did! :o)",10,0,1,21 August 1999
The Wedding Singer," Love Story of the 80's
","You can't help but love this brilliant and funny romantic comedy starring the very talented Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler.  'The Wedding Singer' captures your heart and makes you feel the heat between Robbie and Julia. I got a real kick out of Christine Taylor's Madonna-wanna-be character, Holly, and the Boy George-like George played by Alexis Arquette, and who could forget that rapping Grandmother?  That was the bomb!  Believe it or not, I began to cry happy tears when Robbie sang to Julia on the airplane!  I thought that was so sweet!  Also you can also look for cameo's by 80's rock sensation, Billy Idol (singer of songs like 'White Wedding' and 'Dancing With Myself')!  'The Wedding Singer' is really an exciting movie to watch!!!",10,1,1,14 July 1999
The Wizard of Oz," THE Original Fantasy Film
","A beautiful masterpiece starring the magnificent Judy Garland as young Dorothy Gale is what 'The Wizard of Oz' is, and when I saw this movie as a child, I watched it over and over again, and became a big Judy Garland fan. Judy has a sweet, powerful, golden voice which can echo in the dark and become so unforgettable, and Judy was so ahead of her time during her career.  I think it's wonderful that her daughter, Liza Minnelli, who I also adore, carries on her mother's legacy.  Liza, too, has an unforgettable voice as well, very brassy, cool, and sexy -- this woman can sing -- her voice is like a kiss!  Like mother like daughter!'The Wizard of Oz', however, isn't like any movie that there was back then. It was all life like with the magical land of Oz, the creative imagination that is put into this film is unbelieveable...it just takes your breath away!Sometimes I wonder what this film would be like if it was released today in this year or if it was remade with another cast.  Who would play Dorothy Gale?  Everyone knows that no one can ever top Judy's performance of Dorothy Gale.  Judy's an original.  The cast is original.  This film is original. One of the greatest movies of the 20th century!!!!!!",10,1,2,3 August 1999
