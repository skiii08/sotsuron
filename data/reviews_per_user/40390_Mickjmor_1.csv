Men in Black 3," Men In Black 3 Delivered & Was Absolutely Amazing!
","This was a sequel that took 10 years to come about, but hey whose counting to a much anticipated Sequel that will become a Trilogy? Okay here we go Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones yet again hit the jack park to the main street with their great one long liners & their great chemistry that they have shared together ever since the first film. I really liked how they were the only remaining cast members from the first too movies, but no one really cared or even noticed that. It shows that Tommy & Will are the true mental piece icons of this Franchise. The film takes place in present day and tells us how Kay and Jay have basically being working in the MIB services for the past 10 years from Men In Black 2 like just your normal every day work. As the film goes along it gets more quirky & hilarious with new characters & the new villain involved. Boris The Animal played by Jemaine Clement was one of the top villains in this franchise,it definitely tops the Serlenna villain but just a little notch down from Edgar The Cockroach from the very first film but very close from 3 steps away! Plus Josh Brolin is in no doubt the best possible portrayal of Tommy Lee Jones to be chosen as the Younger Agent K ever! We see him in 1969 when Jay goes back in time to save Agent K from being killed from Boris The Animal! Brolin really look's and sounds like him, he really took the spotlight gracefully from Will & Tommy in this film as if he was one of their very own characters from 1 & 2 or it just seemed that way from his great portrayal! I'm so ready for a Men In Black 4! I Just Hope It Doesn't Take 10 Years To Do It For This One!!!",8,0,3,16 June 2012
