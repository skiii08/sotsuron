It," Generic horror movie with horrible sounds and poor team dynamic
","I went in pretty excited, the original TV miniseries was great.It 2017 was scary. I jumped off my seat a couple of times (damn you old painting lady). However, film suffers from 2010s horror movie tropes where everything has to be loud and thrown to the screen as quickly as possible. It gets annoying pretty quick in this movie.Practically every single scary scene in the movie starts off with the obvious scary track playing. Usually one of the children starts seeing things that aren't right and starts slowly advancing towards the disturbance, because horror movie.The soundtrack gets louder and louder until you are stuck in your seat covering your ears and just hoping for the obvious jump scare to pop up. But It lets you off easy, it pretty much tells you when you are supposed to be scared. The ear breaking music nearly always stops abruptly a few seconds before the jump scare. Thanks, movie.The sound design is horrible. The loud music indicating an oncoming jump scare gets very ineffective. Along that, the original soundtrack was really nothing special. Guess it was called the 'Horror Movie Stock Soundtrack' or something.Even more annoying was the use of real songs in the movie.I have to back this up first by complimenting the opening scene. Piano music is heard when Bill builds the paper boat for Georgie and when Georgie goes downstairs, their mother is seen to be playing the music we hear. It's a nice touch, though nothing special. The blending of the soundtrack into the world made me excited for the music.When the kids throw rocks at the sociopath bully kid, Antisocial by Anthrax plays. It is a good song but in this scene it felt so weird just because in the opening scene the piano was coming from a real piano there, the music really was there. Now when the kids stone the bully, I couldn't stop thinking that Anthrax might be somewhere there playing. It's stupid but it made the out of place song be even more weird there.When studying the history of the town the kids go to Ben's place. There, Beverly happens to close the door, because script and gotta make the crowd laugh, revealing Ben's New Kids on the Block poster. It is really stupid that the 'new kid' in school listens to New Kids on the Block. It's like 'Hey it's fun and clever the new kid listens to New Kids on the Block see what we did there ha ha New Kids so lame ha ha the lone fat kid listens to it'. I can see the screenwriter drooling over the script paper. But yeah so Bev opens the door to reveal the NKotB poster, and guess what, a New Kids on the Block song plays for a few seconds! Mr. Screenwriter, you are a modern genius.I hated the kids.The annoying meme machine with ridiculous eyeglasses was the worst. His character was so obviously written because the of the sequel. I can already see him being equally immature and getting his mature moment of heroism in the sequel. Can't remember how it went in the miniseries, though. Eh.Beverly's actor had to be the oldest looking 15 year old they could find. She could be as someone's big sister in the movie. It's not a major flaw but still annoyed me.The biggest flaw is that the kids don't matter. The only kid who matters here is Bill. The movie is such a stereotypical hero's journey. Of course, he also gets the girl in the end. The movie would've worked so much better if they'd build the movie around Bill's journey to grow up while searching his brother.Any of the other kids could've been taken away from the movie and it wouldn't had changed anything. The kid whose mother is overly sensitive and protective? The kid who lost his parents in the fire? The kid with glasses? The new kid? All worthless to the plot and the nonexistent team dynamic.They really don't feel they like to hang out together. They just are, or end up, spending time together. All their time together feels so artificial. I wish I could've immersed myself with the world and the Losers Club but it doesn't feel real. The kids don't feel real. They feel like screenwriter gave them things to say and the director told them to say the things in a way they thought the audience would feel funny.Pennywise is also there. The clown. A critic stated that the more they show It, the less scary It becomes. It is very well said.My initial reaction was laughing my ass off when Pennywise tried to lure Georgie into the sewer in the opening scene. He sounded so comedic in a totally wrong way. He sounded like he tried too hard to be funny and scary. In the miniseries, Tim Curry's Pennywise maintained a voice which was fun and scary at all times, without changing from clown voice to a scary voice.I really don't have much good to say about it. It scared me a few times, the opening scene had its moments, the painted lady with the twisted face was cool, Ben the thick kid had a fun introduction.",3,8,13,17 October 2017
Hereditary," Intense yet flawed
","Midsommar was a solid movie (7/10). I also enjoy the other modern horror movies that are often mentioned along with this movie (The Vvitch, It Follows, It Comes at Night, The Lighthouse), so I was pretty excited to finally see Hereditary.The movie starts with the funeral of Annie's mysterious mother and continues into their family's life after that. Every scene looked good and the eerie atmosphere was great as expected.However at the 30 minute mark or so the movie got pretty annoying.Charlie, the youngest daughter, wanders off into the woods to see the grandmother surrounded by a circle of flame. The scene ends abruptly when Annie takes her back to home and asks for Peter, Charlie's older brother, to take Charlie into a party with him.If Peter had been a normal human being he would have probably said that he can't take the 13 year old kid into a party. He just looks apathetic and takes Charlie with him though he clearly didn't want to take her. That's dumb but okay.In the opening scene it was revealed that Charlie has a nut allergy and of course it's relevant to the plot, why would they tell details like that otherwise. In the party Charlie ends up eating cake that has peanuts (they even show a girl chopping peanuts, jeez) and Peter has to take Charlie into a hospital. Don't know why she doesn't have an EpiPen with her.When Peter is driving Charlie sticks her head out of the back window, only to get decapitated by a pole because Peter had to dodge a dead deer. I was laughing so hard at this scene, holy smokes. After that Peter just drives home and leaves the headless body in the car to be discovered by his mom and that's supposed to build up the family's tensions even more.The party and the accident felt so forced that it took me completely off the movie. In the end it's revealed that Peter's grandmother was a witch or Satanist or something and they were preparing Peter to be a vessel for Charlie / King Paimon.The last 30 minutes were really intense and I wanted to enjoy the movie overall, but the main conflict is built on a premise so ridiculous that I couldn't relax and enjoy the movie. I did laugh a lot, but that wasn't what I was expecting.The accident was apparently based on a real life accident. It is so distracting and forced, I think it'd been equally silly if Ari Aster had taken any other ridiculous one in a billion accident and made it a major story element.The parent's actors were great but the kids were a bit shallow. Both of them just had the same expression throughout the movie and felt like they were just trying to react at the silly stuff the script threw at them.It's not a bad movie but I was expecting a lot more.",4,1,4,15 June 2020
500 Days of Summer," One of the finest romantic comedies ever
","I absolutely love this movie. From the very beginning the movie introduces its very personal sense of humour. I've seen the movie more than ten times by now and I laugh every time just as much as watching it the first time.I usually dislike nonlinear storytelling in movies, since mostly the nonlinear story just ends up 'spoiling' scenes that would've had more impact when told in linear order. In the beginning the movie tells you that it's not a love story, and 500 Days of Summer's humour justifies the nonlinear story. The movie handles the nonlinearity very well with a plenty of nice scenes where Marc Webb utilizes the possibilities of audiovisual storytelling greatly. With a great soundtrack the personal scenes feel even stronger.The actors do a great job, no matter how small their part. There isn't a single bad performance in the movie, everyone fits the personal tone of the movie. The movie is also very quotable!My only two major complaints is that the penultimate scene at the bench is the only scene which doesn't fit the movie too well. Summer's explanation about her sudden change of mind is left pretty shallow. Luckily the very last scene saves this, since it again supports the basic structure of the movie perfectly with the personal humour and the completion of the day-by-day narrative.The other complaint is that if you don't enjoy the story the movie might feel too much like a series of scenes instead of a solid one movie. I personally enjoy the solution of showing the literal numbered days of Summer, but if someone doesn't enjoy the movie because of this, I undestand them fully.8/10.",8,1,6,13 August 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," I miss the first Iron Man
","Back in 2008 Iron Man felt really a fresh breath on the blockbusters. It adopted its source material really faithfully in the vein of big budget action adventure movies. Despite the predictableness, the movies was really funny and it was fun to see the good guy smash the bad guy in the end. Good laugh and a fun to behold. Iron Man 2 was nothing special and Iron Man 3 is a whole review of its own.The Thor trilogy, however, is really just sad, wasted opportunity.First Thor was so dull and bland. It was the most obvious setup for the Avengers in phase one and felt nothing more than a paycheck for everyone involved. The Dark World absolutely wasted the great Christopher Ecclestone, I really wish they'd given the opportunity for him to get his thing going on with Chris Hemsworth in their scenes. Instead of this, they decided it'd be better to reduce him to nothing more than a dull joke.They went all in the dull jokes in Ragnarok. This movie is just the mediocrity of the Dark World combined with Guardians colour palette and jokes, endless amount of unfunny jokes. The plot is yet again the old 'something wants to destroy everything, main character must discover the way to prevent this', and the few serious scenes trying to explain this conflict feel awkward among the swarm of clunky dick jokes.The few scenes where they let Tessa Thompson, Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth just talk to each others like normal people do, the movie feels real and funny. Those scenes are very few, most of the time everything is interrupted with a really awkward joke. Idris Elba was awesome, but Heimdall feels so weird in this movie. He's super serious when everyone else isn't. Anthony Hopkins' line delivery was the funniest part of the film.There's something wrong with practically every character (except for Loki, I guess). Hela stabs Thor and gouges his eye (the makeup is so ugly), but she mumbles when she has to talk about executor executing people. Ha ha. Skurge is maybe the most worthless character in the whole series. Thor ranges from being a childish idiot to a hero of the day who cheats his brother, who's supposed to be a trickster god or something. Valkyrie being a badass drunk doesn't feel real at all. Surtur looks like a PS3 cutscene. The Warriors Three get treated like they weren't ever there in the previous movies. Jeff Goldblum plays himself in this movie. Hulk's voice sounds like its completely unfinished, I had to check that my speakers were working normally. Korg is probably Taika Waititi's final middle finger to the audiences and the producers.The bigger these movies get, the smaller these stories go. Some Marvel movies feel like the directors want to make adventure movies, but the producers want to make children's movies. These movies are starting to feel really weird. Everything shown is told to the viewer by the characters. Literally everything.Thor Ragnarok is probably the Schindler's List for people who paid to see all the Transformers movies.This was almost as bad, lazy and uninspired as Guardians of the Galaxy 2. I'll add rate this one star higher for the slightly better actors and some nice looking green screens and special effects.Can't wait for the next reboot in 10-20 years.",3,4,8,18 March 2019
Baby Driver," A bit too long ending doesn't ruin this awesome movie
","Edgar Wright's sense of style is just excellent. I loved the movie from start to the near end. All the scenes are audiovisual candy and the character interaction is so much fun. The cast is great and they dedicated themselves to their characters very well. I burst out laughing several times through the movie. The soundtrack is one of the better ones I've ever heard.My only complaint is just that the movie really should've ended with Jon Hamm falling into the flames. Jon Hamm endlessly coming back was a bit comical in the wrong sense. I don't think that Baby would be so stupid that he'd turn himself in after killing people and doing several armed robberies. Five year prison sentence was very generous on him 'just because he was nice'. It'd been perfect if Baby and Debora would've just driven into the sunset and roll credits. It'd fit the personal style of Baby Driver perfectly.Nevertheless, this was really one of the better movies I've ever seen, I'll give this a very solid 8/10, maybe even 9/10 on rewatch.",8,0,1,28 May 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Has not aged well
","I just watched the scene where Aragorn throws a torch, spinning in the air, into a Nazgul. These movies looked and sounded really good when they came out, but it just looks so bad now.Some of the acting is great, though. Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee do a great job portraying their characters, but even their scenes feel clunky and funny. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are annoying as always. It's somewhat entertaining to witness the unintentional silliness of the conversations.The main problem, though, is that every character feel so empty. If this movie was an original story and the story had never existed before this, I wouldn't understand anything what's happening. I can't sink myself into this movie anymore. It feels like Transformers but without the butt jokes.Soundtrack is awesome, though.",4,1,11,9 November 2018
Climax," Hypnotic, beautiful, thought-provoking, silly, and a bit boring
","What a film. When I wasn't mesmerized by the insanely beautiful dance scenes, I was bored to tears by the characters explaining the plot each other or trying to cover my laughter in the theatre. Some of the scenes were hilarious. I'd really like to avoid using the word 'pretentious', but the dialogue, or general interaction between some of the characters felt pretentious. Weird for the sake of being weird. Which is sad, since most of the scenes manage to capture the eerie euphoria of the party perfectly.The party is a joy to see and hear. The soundtrack was nothing short of perfect, but after two visually stunning first two 'parts', the third part is somewhat bland looking.
I wish there'd been more of the good stuff. The movie turned out to be pretty lame, I was told that this movie is terrifying. It was, but I really mostly laughed at the movie, in a positive way. It's definetely not a bad movie but I wish they'd delve a bit more into world of lust they explore very well.The kid was great.",6,1,3,1 February 2019
Drive," Almost flawless
","The only issue I have with the movie is the Driver. The main character is just laughable in the beginning of the movie, Ryan Gosling does a great work portraying the mysterious Driver, but he is just so damn awkward. Of course it's obvious that Nicolas Refn wished to portray the character this way, but in the first 30 minutes of the movie (exclude the intro scene) the Driver just seems to be a prop saying things to characters around him.When the movie picks up the pace and the conflict begins, the Driver finds his place in the movie's world. The drama, the thrills, the atmosphere, everything in the movie is built perfectly to support this decadent love story in the life of a man who just wishes to drive.Carey Mulligan as the sole female in the movie is placed like the mediator in the Driver's life, bringing balance to his life.I especially like that in the movie every (male) character is either an anti-hero or a villain.I would like to write much more about the film but I'm tired",9,1,1,22 September 2018
Inside Man," Roger Ebert's review was perfect. Go read it.
","I had to check this film out after I was vastly let down by BlackkKlansman since this was on Netflix.And after a dull start, where the movie seems to introduce way too many side characters, the movie gets going. The point of the film, the bank robbery, is presented very well. I enjoyed all the bits inside the bank, and the interactions with the characters seemed very natural and it was a thrill to follow.Even though the police central command seems to be some kind of tourist attraction with free entry to anyone.And even though the police raiding the bank seem to have no idea how to raid a building after it's been taken over by armed criminals who have disabled the cameras, wired the ransom note with listening devices. The cops just go in there switching lights on and just seemingly irregularly proceed through the bank.And eeeven though all the stuff the robbers hand out, are just casually taken into the command central. Thank god they drove the robbers' truck away, I was expecting them to just casually open the truck doors. This movie has a lot of illogical stuff going on.So then we get to the point in the movie where the bank robbery is over. The payoff is finally revealed, and the rest of the movie happens. I realized that I had literally zero interest in Christopher Plummer or Jodie Foster stuff going on, anything answering the WHY did they rob the bank.Inside Man takes its bloody time to get to the end where everything is revealed, and all the secrets revealed are just dull. All the actors do a very solid work with the film, don't get me wrong. Everyone is very natural and charming in their own way in the movie. Especially masked Clive Owen, he was great.It was still an ok movie, even though the beginning and the end are significantly weaker when compared to the middle section. Especially the end. Propably never going to watch this again, it was too long to be casually enjoyed.I would still recommend to watch it, I enjoyed the scenes inside the bank. 6/10",6,2,3,26 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A good reminder to not revisit the prequels or the original trilogy
","Episodes four to six were... OK, if I remember right? I watched them as a kid but they were nothing too special, I never grew too fond of the Star Wars lore. I watched the episodes one to three when they appeared, and if I remember right, I liked them when I was a kid. They were loud and fun and suspenseful. Rewatching them few years ago made me realize that the prequel trilogy was mostly as horrible as people claim them to be.With this to back everything up, I wasn't too enthusiastic to watch the hyped Force Awakens. It was hard to not make up my mind about the movie before even seeing it, the reception ranged from being a poor cash- grab remake of the original from the best movie ever.I had to watch it. Well, start watching it. The movie is still playing when I type this review and it has been maybe the most annoying movie I've seen for a while.Why does Finn break free from the Stormtroopers? What happened to the Clone Army? Why did they break Leia and Han up? Why does General Hux Weasley seem to be the most insecure military general in a movie ever? Could Rey be anymore annoying? Could Finn be anymore annoying? Could Kylo Ren be anymore annoying?The movie made me realize one thing. I like DC movies because I love the comics. I acknowledge the flaws of recent DC movies (Suicide Squad was poor, Batman v Superman is a hard one to love). Watching The Force Awakens must be what it would be like to watch Batman v Superman without knowing and loving the lore. It would be horrible.Watching this movie is almost unbearable, almost every character is annoying in some way. It almost feels like a race between the characters who can be the most illogical and annoying in the movie.The movie just doesn't stop feeling like just another popcorn blockbuster which has been made a million times over and over. This could be called Transformers: The Spark Awakens. Just change everything related to Star Wars to Transformers and it could be a sequel to Age of Exctinction.And instead of being praised, it would receive the reviews this movie should have received in the first place.Boring, annoying and generic random late night snack flick.",3,13,76,30 October 2017
Annihilation," Pseudointellectual nonsense adventure movie gone beyond bad
","The premise of the movie is that something called The Shimmer has been expanding for three, I repeat, three years in a national park. The officials have sent expeditions in with no one returning except Natalie Portman's husband Oscar Isaac who remembers nothing about it. The Shimmer is like an instagram filter that's begun to remix the DNA of literally everything that's caught in. Lead scientist covering the event explains that it's 'a religious event, an extraterrestial event, a higher dimension - we have many theories, few facts'.I thought this line 15 minutes into the movie was really nice and I had high hopes for this. I can't believe how wrong I was. The further the movie explores the concept, the less sense everything makes. The plot was beyond stupid and if there had been even one single rational person in the movie, this film simply wouldn't exist.If the Shimmer got treated like they handled an extraterrestial threat in, for example, Arrival, it'd be a completely different movie. In Annihilation they just head straight into the Shimmer with a rifle and a backpack. The Shimmer has grown for three years and when they go in there they find out that their radios don't work in there. I'd think they could've tested that during those years pretty easily but who cares about logic, it's just a stupid adventure movie, let's head towards the danger and wait for everything to work out conveniently.Acting ranged from passable to horrible, but especially the dialogue felt really forced and shallow. The only two reasons the characters had anything to say was to 1) wonder how everything is so strange and mysterious 2) to explain the messy plot to the viewer.I love Natalie Portman, Oscar Isaac, Alex Garland and science fiction so I can't understand what went this badly wrong here. It feels like several different people wanted to tell their own story and the end result is such a horrible and silly mess. I'm pretty sure that this movie is going to age like a can of butter that's left outside for the summer.",2,3,5,6 March 2019
Sully," Underwhelming ending to a good movie
","Captain Sullenberger and First Officer Stiles landed a plane on the river Hudson. It sounds quite miraculous and the premise of the film gripped me instantly.Director Clint Eastwood tricked me into thinking that this will be just some generic airplane disaster movie. The opening scene, where Sullenberger crashes the plane, turns out to be a nightmare, which is utilized fairly well in the movie. The landing on the river haunts the captain and Tom Hanks does excellent work in portraying the calm man who is tormented by fear and suspicion.Sully's wife and daughters are at home waiting for the crash investigation to be over and worried of him. Laura Linney portrays the wife and she was great. I loved her in the movie. I saw her performance in the movie Mr. Holmes and she portrayed fairly similar character in that movie as a worrying caretaker for aging Sherlock Holmes. She was very good and sympathetic in both movies.I love the premise of the movie. Sully's nightmares were really interesting, I loved the way Eastwood portrayed the human side of the accident.My first complaint is the supposed 'main antagonist' of the movie. Mike O'Malley portrays Charles Porter, the man leading the investigation about the investigation. He performs well, but it is very unnecessary for his character to be so obnoxious in the movie. I sided both factually and emotionally with Sully in the very beginning of the movie, there was no need to put an antagonist in the film to make the viewer more emotionally invested in Sully. His character could've been there without him being a total jerk. Did the writers think that the viewer would not side with Sully in the movie? Are the geese that crashed with the plane the misunderstood heroes here?The screen time where characters are pitted against each other could've been dedicated to portray the nightmares of Sully even more deeply. Oh well.The highlight of the movie was the mid point where they show the plane get damaged, being piloted into the river and the passengers and the crew being rescued from the river.I was awestruck with it. I got fully caught with the scene and the scene made me cry. Everything with it hit me so hard, I definitely wasn't prepared for the scene to completely suspend my disbelief in it. The small character arcs of the passengers, the crew working during the emergency, the personnel in the flight control, the rescue crew, everything. I haven't been crying like this because of a movie since The Wrestler, and it was bad.There I was ready to give this movie, despite minor flaws, a 9/10 immediately.But after that the movie falls flat.After the mid point, everything in the movie feels just off. The investigation committee trying to make Sully guilty turns, of course, to be wrong in the movie. Sully is officially made a hero. Sully's nightmares end after he goes into a bar for a drink and there he figures out how to convince the committee that he did what he had to.The ending is so dissatisfying. The character buildup towards the end just feels so bland and obvious. Everything in the end just screams 'obviously this was going to end like this, what did you think'. I didn't want a surprise ending, but rather a satisfying ending.Maybe I should've sided with the geese.I rate this movie six Aaron Eckhardt's mustaches out of ten.",6,1,2,15 November 2017
