Come and See," Death, destruction and despair
","There's not much one can say about this movie, besides 'Be warned, it's going to hurt you - a lot'. The story is simple: Byelorussia in 1943 and it's Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-asked war against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught in between (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to 'clear' the rear of Third Panzer Army). Those who haven't been deported or killed by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them is Florya, a young boy - and in his quest to 'join the fight' he get much more he had bargained for. It's a movie about an apocalyptic world (the title is taken from the Book of Revelation, a most of the movie looks like it has been filmed on another planet), but unfortunately it was all-real. The emotional centre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of a village, with all the sickening (but not exploitative) details shown with cold determination. There's no catharsis (this is not Schindler's List!), no hope, no redemption - even the eventual revenge against the village's destroyers become just a sad and murderous business. 'Come And See' is a difficult, violent and surprisingly poetic movie, compared to which even classics like 'Saving Private Ryan' (Spielberg payed a homage to this movie on SPR's beginning) or 'The Thin Red Line' seems just artificial. This is the real thing!",10,141,172,25 June 2001
