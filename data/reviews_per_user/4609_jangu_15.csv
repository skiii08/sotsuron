The Ring," Excellent for the most part...
","First, let me say that I have NOT seen the japanese original! You don't have to rely on guts and gore to make a good horror movie. 'The Others' is one example, this is another. For most part, this is one truly creepy and scary horror movie. Naomi Watts is excellent in her (a bit awkward) part as a single mother. Let's hope she can lay her hands on some more major parts! It is a visually stunning movie too. 'Feardotcom' tried to achieve a similar look and managed for the most part, but otherwise that movie led nowhere and was all over the place! Here the visuals serve a purpose. To set a specific mood. The best scenes are the ones on the island! They are genuinely disturbing in a very quiet and understated way. *******MINOR SPOILER HERE******* And even though the 'surprise' ending after the ending is totally predictable, it is still chilling. *******END OF MINOR SPOILER***** There are only two things I am not satisfied with. First, the little boy who plays the son. He is not a bad actor but he displays some truly bizarre behaviour. Or rather, he displays no concern at all when all type of strange happenings are occurring all around him. He seems to be the 'Sixth sense'-boy crossed with 'The Omen'-boy. And finally, the plot is really no big shakes. Once you get the hang of things, there is really no need for any more explainations. However, the film makers insists on explaining and explaining and explaining in too many flashbacks. But otherwise a classy shocker!!!",7,1,2,19 September 2003
Final Destination 2," Inventive deaths...but little else!
","The first film was quite inventive and had an ominous atmosphere that I really liked. And the plane crash in the beginning was incredibly well made and horrifying! Here the plot is more or less the same. A girl has a vision of a huge serial car crash on the highway and of course she is a survivor among a few others. And soon enough they start dying, one by one, in some VERY implausible ways. All the death scenes are very well made, nicely built up and most of them pretty shocking. But this movie has so little else to offer. Performances are adequate at best (the heroine is pretty sympathetic though), the plot is almost non-existent and, worst, the film is pretty tedious when there are no deaths. We get a lot of mumbo-jumbo about 'death's design' and 'list of death', but those of us who saw the first FD will yawn and think about something else. So rent it on video or DVD so you can fast-forward to the 'good parts' and skip the dull interludes.",4,0,2,5 November 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Almost perfect comedy and really heart warming
","Surely, there is a Bridget Jones in all of us! At least I can certainly recognize myself in a lot of the things she says, thinks and does. This movie manages to be heart warming without getting too sugary and still it doesn't lack guts! We have love, hate, disappointment, excitement and a fist-fight. There are some scenes that are absolutely hilarious (like Zellwegers tv-debut in a fire station and the 'Tarts & vicars party') and others that are touching or heartbreaking (look at Zellweger's face when she finds another woman in Hugh Grant's bathroom). Every member in the cast is perfect. Grant plays a manipulative yet very charming creep, and does it well. It's a long way from 'Four weddings...' where he was the one who had a sort of Bridget Jones-character to play. You DO however understand why Bridget is attracted to him. Colin Firth is the straight-laced lawyer who develops a crush for Bridget early on (if not at first), but have great difficulties to express his feelings. A character like his isn't easy to put across and might become a bore in the wrong hands. It is a great strength of Mr Firth that he conveys a sort of boyish awkwardness and lack of confidence instead of inducing yawns. Smaller parts are equally well cast with a few stand-outs, like Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent as her parents and James Callis as her gay friend. But finally there is Zellweger and she is perfect in her part! Absolutely amazing performance. You root for her all the way because you always feel she is so HUMAN. She makes foolish mistakes and put her foot in her mouth on quite a few occasions, but who hasn't? She is sweet, funny and a fighter. And she is in every single scene in the movie(except for a few funny ones during the end-credits) and yet I didn't spot a single false note in her performance. Academy-award stuff, really! If the movie has one small fault it is that a few scenes tend to drag a bit and are not as funny as they could have been. I also think that too many of the minor characters were reduced to clichés, but i have to admit that I probably wouldn't have laughed as much if it had been otherwise. All in all, a treat!",8,0,0,8 November 2002
American Psycho," Almost perfect despite the ugly storyline
","Oh, it could have been a very very bad movie indeed. The infamous novel is very horrifying and contains the most graphic descriptions of murder and mayhem I have ever read. Oliver Stone, who was to direct, probably would have made a much darker movie with the violence turned up at least a notch or two.As it is, Mary Harron has chosen not to be too graphic but stays tasteful all through the picture, even when the action gets bloody. And there is still plenty of gushing gore and since you don't see everything, the impact of the murders, when they arrive, is even more immediate. However, don't expect a slasher movie.
But at the center of it all is Christan Bale as Patrick Bateman. Shallow, self-aware, greedy, narcissistic and completely nuts! As a portrait of a man who has no soul and only exists when he can experience the `high' of murder or have the most stylish business card in his firm, his performance is truly chilling. He is machine, not human, who delights in others pain and degradation, except for one scene in his apartment with his sweet secretary. When he realizes that a murderous rage may be imminent he tells her to get home because `he might hurt her'. Hmmm, in what sense one may wonder? Just kidding. Anyway, at that point, there is a subtle sense that he MIGHT be salvaged by this girl and that he longs for a life that is real.
Christian Bale was apparently not a first choice for the part but seeing him here I doubt that anyone could be a better choice (certainly not Leonardo DiCaprio). He is excellent. Actually I didn't know he had it in him and thought of him as a child actors who's work as an adult had been, at best, indifferent. Clearly playing the part of Bateman is a challenge and had American Psycho been a turkey, it could most certainly had been one nail in his career coffin. Brave man! The other parts are also well casted and well played, but it is Bale who has the center stage.
Praise must also go to Mary Herron who handles this unpleasant story in a manner as to say: Look, Bateman is a man just like most other men but he just go a little bit further. The script that she and Guinevere Turner has fashioned is an extremely interesting look at male behavior. However, if there is something amiss, it is the lack of someone remotely sympathetic. ChloÃ« Sevigny is the exception but she is too bland to be really interesting. All the others are people you would cross the street to avoid! That way you are never very upset when one of Batemans victims `gets it' because you don't really care. But otherwise excellent!",7,1,3,24 October 2002
American History X," So very, very good and truly powerful
","Oh, this movie truly is a punch in the stomach! Mr Norton is truly electrifying as both the nazi-thug and the reformed ex-prisoner, trying to prevent his younger brother to follow in his footsteps (an equally excellent Edward Furlong). True, the violence in this movie is very disturbing, containing a murder scene that is the strongest and nastiest I think I have ever seen. It really made me cringe. But it never becomes gratuitous or just something to titillate the viewer with, but an integral part of the story. And all the time you feel that this story could very well be a true one. Nothing is too blown up, or exaggerated out of proportions. The nazi's party looks just like documentaries I've seen on tv. Heck, I even know some people who underneath their open minded exterior have some views regarding immigrants that are not too far removed from some of the characters in 'American history X'. The visuals are also powerful. Backflashes are black and white, but it doesn't feel superficial. All performances are great with some really outstanding ones: apart from the above mentioned there is Guy Torry as Nortons black buddy in prison and D'Angelo who is convincingly confused about everything happening in her family. If the movie has any faults, it's that the time Norton spends in prison is too sketchy. He is violently raped by some fellow inmates and suddenly (well, almost) he sees the error of his ways?!?! Not very convincing. But all in all a very powerful and disturbing (in a good sense) experience!",8,0,0,1 November 2002
Moulin Rouge!," A visual feast and famine plotwise
","MR! is a feast for the eyes. The movie starts with a bang and hardly ever let the fast pace slack, but the ten minute frenzy in the beginning is never reached again (thank god, because it would have been too much of a good thing). You cannot resist being impressed by the set design, decor, costumes, cinematography and all technical stuff. However, a day or two after seeing this movie, all I was left with was an impression of colors swirling before me and dancing and singing. The story!?! Well, it is easy enough to comprehend, but does it stay with you after a week. No, I don't think so. It is not involving enough somehow, even though it should be heart breaking. All in all, great entertainment, but not all is it trumped up to be.",7,1,2,14 November 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," What is there to get excited about?
","This film started promising, with some solid rock numbers, amusing and interesting characters, good feel for atmosphere and, last but not least, a truly interesting premise. But somewhere in the middle I lost interest. The breakdown of the band and everything that happened after that struck me as too pretentious with tons of artificial pathos. At the same time the pace of the movie almost slows down to a stand-still and the story goes absolutely nowhere. And what about that Yitzhak character? He/she was a complete bore from his/hers first scene to the last. Maybe the part is meant to be some sort of enigma, but I couldn't have cared less. And the cartoon interludes, which were fun at first, started to give me a headache after a while. What I expected was an adventurous and knock-em-dead' romp with no holds barred. What I got was something castrated, like the `angry inch' of the title. The final ten minutes could have been great, but Mitchell drops the ball by playing it safe and mouthing bad clichés instead of revealing some really interesting insights. I don't know how Mitchell managed to get awarded for best direction at Sundance. Sure, it has it's inventive moments (the trailer park number to name one thing), but often the direction is static. However, nothing bad can be said about the actor John Cameron Mitchell. His performance is pure energy from the moment go and considering that he is on the screen in almost every scene, it's a great achievement. I also enjoyed the performance from Andrea Martin (the manager) and Alberta Watson too brief scenes as Hedwig's no-nonsense mother. Actually, the flashbacks are fun and have a depth to them that the film as a whole is lacking. So, despite some very good thing, I think this movie was a disappointment. Pity, because with some more guts it could have been great!",4,5,13,23 November 2001
The Mummy Returns," Entertaining but...
","It starts off very well and for the most part, this movie moves along at a very decent pace ALMOST the whole time. Velasques is a intriguing villainess and Weisz charming as heroine. They have also supplied this movie with a lot (and I do mean A LOT) of computer-animated images. Most of them are very impressive (like the wall of water in a ravine), but some fall flat and look fake. A reviewer referred to this movie as 'Brendan and the 101 computer-images' and it's a fairly accurate description. It's a good, almost old-fashioned, matinee-movie where only a few images may be unsettling for a minor. However, I got a slightly dizzy feeling watching this. In a sequel you always know that they are going to do something more spectacular according to the 'bigger is better'-philosophy. And here they have thrown in almost everything imaginable and after a while I found myself saying 'oh, please. Not that too!'. The balloon-ships arrival was such a case. They should have cut some things out and left a more tightwoven plot, because I found the film just a bit too long. Otherwise I have nothing bad to say about this. All this movie wants is to entertain and that it does! The actors do their job fairly well, but take a back-seat to all the spectacular images and effects. I liked the first movie better, but as sequels go this is not a bad one.",Null,1,1,31 July 2001
From Hell," Well made, but strangely un-involving (and a lesser copy of 'Murder by decree')
","I approached this movie with great expectations. But only in one field was I rewarded: the technical credits are impeccible. Victorian London is atmospherically recreated and cinematography is above reproach. However, basically this is a remake of the 1979 film 'Murder by decree' with minor alterations (mostly concerning the Mary Kelly/Heather Graham-part). And in a comparison this movie is the lesser one almost in every aspect. Don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed 'From Hell' and thought it was quite a good movie.But somehow it never moved me at all. I admired it to be sure, but never really liked it. First of all, the casting has it flaws. Heather Graham is a good actress, but is totally wrong here, looking like a whore who spends all her sparetime at Vidal Sassoon. The other 'girls' looked more the part and I thought Geena Davis-lookalike Susan Lynch did a good job.Johnny Depp is quite good actually but doesn't compare to Christopher Plummer in 'Murder by decree'. The only parts I really liked was Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm. Especially Holm manages to be very convincing and deliver a surprise or two. The story tries to get away with some surprises and twists also, but you spot them a mile away unfortunately. You get some of the advantages from a big budget here, but also a lot of the disadvantages. The scenery looks just like a scenery and I was never once convinced about the dirt and filth in Victorian Whitechapel.
And, finally, this film didn't have Genevieve Bujold who in 'Murder by decree', despite very limited screentime, alone managed to bring more pathos and emotion into that picture than every castmember in this one.",5,1,2,6 December 2002
The Descent," Wow! Edge-of-your-seat-movie of the year!
","This movie starts with a bang (the car crash in the beginning is truly shocking).Then the movie settles down for some character introduction as our 'heroines' begin their travel downwards into the unknown abyss. Soon they are trapped within an unfamiliar cave system and have to find another way out than the hole from where they entered. While the terrors of climbing in a dark and claustrophobic environment makes itself felt quite early (I developed sweaty palms long before I had expected!), the introduction of the underground creatures was enough to send me flying out of my seat when I watched this (among with almost the whole cinema salon audience). The atonal score that accompanies the mayhem is very effective and contributes to the overall atmosphere of dread. It's also a very nicely shot movie, gaining much from the contrast between dark and (occasional) light.There's a lot I like about this movie, but also a few things that doesn't work (according to me):The latex creation of the creatures are not very convincing when they are viewed up close (they should have been kept in the dark for a longer time) and the ending...well, let's just say that I thought it was interesting and very frustrating in about equal measures (sequel, anyone?!). And the women were not very interesting from the beginning. They act as good as can be expected with this type of material, but the audience is not given enough of background information to really care for them...well, maybe for Sarah. There are also a few lapses in logic. Nothing new with this genre, I would say..;DAll in all though, a superb horror movie with guts and gore and enough tension to fill at least three or four lesser horror movies. For the fans, it's a MUST!",8,2,5,28 December 2005
A Beautiful Mind," One fine performance and well-made, but overrated
","At the Oscars, this movie was showered in awards and I cannot honestly say that I understand why. It is all very professionally made and the story itself is truly touching and so I guess that any modestly competent director could wring out some strong scenes from it. Russell Crowe is impressive, but somehow he never convinces me that he is someone else than Russel Crowe. Jennifer Connelly is competent, but her academy award was undeserved. Her performance is mostly not a very memorable one, acting out almost all the different and sometimes difficult scenes professionally but with no personality. It like there is a switch on her back, set from OFF to CARE.The fault may not be with her acting abilities though because Ron Howard's direction is, as always, very slick and without an ounce of character. He knows what he is doing every second throughout the movie and where to push the right buttons for 'emotions'. All in all, a perfect date movie or something to watch if you have a couple of hours to spare. But I cannot shake the feeling that this touching and true human story could have been more memorable in some other directors hand. Because a week after watching, I really don't remember many moments that have lingered in the mind.",5,0,1,23 October 2002
Shrek," Get better with every viewing
","I must admit that I was not very overwhelmed the first time I saw 'Shrek'. It wasn't as smart and heartwarming as I thought it would be and it had a mean edge to it's story and characters. Well, that was my first viewing. Another five or so viewings later I am willing to hail this movie as the masterpiece it is. True, it is not as cute and sugarcoated as your average Disney-saga, but now I consider it a big bonus. Instead you have some amazing characters who interact better than most live actors, a great but simple-to-follow story and lot's of funny lines and moments. And there ARE some heartwarming episodes! All the voices are superb in there parts, with an added bonus for Eddie Murphy (his best part in YEARS!) and John Lithgow. And I do like the interwoven fairytale creatures, especially the Gingerbread man whose 'torture' is a hilariously funny scene. And Shrek himself is a truly likeable fellow even if he is somewhat of a slob. The animation is amazing! The best part is the rescue of the princess with it's firebreathing dragon and all (also a funny scene). The ending ,with the escape from the dragon's clutches, is pure 'James Bond meets Indiana Jones' with a score to match and even the use of slow-motion! A delightful mix of suspense and humour! My only, minor, complaint is that the movie is too short!! But you do get a bonus after the feature to treasure :-) A MUST-SEE for children of all ages!!!!!!",9,1,2,17 December 2002
Final Destination," Tries hard, but doesn't quite make it
","'Final destination' starts out very fine indeed! From the ominous title-sequence, accompanied by Shirley Walkers effective score, until the inventive first murder, the atmosphere is thick with foreboding and threatening omens. And the airplane accident must surely be the most terrifying ever to be put onto celluloid! Scary stuff, to be sure!!! However, the movie goes downhill from there. The murders become more and more unconvincingly contrived (the bus-accident is a very well handled shock, though) and characters, grown-ups as well as adolescents, behave increasingly silly. Anyway, it's well above average for this kind of horror-thriller even if the final isn't as surprising as the filmmakers probably intended. Competent all the way with an unusual premise to begin with and, above all, a very nice surprise from a genre that seemed to have outlived itself after all the latest Screamclones.",7,0,0,23 April 2001
Cube," Enigmatic sci-fi/horror and for the most part very effective
","A very interesting premise. Six people locked in some sort of maze, trying to find a way out through the cubelike cells and at the same time avoiding devilish, nasty and very deadly traps.  This movie gets of to a very good start, where you find this one man trapped inside one of many cubes. He crawls through a gate into the next cube andÂ…well, let's say it is a very nasty and shocking surprise. One of the most innovative deaths I have seen for a long time. Then we are introduced to five (later six) people who try to survive and/or avoid different traps while searching for the exit. A black guy takes charge and soon they are not only fighting their surroundings but also each other. This movie never outstays it's welcome and you keep watching because you don't know what to expect next. Like many other horrorfilms, the intensity of the beginning is never quite reached again, but almost. If it has one big flaw, it is that none of the characters are very likable. The supposed hero turns out to be a murderous creep and our young heroine is quite obnoxious for most of the time. The ending may be good for some, but I felt it was a bit of a cheat. The story could have used a final twist. But all in all, most unusual sci-fi/horror and for the most part, efficiently presented but maybe not for everyone. Recommended!",Null,0,1,24 August 2001
The Wedding Singer," You've seen it before...but you will like it once more!
","*** MINOR SPOILER *** Sure, it's old-fashioned! The plot is VERY transparent from the moment we first watch Sandler and Barrymore together! And we have two MAJOR bad guys here, one male and one female and they are supposed to marry the leads against better judgement. So why watch something that you have seen before over and over again. Just because it's a sweet and painless experience, clocking in just over 90 minutes, so you won't be bored. You might however be slightly annoyed at Adam Sandler, even if he is better here than he usually is, but then you should focus and attention to Drew Barrymore who has a capacity to breath fresh air and life into almost anything. She is so appealing and natural that you won't be able to understand why Sandler has to hesitate at all!!! Admittedly, there are flaws. I could not figure out why Alexis Arquette's character ever needed to be in this picture. He is somewhat of a Boy George-clone, and they could have done something interesting with him and HE DOESN'T BARELY SAY A LINE! And even if the finale is sweet, it is also just a little bit silly. But it will do on a rainy night when nothing else is playing on the TV!",6,1,2,11 July 2003
