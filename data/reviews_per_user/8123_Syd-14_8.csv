The Devil's Advocate," Pacino: As good as ever
","I enjoyed this movie despite a somewhat weak plot and a weaker supporting cast. I think Keanu Reeves grew up a little with this performance, although, at times, he forgot the Southern accent lawyer Lomax was supposed to carry.Pacino was good in everything. However, he might have over-acted   (probably because nobody else would do it consistently well). I feel the best acting took place during the dialogue with Reeves at the end. All those lines about God were great -even though I´m a Catholic believer- because they displayed in a very sincere manner the essence of humanism and the skepticism of many people in the world who feed their atheism off those exact premises.I loved it when Pacino replies with the contemporaneous 'whatever'. The disdain he shows at this moment for Reeves´ own interpretation of what´s happening can only be called 'art in less than a sentence'.Finally, I agree with Pacino´s character when he advises Lomax 'to stay in the trenches', never exhibiting all his capabilities and knowledge without needing it so. I think that´s a very underrated piece of advise for many of us in this 'smarter-than-thou' world. 'Learn the subway Kevin!' Pacino yells. Let´s learn it all of us. Nice philosophical ending for an entertaining film, but what is it with all those Rolling Stones songs at the end of creepy movies lately?",Null,2,5,27 November 1998
Armageddon," A child´s movie
","This movie was entertaining, nice special effects and so on, but...please, don´t try to convince me this was meant to be a serious film.I spent 75 % of the movie laughing and making sarcastic comments about the stupidities and sorrowful pack of absurdities. True...fiction entertains, but...come on! have some respect for your average watcher!This is the kind of movie that is slowly taking the place of old comedies like Beverly Hills Cop, etc.I´m sorry, but half the theater was bursting with laughter...I had no choice but joining them with tears in my eyes...so funny!!",Null,0,1,1 December 1998
Independence Day," Commercialism at its best
","Horrible movie. Pathetic. Insulting. Embarrassing for true patriots...One thing is to create fantasy action movies...another is to insult one´s intelligence by creating special effect shows with a plot that stopped belonging in this world long time ago. What is it with aliens trying to destroy obviously inferior creatures? If they made it all the way to Earth, why would they even care about us?The plot has so many stupid inconsistencies that -even though we are aware the film is pure fantasy and should not expect a brainer-  it makes me shout to the producers: 'Why don´t you market this thing for children only????'Oh, Americans...I respect them and like them so much, but they´re so easily manipulated into xenophobia. Hey guys! friends! brothers! the world respects you! Vietnam is long gone! you have too many beautiful stories and achievements to resort to this kind of movie to rescue your patriotism! Stop that uncalled for, unnecessary, and artificial patriotism crusade! I repeat: the world respects you!! Don´t chew on any complexes!The movie is entertaining for its special effects, that´s about it. Pretending to make it a symbol of American pride and unity would make Jefferson and Lincoln puke...Arrrg!!",Null,0,1,30 November 1998
Saving Private Ryan," Devastating
","Devastating film. The landing on Omaha Beach was as realistic as it gets. The sound and the camera angles were superb. Scenes like the inflated dead animals provided a view of war previously unexplored. However, I don´t know how realistic was the freedom given to the German soldier who comes back to haunt the squad and slowly kills Mellish with the knife. That scene was shocking, considering that the other American soldier was slowly drowning in his own blood next to them two, involved in the loudest silence I´ve ever experienced.Despite a weak plot, I think SPR is an excellent movie, a solid work, and a horrible reminder of the cruelty of war, for those out there who love to WEAR military outfits as a fashion statement and would probably quit three minutes into the battle.For those who mentioned too much Americanism in the film, sorry. That´s life. As far as I know, this part of the war was an ALL AMERICAN effort, and there´s nothing wrong in saluting once again the flag and the spirit of those who died protecting the freedom Americans enjoy and of which I personally benefited while I lived in the USA. It seems some folks take freedom for granted. I wish you had lived here in Nicaragua during the 80´s. You would understand that spirit much better. If you haven´t experienced lack of freedom -and I´m truly happy for you-   try to refrain from making that type of judgement.All and all, SPR is one the best attempts ever made to portray the horrors of war as sincerely as possible.",Null,1,2,14 December 1998
Donnie Brasco," That final Lefty scene
","The movie is touching for the realistic view it portrays of life in the mob, but I think the most touching part is when Pacino´s character, Lefty, is called by his bosses in his last appearance in the film. He knows it´s time to get off the bus, we know his fate, however, we didn´t know how sure he was of his departure and how truly resigned he was.Seeing Pacino remove his neck chain, his watch, and his wallet after kissing his helpless and unsuspicious wife is a refreshing reminder that challenging plots and admirable performance are still alive. Well, it´s Pacino after all.Depp also did an excellent job. The rigidity of his facial gestures all along the movie, especially upon realizing the boss likes him during the boat ride, is remarkable.",Null,1,1,26 November 1998
When Harry Met Sally...," Inspiring, positive and quality work
","This film proves that you can mix comedy, love, and drama in a single shot, all while keeping a high level of quality. Both stars are superb in their performance, and although I´m not a romantic person, I have to admit that the plot of the film combines the subtle power of hope and illusion with the dry coat of reality in a very nice way.I enjoyed watching this movie. The insecurities, happiness, sadness, and life of the characters in general are very contemporaneous and realistic. The ending -topped by Harry´s declaration of love-  is very clever and refreshing.This movie is an absolute must for any couple who recently had a fight and are thinking of making up, or for any couple who recently made up and are thinking of having a fight.",Null,0,1,2 December 1998
Con Air," Malcovich...one cheesy movie is enough. Now get serious again!
","Well, I would´ve taken the big sack of cash, too. I shouldn´t really criticize Malcovich for acting in a not-credible, macho-man, no-brain, movie like 'CON AIR', but I wonder how dangerous for the career of a drama actor this action clips are.Hollywood is getting smart. They used to produce this kind of action packed films using no names. Now, aware of the increasing boredom they were creating in most adults, the industry has decided to start plugging in serious, established, quality stars in their cheesy movies (like Glenn Close in 'Air Force One' or William DaFoe in 'Speed 2').Don´t get me wrong, 'CON AIR' was entertaining, of course, but it´s far from being a brain teaser like all the other movies where Malcovich starred in. Again, I would also take the money. Can´t blame him for doing it, but... still...don´t make it a habit, please! Take it as a cameo role and go back to the real projects where people still talk about you a week later.",Null,0,0,30 November 1998
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," When Hell becomes Reality
","I feel this movie is a nice visual metaphor of living with a lingering pain we have never been able to remove and probably never will. It´s a painful display of hopelessness in the face of anguish from which there is no escape. Personally, I liked the performance of Pitt, Cruise, Rea and Slater, but I agree with those who think that -despite his acting talent- Banderas was a casting blooper. Overall, the music, the lighting and the cuts -such as Rea´s sinister smile after Pitt realizes his companions have been calcinated in the well- were excellent and made this a quality film. Cruise´s feast at the end? Marketing.",8,1,2,24 November 1998
