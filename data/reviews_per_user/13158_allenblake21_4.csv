Vertigo," Alfred's Best work of true art!
","This is Alfred Hitchcock's finest work. Though you find out who Madaline really is two thirds of the way through the movie, the ending is still climatic and very powerful. You never expect her to fall off the roof at the very end, but this helps cure Jimmie Stewart's 'Vertigo.' Bernard Herrmann does a fabulous job once again with the musical score. There is deep passion written in the music, and it enhances the mood of the film to a drawing and clenching feeling. The whole entire movie, you are trying to understand why Kim Novac is walking around as if in a daze. You think that she is possessed, but later you realize that it is all a gimmick. She falls in love with Jimmie Stewart, so after the death of the real Madaline. She forces herself to become her real self from Selina, Kansas.",10,5,7,17 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," It's Almost Sunset....
","There has been a lot of 'talk' about Pirate's of the Caribbean: At World's End that I do not quite understand. If you know me, you know that I am one for opinions and everyone is allowed to allocate and share it, but I have begun to realize that people are not appreciating art. I mean, I am obsessed with movies and soundtracks to the point where that is what I want to do professionally (record), and so I have seen and own my fair share of classics, new and art form movies. To define art form, let me give you some examples: Gone With the Wind, Vertigo, Amelie, The Hours, Somewhere in Time and Lord of the Rings. These movies are in themselves amazing feats, but they are ART. What I mean is that the shots are so beautiful and every single camera angle is a masterpiece. This is what I feel like the Pirate's of the Caribbean films are. They are art forms. Yes, movies are there to entertain, but they are also the Nouvelle forms of expression. At World's End is in every sense of the word Glorious. There has been discussion that the plot is too heavy or dense (which I guess compromises for the (not my opinion mind you) lack of one in Dead Man's Chest (as I roll my eyes)). Well, if people begin to realize that these movies are based on famous folklore, they will notice that they are not superfluous pits of script vicariously strewn together to create action. They are in themselves deep, thought out archetypal patterns portraying the imagination of the 18th Century seas. As I have stated several times as well, one cannot judge a movie by one thing. Therefore, I am going to give a list of reasons why this movie is utterly outstanding and amazing. The plot, as I have discussed, is intertwining, complex and extremely amazing, and in reality, one of the best I have seen (out of the hundreds I own and have previewed). The script is not to serious and not to funny. It is the exact amount of intensity and humor needed. The cinematography is jaw dropping. The art design is sensational and well thought out. The costume design is even more awefying than previous pirates (which is really hard to come by). The casting for each roll is perfect. The musical score is daunting. It really brings out emotions and portrays exactly what is happening on screen. An interesting thing about the score is that it evolves along with the plot. This is made evident by the theme portrayed during the 'Antarctica' scene (or track 3) in comparison to the 'One Day' scene (or track 12). The make up is once again sensational. The special effects are so realistic (another reason why they won for Dead Man's Chest). The acting is outstanding. I could keep on going on forever discussing the amazing qualities that this movie has. I don't mean to bash anyone who has these opinions of disgust towards this movie, but I really do not see where these narrow minded 'self called' critics get their outrageous and egregious ideas and perceptions about such an amazing movie. I honestly do not understand. Yes the ending is tragically depressing, and yes I have cried all the times I have seen it, but that does not denote a movie to doom-dom, and there was one uproar that I would like to solve: 'What are they fighting for in the way too long fight scene at the end?' Well, what I have to say about this is, if the fight scenes were any shorter, people would have complained as they did in Spiderman 3. Therefore, people cannot and will not be satisfied because they are looking for the perfect amount of fighting, which can never be found Â– therefore don't criticize. In regards to the moral base of the fights, here is where the folk lore falls into place: Lord Beckett is fighting for all of humanity with his greedy soul to destroy the wicked pirates of the world and gain control over the sea, hence the capture of Davy Joneses heart in Dead Man's Chest. Then Davy Jones is out to save his hide and control the seas once again, since he has lost that power (which is made evident when he kills all those in control over him). The Pirate Lord's and all the characters are protecting themselves and trying to destroy Lord Beckett and Davy Jones, otherwise they will be killed and trapped in the locker forever. I do not understand why people try so hard to punish decent material because it does not apply to their specific wants and needs. This is all I have to say - 'You go try and make a better movie than they did and see if you become more successful...what? No volunteers? EXACTLY!!!'",9,32,52,30 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," I guarantee you will have the closest shave you've ever known
","I have always been an avid lover of Stephen Sondheim, especially the musical theatre Sweeney Todd. At first, as I presume many people were, I was skeptical of the ability of the cast in their vocal performance. Let me just say that their voices, though not the 'best' in the world, fit the characters perfectly. Also, the casting was marvelous and I do not think that better pairs and people could have been chosen. It is hard to follow suite of Angela Lansbury, Patti LuPone, George Hearn and Len Cariou, but I think Depp and Carter both blow the socks off of the watcher and listener.The eyes are also given a stimulating roller coaster ride with the amazing color differences, stunning cinematography and intriguing mind puzzles that are displayed throughout.Though I know the musical well, I was still able to be at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I was still just as emotional stirred during the infamous Johanna and Not While I'm Around. I was also shocked, once again, when Sweeney kills his beloved Lucy. Even more though, when Mrs. Lovett is thrown into the fire, your heart aches and burns. How tragic it is when Toby, such a young and innocent boy slits Sweeney. There could have not been a better drastic and traumatic way to end the movie then to have Sweeney mixing blood with his 'vengence' (aka his wife).What a remarkable movie it is that draws your attention to minute detailing in the background and costumes; a movie that keeps you guessing whilst squirming at the same time; a movie where your heart is pulled.Many movie musicals keep to the original stage feeling where chorus and dance numbers occur on a 'stage' of some sort. Sweeney Todd breaks all of these barriers. It is hard to believe that this originated on Broadway. Tim Burton does bring back some of the same 'stage' choreography with the 'At last my arm is complete again,' 'These are the worst pies in London' beatings, 'We'll serve anyone...at all' butcher knife and rolling pin stance etc...This movie is nominated for some Golden Globes. There have been many movies that qualify and even can win for the ones that Sweeney Todd is nominated for. It is, however, not very often when a movie is able to be an 'art form' and also an engaging visual experience.",10,6,12,21 December 2007
Gone with the Wind," Melanie's Dynamic Qualities
","Have you ever sat and watched this movie putting yourself in the place of a person who had that extraordinary opportunity to see this movie when it first came to the big screen? How astounding it must have been to watch this glorious epic tale of a women who truly does not know what she wants.Each character has such depth and power, and what a dynamic women Melanie is. How hard must it have been to be accepting of Scarlett after being caught with her husband? Yet, somehow, when Scarlett attends her birthday party dressed as a 'lady of the night,' she walks over to her with outstretched arms and embraces her thanking her for coming and expressing her gratitude towards her. Melanie is most defiantly a pivotal character that is often over looked in the story. Most people think that the plot is between Rhett and Scarlett. However, if it weren't for Melanie, then there wouldn't be a story. When Melanie is giving birth to her child, Rhett comes and rescues them from the house as Atlanta is being destroyed. This allows Rhett and Scarlett once again to be in contact with each other, thus leading to their wedding. Melanie is basically the one that snaps Scarlett back into reality and makes her realize that she truly loves Rhett though it is far too late. Scarlett did indeed love Rhett, but she was too stubborn to allow herself to realize this. Even when Bonnie flew off the horse and broke her neck, she didn't understand. Melanie's death was the tragedy that woke Scarlett up. As she ran to greet Rhett, she knew she had lost him forever, but Melanie's thoughts were left behind when she passed. This is evident when Scarlett, whom we have seen the whole movie think about herself and wallow in self pity, rises from the stairs and proclaims, 'After all, tomorrow is another day,' and Melanie will live in her mind forever after.",9,0,1,23 January 2007
