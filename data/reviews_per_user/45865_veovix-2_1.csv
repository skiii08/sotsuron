The Blair Witch Project," F a n t a s t i c !
","Saw TBWP opening day in Seattle WA, and was Blown away. The film has a way of drawing you into the group; making you feel as if you are lost in the woods with them. Heather, Josh and mike seem like old friends.. friends whom are lost, hunted and traumatized.  There is a feeling of claustrophobic anxiety that builds with each scene. You want them to escape the woods but you know they are doomed. Finally, in the final scenes, claustrophobia explodes into out-right terror..  the best terror I've ever experienced in a movie theatre.Blair Witch is both horrifying and heartbreaking.. For two days now I've felt like I'm mourning lost friends who died mysteriously, even though I was there to see their 'end.' This is only possible because of the films total believablity. A masterwork of fakery..Heather, Mike, Josh?  are you OK?",10,2,4,18 July 1999
