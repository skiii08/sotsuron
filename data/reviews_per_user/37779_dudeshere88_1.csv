The Avengers," Hilarious and highly intelligent.
","One word. AMAZING!! Period. Joss Whedon has done a wonderful job. The effort he (and his crew) put into the movie is overwhelming and evident. I've never seen a superhero(es) movie being so hilarious, uncanny, intelligent, all together. This has bettered all the previous incarnations of each character, notably the Hulk, Thor and Captain America. The script is one of the finest that I've seen in a superhero(es) movie and so are the screenplay and dialogs. The one liners are the best! Especially the ones from Tony Stark. And OH how I totally loved watching the Hulk literally smash everything to pulp! You know what? This is just BS, go watch the movie, seriously, no amount of words can take you to the level of awesomeness that the Avengers set. Go watch it, I am, for the third time this week.",10,1,5,1 May 2012
