Mission: Impossible III," JJ comes thru
","MI:3 was an enjoyable movie.I didn't find myself tearing the movie to pieces trying to figure it out. The beginning was a little slow, but once the action started it was fast paced till the very end. Cruise does an acceptable job on a pretty good action movie. Go into the film with an open mind & you'll have a hard time not enjoying the film. As in most action films...don't go looking for an Oscar, just sit back & enjoy.Complaints: JJ does the action sequences just fine, but he should have developed Hoffman's character more. There was just no depth. In MI:2, they spent a good bit of time developing the bad guy & you came to loathe him. Here, Hoffman is just kinda bad guy eye-candy (the fact that Hoffman won an Oscar doesn't mean that he can make an empty character come to life all on his own). His scenes are good, but without the back-story - it just feels empty. As far as putting Fishburne in the movie...again not much in the way of depth. Finally, the last 3 minutes of the film were a bit goofy. Happy-happy-joy-joy (enough said). BUT none of this takes away from the fact that this is a fun movie to watch!Overall: MI:3 was a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Go see it.",8,2,3,7 May 2006
