Requiem for a Dream," Best Anti-Drug Campaign You Can Have
","This movie is the perfect anti-drug campaign. Don't tell kids not to use drugs. Just show them this movie and after they are done throwing up they will beg you to never let them see it again, and you won't ever have to worry about whether they will take drugs again. This movie was very graphic in its depictions of four individuals who screwed up their lives due to their drug addictions. It even gave you an example of how you can screw up your life by abusing prescription drugs. There's never been a movie so disturbing to me as this one and I don't expect to ever see another one like it. Various movies have attempted to depict the 'junkie' such as 'The Basketball Diaries,' 'Traffic,' and 'Trainspotting,' but none of them has had the same impact that this film had on me. I think that the movie did a really good job of creating this effect by presenting a situation that made you realize these characters lives were never going to be the same and there really was no hope for them to return to the lives they had before their drug addictions.",9,0,0,28 June 2001
American Beauty," The Definition of Perfection
",If you need the definition of 'the perfect movie' look no further than 'American Beauty.' This is simply the most perfect film I've ever encountered and I never expect to ever see another film that equals in brilliance. I sat from the beginning to the end in complete awe. The hairs stood on the back of my neck. When the lights came on at the end I felt completely different about everything. This is not just an ordinary film- it is true beauty. The kind of beauty you hold dearest in your heart.,10,0,0,2 October 2000
