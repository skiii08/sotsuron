",It was a truly eye opening movie the life story and the music were fantastic. Joaquin and Reese both did great jobs on the songs they performed.I would recommend this to my friends to see and buy the soundtrack also.The actual time period of this story is close to my own and I remember all the artists involved. The music of the time brought back many memories as it will with anyone who see this movie.Joaquin did a admirable job of portraying Jonny Cash and his lifestyle which I am sure many are not aware of. Reese did a likewise job portraying June Carter I was not aware John had been married before and of the romance the two had for each other.I hope everyone gets a chance to go see it or rent it in the future!,9,0,1,26 November 2005
