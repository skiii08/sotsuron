The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," It was good but not the best
","I was really looking forward this movie and I thought that it was okay. But sometimes really gross and awkward, especially since I watched it with my mum. I thought the first half (before we got pregnant) was good. I liked their honeymoon bit. Then when she got pregnant I found it just a little bit awkward. Especially since I was only 11 when the movie came out. I think that the actors did a really good job especially Rob and Kristen. I hate the part where she breaks her back ad then gives birth because I really can't keeps era open during that scene as it is gross, disturbing and cringy. The fight between the wolves and the Cullens was good an i loved how some of the wolves defended them. I really hate how Jacob imprinted on Renesmee. I mean you don't love someone and then when thy get married you imprint on their daughter, that's wrong. Then when Bella was shantung into a vampire and she opened her eyes I was like no! Don't end there. So I thought that this was an goo movie but not the best.",7,1,5,2 March 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," I'm not a hater
","I don't know why everyone hates the movie. I think that it was really good. I had been waiting to watch this movie for a long time and I could t wait ever since I watched the first part. I really wanted to know what would happen after Bella opened her eyes. I thought that this movie was really good. I think that the actors did a really good job and that everything in the scene looked real and beautiful. Mackenzie, Kristen, rob and Taylor did a really good job. I loved the plot and I like the movie better than I like the book. I really liked the epic fight scene at the end even though it wasn't real and they were killing off all the main characters. I was like no Carlisle! And he wasn't even dead. Sometimes i did find it a little cringy, like when Bella was running through the forest for the first time with Edward. I thought the ending was really cute and I'm going to miss the twilight series because it was my favourite after Harry Potter.",8,0,9,2 March 2014
