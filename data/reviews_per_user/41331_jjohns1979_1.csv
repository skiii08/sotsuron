Skyfall," Skyfall, and it's main character Emo Bond
","Okay, I can't stop thinking about this so I'm going to explain a few things. Basically that this was not actually a James Bond film. It was, as Michelle Alexandria pointed out, a film about his twin brother Emo Bond. The differences between the two personalities are hard to see at first, but after you notice a few things the pattern becomes clear.Now what kind of guy is James Bond? He's confident, tough, resourceful, charming. You can always rely on him to do everything possible to save the world or rescue the damsel. He's tricky and can be deceitful, but usually only when the person he's deceiving is trying to deceive him, and always when the end justifies the means. Emo is not like that, he's brooding, sulky, blames others for his own failings, can not be trusted to deliver on promises, and has Mummy and Daddy issues.The first sign we get that the hero of this film is not James but Emo can be found in the way he reacts to his perceived mistreatment by MI6 and M in particular. James Bond would have accepted that a decision was made (to take the shot) and that the outcome was unfortunate, and simply shaken it off and gone back to work. Or he would have been furious and left MI6, or at least found some way to outsmart M and get back at her. In contrast Emo Bond sulks in his beer for a while then comes back and attempts to milk sympathy from M and the rest of MI6. Emo Bond is always playing the victim card.Next we have a chain of events that prove that the character in this film is simply unable or unwilling to save the damsel, or to deliver on promises. When Bond meets Severine in the casino he makes an implied promise that he'll be able to protect her. He understands that she has had a very tough life, and she makes the brave decision to trust him. Later Bond is given a gun and takes Silva at his word that they are playing a game of William Tell for this woman's life. James Bond would have known this game was rigged and would have had some sort of trick up his sleeve to save her. Emo Bond is either too stupid, too scared, or too apathetic to save her. Now I know women have been killed as a result of James Bonds actions as well, but this was just too easy. Especially considering the MI6 choppers were only 100 meters away. James Bond can be a bit of a d@#k, but Emo is actually kind of a f$%kw*t.Also the two Bond's have different methods of seduction. James Bond is always the most charming man in the room. Once a woman finds herself talking to him it is only ever a matter of time before she succumbs to the sharpness of his wit and forcefulness of his nature. Emo Bond is the shy quiet type. He likes to sneak up on women in the shower for 'surprise sex'. Not very becoming of a super-spy in my opinion.As for the issue of a rough childhood, well that's just not something James thinks about. He and Emo had the same upbringing, but while James focuses on killing bad guys, sleeping with gorgeous women, wearing the best suits, driving the best cars, and drinking the best booze, his brother Emo never got over a sense of abandonment after his parents mysteriously died. While James was able to channel that rage into a productive and powerful force, Emo continued to carry with him a sense of melancholy.More bizarre though, was Emo's choice to seek out a surrogate mother in the form of work colleague M. James always had a professional, if sometimes strained or even insubordinate relationship with his work superiors. It was strange to watch his twin brother Emo, who shares the same DNA, become so emotionally, even romantically, attached to a superior operative. James Bond is a loner, like Dirty Harry, Mike Hammer, or that guy in the Searchers. Emo Bond is like Harold from Harold and Maude. In love with a woman that reminds him of his Grandmother.Last but not least, when asked what he thought when he heard the word country, Emo Bond said 'England'. James Bond would have said 'Great Britain'.",4,18,37,4 December 2012
