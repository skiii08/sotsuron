Casablanca," best romance ever created
","unforgetable dialogue, unforgetable characters, unforgetable plot.... perfectly describes the essence of true love...that being you don't always get the one you love, and sometimes giving them up is the greatest act of love you can do.....",Null,0,0,8 August 2002
Citizen Kane," Brilliant...but not the best ever made
","From a technical standpoint, yes, citizen kane deserves all the acclaim, even being described as 'the best movie ever made.' Yet somehow the viewer is detached from all the characters, and doesn't care what happens to kane. However the ending makes the film all worth while when the watcher discovers what exactly rosebud is.",9,0,3,8 August 2002
Citizen Kane," Wow!
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I've watched this movie a couple of times, and every time the ending still grips me the way it did the first time I saw it. The story (which some have the audacity to call 'boring') is about a man who had everything...except what he really wanted, love. Why didn't he have love? Because he spent all his time trying to accumulate more power, more wealth, more fame.
WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEADContrary to what many have said on this site, Rosebud not only symbolizes Kane's childhood and other superficial things like that, it also symbolizes the life he missed, the life he could have had, the joy he could have had, the love he could have had, if only money and power hadn't have gotten in the way. We all have rosebuds in our lives, and unlike Kane we are still alive to try to find them.",9,0,2,31 July 2001
