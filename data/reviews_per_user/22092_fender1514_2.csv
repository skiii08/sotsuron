The Ring," Didn't make sense
","This movie had potential to be very frightening but I just didn't feel it. I was the most scared when they switched scenes and would play a screeching sound and show an eyeball or a ring between the shots.  The whole point was that the girl wanted people to hear her story but why would she kill them once they did?  If she had this amazing power to just kill someone, why wouldn't she just kill the people who didn't know about her or some how make them find out her story.  A lot of stuff wasn't even explained like how did she make the tape?  It seems kind of impossible to me that a tape just appears somewhere.  The girl looked pretty freaky but other than that, this movie was not scary.",1,5,13,13 November 2002
The Matrix," Not only the bible, but also Plato
","I've read many of the comments regarding the parallels between the Matrix and the Bible.  I didn't see them before that but thanks for pointing them out.  The Matrix also had a strong parallel with the writings of Plato. Plato basically believed in two worlds.  The world that you could see with your senses (filled with problems, change, and imperfection) and the world that you could 'see' with logic.  According to Plato, the logical world was the 'real' world and the world of senses was created by a divine being(similar to the matrix being created by the machines).  Plato's allegory of the cave is a story to describe how this situation could happen. Basically, he tells of people who have been captured and chained to a wall in a cave.  Your head is held in place so you may only look forward at another wall.  Above your head (and out of your vision) are many objects that are part of the real world.  However all that you can see are the shadows of these objects cast upon the wall of the cave.  Everyone learns these shadows and makes names for them.  Their entire lives are based on shadows.  Upon being released from the cave the people are obviously in shock (like when Neo was released from the Matrix).  I could get into it more but I think you can probably see the parallel here.  Anybody who wants to more about it can study Plato a little as these are some of his major contributions to natural philosophy.",10,0,1,14 November 2002
