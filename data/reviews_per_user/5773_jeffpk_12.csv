Deja Vu," Uneven but engrossing
","This is an interesting pair of movies. I say that because it really *feels* like two movies. 2/3 of the movie takes place in the 'present' spying on the past. That plot line is a tight investigative thriller with a very clever spin on the genre-standard car chase. It fully resolves with the catching of the terrorist.Then the movie goes on to suddenly turn into a time travel movie, and this part is not as tight or as satisfying. After being told that the mass of an object determines the power requirements to send it back in time, and establishing that sending a piece of paper back in time in the first 2/3 practically blacks out New Orleans, they somehow send all of a not small Denzel Washington back in time without a lot more impact. Odd to say the least.The only idiot-plot moment of the film also occurs in this last 1/3 when Claire, on spotting the terrorist returning to the ferry, does NOT go tell the police right behind her, as she was instructed and who undoubtedly have radios to warn the police on the ferry, but instead decides to chase him. How she even gets ON the boat is a bit of a mystery since we see the terrorist JUST make it on before the gates are closed before she even starts running for it.All in all, this last 1/3 is so sloppy compared to the first 2/3 it makes one wonder if it wasn't tacked on by a studio demand for a 'happy ending.'Still its an entertaining film and the last 1/3, if a bit weak, maintains a good pace and carries you to the end.Edit: It recently occurred to me that the first 2/3 of the film can also be viewed as an interesting allegory for the 'imaginary' relationships we have in the modern world. His falling in love with, and in a real sense constructing an imaginary relationship, with this woman he by definition cannot interact with but only observe parallels our modern day obsession with media figures and 'internet friends.'",7,0,1,31 May 2011
Cloverfield," One trick pony, and the trick is both good and bad
","As others have said, this is basically a by the numbers giant monster invasion movie.Its one trick is the pseudo-amateur documentary filing style ala 'The Blair Witch Project. In fact if they had named this movie 'The Blair Witch Godzilla' you wouldn't have even had to go to the film to get 90% of it.The BWP technique applied to this subject material IS interesting. My experience was that it added to the sense of realism. I stopped thinking about the CG (which was thankfully used sparingly, someone understood that what you can't see is a lot scarier then what you can) and just accepted the action, which is unusual in my experiences of modern effects film.Unfortunately, the shaky hand held camera work really made me ill. I had to do deep breathing exercises just to make it through without vomiting.So... its an interesting little film IF you literally have the stomach for it. But if you are prone to any kind of simulator or motion sickness, I wouldn't try this movie.",5,2,3,12 November 2009
Pacific Rim," A loving tribute to anime and kaiju
","Pacific Rim is a live action mashup of giant robot anime and classic rubber-suit kaiju movies (eg Godzilla).Being a Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) movie, it has a strong, bold and lavish sense of visual style. It is clear that Del Toro both knows and loves both of the movie traditions he is drawing on but also suffuses the movie with a Hollywood sensibility, all without an obvious clash or discord.The plot is not deep, in fact as anime it would be on the markedly shallow side. There is none of the philosophical musings or mythological literacy that underlies good anime. It is, in the end, about as deep as a Godzilla film. The characters are shallowly drawn with obvious motivations. The plot is pretty minimal with most of the movie being spent on action sequences.In the end, my review is much like my review of Avatar. Its a B action movie. But what a B action movie!I saw it in IMAX 3D and, if you can, its definitely worth the extra few bucks. The movie is visually stunning, exciting in its action sequences, and in the end just a whole lot of fun for anyone else who loves the source genres.Which certainly includes me.",8,5,9,20 July 2013
American Beauty," An unusual gem from Hollywood
","Hollywood has its own language that doesn't exactly mean what you'd expect it to. A 'High Concept' movie is a movie whose entire plot can be summarized on one 3x 5 card or a phrase like 'Jaws meets Starwars!. Not exactly deep.This movie is anything BUT high concept. A deeply philosophical movie, for most of the film you may wonder why you are watching it as it seems little more then the depressing portrait of a middle class man in a simultaneously poignant and boring midlife crisis. I didn't know why I was watching this movie until the last line of the film... where suddenly it all became clear.And that it takes until then means it hits like a ton of bricks and leaves you really thinking.Really a brilliant movie. How it got a green-light though, is beyond me.",9,0,1,9 July 2010
Now You See Me," Movies about magicians keep getting better
","We've come a long way from the unbelievable, magician-insulting crap that was the Prestige.Where the Prestige got just about everything about magic and magicians wrong, this gets it right., There are one or two minor flights of fancy (I don't think the bubble levitation is workable, but I could be wrong.) but by and large it is very true to both the art and the ethic of the magician, Magicians since the time of Houdini at least have been very aware that our dark cousin is the con man, and we hate them and seek to expose them wherever we can. In this day and age, the con men wear suits and run corporations and banks, and in spirit there is no netter group of people to challenge them then magicians.In addition to getting the small stuff right, this movie gets it right in the large. Just when I was shaking my head and saying 'this can't be done, the safeties aren't there and it depends too much on people doing the right things at the right time', the movie pulls out the ONLY solution that solves all those problems.Like all great magic tricks, there is only one good solution, but the magician distracts from it to the point that we don't even realize its there.Sadly, I think this movie suffered from the problem many really good movies about magic do... they are so faithful to the hidden art that no one but practitioners believe its real. Ironically, the more absurd a movie about magicians is, generally the easier it is for the audience to swallow. The more accurate, the less the common man believes it.Which is probably why The Prestige did so well and this so poorly.",10,8,14,3 March 2014
The Number 23," An interesting, if maybe flawed film
","I gave this move a 7. 7 = 2^2+3Which of course is the whole point of arithmomania, the obsessive compulsion with numbers. Numbers only have meaning because we assign it to them, and so rudimentary is their meaning that it is easy to build any complex result you need to from them. There is a great history in just such interpretation as it relates to spiritual matters. For some reason, numbers and their relationships touch something deep in our own pattern recognition systems. In some people, that mechanism spins out of control resulting in faulty reasoning, obsession and/or outright delusion.In that regard this movie and the movie 'a beautiful mind' both touch on similar subjects, though from a very different perspective. As far as we know, the main character in this movie descends into obsession and paranoid, but never out-right hallucination.Which, in some ways, is too bad, because hallucination could explain what are otherwise some questionable coincidences in this film. The denouement of this movie is when the main character tells us 'there is no fate, just the choices we make.' And one could see this as his return to sanity. But without either fate or delusion, the movie hinges on a bit too many random circumstances to make decent sense.From what we see of the construction of 'the book' there is only, and can only be, one copy. It contains hand written notes and pictures that were cut out of newspapers and pasted in. Yet this one, lone copy finds its way into the hands of the one person it could effect by seeming random chance. That alone is odd. But what such an amateurish looking work was doing in a used bookstore to begin with also makes little sense... It would be about as likely as them buying your freshman history notebook.Ned the dog is also a prime mover of the plot. But this again is far too much coincidence. Why should the dog keep showing up at key moments . In the end, even though our protagonist tells us there is no fate, the hand of god is pretty much essential in making this story happen as it does. And that, in the end, is a rather confusing flaw. I would have given this movie more stars if it had been clearer in its conclusion. It is still a fascinating piece of film making, but the muddled ending detracts from what otherwise could have been a very strong work.",7,3,5,7 February 2010
Avatar," I am Joe, Dragonrider of Deathworld
","So, we went and saw Avatar last night at the 3D IMAX.It is a beautiful movie. It absolutely sells the mix of 3D animation and live action on a level I haven't seen before. The art direction is simply stunning and highly imaginative. The 3D is used not to poke you in the eye but to immerse you in the space. It was well worth the few extra bucks we paid to see it in large format 3D. It is, in a word, breathtaking.The story is well written and executed but is mostly a mix of semi- standard science fiction plot vehicles. I wont go into spoilers here beyond the title of this review, but suffice it to say there are no ideas here that will excite or surprise anyone with a decent knowledge of classic speculative fiction.I wouldn't call it a great movie, in the way, say, The Godfather is a great movie. This is, in the end, B movie fare. But, of course, thats what Cameron has always been good at. It does have stupendous A-plus production values and is worth watching for the visual spectacle alone. That the story is decent and competently told, is an added bonus. That it is hardly original and thus somewhat predictable, well, you forgive it that for all the eye-candy it gives you",7,0,3,9 January 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A sweet movie of the kind that shouldn't be made
","A wise man once stated 'Never make movies about Hollywood, because no body but industry insiders give a crap.'Its not always true, but it is more then it isn't.Birdman is such a movie. A love song to actors and the acting profession that encapsulates all of how screwed up most of it is. All the main characters are damaged and desperate for validation.I don't know why IMDb calls this a comedy. Its a drama, and maybe even a bittersweet tragedy. But it IS brilliantly and lovingly made and acted. Sadly, it is still all but incomprehensible to the mass audience.",8,0,3,30 November 2015
Prometheus," Deeper then it appears
","On the surface, Prometheus is a reasonable back-story to the movie Alien. if you are at all paying attention, it adequately explains who and what the giant pilot in the spaceship was and why the Alien eggs were on board. The adventure/horror story is fairly run of the mill. At times its a bit predictable and at other times its a bit silly (sometimes both at once.) As a space adventure movie it stands up reasonably well, if not being nearly as taught and tight as Alien was.If you focus exclusively on this however, you will miss the real depth of this movie. What is of real interest here is not so much the enigmatic aliens and what they are up to, as much as the humans in the story and their motivations and reactions. I'm going to break that down below, so fair warning, it comes with spoilers.The quest of the Prometheus is repeatedly stated by multiple characters as one to 'meet our makers.' What this means to the different characters is evidenced in their reactions to events and is the core question of this movie-- why do we seek divinity and what do we expect from it? For a science fiction film, this is actually a deeply theological piece.The first scientist,Charlie Holloway, is supremely depressed when they initially think all the 'engineers' are dead. He reveals that his big goal was to talk to one. To stand on an equal footing with his creator and show him how far we had come. To him, this is a chance to prove us, and by extension himself, as the mature equals of those we might consider gods. Although one might accuse Charlie of hubris, I prefer to see this as an urge to 'come of age' as a species.Peter Wayland, the enigmatic founder of Wayland corporation and the sponsor of the mission, seeks the answer to mortality. To confront it and to defeat it. To that end he built a humanoid replica of himself in the Android David, but just creating something that mimics himself that could live forever wasn't enough. He wants to defeat death for himself.What is death and how can we overcome it is a common reason humanity looks to divinity and religions have answered that same question in many different ways over the course of human civilization.They key to understanding Elizaberth Shaw, the second scientist, is the revelation through the movie that she lost both of her parents at comparatively young ages and she herself is wrestling with her own infertility. She is looking to her makers for meaning. Why do bad things happen. What is the purpose? Do we do something to deserve it? Again, a common theological question. She ends the movie still seeking the answer to that question from her makers.The last, and in some ways most interesting character, is the character of David. In part he is the Greek chorus. He stands outside of human questions and desires. In his comment 'sometimes one must destroy in order to create', he dares to suggest the most unpalatable answer of all-- that our makers care no more about us one way or the other then we might about the bacteria in a petri dish. Something to be grown, examined, and then thrown away to make way for the next experiment.The only thing driving his actions for most of the movie are the orders of his own creator. His only true wish, we discover in the end, is to be free of them. The quest for autonomy from our creators is embodied in him.In the end, this is a very interesting film dwelling in the place where psychology and theology meet. Just as an action film, its probably a 6.5. As i mentioned above it is certainly not as tight as Alien was. But it is also far more ambitious in content. Add in the deeper meaning and musings and I think it deserves an 8.",8,1,4,12 November 2012
The Wolverine," Holey Plots,Batman.
","This was better then the wretched 'Origins' movie. But that is damning with feint praise.On the positive side, it did move well. The pacing was good, the action well directed, and Hugh Jackman has the Logan character down pretty solidly. On the other hand, this movie has a plot with more holes then a decent piece of swiss cheese. The motivations of most of the characters are murky and just seem off. Yashida-san senior's emotional motivations never seem clear. First, he is ready to commit seppuku, then he is over flowingly grateful to Logan for preventing that. THEN he is ready to steal from Logan powers Logan is unwilling to give. In an occidental character I could almost forgive such capriciousness and weakness but it was totally out of character from a highly traditional upper class Japanese man. Especially one with the strength of character to forge an empire.Yashida-san Junior tells us his father bankrupted his company with his obsession with obtaining mutant powers... and yet is willing to murder his own daughter to obtain the inheritance of that company. In one of the smallest but oddest inconsistencies, Logan refers to the silver samurai at the end as 'bob', a name he gave Yashida senior during the war. Yet is somehow surprised when its head pops off and who is inside but Yashida senior? (Something which I would imagine surprised no one in the audience over the age of 8.)The main mutant villain, the Viper, remains a mystery as to any of her motivations. About the only clues we see are a homicidal disdain for men and her self description as a 'mutant, nihilist and capitalist.' We can suppose her motivation was pay, but she seems awfully committed to the job for a hired hand employed by an icon of male economic power.Mariko is basically the McGuffin. Everyones chasing after her for better or worse reasons. She herself is pretty much passive. But she too is strangely inconsistent. She tells Logan that she is marrying a man she despises because to not do so would 'dishonor her father'... and then within 10 minutes is jumping into bed with Logan. Now, I am not an expert on Japanese culture by any means, but this doesn't seem to me to do much in the 'honor' department for her.Yukio is Logan's reliable right hand from beginning to end. A fairly amazing transition of loyalties for someone who tells us her entire life is owed to the Yashida clan. Yes, Junior is a bastard and acts like it to her, but her primary loyalties are to Yashida senior who has almost no interaction with her in the film at all.I could go on, but you get the idea. The characters in this movie are so shallowly drawn as to be indecipherable and motivated so poorly as to be totally uninteresting.The sad fact, is I found the hint of what the NEXT movie will be about after the credits to be the most interesting part. But I always did like the Sentinels. (Note however that this creates a serious continuity error in the original XMen movie series, where we see them fighting a undersized Sentinel in a danger room exercise.)",6,0,2,1 August 2013
Cloud Atlas," A fine piece of philosophical science fiction
","This is not a highly accessible film, but few great films are and this may certainly qualify as one.It redeemed the Wachowskis in my eyes. The Matrix itself was a fun, well made, if in the end a lot more shallow then its pretensions, sci fi comic book actioner. The middle movie was philosophically interesting but suffered from middle-movie syndrome. The last wasn't even up to comic book standards and ruined the whole series with a denouement I could hear every Sunday in church if I wished to.I predict Matrix fans will hate Cloud Atlas. Complex and sophisticated in its story telling, and deeply philosophical, this also makes it hard to describe. You really have to not just see this movie, but truly experience it, and even then it leaves a great many open questions. I am not surprised that those who didn't get the movie also by and large call the future- dialect 'unintelligible.' In both cases, its a sign of ears that are deaf to anything new or that asks the audience for some effort.",9,0,1,25 July 2013
Cube," Crucible meets torture-porn
","This movie is, really, a pretty basic and pedestrian crucible story. A bunch of characters are thrown into a situation that seems out of their control and have to try to work together to solve it. In the process they are picked off one by one with gruesome death traps. That's the torture-porn part.From such pedestrian beginnings however comes what is, at times, a surprisingly engrossing film. You find yourself caught up in the same questions facing the characters: why are they here? what is this place? why did someone spend a whole lot of money building something with essentially no purpose other then to confuse people and kill them horrifically?Alas, the main characters never learn the answers to any of these questions and neither do we. We just get to watch them struggle and die in ways that are sometimes believable, sometimes not, and always over- the-top. The film-making craft here is excellent and the director manages to make you believe an entire environment with just a single set that consists of 3 walls, some make-up and models, and a bit of CG. Visually, the movie is stunning in its elegant simplicity and that's its strongest point. Unfortunately, the death scenes, while dramatic, often strain believability. A good example is the first one, where someone is 'diced' by what we can presume is a mono-filament wire grid. People, however,are not bricks of cheese that fall apart in cubes. We are much more akin to a tomato or a water balloon and the effect used thus, while visually appealing, makes no sense at all.But, in general, sense is not this movie's strong point. Film- making,and to a lesser extent , acting, are. And there it shines as a brilliant example of doing film on a tight budget.",6,0,3,17 June 2010
