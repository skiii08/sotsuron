The Mask," Jim Carrey steals the show
","Have you ever wanted to see Jim Carrey wear a green mask and bounce off the walls making Looney Tunes references? Well now you can! With, 'The Mask', a really great comedy with Jim Carrey as a bank clerk that finds a mysterious mask and when he wears it, he's bouncing off the walls and making you laugh.I love this movie mostly because Jim Carrey really steals the show and it has a lot of funny part's where he would imitate celebrities and act like a cartoon. In a good way. He's kinda like how Robin Williams when he did the voice of Genie in Disney's, 'Aladdin'.Overall, 'The Mask', is a funny movie that will make you laugh from start to finish.",10,1,1,18 February 2011
Black Swan," Weird, Bizarre, and Magnificent
","'Black Swan', is about a ballerina named, Nina (Played by Natalie Portman), playing the lead roles in the play, 'Swan Lake, but when a rival ballerina (Played by Mina Kunis) joins, Nina start's to lose her grip on reality and start's hallucinating.Pro's: Natalie Portman does a magnificent job as Nina and Mila Kunis does a great job in the movie. Most of the time, Mila Kunis, is in Comedies but in this movie, she's different. The Music in the movie was amazing and captures the tone of the film. The character, Nina, was also great because her personality in the movie switches from the White Swan to the Black Swan. When she act's like the Black Swan, that's where the movie get's really weird.Overall, if you're a fan of Darren Aronofsky's work or if you're looking for a good Thriller to watch, 'Black Swan', is definitely worth watching.",10,1,2,15 August 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Fun and action-packed sequel
","The film is about Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and a gypsy trying to capture Professor Moriarty.Pro's: The film has some really great action sequences.The acting is still great you have the original cast (except for Mark Strong) returning and you have Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza Heron and Jared Harris as the villain and they both did a great job as their characters.Con's: The film dose not have that many thrills from the first film and the film feel's pretty rushed especially at the beginning of the movie.'Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows', is still a fun movie to watch and it still has some nice thrills.",9,0,3,28 December 2011
Sucker Punch," A fun visual treat. But it's pretty disappointing.
","'Sucker Punch', is Zack Snyder's latest film. This movie has been given a lot of bad reviews and after watching this movie, I liked it.What I liked about the film is the visual's. They really blew me away at time's. Like in one scene, Baby Doll and her friends are fighting robot Nazi's in the trenches during World War II. The film also has some good acting from Emily Browning, but I found Scott Glenn and Oscar Isaac's performances really great.The two main problem's I have with this review is character development and the ending was a bit confusing. We only see Baby Doll's friend's working together.Overall, 'Sucker Punch', is not as great as Zack Snyder's last film, 'Watchmen', but it's still a fun movie. If you're looking for a good action movie to watch, this is worth watching. If you're someone that's looking for an action movie that take's itself seriously, then this movie is not for you.",7,2,6,3 April 2011
Akira," One of the greatest anime films of all time
","We've had many great anime films like 'Princess Mononoke' and 'Ghost in the Shell'. But there was one anime film that formed a legacy.The anime film is, 'Akira'.The film is also based on the manga by the same name. The film has some great animation and a nice story. The character's are also interesting. Who knew three kids with mental powers and having 60 year old skin would be interesting. The voice acting was good. Mostly because Johnny Yong Bosh and Joshua Seth did good job's as Kaneda and Tetsuo.Overall, 'Akira', is a great anime film that is definitely worth watching. Even if you're an anime fan or not.",10,2,6,27 January 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," A Star-Spangled success
","Today, Marvel has been doing a Great job releasing their Comic-Book adaptations. So far, 'Thor' and 'X-Men: First Class', have been successful.

When Steve is turned into a buffed dude after performing a medical test on the, 'Super Soldier', medicine, he end's up being, Captain America.Pro's: The acting was great especially having Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from, 'The Matrix') as the villain, Red Skull, and Chris Evans (The Human torch from, 'Fantastic Four') as, Captain America. The setting was also interesting because most Comic-Book adaptation's are taken place in the present. It also has some great action scene's.Con's: Sometime's, the movie can be boring and cheesy at time's.Overall, if you liked, 'X-Men: First Class' or 'Thor', you will love, 'Captain America: The First Avenger'.",9,2,7,30 July 2011
Van Helsing," A cheesy and campy Monster Movie
","'Van Helsing', is a monster movie with Frankenstein's Monster, The Wolfman, and Dracula. It has a nice idea, but the execution is just awful.The only thing I liked was the idea of having Frankenstein's Monster, The Wolfman, and Dracula in one movie.The rest was just cheesy and campy. The CGI look's like it came out of a Video game and Dracula is just laughable. Also, Hugh Jackman dosen't even do a good job as the titular character and Kate Beckinsale's performance was boring and flat.Overall, 'Van Helsing', is just a bad movie that dosen't try to be action-packed or scary. It's just cheesy and campy.",1,2,5,17 March 2011
Hellboy," A cool superhero movie.
","'Hellboy' is one of the greatest superhero movie's I've seen.The film has a great story, the acting was good especially having Ron Perlman as Hellboy, but the thing I loved about this movie were the special effects. The monsters in this movie were pretty interesting and cool to look at.The only problems I have with this movie is that we don't get to see Abe or Agent Tom Manning a lot in this movie and the ending was a bit disappointing.But overall, if you're a fan of 'Hellboy' or someone that's looking for a good movie to watch, 'Hellboy' is worth watching.",9,1,1,5 February 2011
Kick-Ass," An awesome comic-book movie
","We've had many comic-book adaptations like, 'Spider-Man', 'Hellboy', 'The Dark Knight', and 'Watchmen'.But in 2010, they released, 'Kick-Ass'.All I have to say is this, 'This movie was awesome'.The story is about a kid that become's a superhero and teams up with other heroes to take down a drug lord.The story was great, the acting was great, especially having Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy, the action scene's were great, and the movie was really funny.Overall, 'Kick-Ass', is a fun movie and definitely worth watching.",10,5,9,5 February 2011
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A stop-motion animated classic from the mind of Tim Burton
","Tim Burton is considered as one of the most greatest director's out there. He has done some great movie's like, 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'Edward Scissorhands'. But there was one film that has been considered as not only Tim Burton's greatest film, but also one of the greatest animated films ever made. The animated film was called, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'.What I love about this film is the animation. It's very imaginative and interesting to see Halloween and Christmas combined. The film also has some nice song's from Danny Elfman (He did the music for Edward Scissorhands and Corpse Bride). The character's were also interesting including the villain, Oogey Boogey (Yes, it's a weird name. But hey, it's Tim Burton). He's a walking bag and his body is made out of bug's (Creepy, huh?).'The Nightmare Before Christmas', is a great animated film that's really worth watching. But it might freak little kid's out. Just saying.",10,1,1,9 May 2011
A Bug's Life," People say Toy Story is their favorite Pixar movie, I say A Bug's Life
","Pixar has been known for making computer animated classics like Toy Story and Monsters Inc. But out of all of the Pixar movie's I've seen, A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar movie.The reason why this is my favorite Pixar movie is because the animation can be amazing at time's like where Flick is floating across the canyon to look for warrior bugs or when he and his friends are getting chased by the Bird. It's also really funny mostly because the character's were funny and likable like the fat caterpillar, Heimlich. It also has some nice voice acting from Kevin Spacey as the villain, Hopper.A Bug's Life is a great movie for the whole family to watch and it talk's about the life of a bug. Get it?",10,2,2,22 April 2011
Avatar," James Cameron returns to do what he does best, make great sci-fi movies.
","When I first heard that James Cameron was doing a sci-fi movie again, I was surprised. Because the last film he did was the 1997 classic, 'Titanic'. After watching, 'Avatar', this is what I said, 'I love this movie'.The reason why I love this movie, is the visuals. They were really amazing. Also the acting was great. Sam Worthington does a great job as Jake Sulley and Zoe Saldana does a nice job as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver also does a good job as her character. Plus, the action scene's were great. We have seven to ten foot blue aliens fighting humans in giant robots. Nuff said. The story was also good. I didn't care if people thought the story was a rip-off of the Disney film Pocahontas or Ferngully.Overall, 'Avatar', is a great movie that is definitely worth watching.",10,3,7,4 February 2011

When he land's on earth, he tries to find his hammer so he can stop his evil brother, Loki.This film was really awesome. It has some cool special effects, nice action scene's and some good acting from Chris Hemsworth and the legendary, Anthony Hopkins.I also like the relationship between Thor and Odin. It's more of a father and son relationship.There's nothing else I can say about, Thor. It's an awesome comic-book film that is definitely worth watching and one of 2011's best movie's.",10,6,12,14 May 2011

Just like what the title say's, 'One word to describe this film: Awesome'.What make's this movie awesome is the story. A guy rounds up a group of people to pull the ultimate heist by going into peoples dream's. Now that's a great story. The actor's did a great job.

They were really amazing.So overall, 'Inception', is a great movie that's really worth watching if you're into crime films or just looking for a good movie to watch.5/5",10,1,7,1 February 2011

","Pixar and Dreamworks has given us many great animated films like, 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek'. But special effects company, Industrial Light and Magic, and POTC director, Gore Verbinski, teamed up to make an animated movie. The result: 'Rango'. A fun animated film.I enjoyed every moment in this film. Johnny Depp does a great and funny job as the titular character, Rango. Timothy Olyphant does a great job as The Spirit Of The West (He is also a reference to, 'The Man With No Name', character). Bill Nighy does a nice job as the evil, Rattlesnake Jake.

The Iron Giant," An underrated classic from W.B. Animation and Brad Bird
","W.B. Animation is one of the less-successful animated companies because most of their films were box-office bombs. But they did make three classics, the first one was, 'Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm', the second one was, 'Cat's Don't Dance', and the third one was, 'The Iron Giant'.The plot is just like, 'E.T.', except instead of an alien, it's a giant robot from Outer Space voiced by Vin Diesel.

I like how it show's what Professor X and Magneto looked like when they were young and creating the Mutan Academy. It also has some great performances from James McAvoy as Professor X, Michael Fassbender as Magneto, and Kevin Bacon as the villain, Sebastian Shaw.The film also has some great action and interesting character's like Azazel, Mystique, Emma Frost, and Darwin.Overall, if you're a fan of X-Men or someone that enjoy's comic-book movies, this movie is definitely worth watching.",10,7,12,27 June 2011

But what make's this movie really great is, Robin Williams performance as the comedic, blue Genie. He really steals the show and does a really funny job as he impersonates celebrities including Jack Nicholson and Rodney Dangerfield. He also does a great job doing the singing voice for Genie.

Pocahontas," An animated Disney classic based on a true story
","'Anastasia' and 'Balto' were'nt only the film's based on a real person. In 1995, Disney released an animated film about the Indian maiden by the same name, 'Pocahontas'.'Pocahontas' is a great animated film from Disney. The animation is great, the song's were great especially, 'Mine, Mine, Mine', 'Colors of the Wind', and 'Just around the River Bend'. The story was good. It dosen't really stay true, but it was good.I did have a few problems with this movie is that the character's, Governor Ratcliffe and Kocoum, were one-dimensional. Governor Ratcliffe is just greedy throughout the film. But I did like his song. For Kocoum, just like what Pocahontas said in the movie, 'He's so...Serious'.Also, the film dosen't have that much comic relief. I know Disney was trying to make the film serious, but we could have had a couple comic relief scene's. All we got was the cute little raccoon, Meeko.Overall, 'Pocahontas', is a great animated film that's worth watching. Even if it's a bit historically inaccurate.",6,1,2,20 February 2011
