Ali," Mixed Emotions
","SPOILER--------------------------SPOILER-------------------------SPOILERIf your looking for a boxing movie you will be very disappointed.  However the first boxing scene was done as well as I have seen.  The way the sound is done really draws you in.Then the film slows down and is a little hard to follow because they skip around, leave things out.  It's a very important part of the story but it just doesn't flow very well.The acting was extraordinary Will Smith and John Voight especially, both playing larger than life characters and both really putting Oscar worthy performances. It was almost scary how real it was.The Directing was vintage Mann, and what I love most about his films are the locations everything is shot on location.  You just know there is passion in every shot.I can't say I didn't like the movie but I can't say I loved it either.  I just felt something was missing.  It's definitely worth viewing if you want to see great acting, wonderful direction and a look at what a major role Ali had during a very confusing time in our country.",6,0,0,2 May 2002
