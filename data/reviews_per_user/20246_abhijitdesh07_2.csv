Skyfall," Not at all Bond movie
","After disappointment from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace,i went with little hope of Improvement with Skyfall. The rating was 8.4 on IMDb before and i thought this time movie will be different if not too much of action but at least good Drama.According to me,the movie failed everywhere. Right from Direction,story,screenplay and most importantly the acting.Daniel Craig always looks in Anger and the expression doesn't changes.Apart from the starting scene there's isn't anything in movie. I think this has to be three of the worst Bond movie ever.I really enjoyed Pierce Brosnan all bond movie and liked them too.Sean Connery being the Best Bond ever,i think Daniel lacks those Bond-ness.The movie had some significance of Die-Hard 4.0 hacking concept and tried to made Javier Bardem(Raoul Silva) role as somewhat like Joker in 'The Dark Knight' which they failed. Bardem is great actor with some great acts in movies like No country for Old men,Biutiful and that's what made SKYFALL somewhat watchable.There were filthy gadgets shown in the movie,one that reads only Bond hand and second the radio which sends signal which army is in,so boring. In the end,Silva & Bond does barter system.Silva destroys Bond's car,Bond destroys Silva Helicopter.There wasn't much action unless the traditional starting scene,even the last scene direction looks boring.Thankfully i was watching movie in morning show on weekend,so it didn't cost me much.Advice:- Don't watch it on theaters,watch it at home if you have time or hardcore fan of Bond movie.",3,17,36,4 November 2012
Argo," Breath taking
","After Good Will Hunting the only movie i like of Ben Affleck was 'THE TOWN'.I went with lot of expectation and i came out of theatre with Happy face.Based on true story, you still required to put an awesome direction, dialogues & great set-up.I feel Affleck has done it remarkably well.I had bit of idea of Candaian Caper but i didn't read it completely as i wanted to enjoy the real story of the movie.The first scene were thousands of Iranian's standing outside compound wall and chanting.... 'Ha Ha....Amerika' (Sounds extraordinary like Gotham's reckoning one).Then the real show starts and movie takes you to different world.The screenplay makes you feel so real that you wouldn't like to step in Iran during any revolution.The acting by all the cast has been good too.Dialogues are wonderful it makes you laugh in such serious issue movie.The last 15-20 minutes of movie are breath-taking and you just wish them to escape asap. So do they manage to escape from Iran finally??? Do go and watch it out.......The movie gives extraordinary example of how International relations has saves some small number of life and their bonding became more stronger.It also shows,two faces of Humanity.",9,1,4,19 October 2012
