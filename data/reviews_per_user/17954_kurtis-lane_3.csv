Iron Man 3," Why no Iron Man 4???????
","This was a good movie, not great but definitely good. The misuse of the Mandarin was a hard one for comic lore lovers to swallow. It was also hard to understand how Pepper became so aggressive in the end . Why was the armor so weak and got destroyed like tin foil during the climax of the movie. Tony was going through suits of armor at the rapid rate during the finale. My question is with the large sum of money made off this film, more than doubling what it cost to make, why have they not green lit another one? I know he is going to be in Avengers 2 but I figured they could start moving forward on Iron Man 4 too. Anyone know why they haven't? Is is because of the price tag that RDJ has demanded for reprising the character? Seems worth it if he can double a figure like $200 million.",5,2,4,4 August 2013
Pacific Rim," Don't go see Pacific Rim in 3D
","My Son and I just went and saw PR in 3D and it was so hard to follow in 3D that we took the glasses off. I would recommend if you go see it, go see it in 2D. Not a bad movie but aside from the beginning which was short and the ending their was not much action in the middle of the movie. It began to drag on and the Character development was lacking and the plot was laughable. The beginning of the movie was where all the meat was contained as far as having a rich story, but Del Toro choose instead to skip over the most important part of the money as if it was just a side note. My Son became bored and dosed off in the middle of the movie as it became hard to follow. Hard to believe they would drop 185K and not have more to the movie. The best scenes were in the previews. If you do go, do yourself a favor and skip going 3D, you will be glad.",7,1,9,13 July 2013
Gone Girl," A Sequel?
","This movie was absolutely mesmerizing, I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie trying to figure it out. I don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this review that has not seen the movie yet, but I will say that if you have not see it you need to see it and you need to take someone with you to discuss the movie with after its over. After you see the movie you will have to decide if you like how it ended and are okay with its ending or if you are like a lot of the people I heard discussing the ending as we walked out wanting a sequel. David Fincher is an amazing director/producer and this is a must see movie, perhaps his best. I highly recommend Gone Girl. I am going to have to see it again when it comes out to purchase or rent from Red Box. If you can go see it on the big screen, I recommend that you do. It is still out as of right now as I post this review.",10,0,8,2 January 2015
