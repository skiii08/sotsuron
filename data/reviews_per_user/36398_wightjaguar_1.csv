Captain Phillips," Fantastic film, definitely worth a watch
","Captain Phillips was by far my favorite movie of 2013, I loved every second of it, and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole 134 minutes which is a little short but I think the length was fine.I liked how even though Muse was kidnapping Captain Phillips, Muse was also strapped as well, his job was to capture the ship, which he failed and as a last resort to save his life, he kidnapped captain Phillips, although he doesn't redeem himself through the movie, although he does do several nice things for captain Phillips, I still feel sorry for him at the end after he has been lied to and they just do pile him before he can even say anything. But the end scene with Tom Hanks and the doctor was just incredible and such a tear-jerking moment, the films was absolutely astounding. With Tom Hanks pulling off an amazing believable performance (as always) as Captain Phillips making you cry,laugh and everything in between, the last scene was so well acted, and to learn that it was all improvised by Tom Hanks just makes it that much realer.Barkhad Abdi also played a great character to the likes that was rivaling Tom hanks, he played the role very well.Overall it was a really well scripted and acted movie and if you haven't seen it yet, then go and watch it now.",9,0,2,3 April 2014
