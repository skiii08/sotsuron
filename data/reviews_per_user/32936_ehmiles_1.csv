The Avengers," Joss Whedon
","Words can not describe how much I love this movie. Over the course of his career, Joss has always exceeded my expect ions. From Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Firefly to Dollhouse and Cabin in the Woods, each of these films and TV shows carry so much depth. The Avengers was nothing less then that. It had comedy (loki and the hulk) it had tender moments (the death of one of their own) a little mystery, but most of all it had a compelling story line. One that never was dull or over the top. You really wanted these heroes to succeed. You felt for them, which if so difficult to accomplish with so many big named stars with big named characters are all in a movie together. Yet I always felt that each person got the right amount of equal screen time. (Except Ironman he had the most time, but he is also the greatest comic character of all time.) So bravo to you Joss for succeeding in another brilliant production, I can't wait to see what he does with the second movie!!",10,0,1,8 May 2016
