The Blair Witch Project," No imagination...Don't bother to watch
","In recent times I don't think a film has divided opinion quite so much as this low-budget, hyped-up spooky tale. A willingness to allow your imagination to submerge itself deep into the narative is the key to enjoying this film. Let your darkest fears and anxieties run riot and 'Blair Witch' will scare you. Watch it with a cynical attitude and you wil leave the cinema smug but disappointed.This is an excellant psychological horror that in the main shows nothing but suggests everything. 'Blair Witch' is fraught with tension and anticipation gradually building a strong sense of hysteria and despair.The film's climax is the best I've seen this year.",10,1,2,12 November 1999
