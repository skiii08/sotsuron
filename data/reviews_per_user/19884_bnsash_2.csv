The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," C'est Formidable!
",I have watched this movie and I really liked it....to me its one of Kieslowski's best movies.....I like the way he told the story....character flow was fantastic..... I like the sudden death of Weronika....the lightening was so fantastic..... if you watch the movie carefully you can find the orange and yellow color the main lightening color of the scenes and sometimes red and even brown.....Kieslowski was so into the lightening that makes the movie so fantasy although the movie's genre is close to a realistic view...... I liked the cast esp Irene Jacob's performance...she's my second favorite actress.......... I think it deserve a big 10...I have never used this rank for any other movie.....this movie is on my top 10 of life time....,Null,1,2,18 May 2007
