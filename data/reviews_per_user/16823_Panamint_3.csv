Vertigo," Film-making as art
","If you view this film as if looking at a work of art, you get a new perspective on it. The use of color, the music, opening sequence, camera work, etc all blend into one piece of artwork. As with any work of art, one person loves it, the next person doesn't understand it. That explains the wide variety of opinion about 'Vertigo'.When I first watched it years ago I too got caught up in looking for the usual elements of 'a thriller', 'a psychological drama', 'a love story', etc. Seeing and hearing the restored version has made me forget about all that and realize that this film is art for art's sake. I believe Hitchcock intended it to be so, because he tells us. For example, Scottie talks to Madeleine, he standing outside the car, viewing her in driver seat from the same perspective as the viewer of the car in Tamara DeLempicka's 'Green Bugatti'. Also, Midge says that she is reverting to her 'first love, art'. Scottie figures out what has happened by remembering the necklace from the painting of Carlotta. And, of course, some scenes are in an art museum.Some great movies are cultural icons and deserve a place in the Smithsonian or in movie museums, some more so than 'Vertigo'. However, 'Vertigo' could be placed in the National Gallery of Art.",10,2,3,17 June 2005
Black Hawk Down," No sentimentality here.....
","Bravery without sentimentality, thats the way these soldiers perform their military duty. The filmmakers have rightly tried to produce their film to reflect this fact.This film has become more significant in recent years. The U.S.A. has learned the lesson of Vietnam regarding war fighting (2003 Iraq war victory) but has not learned the lesson of Mogadishu (lack of advance planning for the Iraq police action since 2003).Remarkable special effects, such as all those crowds running at night, helicopter crashes, etc. Good acting by the cast members. Well-made film in all respects.Read the book either before or after viewing the movie. You can check out a copy free at most local libraries. It will enhance your understanding of the overall military operation, which does appear a bit too 'condensed' in the movie. It will also detail the drawbacks of the amazing real-time view from above that the commanders actually had during the battle. The book humanizes the unfortunate citizens of Mogadishu (the film does a very poor job of this, but just doesn't have time). Some other movies are pretty realistic, but 'Black Hawk Down' is the definition of stark reality.",8,0,0,27 June 2005
Tombstone," What a ride......
","A very good movie, well made action and with fine adult psychological aspects.The law was what you made it. Hard to believe, but this was western America in the 1880's. Equally unbelievable to us nowadays is the fact that Earp's ride of vengeance really happened, but it did.Outstanding performance by Russell. He nails Earp, and is the only actor to portray a sense of the personal charisma that Earp apparently had in real life. Kilmer is also good. He delivers a very watchable, outlandish and complex portrait of Doc Holliday that, like Russell, portrays a sense of who his character probably really was. Kilmer's and Russell's acting styles are so different that they interestingly show what a true odd couple these two historical characters were.Powers Boothe portrays crazy, wild badness as the insane Curly Bill. A fine performance that provides a glimpse at one of the types of unrestrained humanity that were roaring across the western landscape in the 19th century. The other supporting actors also do a good job as they portray the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of human nature.The director and actors have probably been to the real Tombstone, Arizona and have researched the subject matter. This is arguably the best of the Tombstone/Earp era movies. It is the only Tombstone/Earp movie you will ever need to see, but anyone who is not a western buff will also be entertained by these remarkable performances.",8,0,1,16 November 2006
