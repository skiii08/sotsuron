Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stunning visuals & music, average acting, sub-par plot
","Easily the weakest of the Star Wars movies, The Phantom Menace is, at best, a missed opportunity.  It could have/should have been great, given the number of years it ultimately took to create.  It's worth seeing, but I can't give it any higher praise than that.",6,0,1,11 August 1999
Unbreakable," 'Unbreakable' is broken...
","I had expected 'Unbreakable' to at least be a decent film.  Wrong.  It just wasn't that interesting and, yes, it was quite predictable.  Big disappointment, but not a total waste.  4 stars (I'm feeling generous).",4,0,1,25 April 2001
Star Trek," Good as a standalone movie, but does not fit in well with the rest of Star Trek
","Taken as a movie in a vacuum, this installment of Star Trek is pretty good. It's fast paced, the visuals are good and most of the characters are well cast. The story line is a bit weak in some places and there's absolutely no excuse for that. Overall, the movie is quite enjoyable.However (you knew this was coming), Star Trek has been around for 40 years and you can't ignore the past -- bail out know if you don't like spoilers. Throwing out the entire time line that has been built up since 1966 was an unnecessary and ill-conceived event, unless the planned sequel somehow restores most of the previous time line. Moreover, they even did a bad job of changing the time line by having the events at the beginning of the movie occur at a stardate later than the beginning of the original series with the 30-something year old Kirk. (TOS has stardates going back to 1312.4 and the movie starts years earlier at stardate 22...something or other.) Likewise, there is no excuse for using the near-Enterprise-A version of the ship instead of something that resembled the original more, since the construction of the NCC-1701 Enterprise is before the time line change.There are numerous other things that happen that don't make sense. Star Fleet would not give command of its newest star ship to a 25ish cadet. Scotty is older than Kirk, not younger ... and that happened before the time line change so the movie just got it wrong for no good reason. Likewise, Chekov is much younger and would not have been around to navigate a newly launched Enterprise. The Enterprise had much of it's layout and structure already defined. It could have been made more 'realistic' in the movie but it should not have been dramatically changed. And finally, the whole Spock-Uhura thing makes less than no sense.There was an outcry when Star Trek V had a series of improbable events that did not fit in with everything else that had gone before. Now it looks like a minor transgression.Again, taken separately from the series and the other movies, this one is very good. However, given the wanton destruction of almost all that had already been established (and for no good reason!!!) , it is not possible to give this movie anything better than 8 out of 10 and that might be a stretch.",8,1,6,16 May 2009
Days of Thunder," Tom Cruise is once again put in a role he's unsuited for.
","This feeble attempt at 'Top Gun in a race car' has neither the story, nor the supporting cast, nor the excellent sound track and cinematography of Top Gun, resulting in a regrettable and forgettable film.  Tom Cruise is out of his element (as he was in Top Gun); he should stick to lawyers and sports agents.  In the end, Hollywood hype made the film successful, but 20 years from now everyone will be wondering why.",3,4,8,18 October 2003
A Hard Day's Night," Two words: A CLASSIC
",A Hard Day's Night gets better every time you watch it.  Definitely 10 star material.  It is hard to believe that some IMDB voters gave it lesser ratings.  I've found in the past that many people who don't appreciate the film have trouble hearing the dialog.  So do your friends a favor and turn on the subtitles the first time through.,10,4,5,11 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Disappointing
","The Sixth Sense just wasn't that good.  The acting and production of the movie were fine, but the story was weak. The big surprise ending I was expecting turned out to be no surprise at all.  Those people who rated this movie a ten should watch some other films so they can learn to rate more objectively.  Now Casablanca.... there's a 10.  The Sixth Sense isn't even in the same league.",6,0,0,28 July 2000
The Truman Show," BORING
","This movie just might have made a good half hour episode on the 'Twilight Zone', but there just isn't enough here for a feature film and the idea is hardly original - the sixties series 'The Prisoner' had many similarities. Do yourself a favor and skip it.",3,4,10,17 July 1999
