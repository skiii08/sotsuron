Howl's Moving Castle," Nostalgic
","A very beautiful animation movie, from art to plot; the music is the cherry on top. I reminisce seeing it home alone wanting to experience life as Sophi. It was my favourite movie then. Still find it great whenever I see it now.",10,0,0,16 March 2020
Parasite," Superb
","The scenery, the performance, the achitecture, the cast, everything knits tightly together to form a bittersweet -masterpiece if I dare say- film. It's been a while since I saw it, but it stays with you; a must see for sure.",10,0,1,15 March 2020
