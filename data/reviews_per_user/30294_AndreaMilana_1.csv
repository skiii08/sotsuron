The Monuments Men," one of the the worst movies I have ever seen...
","Boring as hell! I couldn't resist till the end, I walked out at around 40min. movie and up to that point I was in vain waiting for something interesting to happen; damn if I was wrong... Talking about actors, Bill Murray is long gone, that's for sure, there's nothing left; such a let down especially when you are a huge fan of his old movies, like in my case. Is that all? Of course not, then we also have one of the worst and inappropriate soundtrack ever used, O-M-G!...well it's not even worth it the time I'm actually spending writing this thing, but this might be of help for somebody else, spend your money and time in any other way but this.",1,1,3,26 February 2014
