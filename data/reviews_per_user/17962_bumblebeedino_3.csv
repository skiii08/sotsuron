Skyfall," Sam Mendes to Bond like C.Nolan to Batman
","As title says Sam Mendes is a brilliant director he showed that in other movies and in this movie.Movie starts in the middle of the action, even then i noticed something is different, action scenes where watchable and there is no shaky camera that has been introduced in Quantum of solace by Marc Forster who betrayed trust of Bond by destroying him in cold blood. Maybe you don't need to no much about that,maybe right now all you need to know it's that that failure of Quantum of solace has not been for nothing because of that he now have new Bond movie 'Skyfall' in my opinion Best movie ever.Skyfall hand to hand combat looks fantastic,visual are great,acting is great especially Javier Bardem with his fantastic performance as Silva and i am free to say that Silva to this movie like Joker to Dark Knight. I like that they brought some old stuff i wont spoil it for ya, but you will have a big smile on your face if you are a true Bond fan.Over all movie is brilliant and story is fantastic.So you have recommendation for me to see this movie.A brilliant, brilliant MASTERPIECE! 10/10!",10,4,19,31 October 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Masterpiece!
","When i first heard 2 years ago that this movie is coming out, i was surprised as much i loved firs two Raimi's films i didn't like the third one in my opinion Spider-man 3 is BORING and it was sad to look at retarded Pete Parker. I was hoping for an fourth one but instead we got a reboot.In my opinion first 20 minutes of this movie are batter then whole original trilogy.And main reason is because of Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield he is much batter SPIDER-MAN than its predecessor Tobey Maguire. And Emma Stone is batter than Kristien Dunst by far.Three things i like about this movie are 1)UNTOLD STORY(Even it's not told but it will be in sequels)2)CAST(ANDREW GARFIELD,EMMA STONE,MARTIN SHEEN and others)3)VFX AND FIGHTS(Like Schools fight)I didn't like about this movie is that its little bit like 500 days of summer so you can call this move 500 Days of Spider-man and i think that lizard character played by Rhys Ifans i missed out they didn't sowed this family and his story i hope that they'l do that in the sequel because Lizard is first Spider-man movie villain that didn't die so that's reason why i hope for him in sequelsOver all THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is a brilliant masterpiece and it's one of rare movies worth watching in theater's so buy your tickets and go watch it before it's too late.Good job MARC WEBB ANDREW GARFIELD, EMMA STONE and other. 10/10!P.S Thanks for reading.",10,5,11,31 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," One of the best movies of all the time!
","The dark knight rises is epic conclusion on C.Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy that is reason why i waited for this movie 4 years.On July 20th of 2012 i saw this movie i got out theater and i was so filled with emotions because this move mad me cry because of sadness and because of happiness.Batman was raging when he was fighting with Bane.Batman would wreak his anger on Bane and bane would be like 'Piece has cost you strength victory has defeated you', and then he broke his back at that moment he showed you who he really is. As trailer sad 'Hope is lost' i really lost hope that Batman will survive.I was impressed with Anne Hathaway's acting as Catwoman, and especially Tom Hardy's role as Bane but i didn't like it as Heat ledger's R.I.P impression as Joker but i like more Bane character than Joker in Nolan's trilogy.Sad thing is that The Dark Knight Rises is 8 years after events of the dark knight and there is no word on Joker. Over all The Dark Knight Rises is an fully emotional move and my favorite movie of all the time.So go and buy tickets for the movie before it's out of theater's. Rating is 15/10! Enjoy!",10,2,8,30 October 2012
