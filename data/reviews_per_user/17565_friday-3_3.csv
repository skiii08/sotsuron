The Blair Witch Project," This movie sucked BIG TIME!
","i had never been so bored by a movie in my life (until i saw EYES WIDE SHUT). Why does everybody think this film is so scary? i liked the website and the mythology they put out, but the movie was BAD! These were college kids, who'd figured out how to use a movie camera, video camera and sound equipment, but they couldn't figure out a compass? For their information, just pick a direction and GO. It also made me sick to my stomach.",1,1,3,30 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Snooze Fest
","The only reason i liked this film better than THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, was it didn't make me seasick. It did make me bored to tears and really p***ed off when i turned to my friend and asked what time it was, and he told me we had 40 minutes to go! i didn't care about anybody in this movie. Are all orgy's as boring and dispassionate as the one portrayed in this piece of detritus? Save your money and your time.",Null,0,0,30 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," i really liked this one. go see it.
","Haley Joel Osment deserves an Oscar nomination.  He's a young boy who sees ghosts, and understands how they've died won't let them rest  It causes him to be introverted and isolated  His mother is single and works 2 jobs, so he doesn't want to bother her w/his problem.  Enter Bruce Willis as a gifted, child psychologist who's suffering from alienation of his own caused by a tragedy some months earlier in his own life.  Bruce feels if he can help Haley, he'll make up for another little boy he failed. Bruce is wonderfully restrained, as is Haley, and lets the story carry him along to a unique conclusion.",Null,0,0,2 August 1999
