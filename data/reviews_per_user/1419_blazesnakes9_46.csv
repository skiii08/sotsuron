The Blair Witch Project," An Experiment in Terror.
","Opening in 1999, The Blair Witch Project became a hit with critics and audiences. In my point of view, The Blair Witch Project is the most smartest and most frightening movie of all of the horror movies. In October 1994, three students go in the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. But, what they don't know is that the Blair Witch is stalking them. Though the movie is filmed completely on a hand-held camera, it does do a good job keeping track of the suspense. The Blair Witch Project also has a ultimate touch on reality and technology. In one of the scenes, one of the students say that reality isn't really real anyway when you see it. That is a very excellent set up of the whole picture. To create the illusion of suspense just by seeing a unknown object that is terrifying and intimidating. The end of the movie is probably the creepiest scene of all. With good acting from the students and good writing, The Blair Witch Project is a good-natured horror movie. Thumbs Up. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,4,4 February 2011
Minority Report," Minority Report gets a A+
","When people go to the movies, they go with a lot of emotion build up inside of them. Those emotions can be happy, sad, angry or even excitement. Steven Spielberg is particularly one of the best movie director out there in Hollywood today. He can make movies the way movies were meant to be made. He makes movies that are filled with wonder, magic, and even thrills. But, in this science-fiction thriller made by Spielberg, those emotions are obvious to the audience. In Minority Report, Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of Washington D.C. PreCrime police force. As the movie opens, Anderton and his fellow colleagues witness an upcoming murder from a future killer, who's planning to commit a future crime. The way it works is that in 2054 A.D., PreCrime can stop a future criminal from having to commit a future crime. In other words, catch the criminal before he or she commits the crime. For the last six years, Washington D.C. has been murder-free because of PreCrime. Furthermore, the PreCogs that are used in this police unit can see visions of the future. There are three of them, each of which are stationed inside a pool of milk. These PreCogs have precognitive abilities to see their future murders. Everything seems to be okay for Anderton until one day he witnesses himself committing a future crime. Now, how did that happen? Anderton quickly tries to hide the footage and is forced to run from the law as he tries to dodge the police every which way he can. Colin Farrell plays Danny Witwer, an very risky Department of Justice agent in the PreCrime unit. Witwer and Anderton inexplicably creates a tension between themselves even at the beginning of Anderton's run from the law. Max Von Sydow plays the official of the PreCrime unit and is also Anderton's superior. He is also drawn into the investigation. Meanwhile, Witwer tries to replace Anderton's position by placing himself as the chief of the PreCrime police force. Most of the movie consists of Anderton trying to outrun the law by avoiding them at any costs. Some of the action sequences in Minority Report are very well-directed by Spielberg. One of my favorite out of all of them is when Anderton gets into a fight with Witwer inside a car factory. The storyline of Minority Report gets complicated, I think, because the movie wants us to solve this entire mystery behind all of the technology that this world has in store. But, there's more to that. The movie also deals with specific themes of mistaken identity and family relationships. We even see how Anderton deal with the pain and suffering throughout the movie with him feeding himself pills and medication. Even more specifically, we see a distinctive relationship between him and his son, who drowned in a swimming pool. The story of Minority Report was based off a short story by cult science-fiction author Phillip K. Dick. To me, Dick's other movie adaptations including Blade Runner and Total Recall were also very successful critically, but also holds a deeper meaning to the hardware. In both movies, you can see the everyday man being forced into a situation where technology affects their surroundings and themselves. The cinematography is absolutely well photographed with a bleached-colored tint. The look of the movie is fascinating to see and eye-popping to look at. Spielberg's vision of the future has never been more better than before. This is the second Steven Spielberg's movie to be set in the future during the early 2000's. His other sci-fi film, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, was also a very good looking movie. Minority Report is certainly one of the best movies of 2002. The feel and look of the movie makes it seems that Spielberg was actually making a tech-noir film, which he did. The one other criticism that I have about Minority Report is that this movie focuses more on everyday themes that affect our society. That is significant to other science-fiction movies as well. But, the way Minority Report portrays those themes makes us wonder about the world we live in. This movie did come out in the early 2000's and according to my critical praise of this movie, I can only say this world is probably moving a lot more faster, even though technology is making several advantages and advances in our everyday lives. You can love it or you hate it, but you can't underestimate technology in the 21st century. The world is changing and we are too. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,2,26 December 2013
Chinatown," An early predecessor to L.A. Confidential
","Film noir is a genre that consists a sense of pessimism. It is a style in the cinema that can be described as dark, depressing and twisted. In the film noir world, the cops are crooked, the women are devious and the hero is a man who can't seem to understand anything that is being investigated. By the end of this long-lasting journey through intrigue and mystery, you will find the truth and the truth will or can be deceiving.Enter J.J. Gittes. Gittes (Jack Nicholson), is a hard-working private eye, who's specializes in eavesdropping on cheating wives and husbands. His job consists of dropping onto a conversation between the cheating wife or husband and snapping photographs of the two of them together. One day, Gittes finds out that a client wants him to take pictures of her cheating husband. The husband is a chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Learning that he is building a reservoir and that people are opposing his construction of the reservoir, Gittes decides to follow the chief engineer around, taking photographs of him and his adulterous lover. Now, you might think I am telling the first half of the story. Well, I am. The reason why is because the story of Chinatown is a lot twisted than you think.After Gittes finds out about the cheating husband, he soon finds out that the woman he met in his office is not the same woman he met before. Enter the second character of the story, Evelyn Mulwray, (Faye Dunaway). She is the actual wife of the chief engineer. But, who was the client that was in Gittes' office? Anyway, Gittes continues his investigation and winds up having his nose cut from a punk, (Roman Polanski), and having to find out that water is the main clue of the murder. But, wait a minute.... The chief engineer is in control of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Why would someone kill him? The story deepens as Gittes meets up with Noah Cross, (John Huston), during his investigation. Now, there are two people involved in this mystery. More clues start to pop up. And Gittes? Well, he's in way over his head. I guess the truth is going to be hard to get to.Chinatown is in the great tradition of the film-noir movies of the 1940's. In fact, the story takes place in 1937 Los Angeles. Director Roman Polanski creates a very dark and disturbing underworld where sometimes the truth can lead to dangerous circumstances. The set direction and costume design are very well done and builds a certain amount of authenticity as both a period picture and as a film noir movie. The way Los Angeles is portrayed as a city of mystery is great because there is so much going on in this metropolis that we, as the audience, are caught between two ongoing problems: the water issue and Gittes' investigation.Jack Nicholson is perhaps, one of the best and most hard-working actors of our time. He creates, what I think, one of his best and most memorable performances in his career. He portrays Jake Gittes as both a man and a detective, who understands something about bad luck since he been to that place. Here, his presence makes the film works because he can't seem to penetrate this strange and mixed up world that seems different to us since he can't understand everything he's given. The more he feeds himself into this world, the more knowledge he will gained. Every time he gets closer to the clues, he ends up having to be drawn back to himself. One scene that proves this point is when Gittes' nose is cut by Polanski. Every step is dangerous, according to Gittes.I also enjoy and really admired the performances by Dunaway and Huston. Dunaway is stunning as Mulwray, creating a character, who at first, isn't pleased by Gittes' joke, but soon comes to terms and becomes Gittes' helper as she begins to explore the underworld with him. Together, you might think that there's a chemistry between the two, but really, these two characters are somehow locked up in this underworld, where everything is not what is seems to be, according to the characters. John Huston is very convincing as Noah Cross, a man who's questions are startling to Gittes since he is crossing that invisible line between discovery and the truth. In one scene, he advised Jake, 'You don't what you're dealing with. You just don't'Robert Towne's screenplay for the movie is a captivating script that is filled with authentic dialogue, which illustrates the world of 1937 Los Angeles and also creates sharp conversations between all of the characters. There are a lot of great well-written and well-spoken lines in Chinatown that can be dared to be said. I wish more storytellers can tell more stories like this one. It is also equivalent to a great book, one that you can't simply put down. I have had that feeling while watching Chinatown. I just couldn't stop watching and for the most of the time, I was more focused on every bit of detail and aspect that this movie had to offer. The first time you might not understand everything that is being done. But, when you see it the second time around, you will understand how everything falls into place. In fact, maybe we can learn something about the littlest details, like water. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,2,12 June 2014
Se7en," Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Pride, Lust and Envy
","At the start of Se7en, we get to see a murder scene happening in the beginning of an investigation. The detectives are played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. What they don't know is that the next seven days are going to be a rude awakening by a series of unfortunate murders. Se7en has a great and smart idea and a great pacing of suspense. But, sometimes the movie is hard to watch because of the graphic violence being displaced. After the beginning of the movie, the detectives are assigned to solve the murder cases. They have a similar connection, all of the cases is marked with the seven deadly sins. Soon, they realize that a menacing serial killer is on the loose. The setting for Se7en really concentrates on a dark, quite scary atmosphere. We don't know where the story takes place, but that means anything big in the plot because this movie holds the full package. Se7en keeps a dark and grim tone to the murders. This is a full exceptional cast also including R. Lee Ermey and Gwyneth Paltrow. Se7en works at its best with all of the suspenseful scenes and it pulls off with a edge-of-your-seat climax. A great mystery thriller. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars",8,0,1,31 May 2011
The Big Lebowski," I'm not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowksi. I'm the Dude.
","The Coen brothers' movies never cease to amazed me. From Blood Simple to Raising Arizona, these two cinematic geniuses always made me laugh and also enlightened me in any situation they put on the big screen. Yet even in the slightest sense sometimes, their stories can be twisted, but hilarious. And after seeing The Big Lebowski twice on DVD, I can finally sit down and write a critical review of the movie.The story takes place in Los Angeles in the year 1991. Jeffery 'The Dude' Lebowski, (Jeff Bridges), is not your average movie hero. In fact, the Narrator, (Sam Elliot), tells us in the beginning of the movie that the Dude is considered the laziest man in Los Angeles. He's a loner, a loser and a fan of drinking White Russians. The Dude also has friends like his bowling buddies, Walter Sobchak, (John Goodman), an angry Vietnam veteran, and Donny, (Steve Bucemi), an simpleton who doesn't seem to pay attention to somebody's conversations. When the Dude is ambushed at his home, he realizes that the guys who assaulted him got the wrong man. He soon finds out that there's a another man who has the same name, Jeffery Lebowski, (David Huddleston). The big Lebowski, (Huddleston), wants the Dude to find his kidnapped wife after receiving a ransom note from the kidnappers. So, the Dude and Walter decides to bring the ransom money to the kidnappers since they were given instructions from them. Unfortunately, this doesn't go as planned. The Dude and Walter failed to bring the money and as a result, the Dude receives news that the culprits cut off her toe. With evidence pending, The Dude decides to investigate the mystery along with Walter as the story deepens into bizarre twists and turns involving a porno king, (Ben Gazzara), who uses the Dude to star in one of his films.After seeing this movie twice, I started to figure out why this movie became a cult movie of its own. And I think I know why. Most movies consists on telling stories that have a meaning to it. The plot can be either straight forwarded or filled with many twists and turns. There isn't really any meaning to The Big Lebowski. Maybe audiences are tired of seeing movies that are predictable or recycled. In fact, I am also one of those people who can't stand watching films that are recycled from the screenplay factory. The Coen brothers don't fall into that specific category. These two men can write sharp and witty dialogue. Some might even compare this movie to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. What these two movies have in common is, yes, they are set in the City of Angels, but also to make a point, the way the characters in both movies talk in such a way that it's sounds screwy and also funny at the same time. It's rare today to see films that are dialogue-driven. I know for a fact that some audience members don't like too much dialogue. I can understand that statement. But, dialogue doesn't hurt. It certainly doesn't.Out of all of the characters that the Coen brothers has written in their films, I have to say that the Dude is, perhaps, the best well-written character that they could come up with. In many ways, The Dude lives by his own rules and doesn't seem to pay attention to the world around him. When he has to investigates the kidnapping, he does his way rather than stopping and looking over the specific details that are involved in the crime. It's almost as if he consumes most of the evidence through his brain and finally after so many complications, he finally understands what is going on. On the other hand, Walter is also like the Dude. Walter is, unlike the Dude, a Vietnam veteran who doesn't like to be wrong on the things that he does, yet he thinks he's being blame for the wrongdoings that he did while serving in Vietnam, hence his repeated line, 'Am I wrong?'. Another similarity is that he and the Dude are somehow stuck in the early 90's. They think they are still living in the 60's. Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the Dude. He brings a lot of heart into his character. He makes the Dude likable because of his on-screen presence. John Goodman is very funny as Walter, the angry Vietnam veteran who reluctantly agrees to help the Dude with his investigation. Among the supporting performers are Julianne Moore as Lebowski's daughter, who specializes in pornography. John Turturro is also well casted as Jesus, the gay Latino bowler who is always eyeing the Dude, Walter and Donny, since they are competing him in a bowling tournament. And I wouldn't want to leave out Phillip Seymour Hoffman's and Julianne Moore's performances. Those two performers did a very good job portraying their own characters with sharp writing.What I also like about the movie is the bowling aspect. This is a very good movie about bowling even though it is a not sports movie. But furthermore, The Big Lebowski is also an ambitious movie that tries to crammed as much as it could because they are so many things going throughout the entire movie. You have a mystery, a kidnapping, a bowling tournament, an investigation, pornography, a rug that the Dude owns that had been peed on, and German nihilists. How could one movie fit all of this in? Well, ambition is the key and so is the writing that drives this movie altogether. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",8,1,3,27 July 2014
Akira," 1988: A Year of Anime
","The year 1988 will go down in film history as three major animation films from Japan were released and all three were critically acclaimed. One of those critically acclaimed films is Akira, which is probably one of the best films of 1988. The movie tells the story that is set in the year 2019, where Tokyo is built into a different kind of city called Neo-Tokyo. 31 years ago, an mysterious blast devastated Tokyo and now, the city is now being replaced by cutting-edge technology and warring political backgrounds. The characters in this movie are very interesting mainly because all of them, except for one, are teenagers. The teenagers are part of a biker gang and they roam the streets of Neo-Tokyo, looking for trouble. In the opening scene of Akira, we see them fighting with another biker gang called The Clowns. When one of the members of the biker gang is injured, he is sent to a hospital, where an government team is conducting an experiment on the injured boy. While the boy is being treated for his injury, the team gets a hold of a telekinesis power that is being put into the injured boy. But, there's more to that. That special power that the boy possess was the cause for the mysterious blast that occur in Tokyo 31 years ago. Even more specific, a young boy who was present in 1988 had that special power to ultimately destroy everything in sight, including the city. The young punk soon knows that he has the power to destroy anything that he sees and can only do it in his mind. He even uses it against the army that occupies the city by blowing up tanks and destroying an entire bridge. But, there's only one problem. If he overuses that power that has caused the blast in 1988, he will not have the ability to control it. That advice keeps popping up by the young kid who started the blast in 1988. Instead, the power will overcomes and destroy mankind as we know it. The punk doesn't realizes that because he thinks that having this special gift is fun. The real truth is that his ability to damage certain buildings and people can destroy his friends as well. While the boy uses the special power, an very aggressive Colonel gets involved with the young boy and he is also affected by this mysterious force. He also want to catch this kid before he even hurt or endanger the lives of others. Along the way, an government scientist teams up with the Colonel to find out the meaning behind this powerful, yet mysterious force. Akira has a lot of energy going for it. To me, the movie is a cross between Disney and the 1982 science-fiction thriller, Blade Runner, (it's ironic that both this movie and Blade Runner are set in the year 2019). The animation is very crisp and very colorful to look at. I also love the idea of having hell-raising teenagers as the protagonists, especially the young punk, who gets a hold of the supernatural power. The story of Akira is very well-told as we see this very imaginative metropolis crumbled as two-warring political parties and members clash against each other to win their independence and their freedom to express each other's thoughts and ideas. The story is also adapted from the manga of the same name. Add that and also the kid and you have a great anime movie. One of the things Akira does that other movies don't do is cast teenagers as the main characters. So many science-fiction films and anime involves adults and also older people. This movie doesn't fall into that category. I think that making teenagers interesting characters makes the movie work because as we see Neo-Tokyo develop, the entire population is swarming with warring political parties, government officials who are operating under direct orders from the military to keep everything in check and also the rebellious teenagers themselves. The main characters are almost like the kind of teenagers that bring out a lot of appeal to the audience. The action sequences is this movie are very gut-wrenching. We see in the beginning of the movie of the biker gang terrorizing the streets of Neo-Tokyo by assaulting each other while driving their motorcycles through the busy streets and highways, not even caring who gets in their way. The finale takes place in the Olympic Stadium, where the punk can't control much of what was given to him and he starts to develop into a giant moving mass, almost like a mutation of some sort. Even though he can't control the power, he doesn't even regret anything that he did wrong. We, as the audience feel his pain throughout the movie because this possession and obsession of using his power hurts him outside and inside. It even hurts and affect the people around him. The movie also tells us about how runaway technology affects everyday life like these kids that live in Neo-Tokyo. Akira is visually-stunning, packed with high-octane action throughout, and it is very violent. This movie is not recommended to younger audiences. All in all, Akira is one of the best films of 1988. It's style and action culminates itself into a anime classic. It's ground-breaking for its time and will not disappointed fans who love the genre. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,3,7,8 December 2013
Memento," A smart, unique mystery thriller
","Leonard Shelby, (Guy Pearce), is a insurance investigator. He suffers from a condition that isn't short-term memory loss. Right before he lost his memory, his wife was killed by someone. He doesn't know who. But, he wants revenge. With the help of his memory condition and the notes tattooed on his arms, legs and body, Leonard is determined to figure out who killed his wife.That's the set-up for Memento. This is a well made neo-noir thriller that plays with us by seeing through the eyes of a man who's determination only makes his investigation more superior. The movie is told through two story-lines. One story-line is told in black and white and the other is told in color. Director Christopher Nolan, who also serves as a screenwriter for this movie, challenges us to follow this mystery through two story-lines. The black and white scenes illustrates the story in chronological order. The color scenes takes place in reverse. As we watch this story unfold, Nolan reveals more and more of the mystery as he lets us get to know the facts before shifting gears.Most thrillers today are jam-packed with predictable story-lines and endings. Memento is the complete opposite. This movie doesn't do any of those. Instead, what we have here is a complicated story about a complicated man. A man who's grief and guilt drives him through his investigation. That why Leonard is so important in this movie. Rather than showing us a straight-forward mystery with the clues being brought up in a linear story, Memento reveals clues from a non-linear story. This is the kind of movie that tells us a story that is based on a Hitchcockian level, but only in the 21st century. Without giving away too much of the ending, the conclusion is very effective in both wit and suspense.The original story for this movie came from Christopher Nolan's younger brother, Johnathan. The movie is full of great performances by Guy Pearce and also from Joe Pantoliano. Pearce has been involved in the neo-noir genre before with L.A. Confidential. Unlike his role in that movie, Pearce brings out the grief in some of the movie's quiet scenes. There's are several moments during the movie where he lets us sympathizes with him while he copes with his condition. I thought that in those scenes, the movie stops short to shows us how Leonard feels about not remembering who he is and what he is. At that point, I felt pretty bad that he has to live with this condition and also solve his wife's murder.I have seen good neo-noirs in my life. But, Memento is a rarity. You don't see movies like these being made everyday. As the audience, we are taken into the mind of a very confusing man. And when we learn about the facts, we sometimes feel as if we ourselves are spinning our heads because we can't keep up with this plot. That is what I like about movies. A lot of the great thrillers that we've seen over the years have made us think about ourselves as ordinary everyday people. It's movies like Memento that makes us think differently with ourselves so that we are caught up at the moment. This is a top-notch thriller that really deserves credibility for its story structure and the editing. This is a must-see. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,0,4,26 October 2014
The Fifth Element," Lots of fun
","When The Fifth Element was released in 1997, it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was selected as the opening film. By the end of the year, the movie grossed over $263,920,180, making it the 9th highest-grossing film of the year. After seeing The Fifth Element, I was surprised to realize that the entire story and ideas came from an teenage boy. Who's that teenage boy you might ask? It came from the film's director and writer, Luc Besson. Besson came up with the story while he was in high school. As a movie, it is more than meet the eye.The story begins with a text, saying, 'Egypt, 1914.' Aliens called Mondoshawans come to Earth to collect a weapon that can be use to defeat a Great Evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones. Each has its classification of elements. All four stones revolved around a fifth element, which is represented in the form of a human. Before leaving Earth, the aliens promise that they will return the four stones in time to stop the Great Evil. The movie then fast forwards to the 23rd century, in the year 2263, where New York City cab driver, Korben Dallas, (Bruce Willis), is an ordinary everyday man that sort of like the kind of guy Willis played in Die Hard, sort to think. Anyway, the Great Evil appears space in the form of a giant black ball of fire. Vito Cornelius, (Ian Holm), informs the president the background history of the Great Evil. As the Mandoshawans head to Earth, another race of aliens, the bad kind, the Mangalores, who work for Zorg, (Gary Oldman), decides to shoot down the Mandoshawans' ship. Even though the stones weren't on board, there is one thing that does survive. The hand of the fifth element. Scientists then create an beautiful alien named Leeloo, (Milla Jovovich). But Leeloo escapes and finds herself falling into Dallas' cab. After a rocky start, Dallas realizes that he must protect Leeloo from danger because she is the fifth element, as we learn later on in the movie.Now, you might think that The Fifth Element is a very bad science- fiction movie, right? Well, it isn't. In fact, I really enjoyed this movie because of the film's amazing and dazzling special effects. In fact, I like to point out that this the first science-fiction movie I've seen where the future is not at all depressing or screwed up in any way. I like this kind of future. I would definitely get lost in this kind of world. The way the colors are used in the movie and the way different shapes are used is something stunning. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie had time to stop for humor because there are a number of funny moments that are in this movie. Most of them come from Chris Tucker, who plays an radio DJ, who is very very eccentric. He really generates much of the movie's funny moments. At certain times, the gears do shift once in awhile. But, it did worked. The cinematography of the movie is very good and I also admired the costume design, which was done by Jean Paul Gaultier.However, even though I'm given a lot of credit to the technical aspects of the movie and to the story, the movie does run on a little too long. Clocking in at 2 hours and 7 minutes, the movie shouldn't been edited into a more tighter time space. I would definitely cut back on some of the opening scene of the movie because I felt it did go on for a little while. But that aside, I did have a good time watching this movie. I believed in the story that Besson had to offered although the most interesting thing about his story is that it isn't like Star Wars. When I mean is that in the Star Wars movies, there are a lot of ideas and pieces that are burrowed from other movies. In a way, those pictures are like puzzles. However, The Fifth Element isn't like Star Wars. There isn't anything burrowed from other movies in this film, but what we have is an original idea and story that comes from an man who grew up to become an very well-detailed virtuoso. There's a lot of money that was spend on the making of this movie, but Besson sure knows how to spend it. This is one ride that you would like to take again. ★★★ 3 stars.",7,1,3,18 August 2014

The Terminator," Arnold Schwarznegger is THE TERMINATOR.
","Science Fiction comes a long way through aliens and flying saucers. Then, when Star Wars came out in 1977, the science fiction grew to a new level. Also, the special effects were mind-blowing during that time. But now, a science fiction movie about a robot from the future emerges. The robot is called The Terminator. The Terminator is a dark and action-packed picture about a killing machine sent back through time to kill a woman who hold the key of the future. The Terminator is played by Arnold Schwarznegger, and he has a frightening performance as the metal cyborg assassin. The woman who holds the key to the future is played by Linda Hamilton. She is the victim of the killer cyborg as she is chased around Los Angeles. But, someone else also came back from the future. A solider named Kyle Reese and he is played by Micheal Biehn. The Terminator has great cinematography and develops a personality for the Terminator. In one scene after being shot in the eye, he pulls his damaged eyeball out of his eye socket and reveals the red vision that he sees. After that, he picks up a pair of glasses. The Terminator is a menacing villain that is unbeatable and destructive. All in all, this movie is a good and great one. There are good performances and great cinematography. ★★★★ 4 stars",10,3,3,22 May 2011
Hotel Rwanda," Powerful and Compelling.
","'When people ask me, good listeners, why do I hate all the Tutsi, I say, 'Read our history.' The Tutsi were collaborators for the Belgian colonists, they stole our Hutu land, they whipped us. Now they have come back, these Tutsi rebels. They are cockroaches...' That quote is from George Rutaganda and he tells us the start of what he said about the civil war between the Tutsi and the Hutu militias. That is the setting in Hotel Rwanda, which is based on a true story about the civil war in Rwanda in 1994 and how one man managed to saved those who were caught in the cross hairs of a raging war. Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed Tutsi refugees during the civil war. He delivers a great performance that makes him a hero in the movie. Soon enough, his family is forced to live in the hotel after militia's action is engaged in the streets. Nick Nolte plays a U.N solider, Colonel Oliver, who is willing to help Paul moved the Tutsi refugees out of the hostile area. But, the only way the innocents can escape from the war violence is by being transfered to a help center. I was hoping that Don Cheadle would get a Oscar nomination for his role in the movie and I was right. Hotel Rwanda is a compelling true story of a true hero who stand up against the Tutsi refugees while everyone else ignored the world of Rwanda. It is a must see. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,0,0,29 May 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'Kid, the next time I say, 'Let's go someplace like Bolivia,' let's go someplace like Bolivia'- 45 years of a great western classic
","45 years ago, there were two westerns that came out in 1969. One was popular. One was not so popular. The one that was popular with audiences was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The one that wasn't popular with audiences was The Wild Bunch. The Wild Bunch made it to my Top 10 favorite list. But, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was also in the same league as The Wild Bunch. What more can you ask for this picture? Not a whole lot. The story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is not really true to what happen to the duo, but the movie is sort of a fictional dramatization of the two bank robbers. The movie begins with Butch, (Paul Newman), entering a bank that already starting to close up for the day. It's the 1890's, there's not much left for the world for bandits. Butch loses his chance to rob the bank, however. Meanwhile, his friend, The Sundance Kid,(Robert Redford), is playing a card game with two other men. The big man behind the card game suspects Sundance is cheating. Sundance denies this. To prove that he is the quickest gun around, he demonstrates his talent by shooting the big man's gun out of his hand. The duo then head out of town to meet the Hole-In-The-Wall gang, which is what Butch Cassidy's gang is called, even though realistically, the real Butch Cassidy's gang was called the Wild Bunch. They have already been selected to work with Harvey (Ted Cassidy), instead of Butch. After beating up Harvey, Butch, the Sundance Kid, and the other gang members, decide to rob a train by blowing up one of the train's boxcars. It turns out that the man who is hiding in the boxcar that they have blown up works for E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad. But, when a posse of lawmen show up unexpectedly at their robbery, Butch and the Sundance Kid decides that they have no choice but to run from the law. The movie also develop an relationship between the two men and a woman named Etta Place (Katherine Ross). In one particular scene in the movie, Butch and Etta shared a joyful and somewhat sweet moment together as Butch rides a bicycle to the tune of 'Raindrops are Falling On My Head.', sung by Burt Bacharach. That scene works very well because it shows just how joyful it is to watch this movie. When the law becomes too close to bear on, the trio decides to travel to Bolivia, where they are bound to rob banks. They do get lucky, however. Yet, both Butch and Sundance know that their times are closing up for the both of them. Time is short and banks are going for broke. There isn't much more to go around for. The finale of the movie takes place in a plaza, where Butch and Sundance face off against the Bolivian army, who is waiting outside. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a fun and funny western. It has the charm and wisdom that is fueled by both Paul Newman's and Robert Redford's performances. They like each other in this movie and we like them together. In my opinion, there are probably the best movie buddies since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover team up together in Lethal Weapon. Another reason why this also works in a beautiful way is the cinematography. The cinematography is rich and colorful, with breath-taking shots of canyons and riverbeds. Furthermore, the cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall, won a Oscar for his work in this film. The picture is very good-looking and very beautiful to watch. To me, the movie is sort of a softer version of The Wild Bunch. The reason why is because in The Wild Bunch, there was a hard edge to the story and the characters. It was a lot more violent than this one. This one isn't as violent as The Wild Bunch. In fact, both movies succeeds in making the western genre more pure. The screenplay for this movie is very well-written with funny dialogue in between drastic situations in which Butch and Sundance must figure out a way to elude the Bolivian army. In one particular scene and the most famous scene in the movie is when Butch and Sundance are trapped on a cliff. Below them is a raging river stream. Sundance wants to fight them. But, Butch, keeping a cool head, decide that they should jump into the river. With Butch trying to egg Sundance to jump, Sundance leaves no choice, but to jump into the river. Even the longest curse word ever said in the movie is also heard. A lot of people like this movie, yet there are some who didn't like. I like to know why they didn't like it. It is because of the charm? It is because of the chemistry between Newman and Redford? Is the movie classic in it's own right? I specifically don't know or how anyone would hate this movie. It is a classic. I enjoy so much of what went on during the whole movie. It was fun. It was funny. It was thrilling. It was tragic toward the end. But, above all, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid continues to be one of the best westerns around. It is also one of the best movies of 1969. As for the buddy genre, it would be qualified as being the best buddy movie ever made. Why? Because Newman and Redford are likable throughout this movie. Whether they have to jump into the river or try to rob a Bolivian bank and also command the tellers and people in the bank to put their hands up in Spanish, it all works very well. It's supposed to be enjoyable. Even after 45 years, it still keep on chugging away. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,0,1,15 February 2014
Alien," In space, no one can hear you scream.
","There are unsolved mysteries in our space. There are surprises sometime around the corner. And even if it should be left alone, you should know that by now. Alien, which is directed by Ridely Scott delivers a heart-pounding suspenseful movie. The movie is taking place in the deep outer space where the cargo ship, the Nostromo is on its way home. There are seven people in the Nostromo. They soon pick up a signal from distant planet.Rather than make their way back to Earth, the Nostromo crew, which is played by a well known cast including Sigourney Weaver as the control officer on the ship. After leaving the planet, one of the member is attacked by a mutant that basically latches onto your face and stay there. But, what they don't know is that the movie's villain is on the ship. Alien has a great deal in special effects and its set direction is the one I like the most. There are also great shots of scenes involving claustrophobia. But, one of the most famous scenes in the movie is when the member who recovers from being attack by the facehugger and then, he finds out that a chestburster or a parasite is inside of him. This scene is very gory and is not for the faint-hearted. Alien is a great movie because it is like Jaws, or in other words, have a great deal in suspense. The background score is really frightening for those scenes where the Alien pops out. An terrific science fiction thriller. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,2,4,15 August 2011
Taxi Driver," Classic 1970's masterpiece from Martin Scorsese
","Taxi Driver is a film that really shows us what American Cinema was all about. At a time where movies were made for entertainment, some challenged movie-goers with some of the most controversial subject matter ever to be put on film. Many of today well known directors were starting out big with their first feature length movie. But, Martin Scorsese was one of those directors who really captured what the 1970's were all about. He shows us all of it in this film.Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro), is an loner who spends most of his time prowling the streets of New York City at night. An Vietnam veteran, he narrates the story with a flat, eerie voice that somehow gives the movie an very dark tone to it. 'All of the animals come out at night', he says. 'Someday a real rain'll come and wash all this scum off the streets.' Suffering from insomnia, he also spends some of his time watching porno movies and living in an apartment building, where welfare seems to cover everything. One day, he spies on a woman, (Cybill Shepard), who is working at a campaign headquarters. At first, Bickle develops an crush on her and even asks her out on a date. But, she rejects him because of his habit of seeing dirty movies. Isolating himself from society, Bickle starts to tense up and decides that the only way to strike back is with violence. In one of the most memorable scenes in the movie, Bickle practices his intimidation by talking to a wall and says, 'Are you talking to me? Talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here.' By the end of the movie, Bickle's violent behavior and actions reaches a bloody climax when he gets his chance. The movie is more of a character study between different personalities. Travis and the woman he loves come from different backgrounds. Screenwriter Paul Schrader illustrates these characters by experimenting with each others likes and feelings. But toward a more thought-provoking point, the movie showcases an long-lasting argument between an dream and a reality. The woman that Travis loves is shown to be an angelic figure, one who's blessed. But, when mental deterioration crosses with her presence, nothing is ever forgiving. From there on, Bickle puts himself through intense training to avenge society. His thirst of violence intensifies when he goes to a gun dealer and buys several guns off of him. The cast of the movie is outstanding. Not only De Niro steals the show, but the movie has a strong supporting cast including Jodie Foster, as a teenage hooker who befriends Travis, Albert Brooks, as the man who's interested in Cybill Shepard, but dislikes Travis and also Harvey Keitel and Peter Boyle stars in this masterpiece as well.Bernard Herrmann creates a strong and resounding score that has a jazzy sense to it. The score is perhaps the most important piece in the movie because Herrmann is master of scoring movies that makes the film more atmospheric with its grimy look of New York City. The sound of the score illustrates the mind of Travis Bickle. When we first see him, his eyes curiously looks around while exhaust fumes fill the screen. Even the red tint on the neon lit signs makes the setting of the movie looks like a hell. Several times through the entire movie, the color red symbolizes a world where hope is not present, but Travis' inner demons are hovering all over him. Like his score in Vertigo, Herrmann makes an hypnotizing sense of insomnia, alienation and isolation.Robert De Niro has never given an better performance of his career. His performance in Taxi Driver is an template of what movie acting is all about. When he grins for the first time in the movie, we get the notion that his appearance is rather frightening, but very mysterious. The way he grins by giving that eerie smile makes Travis Bickle believable. We know from the beginning of the movie that he's not a hero even though the people around him praised him for what he did to Iris. As for Jodie Foster, she doesn't glamorizes her role as Iris. She is trying to get out of the city, but she needs Travis to help her. That on-screen performance is something to look for. Her performance is an essential part of the whole movie.Martin Scorsese does a outstanding job directing this movie. He really knows New York City. He knows how to hook the viewer and take them on a journey through the rough streets of every neighborhood in the city. His way of making characters into sinners is something mesmerizing. The shots of the rain wetting the streets. The way the windshield wipers wipes off the rain on Travis' cab when he travels through the night. The symbolism of what Scorsese shows you is something to study on. You have to pay attention to every speck of detail he gives you. Even when the characters stop to chat for a while, pay attention to how they talk to one another. That's what makes it such a great film. It's movies like Taxi Driver that captures a time not long forgotten, but long gone. Both the cinema world and to the world of the 1970's. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,0,1,21 August 2014
Romeo + Juliet," From Shakespeare to Punk Rock to MTV
","William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the classic love story about two youths who fall in love. The setting is a city called Verona, where two households families fight each other off. One family is called the Capulets and the other is called Montagues. In this modern day adaption of the classic play, it turns out that wasn't fresh enough. The movie starts out pretty fast, with the camera making fast movements when we are introduce by new characters. What I thought would be a modern day version of Romeo and Juliet turned out to be a punk version, MTV hyped up story. The first few minutes of the films went by fast that I though I was seeing this movie in fast-forward mode. After seeing this movie in my freshman classroom, my English teacher said that this movie isn't accurate as the play. It isn't as accurate as the play. As for the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, those two are perfect, but sometimes I feel that they had too much love scenes that made Leonardo famous. Romeo and Juliet is not the perfect adaption to date. But, for those who are Leonardo DiCaprio fans, this movie is for you. ★★ 2 stars.",2,0,0,22 May 2011
The Godfather: Part II," One great sequel
","In 1972, Francis Ford Coppola directed the film, The Godfather. It told the story of a family that was involved with the mafia. The son that came home from the war was given a job to look after the family after his father died. In the end of that movie, his own son became the new godfather. Now comes The Godfather: Part II. But, before I start my review on The Godfather; Part II, let me tell you about my rule of thumb on sequels. For many years, sequels have been trashed, criticized harshly and been disowned. Audiences do go to see sequels, but they don't understand the concept of a great or good sequel. So, I will turn your attention to my review of The Godfather: Part II. The movie tells us two story lines, one showing us how the original godfather, Vito Corleone, came to America in the beginning of the 20th century and one telling us the story of Michael Corleone, taking over his father's empire. Corleone, in a younger age, is played by Robert De Niro, who won a Best Supporting Actor in 1975 at the Academy Awards, and his journey in New York leads him into becoming the godfather of the original film. But even though this is a sequel, this movie is actually a prequel to the original film. Corleone's story is one of the main points of the movie and how he rose to power over the years before 1958. The other main point involves his son, Michael, played by Al Pacino, coming into play as being the godfather after his father dies in the original and in this movie, he takes on his father's job, where his relationship with his wife, played by Diane Keaton, takes a toll and he begins to experience the life of a matriarch, more specific, a hard-working matriarch. Pacino in this movie give a memorable performance in this movie and also in the original. But, there's something different about Michael Corleone. He's more powerful than the original film. If you remember the first movie, you'll realizes that he didn't want to be with the family, or be involved with the family's business because he wanted to live his own life. But, when his father died, however, he accepts the role of being the new godfather. To me, this movie is ranked pretty much up to the original, but this sequel and some sequels are bad and some sequels are good. The Godfather: Part II is a great sequel, more far-reaching than ever and much more in depth with the original. Why is it that great of a sequel? Well, first of all, the movie takes the characters to a new place and have them go on a different scenario in which they can drawback to the original. The business that Michael gets involved with in Cuba in 1958 is well-told. The drawbacks in this movie relies on flashbacks from Don Vito's early career in the early 1920's and 1930's. The movie features some of the other family members of the Corleone's clan, like Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall and Sonny Corleone, one of the Corleone sons, played by James Caan. To me, those flashbacks builds up the supporting parts that made The Godfather great. Not only great, but also revolutionary. If you put all of the pieces together, than you got yourself an epic story of one man, who was poor as a little boy from Italy, grow up and became inventive with his ideas and made himself an empire of his own people and his own family. His actions were direct and his journey was worth watching. It's amazing that audiences will buy a movie like this and see it and go to the movies to see this movie and not understand the supporting backdrop to The Godfather. Coppola directed this movie and amazingly, he won an Oscar for Best Director and the movie itself won Best Picture. The Godfather: Part II was the first sequel to every win an Academy Award. Even though I am not a member of the Academy, my opinion this movie is that it fully deserved the Oscar and does make sense for its story-telling and its magnificent scope of Don Vito's life. The transformation is far more superior than other movie character every to be told or made. The enormous ground-braking history behind the two Godfather movies brings out the American Dream. The two other movies is not about living in the American Dream, where you can pursue happiness and live life. The American Dream in the two Godfather movies is more different than what one's will say. The truth is that the American Dream consists of hard work and dignity. Anyone can pursue the American Dream, but only one will succeed by pursuing their own journey and making the best out of something giant. Giant like the empire Vito build on. It's more than a mob story. The Godfather: Part II is a great movie, with more in depth information amongst the characters and story-telling at its finest. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,3,27 November 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One sequel that was better
","In The Terminator, Arnold Schwarznegger play a menacing cyborg from the future. His mission was to terminate the woman who hold the key to the future. Now, In Terminator 2: Judgement Day, that change. In this sequel to the 1984 smash hit, Arnold Schwarznegger reprises his role as the Terminator. But, this time, his mission is to protect a teenager from another terminator. The new terminator is played by Robert Patrick. What's unique about Patrick's performance is that his character is made out of liquid metal. It can form into a puddle, or shape-shifted in any way. The action sequences are astonishing. Every chase after chase, the action gets better and better. This is a good sequel to a good movie. Arnold Schwarznegger is terrific as the The Terminator, once again, this time playing a hero and, somewhat of a father figure to Edward Furlong, the actor who plays John Connor. Linda Hamilton is also terrific as Sarah Connor, the mother of the future. The special effects are wonderful, spell-binding and explosive. Arnold Schwarznegger's performance as the Terminator is superb. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",8,2,2,15 May 2011

","At the beginning of Saving Private Ryan, US soldiers embark on the Ohama Beach in France of D-Day 1944. As the hatches of the U-boats open, hails of gunfire ricochets and hits the metal and soldiers. Many jump off the boat and into the water while the gunfire pierce through the water. Blood filled the ocean with dead soldiers dying. Loud screaming is heard as Captain John H. Miller arrives at the hellish beach with his eyes wide open. As he looks around him, soldiers are seen screaming and some are holding their lives on with fear while some finds out that their arms are shot off. Epic, pure epic. Saving Private Ryan is not a roller-coaster of action, it's triumph. It's a movie where you salute those who fought in Normandy on D-Day in World War II. Steven Spielberg delivers us the horrors, shock and amazement and triumph of World-War II since Schindler's List. I was amaze at what he brought to us. The sheer horror and amazement of World-War II is never forgotten. I have this movie on VHS, the Double Videocassette on DreamWorks, that shows the feature movie and the special edition of the movie. I also felt emotionally driven at the end when the older Private Ryan is seen looking at John H. Miller's cross and grave. He asks his wife if he was a good man and live a good life. After she answers Yes, the camera shows Ryan and his family family in the background. With triumph, he salute Miller's grave as the camera zooms in to shows the description of the grave. The last shot shows the American flag waving the sky. The film fades out. THAT is triumph and showing that American soldiers will never be forgotten.

Drive," Drive is the best action film of 2011
","The Driver is a man without a past. He doesn't have a name. But, he has 3 occupations. At night, he moonlights for a getaway driver for robberies. At day, he is a stunt driver for major, big-budget Hollywood movies and a auto mechanic. But, he's alone.Add that, smart script-writing and energetic action sequences that really pushes this movie to the max. Drive is a very entertaining film mainly because it revolved around only one character and several others. The Driver (Ryan Gosling) doesn't talk much and doesn't seem to have any relationship with anyone or anything of his past. He works three jobs. At day, he's a Hollywood stunt driver for action films. He is also a mechanic and also a best friend to his boss, Shannon (Bryan Cranston). At night, he moonlights as a getaway driver for robberies. His only relationship that he has is only one person. That one person is his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan). Irene is a young mother, who is dragged into the gritty and very dangerous underworld of Los Angeles, mainly because her husband is being released from prison. At first, Irene seems to be attracted to the Driver. But, when the Driver encounters Irene's husband, he becomes a getaway driver for him. Irene's husband wants to knock off a pawnshop and he knows that the Driver is the right man to do the job. After the heist goes wrong and Irene's husband is shot to death, the Driver finds himself driving himself to defense for the girl he loves. Even more worse, he is also being tailgated by a syndicate of deadly criminals. One of them is a local gangster/loan shark named Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and the other is Nino (Ron Perlman). Soon, the Driver realizes the gangsters are after him and Irene because of the money that was stolen from the pawnshop robbery. This throws the Driver toward offense as he tries to go after the men who wants to hurt Irene and tear down their relationship.The movie is photographed like a neo-noir picture because of its shiny and fluorescent lights that illuminates the City of Angels. Drive is one of those movies like Michael Mann's Thief or Manhunter, where the style creates an atmosphere for the movie's premise. It also illustrates how dangerous and violent this underworld is to Irene and especially to the Driver. Those nighttime scenes are very well photographed and very well directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. He sure does know how to create a 1980's atmosphere for a movie that is set in the present era.Another aspect that makes the movie works is the performances by Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks. Gosling is right for this role because we can see just how gentle and humble he is when he is first introduced to Irene and her son, Benicio. He is sort playing in the acting field as a young Steve McQueen, where emotionless responses toward the other characters creates a original identity to the Driver. There is also something to point out about Gosling's performance and his presence. He is not playing the pretty boy role that he played in The Notebook. This is particularly way more different than the character he played in that film. Here, he takes the screen by storm. Brooks, on the other hand, is very intimidating as the local gangster who puts the Driver and his girlfriend in danger. Brooks has been playing comedic roles in the 80's with films like Lost in America and Modern Romance. I was very surprised just how scary he was playing Bernie. He is relentless toward the people he distrusts, yet his presence makes the movie works perfectly fine.The action sequences in Drive are very well choreographed and perhaps probably the car chases I've seen since Steve McQueen got behind his 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback in Bullitt. Refn has said that he shot the car chases without CGI. Well, I can't argue with that statement. So many movies that do included car chases are done by CGI. A lot of them are done very horribly and doesn't generate the kind of energy that is in store with this movie. That's probably why Drive is the best action movie of 2011. It's realism in the chases that creates an energetic response to the audience that is watching it.All in all, I must say that I enjoyed Drive very much because of the action sequences, the cinematography that makes the movie look like a neo-noir film of the 80's and especially the performances by Gosling and Brooks. You know, after watching Drive, I've been thinking of two things. One is that I like to see another movie like this again. The other thing is that with the exception of Drive consisting of 80's atmosphere, I think that there can be a way to make great movies again. If movie directors can learn from this movie, then films like Drive can extend just how cool it is to create a vibrant style through a decade of film-making. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,4,1 March 2014
Gran Torino," Eastwood at his finest.
","When I was going to the movies one Saturday afternoon, my birthday was coming up and my mother took me and my sister out to see Gran Torino because I really enjoyed and liked Clint Eastwood's movies. Once I was inside the movie theater getting popcorn, I started to wondered if this movie would either make Eastwood's last movie as a actor good or horrible. I had to see what happened and I was impressed. Clint Eastwood directed and stars in Gran Torino, a drama that focuses on a relationship between a racist Korean War veteran and his new neighbor, a Hmong immigrant. Eastwood may look old in this picture, but that doesn't means he is not bad. One night, Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski, is alarmed when a intruder breaks into his garage. The intruder appears to be his Hmong neighbor, played by Bee Vang. He was ordered to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino because an Hmong gang told him to do it. Soon enough, the 1972 prized Gran Torino brings the Hmong neighbor, Thao and Walt together. Watching Gran Torino, I suddenly noticed that Eastwood's direction is the same thing as what he does in his 2004 Best Picture winner, Million Dollar Baby. The connection is that the relationship between different characters are focus on like we are seeing in his point of view. As for Eastwood, he has a great performance as Walt Kowalski. So it all adds up that Gran Torino is a modern update of Eastwood's stardom and that this film stays on that level all the time throughout. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,0,3,18 August 2011
Kelly's Heroes," A good, well-made war movie.
","Kelly's Heroes is a war movie that does something that other war movies didn't do before. It mixes humor with explosive action. At the start of Kelly's Heroes, Clint Eastwood, who plays the title character get information on Nazi gold in Germany from a general. This leads to a bizarre plot, a group of misfits going after Nazi gold that could worth millions of U.S. dollars. Soon enough, everybody agrees to pursue the gold. One of them is a war hippie named Oddball. He is played by Donald Sutherland, and really he is the main laughs in this film. As the movie nears the big showdown between the enemy soldiers in a Germany village, a general, played by Carroll O' Connor, from All in the Family, comes to congratulate the group of misfit soldiers. Hearing this happens, it appears the Kelly's Heroes packs a punch for action in the right place. There are good performances in Kelly's Heroes that really made you feel like you were part of the group. Clint Eastwood proves himself in this movie that he can be a action hero, even he isn't being miserable and sorrowful, but not here, he has a ball in this movie. If you haven't seen Kelly's Heroes, see it. ★★★ 3 stars.",7,0,1,28 May 2011
Black Hawk Down," Black Hawk Down is a knock-out war movie.
","In 1993, American Army Rangers were in Somalia, participating in the OPeration Restore Hope, where they were to help out the people of Somalia gives fresh food and water. Within minutes, all of that was ended up in war. Ridley Scott directs the war epic, Black Hawk Down. Josh Harnett plays one of the soldiers, who participates in the mission. The mission was a raid to contain the people in the raid as the Rangers seal up the area. Soon enough, the raid turns into a disaster as one of the helicopter is shot out of the sky. The raid turn into a rescue and survival mission. While watching Black Hawk Down, I felt the rush of action and war fill up completely. Black Hawk Down is about the mission failure of taking down a Somalia warlord during the 1993 Mogadishu raid. 19 American soldiers died during this raid and over 1000 Somalis died during this event. I really was hooked by this movie because it was loud, yet remarkable and outstanding. The director, Ridley Scott, filled the screen with buckets of blood and gunfire. I salute the 19 American soldiers who lost their lives during this raid and they will never be forgotten. Winner of 2 Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, Black Hawk Down is a knock-out that will blow you off the edge of your seat. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,2,3,8 January 2011
Rudy," The littlest guy goes up against the odds
","Sports movies always have a appeal on me. In my perspective, they are categorized as inspiring, moving and emotional. Some of those sports movies that are in that category are Rocky, The Natural, Hoosiers and Breaking Away. Rudy is a exception to the rule. It's premise is so moving and so touching that we forget that we're watching a story being developed. Sean Astin plays the title character and he plays a young kid from Joliet, who dreams of becoming a Norte Dame football player. His parents, especially his father, played by Ned Beatty, are shocked and try to convince Astin's character to think about his choice. The family that he lives in isn't rich, as the father said to his son. So, Rudy, Astin's character, works his way to achieve his dream. But, there are drawbacks that comes in his way when trying to pursue his dream. His older brother of the family dies during work and Rudy goes to Holy Cross. In order for Rudy to be transfers to Notre Dame, he has to have good grades and also have to be at the top of his game. Finally, Rudy does get into Notre Dame and his dreams of success falls into failures and redemption as he fights his way toward the end. As I said before, Rudy is a exception to the rule. It does has a very nice premise to the story. It is also moving in the way Astin portrays his character. This 5 foot kid is trying real hard to pursue his dream and achieve his goal. The movie is not only about sports, but also about academics. It's a familiar ground cover that most kids fall into because kids who do play sports have to be aware of their academics as well. Ned Beatty, who plays the father, gives a very fine performance. And also, Charles S. Dutton plays a janitor, who works at Notre Dame and befriends Rudy. He too give a very good and a very strong screen presence. The reason why I said that is because Dutton explains to Rudy the meaning of success and the meaning of failure. Failure is not a option. Success is a winner. Rudy works as a moving, inspiring and very well-told true story that is based on the real Rudy Ruettiger that attended Notre Dame in 1975. The movie is also directed by David Anspaugh, who also directed Hoosiers. He does know how to make a very good sport movie, with all the right tools and all the right performances to make it exceptional. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",8,3,4,20 October 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time
","Stanley Kubrick is a movie director that can do no wrong. His vision is far more strange and thought-provoking than any other director on this planet. When he died in 1999, the world was saddened by the news of his death. But, his films didn't died, either. He left behind some of his best work to all to see. In my opinion, he left behind a lot of questions with one particular movie that really stands out as being one of the best science-fiction movies of all time. The name of the movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even after 45 years, it still holds up. The movie takes place in the futuristic year of 2001, where a space crew investigates a unknown monolith that is excavated out of the Moon. The scientists don't know who put the monolith there, or how it ended up on the Moon. But, there's more to the story than investigation. Another monolith appears during the Dawn of Man sequence, where humans in the beginning of civilization were primitive apes. Meanwhile, the space crew's computer, HAL 9000, get involves in the mission and determines to find out the answer. One of the scientists on board questions about the technology of the HAL 9000 computer. What the space crew doesn't know is that HAL 9000 has a mind of his own. He is also very deadly when discovering about the unknown monolith, and even jeopardizes the astronauts onboard. He eventually kills some of them and even locks out Dr. Dave Bowman in his pod. Dave soon gets into the spaceship and deactivate HAL 9000 and then goes a mind-trip through the star-gate. One of the greatest achievements in 2001 is the mind-blowing special effects that the movie possess. A lot of science-fiction movies are jam-packed with wall-to-wall special effects, making the story harder to follow. In 2001, those special effects don't get in the way. Instead, the special effects makes us look in awe. It's the inspiration that the movie makes for us. Kubrick's vision of the future is far from being made in 1968, but there are other elements that 2001 have that makes more unique. The relationship between HAL 9000 and Dave Bowman is significant mainly because, Kubrick sets up the relationship that can take an a effect on a human being. HAL 9000 is a computer that likes to meddle with people. He is complicated in his own ways of destruction and murder. In other words, HAL 9000 can't function accordingly. It's that story that make us think about the relationship between man and machine. The monoliths also serves a significant role as well. In my own perspective of watching 2001, I think that the monoliths serves as a part of life. The Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 and the ending are crucial points to the movie. In the beginning, man is ape in a world that is inhabited by other members that make up civilization. By the end, Bowman is near death, but he is reincarnated through the monolith that is placed in his bedroom. It follows the phrase, 'What comes around, goes around.' Kubrick's direction is also very descriptive and never fails to mislead us. He uses long shots of people inside the space station. He puts us in Bowman's perspective when he is traveling through the star-gate. If I had to say something about the star-gate sequence, I would say that the questions relies on the mysteries of science and technology itself. The point is, there may be another dimension outside outer space, one that is never been seen before. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a great movie. Not only great, but magnificent in its own way. The music sets up the movie as a space opera and moves very steady on the details and visual effects. In the past years, 2001: A Space Odyssey has been criticized as being the greatest science-fiction movies of all time. I can't agree more. It is also one of my favorites. It belongs on my top 10 favorite movies list and it fully deserves to be placed there. A feast for the eyes, ears and mind for all to see and hear, and also for all generations of movie directors. Kubrick should be proud. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,3,6,10 November 2013
Reservoir Dogs," Quentin Tarantino is here to stay
","Before making his name well known in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino worked as a video store clerk before directing his first feature length movie. Reservoir Dogs was his first feature and boy, it was very good. In fact, I believe that when they pick out the best Tarantino movie of all time, my best guess is that they will have a field day with this film and his other works.The story centers around four professional criminals with false aliases. They are: Mr. White,(Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde, (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink, (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. Orange, (Tim Roth). All four men are involved in a robbery that went wrong. The bosses, Nice Guy Eddie, (Chris Penn), and his father, (Lawrence Tierney) got the message clear. But, what went wrong and who is the rat? Told through sharp dialogue and in flashbacks, the criminals try to figure what to do in this situation. The plot of this movie is dialogue driven and every piece of information is either spoken directly from the characters or told through flashbacks.Tarantino has a ear for words. In fact, this independent film was made on a low budget and doesn't consists of any big budget special effects or explosions. While I was watching Reservoir Dogs, I was reminded that the artistry of the movies is not about action, but dialogue. It seems that in this world of today, movie goers are somehow drawn to the loud and sometimes obnoxious world of action. But, this is more than just your average crime caper film. An example of just how sharp Tarantino writes dialogue is the opening scene where we see the gang having a conversation in a diner. With this, we, as the audience, feel like we are eavesdropping on their conversation. Even more to the point, these characters aren't really talking about the actual crime they are going to commit. Rather, they are talking more about Madonna 'Like a Virgin' than the robbery. That kind of trademark is always essential in all of Tarantino's movies. The main characters talk about pop culture and especially make movie references in either a diner or a restaurant. The performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and others including Penn and Tierney are very good. Keitel, who was also in another daring performance in Bad Lieutenant that same year, gives a commanding performance as Mr. White. Out of all of the main characters in the movie, I happen to enjoy watching Keitel's character walk through this movie, trying both to figure what happened and also keep his loyalty and respect to his boss. Tim Roth, who played Mr. Orange, is wonderful and also very realistic. The reason why I mention realistic is that throughout the entire time, Mr. Orange can be seen bleeding out on the floor for a very long time. Also, the bonding between Mr. White and Mr. Orange resembles a symbol of camaraderie between two soldiers who have went through a harrowing and violent scenario. But, one character who is different from all of the other characters is Mr. Blonde, who is played by Michael Madsen. He is very twisted when it comes to violent. One famous sequence in the movie is when he tortured a cop by tying him up in a chair and cutting off his ear. Later on, he threatens to set him on fire. That kind of violence is not glorified, but a lot of people were stunned and disgusted by that scene. For me, Tarantino know how to cut away from the violence so that you don't see the razor slicing the cop's ear. Tarantino often writes movie references in his scripts and at certain times, bring influences to other genres as well. This is evident in Reservoir Dogs. The characters stated movie references from the 60's and mostly the 70's, creating a sense of pop culture. I know for a fact that for all of its intentions, this movie deserves to seen more once. It is twisted because of the story of a gang trying to recover the diamonds and also figure out what went wrong. It is screwy in the way that these characters talk and act toward each other. Unlike other crime movies, the characters who portrays criminals are more calm and more relaxed than other movie criminals. In other crime movies that I've seen, the criminals act rough toward each other and also to the women. Here, there is one minor female character, which is the waitress in the beginning of the movie. But, after that, no other female speaking parts.Reservoir Dogs works as a mystery film, as a violent and bloody gangster picture and also as a movie of its own. If there is one other thing that I would say is that Quentin Tarantino will be around for a very long time. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",8,0,0,16 June 2014
Total Recall," Total Action, Total Sci-Fi, Total Schwarznegger.
","Phillip K. Dick's novel, We Can Remember it for You Wholesale, is about the classic meshing of reality, false memory and real memory. Total Recall is loosely based on the novel by Phillip K. Dick. This movie has a lot of great visual effects, a lot of great action sequences and some great acting for Schwarznegger. In this movie, Arnold plays a average Joe who wants to travel to Mars. The movie is set in the year 2084 A.D, and it does play a major role in the movie itself. Arnold then goes to a place called Rekall to implant a memory in his mind. But then, his character suddenly bursts into anger as he is what he believe to be a secret agent, who's cover was blown. After the blowout, his friends are all enemies and are out to kill him. So, he escapes and goes to Mars to get his real identity on who stole his true identity and why. Soon enough, the action starts up again. What I like in Total Recall is the themes of identity. The movie's script is adapted by Phillip K. Dick story, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale. The themes also are a major role in the movie. As I said before, Total Recall has some great special effects and great action sequences. But, sometimes the movie can be confusing to viewers because Arnold Schwarznegger is sort of playing himself and someone else in his false identity. Total Recall is a great science fiction action thriller. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",8,0,1,2 June 2011
Rocky," An triumphant movie
","Rocky Balboa's life was a one in a million shot. He is willing to 'go the distance' with another heavyweight boxer. His entire life is filled with interesting people that means a lot to him. Yet, when it comes to hard times, Rocky is the only person who can see it all. And right now, he is given a chance to fight at the 200th anniversary of the nation.In the beginning of the movie, Rocky Balboa, (Sylvester Stallone), is a down and out boxer who is just finishing up his last fight. He's poor and his only other occupation that he has other than a boxer is a collector for a loan shark. Rocky also has friends that seem to challenge him in his everyday life. His friend, Paulie, (Burt Young), work for a meat processing place and even he has to deal with his problems. One of those problems is Adrian, (Talia Shire), a shy woman who can't stand living with him because of his drunkenness. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers), is looking for a competitor to fight for the nation's biggest birthday. His ultimate choice is, of course, Rocky. Creed thinks that Balboa is the perfect fighter. In order for Rocky to fight against Creed, he seeks the help of his gym manager, Mickey, (Burgess Meredith), an angry and tough man who is willing to train Rocky for the big fight.The movie is filled with a lot of great screen performances. The one aspect that strike me the most was Sylvester Stallone. This is a great performance from him and the first of many. One thing that I like about Stallone is the way that he writes Rocky and all of the other characters' dialogue. He tries to create a likable person out of himself and with that writing, we can actually see ourselves being with these people. Rocky Balboa is a wonderful character. He has a heart of gold. In addition, there is a very nice and sweet love story between Rocky and Adrian that adds flavor to the movie. Burt Young and Burgess Meredith also make the movie work because their characters to me, were one of the reasons why Rocky's world is so upset and angry. It's not the characters' fault. It's the way their world is affected by America's problems. These characters are not happy living in this competitive world of fighting over what they want or what they can get. Rocky isn't about the central character. It is more about people rather than the main character.The famous scene in which Rocky runs up the stairs while 'Gonna Fly Now' plays in the background is perhaps the most powerful and most inspirational scenes in movie history. In my opinion, whenever I see a sports movie, I think of them as being inspirational. I always find that the main character is always pushing his way through tough times. The final fight scene in the movie between Rocky and Apollo is the second best scene in the movie because by the end, you feel as though your emotions are drained. By that time, the audience who seen this movie in the movie theater were probably cheering with joy and crying with emotion. Inside, I was cheering and devastated with joy. It's a shame that Rocky is the only great movie that Stallone has written and starred in. Because of that, Stallone fell into a losing streak with very bad films and sometimes embarrassing. This movie proves that Stallone is perfect for the role. He knows what comes out of Rocky Balboa. He knows that people will like this character and always stick to him because he is friendly and also, lonely. But above all, this is the movie that made Stallone a star in the first place. It's great to see him land a juicy role in a major motion picture. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,1,29 May 2014

Jackson stars in this riveting and explosive crime drama about four tales about violence and redemption. Quentin Tarintino, who directed Reservior Dogs in 1992, takes four tales and makes a classic gangster tale. The movie is packed with screwy dialogue and extreme surprising characters. My reaction? My reaction was that Pulp Fiction was that it was funny, exciting, thrilling and excellent. Pulp Fiction was a worldwide explosion with audiences and critics saying the movie is fun, thrilling and funny throughout. I sat through Pulp Fiction one night watching it on AMC and I thought, this movie is fun. It's cool and crisp. At the end, it was all-out conclusion. Though the stories are out of sequence, it still can be fun without knowing characters in random areas. The movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. All in All, Pulp Fiction is a cool, riveting and exhilarating motion picture of the 1990's. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,2,5,9 January 2011

The Untouchables," Untouchables rivals with The Godfather
","It's the 1930's. Prohibition is affecting the nation. But, in the Windy City, there's a war waging. A war between the good guys and the bad guys. A war between the cops and the gangsters. A war between Elliot Ness and Al Capone.Brian De Palma's The Untouchables is a film that tells us that story and tells it very well, indeed. In the 1930's, Prohibition was affecting everyone. Businesses had to be shaken down by the law for illegal booze and drinks. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is the main character and leader of a squad of police officers who called themselves, The Untouchables. Ness and a fellow Irish cop, Jimmy Malone, (Sean Connery) enlisted Italian-American policeman George Stone (Andy Garcia) in the group along with accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). Together, their main objective is to bring down the big man who runs all of the illegal business in the streets of Chicago. And that name is Al Capone (Robert De Niro). After cracking down on illegal booze operations and successfully cutting off Capone's gangsters in Canada, the Untouchables gain popularity. Later on however, several members of the group are being killed off by Capone's right-hand man. It's up to Ness to go against Capone's right-hand man and also Capone.The film has a real sense of authenticity to the period era. De Palma has all of the right ingredients to make this picture works. From the cars to the guns to the clothes. The art direction is very well done and achieves the actual historic setting of the 1930's. What De Palma does in this film and his earlier gangster film, Scarface, is that he brings us into a glamorous world of the gangster life, but doesn't let the artistic details get in the way of the characters and the acting.As for the performances, I admired the supporting casting of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone. Connery did win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in this movie. Connery does a very good as portraying Malone as Ness' mentor. In one particular scene where Ness is at a church and meets Malone for the second time, he gives Ness a little piece of advice. 'Shoot fast and shoot first.' Together along with Garcia and Smith, their chemistry is the most interesting part in this movie. For De Niro, I felt that he gives a mediocre performance as Capone. In my opinion, I had a very hard time accepting him as Capone, since his appearance doesn't necessarily match with the real Capone. Kevin Costner does a good job portraying a very young Elliot Ness. This young Ness is very different than Robert Stack's portrayal of Ness in the older version of the TV series. Even though The Untouchables is based on a true story and that it achieves on both style and authenticity, it is actually a fictionalized account on Ness and Capone. But, I think the reason why this movie is entertaining is that it's wonderful and great to look at and that we, as the audience can enjoy what is being done between both men who come from opposite sides of the law. I believe that this film rivals up there with The Godfather. What I mean by that comparison is that the two films presents us a glamorous look and feeling of the gangster world. It is lively and very colorful to look at, yet the characters are wrapped in their own situations where they have to deal with certain people in order to get the job done. In this case, The Untouchables is ambitious, yet it is not longer than Scarface.The Untouchables is a very good gangster film, both well directed and well art-directed. It's style and substance drives the energy toward the film, creating a sense of motion and ambition. The chemistry between Costner and Connery works and also it works for the members as well. Brian De Palma made a very modern version of the TV series and it's his best work since Scarface. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",8,0,3,5 April 2014
Die Hard," The action movie that raises the bar of action.

This movie is one of them. Die Hard,which is the biggest action movie of 1988 blows you away, completely. Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop, who is in Los Angeles going to a Christmas party in a skyscraper. He is just another cop who is off duty and just attending the Christmas party to be with his wife. We learn that Willis' character is a struggling person who is trying to keep the relationship with his wife going. Then, terrorists invade the building, seizing off exits and entrances. The terrorists' leader is played by Alan Rickman, who has a great performance as the evil Hans Gruber. Everybody in the building is held hostage and that the only person who is not a hostage is John McClane. He has only one shot to fight against the terrorists and his has to use his wits and skills to fight back. Soon enough, the police and F.B.I arrive to control the building. All I can say is that Die Hard has a number of great action sequences and a lot of great performances by Willis and Rickman. Another thing is that it have good characters including Willis character, John McClane. Great action sequences and great performances from Die Hard. ★★★★ 4 stars",10,1,2,15 August 2011
War of the Worlds," Spielberg's Eye of Science Fiction.
","H.G. Wells' novel, The War of the Worlds was about the invasion of martians from outer space coming to end mankind on Earth. The novel was published in 1898 and it was made into a radio broadcast in 1938 by Orson Welles, considering a prank to fool people into believing that Earth was under attack by the martins. The story later get to the big screen in 1953 and now, turns into a remake of the 1953 film. Steven Spielberg directs this energetic, loud and very exciting version of the classic novel. Tom Cruise plays a family man, who is the father of his daughter and his son. The daughter is played by Dakota Fanning, and she is marvelous playing these characters that scare easily by unfortunate beings, whether it's aliens or ghosts. Later, Cruise's character Ray, flee the town, while everybody is being zapped by the tripods that live underneath the ground. The one I like about the tripods is that they are very menacing and very destructive when it's come to destroying the Earth. The special effects are outstanding in this movie, Cruise's performance is very good and Fanning's performance is also good for her screen performance. War of the Worlds is a good science fiction remake that doesn't pushes itself too far like most other remakes. ★★★ 3 stars.",7,1,2,29 May 2011
The Bridge on the River Kwai," David Lean's best work since Lawrence of Arabia
","I've made a list of the top 10 favorite movies that I would to watch over and over again. These 10 movies will forever be near my heart and always influenced me to be a movie director in the future. The Bridge on the River Kwai is definitely one of the top 10 favorite films on my list. Of course, I also enjoyed and love other great movies as well. Other movies included on the my list are: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bullitt, The Terminator, Thief, Lethal Weapon, The Wild Bunch and Alien. The Bridge on the River Kwai is also included. The movie is set in Burma during World War II. The year is 1943, and British POW's are being held up in Japanese war camps. One of those British POW's is Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, who won an Academy Award for his role in this movie. Nicholson and his fellow men are assigned to build a bridge that will be used for a railway that will go through the Burmese jungle. Meanwhile, another POW, an American, played by William Holden, plans to blow up the bridge and sets off into the jungle to escape from the camp. Eventually, Holden and his recruits are all rounded to destroyed what is being constructed. David Lean is a cinematic master. His work is eye-popping and very vivid to look at. However, he is not one of my favorite directors. But, what I like about this movie is the way he tells the story. Some people may called it a war movie. But, others, like myself, would say that this movie is both a war movie, but most importantly, a war movie about individuals. So many war movies reflect on the pain of war. A lot of them reflect on the horrors of war itself. The Bridge on the River Kwai is a war movie about people. The people in this movie are devoted to be put into a plot that involves having to struggle and survive this snaring scenario. As we watch Bridge on the River Kwai, we are reminded that the two leading characters are different men coming from different backgrounds. One is honorable, but arrogant among his men. The other is not honorable and damaging, perhaps. These two men are stuck in a story where the only thing that stands in their way is a bridge. As a matter of fact, the bridge also plays a significant role in the movie. The bridge is a mark of the Japanese colonel, who assigned Nicholson to build the bridge. The Bridge on the River Kwai won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture. I like it a lot. Much of it is based on the story, direction and characters. I like when movies break new ground with their original stories. It's films like this one that reminds us how much we love movies. David Lean should be proud of making this movie, since it struggled through a troubled production. An excellent movie for the generation of film-makers. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,2,5 November 2013
Jaws," One of the best movies of 1975.
","There was never a great thriller like Jaws. Why is that? Because Jaws was legendary. It's suspense is surprising. Jaws is about a great white shark that terrorizes a summer resort in a small town called Amity. The police chief played by Roy Scheider, is determined to find out how to eliminate the shark after it's eaten one of the citizens of the town. Later in the film, a marine scientist, played by Richard Dreyfuss explains that the first victim in the movie, in the beginning of the film says that it wasn't no boating accident, it was a shark. Then, the Fourth of July comes up and the people of Amity are having a good time until the shark shows up. After the panic on the fourth of July, an grizzled fisherman, played Robert Shaw, plans to hunt the shark down and kill it. So, Dreyfuss, Scheider and Shaw team up to eliminate the shark. Director Steven Spielberg's has a great sort of suspense shots. Thought the shark is not seen the entire time, that is great because it is how Alfred Hitchcock directs suspense. It is what he calls playing with the audience like a piano. Jaws is one of the best films of 1975 and it's also one of my Top 10 best movies I seen. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,7,12,25 June 2011
Blade Runner," Blade Runner is one of the two best science fiction films of 1982
","What is man? What is robot? What is artificial intelligence? Those are the kind of questions a sci-fi geek will ask themselves. Ridley Scott's explosive sci-fi adventure, Blade Runner covers those aspects in some of the most eye popping and thought-provoking ways. Blade Runner tells the tale of a futuristic policeman, specifically a blade runner, who's hired to track down 4 replicants. The blade runner is played by Harrison Ford, and he takes the job after thinking about retiring on the force. The setting for Blade Runner takes place in the futuristic year of 2019, where Los Angeles is overpopulated by Americans and Asian Americans. The leader of the replicants group is an albino, played by Rutger Hauer. His mission on Earth is to track down the creator who made him and the other robots. One of those robots is a female, played by Daryl Hannah. Blade Runner has a good story to it and it's beautifully told. But, the big surprise in this movie is the art-direction and visual effects. The whole city of Los Angeles is lit with neon lit signs and giant advertising posters that really enhances the culture aspects and look of the future. Harrison Ford is also convincing as the leading role. This is actually his best since Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rutger Hauer is very frightening and very good as the killer robot with a vengeance. I like how the movie uses the 1940's film-noir style to it, creating a feel of mystery to the story. Believe it or not, I am a sci-fi geek. I really enjoy watching science-fiction mainly because science-fiction movies are thought-provoking and brilliant about the way the story is told. But, the visual effects in Blade Runner doesn't undermine the story. The special effects are indeed, exhilarating. The look and feel of this rainy and depressing city is very similar to other movies that followed after this one. What's surprising is that Blade Runner did not do well at the box office, probably because people didn't quite understand the concept and story of it. Yet, another sci-fi movie, E.T., did a lot more better than Blade Runner. In fact, E.T. grossed over $435,110,554 that year. It was also one of the best films of that year, and compare to Blade Runner, it's different in its tone and look. I find this to be very disappointing. What I mean is that movies within the same genre should be viewed the same and be reviewed as films that will make cinema history. I think that Blade Runner deserved the same kind of criticism as E.T. does because both movies relied on different stories, but inside, there's a meaning to it. If audiences and critics can't seem to rendered that fact, the movies are in for a rude awakening. In a nutshell, Blade Runner is a excellent sci-fi movie, filled with interesting characters that we care for and a set that's worth a look at. It is also one of the best films of 1982. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,6,3 November 2013
The Deer Hunter," The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978
","In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film is, of course, was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978,other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,0,2,30 September 2013
Casino," 'Today, it looks like Disneyland.'
","Martin Scorsese have gained a lot of respect and power through his films. Ranging from Taxi Driver to Goodfellas, his career have spawned one magnificent movie after another. His films are powerful, violent, well-crafted, well-directed and well-written. You can also say that in a lot of his films, there's a sense of ambition. In the case with Casino, it qualifies as another great piece of film-making from him.The story begins in 1973, where Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, (Robert De Niro), is sent to Las Vegas to run the teamsters-funded casino called The Tangiers. In the Tangiers, the mafia controls every aspect of activity. Sam becomes the boss of the casino, giving him full responsibility to run it. His best friend, Nicky, (Joe Pesci), is also involved with Sam's business of running the casino, giving Sam all the protection he needs. But, when a woman walks into Sam's life while playing on the craps table and also causing a disruption, he spots his eyes her. The girl's name is Ginger (Sharon Stone). Soon enough, Sam and Ginger get married. But, what Sam doesn't know is that Ginger is a prostitute and her unfaithful actions to him comes from her long-time pimp, Lester (James Woods). When Sam finds out about Lester, he takes matter into his own hands. As the film progresses, Sam's dreams are shattered when he starts to lose control of his casino empire and everything becomes too complicated to handle or bear.The photography is very well done and it creates a sense of vibrant to the world of Las Vegas. Furthermore, Scorsese shows us how the casino operation works. There's one scene in the movie where Nicky narrates about what goes on in a specific room called the 'Count Room.' In the Count Room, casino managers count up all of the money that is collected from the players. It turns that the mob controls the casino and Rothstein is calling the shots. But, as the movie progresses, I felt that the film turn into a 'How to' movie, where the viewer learns a thing or two about mob operations in Las Vegas.There are other parts in Casino that I really like. Another criticism that I have is the relationship between Sam and his wife, Ginger. In this relationship, we see that Sam really love her, yet what he doesn't know is that Ginger doesn't love him. Sam, as a person wants to do right and set certain things right because he wants them to be this way. However, in the case of his relationship with Ginger, he is trying to help her get over her drug addiction. But, like the casino business, he can't seem to control her, and therefore, the result is very fatal and destructive.Another thing that Sam can't control is his relationship with Nicky. Just like his wife and his casino managing, Nicky is a giant complication to Sam. He's out of control and throughout the entire movie, we see Nicky getting more and more arrogant about setting up his part in Las Vegas. That proves to be too much for Sam because he doesn't want Nicky get out of control. As a result, Nicky is becomes his own enemy toward the mob and that, his fate is ill-fated.What Scorsese does in this movie and also with Goodfellas is that the mafia world is being used as a crutch and that the main character of both films set their standards toward the mob. Yet, even though his promises are convincing, they are really not what they seem to be. In other words, what one would warned to another, another does the impossible. In Goodfellas, Henry Hill is told by Jimmy Conway to never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut. In the end of Goodfellas, that promise is broken, yet there is a sense of resentment and regret. In Casino, the characters are all infatuated by what goes in Las Vegas. It's almost as if Scorsese change the location from New York to Las Vegas. All the performances in Casino are astounding. Robert De Niro is excellent as Sam Rothstein, the man who wants everything done, but can never predict the problems that he has to face. Sharon Stone gives, I think, an Oscar-nominated performance as Ginger. This performance proves that Stone can act under so much pressure and destruction that creates her character to be convincing. Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his performance in Goodfellas, is effective as Nicky. Some people would say that Pesci is playing in the same field as in Goodfellas. But, Pesci is playing a character here. A character would can snap if he is push too far. All three performances really hold the movie together and all three should be given a certain amount of respect to their characters.Scorsese continues to make movies after Casino, with other future works like The Departed and Gangs of New York. But, Casino is his second boldest. I say that because his latest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, is probably his most boldest yet. With the evidence of Casino, he really scores high with this masterpiece. He captures the life and glamor of Las Vegas life, yet I have to say that this film and Leaving Las Vegas really brings us to the world of Sin City, where the bright and shining lights are covered behind a sense of toughness and crime. Another film that failed to live up to Casino or Leaving Las Vegas is Showgirls, which fails to capture the toughness of being in Las Vegas. Casino is bold, bloody and brilliant and its ambition takes us deep into the heart and crime of Sin City. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,2,3,12 April 2014

The Wizard of Oz," We're off to the see the Wizard. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.
","In every childhood's dream, we all have been inspired to be somewhere. Some have the dream to become someone in a different place. An place where speculation is an key point in that particular environment. Some dream about being in an place, where wonder and joy filled up their imagination. When Frank L. Baum wrote the book, 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz', his vision was much more different than the movie's adaption. In 1939, The Wizard of Oz was made into a motion picture. It is not only a motion picture for audiences, but a motion picture for all generations. The movie tells us about how Dorothy, played Judy Garland, set off on an adventure in the colorful, lively world of Oz. But, before even being situated in the world of Oz, let's start from the beginning. In the great state of Kansas, Dorothy is happily living in her little Kansas farm, with her aunt and uncle. But, an mean landlady named Mrs. Gulch has a grudge on Dorothy because Dorothy's dog, Toto, bit her. She is ignored by her guardians, who are helping out on the farm. Then, the movie strikes a major chord, and from there, The Wizard of Oz begins to unfolds as Dorothy sings the musical number, 'Over the Rainbow'. Soon enough, an huge tornado threatens Dorothy's home and eventually, Dorothy lands in the wonderful world of Oz. From there, her adventures will unfold and set the viewers on a vivid, magical, journey through Oz. Dorothy begins to make new friends with the people she comes in contact with. But, like any other fairy tale, there's always evil lurking. The Wicked Witch of the West threatens to take over Oz, and so it's up to Dorothy and her friends to make it to Emerald City to see the Wizard. There are supporting characters in The Wizard of Oz that consists of The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion and The Scarecrow. Each one of those characters want to achieve something during this journey to see the Wizard. The Tin Man wishes a heart for his body. The Cowardly Lion wishes to be brave and have courage to stand up against his fears. The Scarecrow wishes he had an brain. Over time, The Wizard Oz had been broadcasts on local television stations over the last 30 years. It is till being shown on TV as of today. But, what is about The Wizard of Oz that makes the movie worth-watching? Well, there are a lot of reasons to speculate on that question. First of all, the original Frank L. Baum's novel was a dark allegory on historical figures being represented as the characters in the Wonderful World of Oz. In this movie version, those elements are thrown away. Second of all, the movie's appeal is to everybody. A lot of parents would take their kids to see The Wizard of Oz every time it is shown on TV or at the movies. In my opinion, The Wizard of Oz is timeless classic. This is a movie that is based on the tradition of magic. We, as the audience, are stunned when we see the world of Oz. Not only the set design of The Wizard of Oz is spectacular, but also, it has a juvenile feel to it. The spirit of the movie really makes the movie more pure than any other movie that is meant to seen by children. The Wizard of Oz is juvenile in its tone, especially the leading role of Judy Garland. For me, Garland is probably responsible for making the movie appeal to children. There's a deep meaning to the movie's argument on whether Dorothy's dream was real or fictional. This was significant when the movie was released in 1939. In the end, her dream is validated as being a dream. MGM was willing to gamble on The Wizard of Oz because it was the most expensive production at that time. The end result was an great-looking, very appealing and dazzling story of magic. The musical numbers in the movie are compelling and is full of joy as we hear Judy Garland's splendid singing voice that makes it all the more purer. It is a unforgettable classic that will live on for many centuries. And, also, there's no place like home. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,3,4,16 November 2013
The Island," Starts off good, but falls short
","The Island is a film directed by Michael Bay, who's previous work were Armageddon, Bad Boys 1 and 2, The Rock and Pearl Harbor. His previous movies were good, but not great popcorn action films that made a fortune at the box office. Yet even he can make several duds, too. Pearl Harbor, Armageddon and Bad Boys 2 were examples of overblown, loud, special effects duds. This movie however, has a great beginning, but the problem is that it looks like it was directed by a different filmmaker.The movie takes place in the futuristic year of 2019, where citizens live underneath the Earth, cutting off their communication to the outside world. The main character of the story, Lincoln Six Echo, (Ewan McGregor), is one of those citizens. His day first starts off with him losing an left shoe. Then, he goes down to the cafeteria, where he is not allowed to eat bacon due to his health record at the cafeteria. He does, however, forms an friendly relationship with a female citizen who lives in this society. Her name is Jordan Two Delta, (Scarlett Johansson). The beginning of the movie tells us that Lincoln has a recurring nightmare about driving a boat in the middle of the ocean and drowning. Of course, the movie does set up an very creepy side to this futuristic world. The one thing this society depends on is the lottery in which the inhabitants of the world can win a trip to go to the Island. But, what is the Island?McGregor's character soon take his chance to escape from the underground society along with Johansson and soon enough, the two fugitives find themselves venturing out into the outside world. However, they are not accustomed with the new surroundings. Everything seems deserted and barren. Risking his life, Lincoln and Jordan decides to find out the answers by joining with another inhabitant from the underground world, (Steve Bucemi). Bucemi explains to the two that they are clones and since they are part of an genetically engineered society, they have no actual memory of their actual parents. Together, Lincoln and Jordan decides to seek out more answers when they arrive to Los Angeles. Right about there is where The Island goes completely wrong.The first half of the movie is very well directed with its inside look of this completely dystopian society. The art direction is very well done and I like how the citizens of this world wear different colored outfits to show what kind of identification or identity they are. McGregor and Johansson are good in their roles as the two clones, but sometimes I felt that their dialogue runs a little bit too simplistic. I also love the supporting cast including Steve Bucemi, who helps them get to Los Angeles and also the performance by Djimon Hounsou. He's particularly a good actor in this film. His job is to catch the two fugitives before they tell everyone back underground the truth about the Island.But, what bothered me is the second half of the movie. This is when Michael Bay steps in. When McGregor and Johansson get to Los Angeles, I felt the movie slow down and came to a screeching halt when the two of them are being chased by Hounsou's goons. Like all of Bay's films, there's is a lot of action sequences. One example is the scene where the two clones hitch a ride in the back of a trailer carrying metal tubing. Throughout that entire scene, the characters are locked into a scene that isn't worth my time or my patience. It almost as if Michael Bay put these two actors on a treadmill and have them run through a series of dodging giant obstacles such as falling building debris, the metal tubing and a whole lot of smashed up cars. Not the least interesting.The story is perhaps similar to those who've seen other science fiction movies where the protagonists escapes from their dystopian society and exposed the real truth behind all of the corruption. The movie Logan's Run is a perfect example. In that film, the two main characters escaped from their own world and venture into the outside world and sees the obvious difference between these two completely different worlds. Here, it is the same thing. As the special effects go, they are good, but not at all great. The futuristic world of Los Angeles in the year 2019 has been a whole lot more better in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner since it had a dark and depressing atmosphere. In The Island, it isn't even interesting or good enough.I guess Michael Bay had a very good movie going for him, I imagine. But, the fact that his over-the-top action sequences get in the way of a predictable and eye-opening story that doesn't work. I know that Michael Bay isn't the best director of the action genre, but I can't give him the credit of putting in a mindless and loud action sequence. If The Island kept going with its story about human cloning and ethics, then maybe it would've been great. I really love to see more movies about human cloning. I know that they made a decent one called The 6th Day with Arnold Schwarznegger, but I am still waiting to see a serious science fiction that really challenges the audience toe explore the world of human cloning, not highway accidents. â˜…â˜… 1/2 2 1/2 stars.",3,0,1,24 August 2014
The Godfather," The movie to conquer all movies
","Movies are made for a lot of reasons and can inflict human emotions to the audience. Some tend to be classics because a lot of people enjoyed the movie and raved about it. Others don't go far to be known. In my opinion, movies that are classics are going to stay for a long time. Movies that don't fare well will be forgotten. But, what about movies like The Godfather? Is that movie is going to be around for a long time? Absolutely. Is it for all generations to see? Absolutely. Without a doubt, The Godfather is the leader to all of the great movies. The movie is adapted from Mario Puzo's best-seller and it tells the story of a family. Vito Corleone is the head of his family. He is also the head of the family's business. His family deals with different situations that are dealt with in their own style and fashion. In other words, they are the Mafia. When Vito's son comes home from the war, he decides on his own behalf to not get involved in his family's business. Michael Corleone, Vito's son, decides to live his own life while his family deals with their own problems. But, when one of Vito's sons, Sonny, played by James Caan, is killed during a mob hit, Vito decides to take revenge against the people who killed his son. Meanwhile, Michael becomes aware of his surroundings and starts to see a downfall of his father's empire. His father is severely injured in the streets after being gunned down and Michael starts to wonder who's going to watch over the family. In other words, who's going to be the next godfather? As the movie progresses, I was suddenly starting to see a change being done to the movie and also to the movie industry. This rise and fall story is told very beautifully and is directed with a focused look at a world where family sticks together and carry out their jobs and fall down and suffer the consequences. This movie has a lot in store and has a lot of feeling about the underworld of the mafia. We even see that even though Michael does become who he is in the end, we know that for a fact that the choice was one that couldn't be refused. The Godfather is a film to be hailed. It's portrayal of the Italian mob is not stereotypical. Instead, the movie focuses on a family that is doused with honor, pride, lust and life. People do get hurt in these drastic situations and those wounds do hurt in a way that you've never felt before. For me, this film speaks louder than the words that are being said. It is more than a gangster movie. It is what the movies are meant to do, which is entertain us at its best and greatest. The performances by Marlon Brando is excellent. He really leads a very well-casted movie that include Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall, as the family lawyer, who is Irish and the supporting role of Diana Keaton as Pacino's love interest. All of the acting in The Godfather is phenomenal. This is the movie that made Al Pacino a star. He is that great of a legendary actor to star as Michael. Director Francis Ford Coppola said that in several interviews involving his film, he said that The Godfather was the hardest film to make. With a ballooning budget and a casting problem with the role of Vito Corleone, Coppola suffered most of the time and even was afraid he'll lose his job. In my opinion, he should be proud of the film he made. Even though it was troubling to make, in the end, it paid off. Not only being in the top 10 grossing films of 1972, but also allowing us to see a movie that's worth watching and worth looking at. It is also fill with style and power that in the end, we are starving to see it again. The Godfather took home 3 Oscars, including Best Picture and spawned 2 sequels. As a movie buff, all I can say is that The Godfather leads behind other classic movies like Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Casablanca. Like those 3 other movies, it's the power and story-telling that grabs us out of the movie theater and puts us into the spotlight with well-scripted characters and various stories that emerged out of the family. The sheer critical praise of The Godfather continues to seen and even though it's been 41 years since the film's release, this film isn't going to die. The epic scope and vision of this underworld is going to live on and keep this classic pumping. The Godfather is the best film of 1972 and yet, one of the greatest movies of all time. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10,1,3,27 November 2013
