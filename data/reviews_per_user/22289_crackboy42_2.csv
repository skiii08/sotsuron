The Ring," Scariest...Movie...Ever
","Ive seen some scary movies in my days. I have nothing againstsome of the older horror pictures (Hitchcock, etc.) They did anamazing job, but don't really cut it these days. Today they arelooked at as good/but not scary FILMS.Anyway, I saw this movie in the theatre and was squirming theENTIRE time, beginning to end. I think this movie pulled off everyscary movie trick. They had the 'What's around the corner' trick, the'Don't open the closet door!' trick, the disturbing images, the 'OHMY GOD!' sudden jump out trick... this movie scared me in everyway I thought I could be scared.Basically, If you saw Blair Witch Project (and actually thought it wasscary... cause if you didn't this doesn't count) think of that chill thatwent up your spine on the VERY last shot. If you remember theshot and remember that feeling of utter horror... this movie is likethat feeling for 90minutes. NOT 5 seconds...90 MINUTES!One of the girls I saw it with was not impressed. She felt that it wastoo unbelievable. For some reason Red Dragon was the scariestmovie she ever saw. She told me that stuff that CAN'T reallyhappen is not scary. To a degree I get her point. This movie is OUTTHERE...but that's the beauty of it. Another small comment I'd like to make is the fact that the neverexplain what the heck is going on or why. I really thought it was anice treat. They never explained HOW the things happened, youjust believe they do. (Hard to explain without spoiling, but if you'veseen it, you know what I mean).The plot wasn't that great. In fact the movie was a 90 minute hook.It hooked you immediate and never let you go.My beliefs are that if a scary movie makes you afraid of the dark,then it did its job...and I'll tell you, I slept with the lights on thatnight.SEE THIS MOVIE!",9,0,0,13 December 2002
Resident Evil," Very true to the game with an American twist
","After Tomb Raider, I was very nervous about seeing Resident Evil.I heard it was to be a prequel to the games, and that just made mystomach turn more. Since Resident Evil (or Biohazard Japan) hasalways been written by the Japanesse, I viewed this movie as a 90minute fan fiction story. Standing on its own, Resident Evil is a great horror/action film. Theentire film is filled with 'what's that noise' or 'what's around thecorner' suspense, much like the game. I was always pleased tosee that Millia's 'Matrix Move' that she uses against the dog (theyshow it at the end of EVERY commercial) was the only string stuntused. Now for the more important part. How well does the movie portraythe game? Very f***ing good. First of all, Millia's costume was verysimilar to Jill's in RE3. Second, about 10 minutes of the film DOtake place within the mansion from RE1 (and if you played thegame, you WILL notice which rooms they are in). Third, a lot of theshots in the film are similar to the game (ex: a dead body lyingagainst the wall and blood stains all over the wall and a pool ofblood leading to his body). Fourth, (and this may spoil some of themovie for you, so you might want to skip to the next paragraph) theclimax takes place on a train. Overall the tone of the game is verysimilar to the movie. On a down note, don't think all the monsters will be in it. Nohunters, tyrants, sharks, spiders. There is ONE Licker, whoevolves into a super Licker, but they save him for the end. The film does have very 'action' moments, such as the laserscene in the beginning, and the matrix move, but it won't ruin theoverall feel. The audience cheered and said 'Oh damn!' wheneverthese incidents occured. But my favorite thing about this movie... is the hidden things theyput in that only the gamers would understand. They talk and showRaccoon City, as well as the outside and inside of the mansion.'Biohazard' is said and shown in the first five minutes. And,(Beware: HUGE SPOILER!) they show you who Nemisis really is,which I thought was a very nice touch. The ending did let you hanging, like they might make a sequel(and I hope they do). If they do it would have to take place duringRE2 and RE3, cause anyone who beat RE3, knows what happensto Racoon City. No Chris, No Jill, No Barry (I love Barry), and no 'You being themaster of unlocking' (joke for the gamers). GOOD MOVIE. SEE THIS.  EVEN IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED THE GAME.",10,0,0,17 March 2002
