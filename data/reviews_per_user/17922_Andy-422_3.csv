The Blair Witch Project," a fine line
","Nigel of Spinal Tap said it best: 'there's a fine line between stupid and clever.' For me, this sums up the reactions to Blair Witch that I have surveyed. Myself, I go back and forth. On one hand, the criticisms I hear of the film make sense. On the other hand, the ending rocked my world. I think it requires more suspension of disbelief than most modern movie goer's are capable of. There's no music playing in the background in real life, but we must have it in a movie. If you allow yourself to get into the perspective the film demands of you, it can be chilling when you really think about what's going on around you. But if you are viewing this as a complete outsider, it will appear stupid and trite.",Null,0,0,11 December 1999
Unbreakable," Great film
","POSSIBLE SPOILER!!!!
Well, I don't reveal any plot development, but the fact that there is a twist may lead some to look at the movie differently when they go in, and you should see it fresh with no pre-conceptions.People are so impatient. The reviews against this movie basically want an action movie. There is a difference between a film and a movie. This was a film, made by an artist. As for the obviousness of the finish, I have this to say. I was surprised, just as I was at the end of Sixth Sense. And then I immediately went back in the film in my mind and saw all the foreshadowing of the 'obvious' twist. But I wasn't looking for the twist. Had I been looking for a 'who is the.....' I would have gotten that right away. But as I usually an one to try to guess every plot angle ahead of time, with both this film and Sixth Sense, Night has been masterful at convincing me to pay attention to one thing, without worrying so much about another. He is, in this way, a master magician. But the viewer has to be willing to let a film be a film for this to happen. You have to trust the film maker to create a world for you to live in for a brief period of time. Sadly, too many people are not imaginitive enough to do this. Our world has become one without mystery, magic, and the unknown. We are unwilling to step outside our narrow boxes of 'what happened' and ask 'why?' Most people will probably be disappointed with this one, but as another reviewer noted, most people thought 'Spinal Tap' was dumb and think that the Patriot is the ultimate in film making. P.S. Having lived in Philadelphia for four years, I also enjoyed once again the Philly backdrop. My only criticism is that there had better not be a third movie, set in Philly, starring Bruce Willis, featuring a character with secret knowledge/power that must be used to help others, and a twist ending. I can take it twice, since I wasn't watching for it.",Null,0,0,25 November 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Derivitave but a guilty pleasure
","I liked this movie the first time I saw it, when it was called 'The Matrix,' 'Face-Off,' and 'James Bond.' I enjoyed the movie, but only because I was able to suspend every shred of disbelief. If you can't do that, you'll laugh out loud at how ridiculous it is, from the first mountain climbing scene, to the last sequence. But, hey - it's an escapist comic-book-esque experience, not a film about realism.
And while Woo is a stylistic director, does he have to keep reminding us? The slow-mo, the constant use of pigeons and doves, the focus on flowing fabric in the air - yes, John, we know you made this movie - your signatures are all over it like a graffitti artists overdone tags.
The romance storyline was unneccesary - in love after one night? I guess ultra-good looking people don't have to build relationships like the rest of us normal folks. I would even say there are two nods to Star Wars. The opening credits shift to a starry sky, then the camera drops to the skyline. Every SW movie opens this way. POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE And the other is the entry into the Biotech company's building. The fortress of security is penetrable through a shaft (not for ventilation but light) - it's the one place of weakness. Is it just me, or isn't this like SW Ep 4's blowing up of the Death Star?
Overall, I enjoy picking on these little things, but as your action movies go overall, still a good escapism. However, I have to agree with other comment writers that the violence was ultra-high. The PG-13 was probably because of little or no profanity, and no nudity - the ratings board is all screwed up -you can kill and maim and get a PG-13, but Jason's Lyric was slapped with an NC-17 for making love.",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
