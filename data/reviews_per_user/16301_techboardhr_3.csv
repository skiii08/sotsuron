United 93," A complete abomination of tedium and pretension.
",The cinematography is simply horrendous. The camera is continuously panning back and forth and going in and out of focus while capturing such illuminating images as someone's back. The director's attempt at realism (excuse me this is not a documentary!) comes off like a cheap transparently contrived TV show for dullards. After five minutes of this immensely annoying tactic I was getting bored. I soon began to fast forward and everywhere I stopped it was more of the same inane drivel. Back and forth the camera goes with sophomoric pretense that is astounding in its ability to bore and annoy. The acting is just as bad. The only value this piece of garbage has is capitalizing on the subject matter to lure people unfortunate enough to pay to see it. I glanced at the ratings here before I rented this abortion and after watching this mess I can not believe anyone would rate it above 6. Hype! Hype! Hype!,2,4,14,9 September 2006
28 Days Later...," Annoying Pile of Rubbish!
","This movie has the feel of a low budget, transparently contrived, amateurish, made for video piece of garbage. It comes off like some 1990s TV drama with its use of the jerking camera technique that is so annoying and boring that it helps to ruin the film. (Not that there are any other aspects of this POS that are redeeming) I was fast forwarding soon into this stupid tepid ridiculous soap opera. This film is nothing but a badly made 'B' movie that should not even have been featured on late night television. All those involved in hyping this dullard fare should be beaten about the face and hands for profiting from this abortion.",1,2,7,28 October 2007
Saints and Soldiers," Low budget, weak acting, boring, need I go on?
","It seemed the majority of the apparently small budget was spent in the first five minutes and that was nothing special. From there prepare for a slow meaningless meander in the hills or what we see of them anyway. The writing is really bad and the acting is not much better. I am shocked that this is rated a 7, that is laughable. It is shot in the style that reminds one of a cheaply made soap opera and that gives the film an unreal cloying tone throughout. I had watched 'El Alamein' right before this POS and found it much better. In fact I can't remember seeing much of a worse war movie than 'Saints and Soldiers' I doubt most people would sit through this rubbish even as made for TV movie.",3,20,34,19 November 2006
