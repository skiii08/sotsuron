Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Obscene, Offensive, Hilarious!
","My expectation for Borat was for it to be an offensive,crude and adult humor oriented movie. It was, and then some. But that doesn't begin to tell how deep this movie actually goes down the well of American culture. This movie is beyond the good chuckle humor found in your average comedies, and it is far beyond laugh-out-loud humor found in the once in a blue moon gem comedies. This movie is downright hysterical; and I mean that in the most literal sense of the word. At times I found it legitimately hard to breathe and unable to see the movie because of tears in my eyes from laughter. The reason this movie is so funny is because of two reasons. Firstly most of the people in the movie don't know they are in a movie. The actors film in real life settings where people are unaware that Borat is a fictitious character. And when he does something outrageous the reactions of the non-actors are ones that even the best actors could not replicate. Secondly Cohen exploits some of Americas biases, prejudices, ignorance and stupidity. This vaults this movie onto another plane. One in which only a select few movies should even be mentioned. This movie has depth beyond surface humor and jokes. It makes you think. But not a whole lot because you're laughing too hard and you're often worried about catching your breath. 10 out of 10",10,7,32,27 September 2006
