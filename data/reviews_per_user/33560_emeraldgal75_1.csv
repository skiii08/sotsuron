Walk the Line," Beautifully Done
","This film was perfectly cast. Joaquin Pheonix is perfect as Cash and Reese Witherspoon was fantastic as June. Their singing was spot on and the acting was flawless.The story of 'Walk the Line' at first glance could seem cheesy and romantic. Maybe even over the top. But it's not. It's true. It's lovely and wonderful.The 'warts and all' story made me admire the Cash's even more. The strength that June possessed, the way she cared for her friend throughout all his problems was inspiring.I can't say enough good things about the power of the actors performances. Better if you just see them for yourselves, lest I ramble.",10,0,2,21 November 2005
