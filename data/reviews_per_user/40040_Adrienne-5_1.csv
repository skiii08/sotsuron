Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well worth seeing
","The special effects are very well done, and the scenery makes the movie easy on the eyes. After watching the movie, I came away with the impression that this is chapter 1 of 'The Book of Star Wars', a good foundation for the unfolding story. It's more of an introduction to the saga (albeit a good intro) rather than a fully stand-alone story. It's well worth seeing, and an enjoyable movie to watch.Some viewers may hate the Jar Jar Binks character, but I found the character amusing, and he provided comedy relief at good spots in the movie to keep it from being too tense/grim for my 8- and 6-year-old children who went with me to see it.",8,5,7,15 June 1999
