The Blair Witch Project," The BEST horror movie I have ever seen!
","This was THE best horror movie I have ever seen.  I have to give complete ups to the people who made it.  It was terrifying.  My favorite all time movie, horror or non WAS Last House On The Left.  The Blair Witch Project completely blew it out of the water.  I haven't been that frightened by a movie in a very long time.  I'm so happy some one has finally filled the void of good horror movies.  This one rocked.",10,1,2,2 July 1999
