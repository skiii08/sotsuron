Blade Runner 2049," Amazing follow up to original
",Blade Runner 2049 is so much better than the original that the 1st one now serves as an intro to Blade Runner world with 2049 being movie that really allows you to dive deep into story line. 2049 pays homage to the original in style but is far better at examining the question of what it manes to be human. Great acting & great set pieces make this movie a must see for all noir and sci fi film fans.,10,1,14,27 June 2018
Captain Marvel," Great story, action, humor and fits perfectly into the existing MCU
","A very original way to tell an origin story for both Captain and Fury. Lots of action, humor & great story telling. Ignore any reviews that are less than 6 stars.
Those reviews are BS by dudes who have no confidence in their own masculinity. Looking forward to seeing Captain Marvel kick ass in future MCU moves.",10,4,17,8 April 2019
Black Panther," Another great addition the Marvel Universe.
","This movie has it all, Great acting , action, effects , costumes, music and scenery. Above all it's an entertaining story which is both dramatic and as with most Marvel movies plenty of humor. While the story stands on it's own seeing Captain America civil war 1st is helpful.",10,3,6,7 September 2018
Black Panther," Another great origin story from the MCU
","Ignore the bad reviewers, they've got issues. Great story, characters, acting and action. While not perfect, (what is?) it could've been a tad shorter, it's got a lot of great emotional moments and some well timed humor. Looking forward to seeing these characters in future Marvel movies.",10,3,6,13 May 2018
