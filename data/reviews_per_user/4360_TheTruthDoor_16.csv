First Man," Terrible Movie
","Don't believe the positive reviews of 'First Man', it is a terrible movie. The plot is ridiculous, so over the top dramatic....yet the drama was only believable from Claire Foy.Ryan Gosling is an awful, unbelievable actor, there are so many other actors that would have been a better choice for this movie.The cinematography was horrible. I promise you that 70% - 80% of the entire movie is filmed with the camera about 12 inches from the subject, whether it is the actor's faces, props, the space capsule..EVERYTHING. And they shook the camera continuously throughout the entire movie....ridiculous.I gave the movie 2-stars because of Claire Foy. She is an amazing actress, even though she is not much to look at.And the ending of the movie was also ridiculous.Sorry for such an honest review, but it needs to be said.",2,47,87,15 October 2018
Wind River," Even Better the 2nd Time
","For me this has been a terrible Summer in the movie industry. I have walked out of more movies this Summer than any previous one. But 'Wind River' has made the wait for a good movie worth the effort. It is far and away the BEST movie of the year.I have never been a Jeremy Renner fan and honestly did not want to see this movie just because he is in it. But I am so glad that I did see it, he shows his acting skills in this movie, he is the real deal. The female actors were all beautiful and excellent. So believable...so beautiful.And how nice it was to see Graham Greene again. What a great actor he is. He adds class and realism to every movie he is in.I will be seeing 'Wind River' again.....I cannot wait to see it again. Thank you Hollywood for this movie.UPDATE: I went to see 'Wind River' again last night and loved it even more than the first time I saw it. I have to say this, I have never seen this before.....nobody got up from their seats at the end of the movie. We all stayed and watched the credits roll, we didn't want to leave.What a great movie this is.",10,3,10,3 September 2017
Darkest Hour," Gary Oldman is AMAZING! Oscar can you hear me?
","Simply put, Gary Oldman is the best actor I have ever seen in 'Darkest Hour'. He IS Winston Churchill. Amazing performance, unbelievable performance, the best ever.'Darkest Hour' is a wonderful film. It is a little slow getting going but you know when watching it that you have to keep your seat because it's going to finish with a bang.I didn't expect much from this movie going in, but wow...it gave and gave and kept giving until the end.This is a movie the whole family should see, it is classy, historical and film making at its best.GO SEE 'Darkest Hour'!",9,1,5,2 January 2018
Passengers," More Than I Expected (I was prepared to hate it)
","I went to see Passengers expecting to hate it, but was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The plot was very good and believable, even for a futuristic space film which I usually don't like.The special effects were great...well done.The acting was excellent...very believable.It was easy to sympathize with Chris Pratt's situation in the film. Jennifer Lawrence was solid as usual and Michael Sheen was wonderful.See this film, I promise you will enjoy it....especially the character played by Michael Sheen.Very good film.",8,1,3,17 January 2017
Aquaman," Boring, overrated, long, nothing movie.
","How many people were paid to write great reviews of this BORING movie?It is boring, long and cheap looking. The only scenes that I enjoyed were the close-ups of Amber Heard.Enough said.",2,3,6,30 December 2018
"I, Tonya"," Amazing Movie...Unbelievable Acting....Brilliant!
","I saw 'I, Tonya' last night because there was nothing else starting at the time. I am SO glad I did get to see it. What an amazing performance by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. I cannot say enough about their acting. It was definitely OSCAR worthy.The plot, the cinematography, the script, the acting and the skating performances were all perfect....bordering on amazing.Margot Robbie is the real deal....she has some serious acting skills...way to go!And for the real Tonya....big hug from me!This is an amazing movie.",10,2,4,9 February 2018
The Book Thief," 'Dad, this is a GREAT movie!'
","I loved this film, I will be taking my 13 year old son with me to see it tomorrow. Yes, I want to see it again, what a wonderful experience. Sophie Melisse is just amazing, she made every scene special with her presence. Such a beautiful girl. How can a 13 year old girl act with such skill and realism. And the rest of the cast was amazing as well. Every once in a while, a film comes along that is truly special and this is one of them. I want to say 'thank you' to everyone involved with this film. You have touched me in a very special way that I won't forget quickly. I can't wait for my son to see the realities of war and what it must feel like to be an orphan child. The little girl handled herself through such terrifying times with such strength and compassion. Please go see this work of art.UPDATE: I took my 13 year old son tonight to see 'A Book Thief'. He was spellbound during the film. On the way out of the theater, he asked if we could buy the DVD when it is available. 'Dad, this is a GREAT movie', he said.I enjoyed the movie even more on my second viewing. Oh what a great movie. A classic.",8,9,16,13 December 2013
Interstellar," Awful Film
","The good reviews of Interstellar on IMDb are proof to me that movie studios pay people to post positive reviews of movies. The current IMDb rating is 9.1......no way in hell is that an accurate rating.This movie is awful...period. How could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie?I really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it. The actor list reads like a 'who's who' of movie stars. But I cannot think of one single positive thing to say about it.Trust me, don't waste 3-hours of your life on this film. You will regret it, just like I do.",1,45,99,8 November 2014
Oblivion," Turkey!
","This movie is a turkey.I squirmed my way through the entire thing and was so happy when it ended. I was starting to think it would never end.Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman playing with plastic props and ridiculous costumes.Terrible plot, terrible acting, terrible costumes, terrible props, terrible, terrible, terrible...Don't bother seeing it, there are too many good movies out there to waste your time on this turkey.IMDb requires 10 lines of text so here is my 10th line. :)",4,2,6,6 May 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Clint Eastwood is Great, Amy Adams is Brilliant
","'Trouble With The Curve' is a wonderful film. The casting, acting, writing, direction, were all superb. The location scenery was beautiful.Clint Eastwood is at the top of his game, he plays his part effortlessly. And, OMG, Amy Adams was unbelievable, she is amazing and beautiful, she deserves the Oscar for this film. The chemistry between Clint and Amy was perfect.This is not a baseball movie, it is a father-daughter film in the fashion of 'On Golden Pond'. It will make you laugh, think and cry.Another Clint Eastwood film that Hollywood can be proud of. Go see it.",10,50,81,23 September 2012
Hugo," A True Piece of Art - A Future Classic
","From the very first minute, this film is breathtakingly beautiful and amazing. The art, cinematography, lighting, acting, story, direction, are all amazing. This film should be given multiple Academy Awards, especially for Best Director (Scorsese), Best Actor (Asa Butterfield), Best Actress (Chloe Moretz), Best Supporting Actors (Ben Kingsley & Sacha Baron Cohen) and Cinematography. The casting was superb, all actors were very believable, I loved everyone of them, kudos to Martin Scorsese for bringing out the best in the cast.The only criticism I can put forth, is that it is a little slow for children, my 11 year old son got a little fidgety at times, but still loved the movie in the end.'Hugo' is a masterpiece, a true work of art in film.",10,26,52,25 November 2011
Dunkirk," An Honest American Review
","How is Dunkirk getting so many raving, positive reviews when it is such a lousy film?The reviews are mostly from Europeans with a blind pride or they have an emotional attachment to the actual battle. Also, the director is from England. You see if this movie fails, which it should, England's pride will take a hit (the home of James Bond, the Queen and all that royalty bs).My HONEST review of 'Dunkirk'...I say 'honest' because there is just no way that someone could give an honest review of this movie without saying something negative about it.I knew in the first 5-minutes that it was a turkey. Honestly, it was almost laughable from the start. The acting, the editing, the corny captions, the predictability, the audio, the video....it was all close to laughable.Dunkirk today is a tourist resort and Nolan filmed the beach scenes on the beach in Dunkirk. Imagine taking a modern day beach town and filming a war movie set in the 1940's on that beach. Laughable.I know you are going to ignore my review, because of the unbelievable reviews it is getting, but you will REGRET IT. I cannot and will not lie to you, 'Dunkirk' is a stupidly bad movie that absolutely DOES NOT deserve the good reviews it is getting.",2,26,55,21 July 2017
Bridesmaids," Quick Review: Fun, Heartfelt Movie
","This is a wonderful, fun, funny, heartfelt movie. I am an older man, I expected the typical chick-flick but I was very pleasantly surprised, it is so entertaining. The chemistry between ALL of the actors was great. There are so many things to be impressed with in this movie. The casting was absolutely superb. Every actor is perfect for their part in the movie and could be a separate movie by themselves. The script is wonderful, it keeps you entertained with laughter even during dramatic moments, and it works.I cannot stop thinking about this movie, I will be seeing it again very soon. Do you yourself a favor and see this movie, you will not be sorry.",8,3,8,18 May 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Long, boring, blah, blah film.
","First let me say, that I am a big fan of every actor in this film....and I usually like Tarantino films. But I cannot say many good things about 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'. This film is really boring and very long, I almost walked out multiple times.The acting was good, but Tarantino's style of jumping from scene to scene really got old in this film. And when is Tarantino going to leave the World War 2 era?I am impressed that Brad Pitt was willing to accept his role in this film, he took 2nd billing under DiCaprio. So glad to see Timothy Olyphant again, he's always entertaining. And Margot Robbie is simply one of the sexiest females to ever appear in movies.If you go see this movie, do yourself a favor and have LOW expectations, then maybe you will be pleased with it.I seriously doubt that this movie will recoup its budget.",3,17,45,26 July 2019
Hidden Figures," Typical Hollywood Over the Top Film
","I just saw 'Hidden Figures' and when I got home I read the reviews on IMDb of the film. After reading some I decided that I have to add an honest review, as the I question the other reviewers credibility.This is NOT a great film, it is mediocre at best and sometimes it is so over the top that it is corny. Hollywood is obsessed with the oppressed black narrative and it really shows in this film. It also seems that Kevin Costner plans on finishing his career preaching the same narrative to all of white America, as if white America doesn't already understand the history.I did appreciate the way the film portrayed black female kindness and strength. I have been very close to some black females and have great respect for their kindness and decency.The history lesson of the American space program and the important role that black females played in it is interesting. But be prepared for 2-hours of 'all white people are bad, except Kevin Costner'.The acting was good, but the film will not receive any Oscars, nor should it.",4,54,118,8 January 2017
Unbroken," Liberal Hollywood Female Makes a War Movie -- Enough said
","TheTruthDoor review of: Unbroken Some people in Hollywood take themselves way too seriously and want to justify their overblown ego's by making movies with a 'social impact', Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are at the top of that list.Angelina wants to be 'somebody' so bad that it consumes her every action. Unbroken is simply her over-directed attempt to say something substantial. If you want to see an awesome war movie that was directed by a female, dig up Hurt Locker. But if you want to make an awesome, genuine war movie, hire Clint Eastwood to direct it.I gave Unbroken 2-stars, but I give Jack O'Connell 8-stars, he did a fine job and makes seeing this movie worth the money.",2,21,47,25 December 2014
