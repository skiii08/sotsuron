The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Beautiful haunting storytelling
","I still listen to the haunting music that weaves it's way through this film and it never fails to move me. The whole film is almost like a modern day ghost story, following its own logic through the simplest but most effective storytelling techniques, beautifully crafted by a master director. Irene Jacob has never been better than here, and I would recommend it highly.",Null,41,52,1 December 2003
