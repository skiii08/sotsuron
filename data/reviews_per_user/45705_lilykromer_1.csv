The New World," NEW WORLD was so fantastic
","NEW WORLD was such a beautiful. Epic in scope, this movie gives an artful, vivid picture of the early history of America. The relationships are rich and engaging, the cinematography is gorgeous. Not a simple film, but definitely one of Malick's best. Colin was great, as was Q'orianka. She's destined to be a huge star in my opinion. I saw the earlier version and this one is much more concise. I think cutting some of then length really made a big difference. The audience in this latest version seemed much more enthralled and less anxious to go once the film grew long. Smart choice.",9,2,6,20 January 2006
