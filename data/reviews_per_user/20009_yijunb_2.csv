Skyfall," Pretty bad, what a let down
","This is a dark Bond film but not as gritty, sophisticated, and elegant as Casino Royale. It's been a big let down since the reboot of Casino Royale. Quantum of Solace and Skyfall are just awful. There are so many flaws in the plot and the Bond feeling just isn't there. The storyline overall is a very cliché and I've never been so bored from watching a Bond movie. Craig makes a great Bond and Casino Royale is easily one of the best Bond movies. But I think they've been just hiring the wrong directors since then. The cinematography is great but the direction isn't clear, action is subpar and the character development (especially the villain) just isn't there. They might need to bring back Martin Campbell to revive the series. I have no idea how the heck this movie got so many positive reviews from so called professional critics.",1,13,26,1 August 2015
Spectre," Unmemorable, rubbish, unoriginal, Craig's talent wasted
","Sam Mendes needs to stop directing Bond films. He doesn't understand the essence of the Bond franchise. But for some magical reason, Skyfall received many positive reviews that it didn't deserve and made the producer a lot of money that it once again didn't deserve. Mendes perceives and portrays Bond as an avant-garde grade character. Marc Foster did something similar by cutting Bond's credit line in Quantum of Solace which I found to be ludicrous and sappy. Let's be real here and they need to stop hiring these artsy film directors like Foster and Mendes who are more interested in perusing their own artistic expression than the true interpretation of the Bond franchise. Mendes' beautiful cinematography overshadowed all the mishaps and cliché plots (presumably copycats of other spy movies) in Skyfall. This time Mendes decides to mix up little of everything from previous James Bond movies, creating one spectacular mediocrity. This explains its long length and inconsistency. Mr. Hinx and Oberhauser are not Bond grade villains. Bellucci is just too old (thanks to feminism) and Seydoux is just too average (thanks to MI:5) to be in the Bond franchise. This won't be your Martin Campbell's Casino Royale which I highly praise, this will be Sam Mendes' wannabe-die another day... mehh.",1,24,54,27 October 2015
