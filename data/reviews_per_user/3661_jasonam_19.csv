Hereditary," Creepy with style
","While visually striking and undeniably freaky, Hereditary ultimately settles for the standard horror ending. Ari Aster proves his competence at establishing character and setting, and Toni Collette delivers a respectable turn as the lead. Unfortunately a slim script and constant misdirections render the film's conclusIon rather flat.",6,0,3,9 June 2018
Train to Busan," A bloody tragedy
","When a diverse group of citizens board a train the moment the apocalypse begins, lines between decency and survival quickly blur beyond recognition. Train to Busan may have all the hallmarks of classic zombie flicks, but its clear execution and vicious monsters keep it entertaining along with a handful of gruesomely memorable scenes.",7,1,4,26 July 2018
Darkest Hour," Gary Oldman reminds us to never give up
","Darkest Hour is a character drama that focuses on a specific moment in British history; it inadvertently serves as the political companion piece to the film Dunkirk which was released the same year. While decently directed, the film's true laurels lie on the head of its lead actor, who completes his transformation into Winston Churchill with commendable realism.",7,0,1,16 June 2018
Green Room," Full metal slasher
","Green Room is a murder thriller that dances closer to Slayer than, say, Rob Zombie. The scenes are colorfully designed for such a brutal subject, and hold some interesting blocking despite the small environment. The acting is serviceable all around and features a solid effort from Anton Yelchin, whose scenes opposite the antagonist played by Sir Patrick Stewart are worth the price of admission. While the ending may be too quick for some, the ride is undeniably exhilarating.",8,2,3,25 May 2018
Aquaman," Rescuing the world with arms and attitude
","Comic-book hero Arthur Curry lives by his own rules, content to help the innocent and drink beer. When his half-brother Oram threatens the world with destruction, Arthur must confront an ancient legacy in order to become King of Atlantis and earn the mantle of Aquaman. A wild ride that's sure to impress, director James Wan's ability to balance action, story, and colorful characters delivers a solid tale about facing your destiny.",8,1,2,29 December 2018
Hotel Rwanda," The story of a good man
","Set during the Rawandan civil war, the consummate businessman has his world turned upside down. His actions will impact not just his family, but families from across the world. Featuring a career-defining performance from Don Cheadle, Hotel Rawanda highlights a singular moment of human triumph against a backdrop of atrocity.",8,1,1,8 September 2018
Ready Player One," A modern marvel
","It takes a special director to make a film based on a novel that defies the conventions of reality. Through Spielberg's deft hand Ready Player One presents a colorful, exciting and strong story that may prove predictive of humanity's future. Soundtrack and special effects are standouts (per usual in this particular case).",8,2,4,6 August 2018
Shutter Island," Blurring the lines of the mind
","What begins as an austere investigation tale steadily descends into a dark realm of madness and deception. Not for the faint of heart, this film is another Scorsese touchstone; visually striking, musically haunting, conceptually intriguing, but overall an exercise in suspense.",8,0,0,10 July 2018
Southpaw," Rage turns to devotion
","When a champion's lust for violence leads to calamity, he must set aside his own desires to ensure his family survives. Even though Southpaw never quite reaches the Oscar-winning caliber of other boxing films, it still manages to stand on its own as a perfectly decent sports drama. Well directed and demonstrating (for those still in doubt) Jake Gyllenhaal's impressive acting range, the combination of brutality and emotion help outweigh an otherwise predictable plot.",7,0,0,18 September 2018
The Revenant," Nature proves a relentless adversary
","In the cold, unforgiving forests of North America, the dark deeds of a group of fur trappers come back to haunt them. A meditation on life and death, nature and humanity, The Revenant is a masterpiece of modern filmmaking. Beautifully scored, iconically shot and at times extremely violent, Iñárritu delivers the visceral experience of survival unlike any other film to date.",9,0,0,24 November 2018
Coriolanus," Torn between pride and duty
","The consummate soldier is lauded for his achievements, but with praise comes new responsibilities that prove more trying than warfare. Based on William Shakespeare's play about a Roman general spurned by those he serves, Coriolanus is a surprisingly well-crafted directorial debut for lead actor Ralph Fiennes. Utilizing the original script while having the plot take place in the modern world may be difficult for some to digest, but at its core this film takes a serious look at the temptations of power.",9,1,3,13 September 2018
Warrior," A family feud settled in the octagon
","While not free of several sports film cliches, Warrior succeeds as a serious drama about two brothers who must reconcile a dark past. The plot is simple but directed with focus, anchored by three strong performances from Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, and Nick Nolte. The fight sequences are decently executed, functioning more to escalate the tension than provide spectacle.",7,0,0,25 May 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A brutal mystery that demands reconciliation
","Two distantly connected outcasts who excel at unearthing secrets are bound by a twist of fate to discover a terrible secret. Masterfully directed by David Fincher and anchored by powerhouse performances from Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig, this film traverses dark territory yet remains undeniably compelling. Part mystery thriller, part family drama, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is truly unforgettable.",9,1,1,27 December 2018
Dunkirk," A stylistic take on history
","The film Dunkirk represents a unique amalgamation of Christopher Nolan's talents as a director. Forsaking his typical character-centric method for a far more technical approach, the production of this film utilized practical effects wherever possible (note the dogfighting scenes). While devoid of any real character development, Nolan's now traditional manipulation of time still manages to maintain a sense of immediacy and tension. Aided by Hans Zimmer's score and a genuine respect for the actual battle, Dunkirk is not Nolan's best work but nonetheless stands as an evocative study of honor and defeat.",7,0,1,3 October 2018
Remember the Titans," Conquering division, on the field and at home
","Despite omitting certain historical details in order to expand its audience, Remember the Titans remains a powerful sports drama. With Denzel Washington as its anchor, the film's cast breathes life into the characters based on the real-life football team from Alexandria, Virginia. The true story is one of integrity, sacrifice, dedication, and ultimately respect; a story the filmmakers managed to honor without compromising its source.",8,0,1,2 July 2018
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," What was old is new again
","Visually stunning and held together by a charming script, the first chapter in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy is an entertaining fantasy adventure. While never consistently reaching the scope and tone of The Lord of the Rings, Jackson's passion to being Middle Earth to life remains strong.",7,1,2,20 June 2018
Zulu," A time of blood and smoke
","With the imposing hills of Africa as its backdrop, Zulu truly immerses its audience. The realities of war are not shied away from, combining powerfully with an honest portrayal of the warriors of both armies. Cy Endfield's direction reflects internally on the nature of warfare and rises above schlocky antics, proving this film a true classic.",8,1,1,7 June 2018
8 Mile," Grinding through life one rhyme at a time
","In this fictional retelling of his own life, rapper Eminem stars at the main character in this gritty drama about pursuing a dream. Combining legendary hip-hop beats, strong performances and a documentary-like look at Detroit, 8 Mile feels genuine and heartfelt. At the same time, this film is symbolic of how the rap game began to change in the 1990s, and how one young man struggled to stand tall amidst the amateurs.",8,4,5,15 September 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Meeting through magic
","Bright, colorful, and youthful, The Sorcerer's Stone is the solid opening all film franchises seek to strike. Balancing its three main characters while immersing the audience in the 'anything is possible' realm of Hogwarts, the result is a charming childhood tale.",7,0,1,25 June 2018
