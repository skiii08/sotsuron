Alien 3," Vastly underrated - a great film in its own right
","I've never really understood why people don't like Alien続, because I think it's a great film - easily as good as anything else David Fincher has turned his hand to. I'll happily concede that the alternative version in the Alien Quadrilogy boxset is superior to the original theatrical cut, so if you're going to watch it, watch that version. It just makes more sense, plot-wise.The first 3 films are all very different films and I suspect that Alien続 is unpopular because people expected a sequel to Aliens - more colonial marines, more wisecracking, more guns. More Newt and Hicks. Alien続 doesn't deliver this. There are no supermen, fewer gags, and no guns at all. Hicks and Newt are shown as corpses in the opening titles. I wouldn't have objected to a bit more Hicks, I'd had my fill of whiny Newt by the end of the scene in the Aliens Directors cut where she screams her head off in her parent's tank. So, hooray for killing off Newt! I like the look of Alien続 - it's dark and gloomy, just as any decent sci-fi/horror crossover film should be. Ripley's companions on this round are for the most part, criminals. It has a decent cast of established British actors in it, who all do a good job of making you care about them as characters - despite the fact they're all rapists and murderers.So, there are no guns, just grubby prisoners in the middle of nowhere. There's also just the one alien, which works well as it restores some of the element of suspense which was so prominent in Alien and almost completely absent in Aliens. Ripley gets impregnated by a super-facehugger and is carrying an alien queen. This is a natural progression in the series, but a good one at that, as we finally get some idea of how it must feel to have an alien growing inside you, from someone who knows it will eventually rip its way out through her chest. From the moment we discover this, we know this film can't have a happy ending (and it doesn't - it led to Alien:Resurrection, which really is a turkey). This also ties up the theme of Ripley and motherhood - we know her daughter died of old age while she was floating out in space. Her 'adopted' daughter Newt dies when they crash land on Fury 161. How sad that her only 'child' turns out to be an alien queen. I thought it was a nice touch that for the first time we are shown that the Alien isn't just a brainless killing machine - it won't kill Ripley because it smells that she has an alien inside her.If I knock off a star, it's because I found the final chase sequences with the doors and the lead works a bit too long. Other than that, I think it's a good film - just not a cheery no-brainer popcorn flick.",9,4,38,19 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Painfully boring
","I really disliked this film. The main reason? It was boring. Terribly terribly boring. Apparently it was 150 minutes, but it felt like 400. Lots happened. Too much happened, really - it was as though they stuck a collection of unrelated possible plots and action sequences into a tombola machine and then pulled several out at random, and glued them together end to end. With so much going on, it should have been exciting and entertaining but was instead, confusing, complicated and not engaging. Ah, if only as many hours had been spent on the script and the plot as were apparently spent on the CGI.The only real 'character' in it this time is Norrington, who is now a bitter ex-Commodore and all the grubbier and more interesting for it - but everyone else from the first film is back, in the same old roles, but with no further character development at all. Come on Hollywood, have you forgotten? We need personalities! It's hard to care about one-dimensional characters.The first film had 2 strong, interesting characters - Jack and Barbosa. This one still has Captain Jack, but he's far less entertaining than he was first time round, does less, says less, has fewer gags and doesn't come across anything like as forcefully as he did in the first film. It's a minor point, but costume wise, he's cleaner, his clothes are less tatty, he's got whiter teeth and very neatly-rolled dreads. Continuity?Other things that grated: Will and Elizabeth were, if possible, even more wooden than last time. The film lacked the humour and originality of the first film, and was almost completely chuckle-free - and any jokes were re-cycled, less-funny versions of jokes from the first film. The gratuitous CGI monsters were a half-human, half-seafood mess and looked ridiculous rather than what was (presumably) supposed to be scary. Why does 'Davy Jones' have a Scottish accent? If they have to give him a regional accent, shouldn't it have been Welsh? :>I probably shouldn't let a throwaway summer blockbuster annoy me so much, but I simply was not entertained by this in the way that I was entertained by the first film. It's a very poor followup.",1,8,16,9 July 2006
Superbad," Only film I have ever walked out of. Terrible.
","I don't think I watched enough of 'Superbad' to be able to review it fairly, if I'm being honest. I lasted until just after the section that recounted Seth's childhood obsession with drawing dicks, and realised 'hey, it's sunny outside, I'm in swingin' London.. I have literally got better things to do than sit here and watch this'. Congratulations to 'Superbad' on being the first film that I have ever walked out of.Big slaps in the face to intelligent media like the Guardian for hyping this up as a rip-roaring comedy. I liked previous Apatow films, but this just wasn't funny. At all. It was incredibly dull, nothing but end-to-end euphemisms for breasts, vaginas and shagging with no actual dialogue inbetween. Not a single laugh was heard in the half-full cinema up to the point where I left. Not one single giggle. Does that sound like a rip-roaring comedy to you? I gather after I left, there was some plot and character development, and it actually got funny, but the first half hour was just too stinky for me to sit through, to get to the better bits. Ah well.",1,77,158,16 September 2007
