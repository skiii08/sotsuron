The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A strong but slightly disappointing lead up to the finale
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay suffered heavily from being Part 1 in a two part film. It was given the task of setting up all of the action to come and that hurt the film both in terms of runtime and overall content. The movie is littered with lots of dialogue between the characters that although is somewhat interesting, but does get a little tiring by the end. On the plus side Jennifer Lawrence's character does get a lot of development throughout the film, but that did create a negative by taking away many chances to have other character develop. In the end the film was very well acted by all involved, but let itself down by having to setup all of the events in Part 2 of the final film.",7,9,28,19 November 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," A fantastic spin on an existing franchise, backed by amazing performances
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a Drama / Mystery Thriller that is a standalone film and a spin off to 2008's Cloverfield. I have not seen Cloverfield but i have heard quite a bit about it since its release 8 years ago. But really, you don't need to know a thing about Cloverfield to see this film. If you have seen Cloverfield then i guess you kinda know what you are dealing with here, but if you haven't seen the film, this spin off is a fantastic standalone film that i can tell you had my full uninterrupted attention. This was a fantastic movie that was intense, dramatic, and had a tinge of humour thrown in there, i was completely engaged and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was very well crafted in many departments and was backed by three absolutely perfect performances. The pacing of this film was pretty much perfect for most of the film, it slowly builds to some big moments and when not much is happening, it keeps you in the film with a clever use of music and a creepy score. There was a 5-10 minute section of the film in the middle that did start to drag but it quickly moved along to some more juicy material. I gotta also note that the dialogue in this film was on point. It is so easy to write cheesy dialogue that is clearly just actors reading off a script, but they managed to have really interesting dialogue so that you completely buy into the conversations they are having. The 3 main characters are also very grounded and fully fleshed out, and that was done amazingly in a short amount of time, getting it out of the way quickly. You really learn to love these characters or love to hate them, and that is because of the great writing in the film. But it is also down to the 3, absolutely fantastic performances leading this film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. were just downright amazing in this film and were 110% committed to their roles. Winstead and Goodman in particular elevated this film so much with their performances, it would not have been anywhere near as good with anyone else. The back and forth between those two made the film so much more intense and dramatic and added a lot of weight to certain parts of the film. The visual style of the film and the cinematography are also something to note because it was beautiful. The way the film was shot in this bunker made every scene a little bit more appealing to watch. It won't be winning any awards but it was a surprising highlight of the film. 8.3/10 So, VERY MINOR spoilers ahead (NOTHING PLOT RELATED)One last thing that i absolutely have to talk about is the amazing way in which this film handled being part of an existing franchise but at the same time being its own thing, and how this could be the beginning of a revolution in filmmaking regarding spinoffs and standalone films. As you may already know, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a spin off from 2008's Cloverfield and unlike other spinoffs it wasn't concerned with trying to connect itself to the universe every 5-10 minutes. It just went and did its own thing, told its own story whilst still being in the same world. Really, if you didn't know it was connected to Cloverfield going in, you won't walk away being confused and left 'out of the loop'. This film very much stands completely on its own and isn't restricted by having to conform to what the previous film set for it. This is the PERFECT way to create new and interesting ideas within a franchise to avoid becoming repetitive to the point where no-one is interested in the franchise anymore. Look at the genre's of these two films for example, Cloverfield was an Action/Adventure/Horror filmed as a found footage film, and this is a Drama/Mystery Thriller that took the franchise in a completely new direction. I still haven't seen Cloverfield but i want to see more standalone films set in this same world to see what they can do to change it up every time. I can only hope that more franchises see the success of this film and introduce similar ideas within their worlds. The only thing i think would stand in the way of this becoming a common sight in Hollywood is if a studio tries it and completely messes it up that will turn off other studios from trying it. But i hope that doesn't happen and we get more films that take a similar approach to this one.",8,3,8,14 March 2016
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A fun and thrilling adventure film that is one of the best of its genre
","I cannot believe i waited so long to see this absolute masterpiece of a film. This film was so much fun to watch from start to finish and that was mainly as a result of a very interesting and engaging plot and an awesome performance by Harrison Ford as Dr Indiana Jones. The overall plot of this film right from the opening sequence got you really invested in the film. It had some interesting twists and turns that managed to take us to many new locations but none of it seemed silly. Harrison Ford is just a master at creating fantastic heroic characters as is seen in Star Wars and he doesn't disappoint in this. Indiana was such a badass, funny and intelligent character that was so entertaining to watch you are cheering for this guy in every scene. What i loved most about this film is how it managed to catch aspects of so many different genres so perfectly. It had awesome action/adventure sequences, some romance, a few scary horror like scenes and bits of comedy to lighten the mood a little. This film had everything and did it so right. Not only did it have everything it was also very well paced, it didn't feel like it slowed down or went too fast at any point.Also, the score in this film by John Williams was so damn incredible that it helped make almost every scene so much better. He has created a score that you can listen to at any time it would still be amazing, something he is so good at. In the end this film was an amazing blend of so many different themes and did everything so right that it is one of the best action/adventure films out there. - 9.2",9,1,2,10 March 2015
John Wick," An intense return to form for both the action genre and Keanu Reeves
","I will start by saying i haven't really been a fan of many strictly action films that have come out in the last 5 - 7 years, until now. John Wick is a mostly well paced action film with many really awesome and intense action sequences that actually really surprised me. This film i feel just revived the action genre, well for me it did. It was so fun to watch while at the same time getting increasingly more interesting the more twists the film took. One thing i also loved was that once the action begins, it doesn't really take many breaks, it just keeps going with fight after fight and not one bit of action felt forced, it all made sense in terms of the plot. Lets talk about the plot, at first this movie seems like your average action film about someone who gets something taken from him and seeks revenge. But that quickly unfolds to reveal more and more secrets about who John Wick is and who the people he is hunting are. The movie felt like to me a perfect mix between 'Taken' and 'Hostel' making for a surprisingly awesome action film. In terms of the performances, i felt that everyone in this film portrayed their characters really well, in a way that felt pretty believable. But the most importantly, this felt like a real comeback to the action genre for Keanu Reeves, he was incredible in this movie, right from the beginning you are really backing his character and are cheering him on right to the end. I believe he can really take over from Liam Neeson and be the new face of badass action if only this film got the attention it deserved. The only issue i felt stood out was that the third act of the film although was still very entertaining and intense felt a little more rushed than the rest of the film. But other than that this film was a very pleasant surprise and restored my faith in the action genre. I love the world they set up in this film and cant wait for the sequel or any other films they decide to set within this world. - 8.1",8,3,7,12 February 2015
Fury," A gritty and horrific take on WWII with intense action sequences
","Fury is yet another film that takes place during the events of WWII and follows a group of soldiers in a tank as they take on an onslaught of German soldiers in an intense and horrific take on this time in history. This film stands out well above many of the other WWII films out there because it tries to depict the horrors of WWII on a much smaller scale. Rather than dealing with large groups of soldiers moving forth and battling over weeks or even months, this movie seems more concentrated as it focuses on only a single group of soldiers over the course of a few days. This very clever take on WWII by David Ayer worked really well as you got to really know a lot about the characters and that got you to really care about them whether you love or hate them. The action sequences also were so intense that you just did not want them to end. He captured the tone of WWII and showed it through the scenery and also the attitudes of the characters, just from the way they act and talk you instantly get an idea of the terror they have experienced. And if it weren't for the performances of the main cast this movie would not have been anywhere near as good as it was. Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, John Bernthal, Logan Lerman, and Michael Pena all equally shine as they provide killer performances as this bunch of soldiers who have to put everything on the line to protect each other and their people. Unfortunately for Brad i don't believe an Oscar nomination is coming his way mainly because as i mentioned everyone was so good in this movie that there was no really stand out role, a very well balanced field of talent. The one thing i wanted more from the film was to maybe see a little of how the war has affected and changed them before the events of this film, we do get some of that from a few characters but seeing a bit of that could have added a little more insight into the motives driving these characters. But in the end Fury is a fantastic film with as very gritty portrayal of WWII and incredibly intense action sequences. - 8.3",8,3,7,5 January 2015
The Babadook," A modern horror masterpiece that many other films can learn from
","The Babadook was hands down one of the best modern horror films that i have ever seen and is also one of the scariest films i have ever experienced. This film is pure evidence that you can still make a horror film without the usual jump scare tactic being used by almost every other film in the horror genre today. The combination of its sound and camera techniques make this film so creepy and unsettling that it really gets you engaged in what is going on. The overall plot of the film felt so fresh that i was amazed that it was something i haven't really seen in a horror movie. Rather than giving you an outright idea of the villain it has you guessing, is it real or is it not, it is the mystery that helps keep you engaged. The incredible film-making and storytelling is accompanied by the absolutely incredible performance by Essie Davis as the mother. Her portrayal of this character is what made this film so engaging and also very frightening, and if this film had gotten a much wider release with more followers we could have even seen her getting a nomination for best actress, but regardless of the award she has really shown the capability of her acting. The only downside i experienced was the ending, i felt that if the movie ended 10 minutes earlier it world have been much better, it was almost too anti-climactic and a way of giving the audience almost a definitive finale. In the end this is a masterpiece of modern horror that a lot of films should look to for inspiration - 8.6",9,3,9,27 December 2014
The Danish Girl," Incredibly well acted and highlights a very emotional transformation
","'The Danish Girl' is a Romance/Drama Biopic that highlights the story of Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener and how their relationship evolves during Lili's transgender transformation. This movie was very emotional, incredibly well acted, fantastically shot and told a very interesting and dramatic story that had me fully engaged pretty much the whole way through. The biggest draw to this film was the inclusion of two of my favourite actors right now, Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. Put one of them in a film and i am most likely going to see it, put both of them in a film and there is no way i'm gonna miss it. Their performances are the real highlights of the film, i feel that Alicia's performance isn't going to be as recognised as Eddie's because he did have a much more complex role and did it amazingly. Redmayne managed to transform into this person to the point where you only saw Lili, it was fantastic to see not only Eddie transform into the character but to also watch Lili's transformation from Einar into her true self. Will Eddie follow up his Oscar win last year with another one? Probably not. But i do see a nomination on the horizon. The big focus of the film was Lili's emotional journey, and her transformation from a Danish painter to the Danish girl. The topics and themes surrounding transgender people are not so widely talked about or represented today, so it was incredibly interesting to see this film represent those themes and how the idea of being transgender differed in the 1930's from the way it is today. I would have liked the film to go a little more into those complications than it did, but seeing some of it play out was somewhat eye-opening and does raise many questions that are still fairly relevant today. I found this journey very engaging and knowing nothing about the story it is based on made for a very unpredictable plot that surprised me on more than one occasion. Where i would say the film was a bit of a let down was where there were times where i felt like i had already seen similar emotional scenes a few times throughout the film. There were a few moments where it didn't feel like the film was going anywhere, and i think all of that was due to the second act being so long. The first act ends rather early and the third act begins fairly late and the second act was pretty long and did have a few repetitive moments. But when you are very invested in the journey of Lili's character, it didn't matter so much in the film overall. So in the end this is a very engaging film with a lot of emotion, great performances, is very well shot, and covers many themes related to being transgender that raises a lot of questions for the viewer. This is a vey 'Oscar Bait' film, it is clearly made to hopefully be a contender at the Oscars, and i feel like it may have tried a little too hard to appeal to that audience and it may have suffered in some other areas. But it is still a film i would recommend if romantic dramas are your thing. - 7.9/10",8,3,10,4 January 2016
Creed," A passing of the baton from Balboa to Creed
","Creed is a film that from the trailers can be looked at as a continuation of the Rocky franchise, but it is actually more of a 'Rebirth' for the franchise and a passing of the baton in a way. My experience with the Rocky franchise is limited to half of the first film and bits and pieces of iconic moments and characters, but missing out on the previous Rocky films will not harm your experience with this film. This is definitely not a 'Rocky movie', it definitely stands on its own and the main focus of the film is Adonis Creed. Of course, being in the same universe and featuring the series' main protagonist does lead to many callbacks to the other Rocky films. Now i didn't know the significance of every reference, but i knew enough to know when they were referring to a past event. But these callbacks (apart from the obvious) are not crucial to the plot and really are just there for die hard fans of the series. The main focus of this film was the journey of Adonis Creed and his rise to hopefully live up to the legacy set by his father with help from Rocky Balboa himself. The story, this journey was incredible to see. There were not too many BIG moments in the film but it really didn't need any because this whole film was a progressive sequence of events that were building up intensity to a big finale. There were many intense training montages and very interesting and emotional storytelling sequences that all tie together the events of the film really really well. There was never a dull moment in its 2 hour runtime and i was glued to the screen and really interested in Adonis' story. He is a very strong minded, likable and determined character who you really get behind and want him to succeed in every way. Michael B Jordan definitely redeemed himself for that Fant4stic disaster that wasn't necessarily his fault, but at least it can't be held against him now. He embodied the role and you really bought his character, wasn't over the top in any way and played a very grounded, realistic character. He conveyed emotion and determination very well and managed to eclipse the presence of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa at times. Having Rocky Balboa in the film and being a mentor and coach for Adonis was a really great aspect of the film that worked in every way. This could have easily been a very forced element where they just threw Rocky in a few scenes occasionally to make sure people know 'Hey come see this film because...... Rocky'. But he really was an integral part of the film and contributed to the plot, bought a slight tad of humour to lighten the mood occasionally and also really emphasis the emotional weight of some of the films key moments. Sylvester Stallone was great in the role, i can't speak for whether it compares to the other Rocky films but you could see that he was a very experienced boxer who has definitely been through a lot in his life. If anything, this film made me WANT to go and see the other Rocky films because even seeing him at this stage in his life was fascinating and i wanted to know more about the character. But despite the big name and the fact that he is so loved by film fans, he did play second fiddle to Michael B Jordan, and i don't think anyone should be mad about that. There was also one incredible moment in the film that was made even more amazing by the camera-work in this scene. There was a fight that was filmed so amazingly i was mesmerised and totally sucked into the scene. The entire fight was filmed with one continuous tracking shot that takes you all around the ring and made you feel like you were literally in the ring with these fighter, truly incredible film work right there. In the end, this was an incredible Boxing film, one of the best if not the best that i have ever seen that if you are a fan of the genre you should definitely see. Fans of the Rocky franchise will love this film for it's callbacks to the other films but as it is a passing of the baton per se, even if you are unfamiliar with the previous films it doesn't lessen the amazing experience you will have with this film. - 9.1",9,25,50,28 November 2015
Spotlight," A very BIG Oscar Contender - Fantastic Acting and Amazing Directing
","'Spotlight' is a Drama/Biopic that tells the true story of the Boston Globe reporting team known as 'Spotlight' and their investigations into the allegations of child abuse in the Catholic Church and how what they uncovered in Boston had a huge affect on the rest of the world. This isn't a topic that people really like to discuss openly and is something that happened fairly recently and is still having an impact on society today. And this film did an amazing job at presenting this story in a way that makes it easy to understand for the audience and keeps it very grounded and real without making it a very uncomfortable thing to watch. It is impossible to tell the story without having to go into some of the horrifying and somewhat confronting details, so the film did great at finding a balance between being too controversial and being too Hollywood. That aside, this movie was very well put together through multiple departments. The acting was fantastic as is expected from a cast of fantastic actors and actresses, Tom McCarthy did an astounding job directing the film rather surprisingly, the writing was exceptional and it really is a big Best Picture contender. The performances in this film were just so damn amazing to see. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Shreiber, Stanley Tucci, and John Slattery all killed it in their roles. This was probably the best ensemble cast of the year as everyone was fully committed and delved deep into their roles to the point where you stop noticing that it is Keaton and Ruffalo. Amongst all the greatness, Mark Ruffalo was still the stand-out performance of the film, watching him act in this film makes me wonder why the guy isn't a bigger actor than he is. It is a shame that most people only think of The Hulk when you mention Ruffalo as he has other roles where he puts in some solid performances. Michael Keaton as always was great, he is one of the best working today so you just know he is going to nail any role you give him. Unfortunately because of the other amazing performances around him he couldn't stand out enough to get a Best Actor nomination but he was very entertaining nonetheless. The directing by Tom McCarthy was a surprise for me after i had looked at his previous work. I was unfamiliar with his 3 earlier films so really all i had to go on was last years 'The Cobbler' and well, it didn't have me really excited to see how he does on this film at all. But after seeing the amazing work he did with this film, it is hard to say that the same guy who directed 'The Cobbler' also directed the Best Picture nominated 'Spotlight'. The way he ties this film together and arranges all of the individual stories going on was very impressive to see. For quite a bit of the film you have the various characters all going off and investigating certain aspects of the case, and to be able to follow each one of their journeys in a way that allows you to keep track of everyone and not get lost is a great achievement. I also like the way he paced the film, there were a couple of moments fairly early on where i felt it could pick up the speed a little, but after 30 minutes in it was smooth sailing. But when much of the scenes involve interviews, meetings and scenes of those sorts it is very difficult to try and cover everything without skipping things or boring people, so well done again. So in the end, Spotlight is just an amazing movie and manages to remain entertaining for the entire 2 hour runtime. It provides you with many of the facts and information regarding the allegations and mixes that in with a very interesting and entertaining story and film. The performances are all great and definitely worth watching just to see these great actors doing what they do best. I love a good biopic and this is definitely one of them so i highly recommend checking it out. Will it win Best Picture? Although my pick is still 'The Revenant' i would have to say this one of the top 3 nominated that actually has a chance.9.1/10",9,2,3,1 February 2016
Black Mass," A gripping, intense Johnny Depp performance
","Black Mass is a Biopic, a Crime Drama, that follows infamous crime lord James 'Whitey' Bulger and his involvement with the FBI during the 70's and 80's that led to him becoming one of the most notorious and violently dangerous mobsters in history. This for me is one of the films that is leading the Oscar race in multiple categories. Maybe not for Best Picture but as of today, this film is a strong contender for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and i reckon even Best Cinematography. It was an incredibly gripping story that was told, it started off a little slow but once it found its feet around 30 minutes in it just got better and better right to the very end. There were occasional moments where it started to look like it wasn't really going anywhere but it quickly gets back on track. It was intense and such an interesting and surreal story that i really knew nothing about. Like i said, there were a couple of moments where it was beginning to lose me a little but there were so many big events packed into this film that if you walked out for even a minute you would miss something. And that just shows a great adaptation of real life events and displaying them in a dramatic way with a very very dark tone that doesn't lighten up at all. But lets talk about the star of the film, the man who elevates this film so much and gets you so engaged in what is going on, the man who is leading the race for the Best Actor Oscar this year...... Johnny Depp. He is such and absolutely talented actor and this is his best performance in a long time and is one of his best ever because he hits it out of the park in this role. Johnny Depp did such a fantastic job at playing this violent, deranged mobster that 10 minutes into the film you completely forget you are watching Johnny Depp. Almost instantly, he completely disappears into the role and then there is no Depp, only James 'Whitey' Bulger. He transformed and became this intimidating monster and he really allowed you to see how so many people at the time would fear him and have nightmares about him. An incredible performance and as of today a strong Oscar contender. But why stop there? If we're giving away Best Actor Nominations, i thing we should give away a Best Supporting Actor Nomination to the amazing Joel Edgerton. He was so great in this film that it is so hard to believe that even with Johnny Depp in the spotlight he manages to shine almost just as brightly. His character was so much more complex than Depp's, he wasn't just crazy, there were so many layers to his character and decisions he has to make and problems he has to overcome that made him an equally interesting character. Just a truly fantastic performance and you cannot help but to be on this guys side for the entire film. Those were the two big guys but then you also had Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Rory Cochrane, and many more all putting on a show. There were so many great performances and they all made for the best parts of the film. The cinematography was also amazing, very well framed shots captured the tones of the scenes exceptionally well. So well that it may be in the running for Best Cinematography at the end of the year, but we'll have to wait and see. Well an intense story that has its ups and downs in conjunction with some of the best performances of the year puts this film in strong contention for some Oscars. - 7.9",8,0,1,8 October 2015
Interstellar," Amazingly beautiful, emotional and compelling
","Firstly, this film to put it simply is beautiful, the visuals in this movie are spectacular and truly amazing at all times. As well as being impressive visually, it is also an emotional story exploring father-daughter relationships that really gets the audience invested in the characters and gets them to really feel what the characters themselves are going through at different stages of this film. Plot wise the film is very strong and compelling right from the very beginning to the final seconds, being a Christopher Nolan film. Now to the negatives because it is not a perfect film, i think one thing that it suffered from was asking a lot of the audience. There are times in this film where lots of information is being thrown at the audience and at times it is almost too much to try to understand what just happened and pay attention to what is happening now. Also I feel that the film was a little too long and around 20 minutes could have been cut out from the middle without losing a whole lot of information. So in the end Interstellar is another fantastically beautiful, emotional and compelling work by Nolan that slightly suffers in runtime and quite a bit of exposition.",9,0,3,15 November 2014
American Sniper," A gripping and tense story of the greatest sniper in US history
","American Sniper is yet another war film that follows the life of Chris Kyle; known as the most deadly sniper in history, both on and off the battlefield. The film is directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle. Right away from hearing this team working on the film you cant help but get a little excited about film. You expect a really good performance from Bradley Cooper and that is exactly what you get. The performance of Cooper is what really makes this film great. He bulked up for the role and is able to play both the loving husband at home and the 'legend' sniper on the battlefield. It was a tough role to fulfill, portraying someone who only recently passed but he did a very good job. The only negative thing about his performance and preventing it from being one of the best may not be too much of his fault, i felt at times that i was watching Bradley Cooper and not Chris Kyle. At some times he really transforms into this other person but at other times i just see Bradley, and that took me out of it a little bit. The story itself was at times intense and at times pretty calm and it did have a good mixture of that. There may have been a few scenarios in the film that you may have seen in other sniper films or war films but not enough to feel like you have seen this movie before. One last thing that i thought of is that there is a smaller plot line involving his brother that seems to all of a sudden disappear at one point in the film, and that just felt like a little bit of a waste to not follow it through to the end. But in the end American Sniper was a pretty good war/ sniper film with an almost great performance by Bradley Cooper. - 7.9",8,10,32,16 January 2015
Southpaw," Another stellar Gyllenhaal performance up against a plot with nothing new
","Southpaw is a Boxing Drama starring one of, if not THE BEST character actors of today Jake Gyllenhaal. Now, boxing dramas have been around forever, and there are a tonne of them, some good and some bad, so this definitely had a lot of competition that it would be constantly compared to. Although it is not the best one we have seen it is definitely better than most. The main draw of this film was the cast, i will see any film that has Jake Gyllenhaal in it regardless of what it was about and you also have Rachel McAdams and Forest Whitaker to back him up so it had the cast in its favour. Where this movie differentiates from other boxing films are the moments away from the ring, because to be honest by now we have seen almost everything that can be shown in boxing films. That is really the only thing i found that let the film down, the fact that it didn't offer anything new made it predictable in that you knew what the main beats were going to be after the 30 minute mark. Although the boxing fights were extremely well choreographed and some of the better fights i have seen in these films it wasn't enough to have me engaged in those sections of the film. This film strives in two particular areas, the performances, and the emotional weight of the film. I will start with talking about the level of emotion that is expressed and explored be these characters over the course of the film. The thing that had me almost completely invested in the film was how Gyllenhaal's character would deal with certain tragedies in his life and evolve throughout the film and how the relationships he had with certain characters would change and affect him. Stuff like this is what surprised me about the film, i realised from the trailer that the more emotional and meaningful moments would play a huge part in the film but i had no idea that it would be one of the best things about it. Watching this man who is forced to overcome set-backs in his personal and professional life for the people he loves was a great story that completely overtook the film for me and helped me really enjoy it. At first it may look like the main plot and the boxing matches would guide the film and the emotional moments would be thrown in here and there, but by the end you realise that it is the emotions being expressed by the characters and the ways they choose to deal with them that take the film from the start to the end. But, this film would be no-where near as good as it was if there was an absence of Jake Gyllenhaal because he stole the film and delivered yet another gripping and intense performance that you can't forget. This man proves again and again why i think he is one of the best character actors to have lived, because you can tell from watching his films the amount of dedication this guy puts into his roles. He is so good that you don't see Jake Gyllenhaal, you don't see the guy from Brokeback Mountain in this film, you see Billy Hope as with all of his other films. Just look at his transition both mentally and physically from last years masterpiece 'Nightcrawler' where he played a weird skinny reporter to this film where he is absolutely ripped and plays an emotionally damaged boxer. The versatility this guys brings to his roles makes his films so much more enjoyable. Look at Donnie Darko, Enemy, Nightcrawler, all very different and all very incredible and we can add this performance to the list now. But thats enough about Gyllenhaal because Forest Whitaker also brings a tonne of emotional depth into the film. He fully commits to his role and just adds another great performance to his list of many. And your supporting cast of Rachel McAdams and surprisingly the young Oona Lawrence were great in mainly assisting in adding to the character of Billy and guiding his journey.But in the end the film is kinda dragged down by a weak and predictable plot but the emotional weight of the film and stellar performances lift it up to become another good boxing drama. - 7",7,0,2,30 August 2015
Ant-Man," A fun, funny, action packed heist film, oh, and a Marvel film
","Ant-Man is the next......... stuff it, you know what is by now, it's a Marvel film, so get up and go see it. This is by far the best origin story of a Marvel superhero so far (Guardians not included), and one of the better Marvel films to date. It did exactly what all or most of the Marvel films seem to do so well and that is the ability to combine action and comedy in a way that provides a near perfect balance of both. Another thing the film makers did amazingly was they made the movie feel like its own individual film and it could stand on its own if you just decided to watch this film without seeing any other Marvel film. Of course, it still had its fair share of winks and surprises, some very obvious and some not so obvious, so you know that this is very much a part of the Marvel universe. Lets talk about the characters in the film, because it is fair to say that those who know nothing about the Marvel comics will have absolutely no idea who any of these characters are, even i was unfamiliar with a few of them. These characters were so fun to watch, both the good and bad, mainly because they were not cliché characters, they all had an introduction and back-story that made them feel like very real people. The other thing that made the characters so great were the actors' performances, Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and even Corey Stoll were fantastic and very convincing in their roles. Even the supporting cast were hilarious and fun to watch and fit into the film really well. As for the plot it really was pretty simple ('Break into a place and steal some stuff'), but at the same time it was very interesting and a fun ride. It wasn't at all predictable and offered enough new elements to make it different from other heist films. It did take a little bit to actually get going and for the main plot to really kick in, but being an origin story where you have to set up these brand new characters it is understandable. So in the end, if you are a fan of the other Marvel films then you already know what you are getting into, it has all of the fun, comedy and action you expect. If you are unfamiliar with the other Marvel films, firstly, where have you been the last 7 years? and second, to sum it up, it is a great Superhero film, a great heist action film, and even a great comedy. - 8.3P.S. And remember there are TWO end credits scenes this time around, so remember to stay right to the very end.",8,12,27,16 July 2015
Nightcrawler," A disturbing yet compelling performance
","Jake Gyllenhaal brings the performance of his career to this disturbing and compelling film that follows Lou Bloom in his quest to become the best at his newfound job no matter what the consequences may be. This film and Gyllenhaal's performance were so mesmerizing that i was completely engaged in this movie for the full 2 hour runtime. Even in the few instances when there was not much happening on screen, i was at the edge of my seat at all times. The supporting cast from Rene Russo to Riz Ahmed also put in strong performances that only added to the overall quality of the film. Gyllenhaal really makes his character one of the most memorable characters of the year, one that stands out from all other films. When people mention Jake Gyllenhaal from now on, this will be the movie i think of first. There is never a dull moment in this very well directed and acted piece of art that i believe may even land Gyllenhaal an Oscar nomination.",10,26,37,5 December 2014
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg delivers another incredible dialogue driven film
","'Bridge of Spies'.. A Drama/Spy Thriller Biopic.. Directed by Steven Spielberg.. Written by the Coen Brothers.. Starring Tom Hanks.. Seriously, this film deserves WAY more love and attention than it got. This film told the story of James Donovan, a lawyer who defended a captured Soviet spy and was then thrown into the middle of the Cold War where he was responsible for organising an exchange: a captured US pilot for a Soviet spy. This was an incredible movie all across the board, Spielberg as usual has done a fantastic job at directing this film and Tom Hanks puts in one of the performances of his career (It seems as though everything he does is 'one of the performances of his career') as they tell this story in the most captivating way possible. One thing you must know about this film and the thing i loved the most about it is that this is, from start to finish, is a dialogue driven film with fantastic visuals to make you feel like you are in East Berlin. You don't get any high stakes action scenes, and no fast paced violent depictions of the Cold War, this is a very focused story about one man and his mission to organise a trade between two opposing governments. And at first it may seem rather boring, you may ask; How are they going to fill 2 hours and 20 minutes with conversations and discussions about a trade for two men in a 'Spy Thriller'? Well by utilising amazing and incredible dialogue, they manage to capture your attention at every moment and you are fully engaged the whole time so that the film goes by really quickly. I cannot express enough, how amazing the dialogue is to be able to carry the film all the way through without needing any big exciting events. The dialogue is so smart that you start picking up on the little hints that tie in to things said an hour prior and start noticing moments of foreshadowing and it only goes to show the amount of attention and thought from the Coen Brothers that went into crafting the dialogue in the film. There are a few scenes in the film where Spielberg creates the feeling of tension extremely well without using any dialogue or little music, just visuals. These relatively quiet moments were so powerful and managed to get the message across without any exposition, that it is another testament to Spielberg's incredibly diverse directing abilities. Tom Hanks was just absolutely amazing in this film as James Donovan. This film showed why he remains as one of my favourite actors of all time. Especially in these dramatic roles, the way he embodies the character and their traits and personality, you never feel like he is just playing the same character over and over. The dialogue alone isn't enough to captivate an audience, you need a top tier actor to put in a stellar performance and make it all seem believable, imagine Adam Sandler delivering the same lines, it simply would not work, and would just turn into a shitty comedy. Tom Hanks it seems can be anyone, need a Captain Phillips? Walt Disney? James Donovan? Hanks is your go-to guy. If i was to pick out anything i think could have been done better i would be nit-picking because it is a variation of minor stuff. But there is a brief moment around a third of the way into the film where there is a shift in the overall focus of the film and i thought it happened a little too quick and would liked to have seen it drawn out a little, but seriously, just a fairly minor thing. So in the end, this is a film you should definitely check out, a Dramatic, Suspenseful Spy Thriller that takes out the big action set-pieces and replaces them with interesting and captivating dialogue delivered by Tom Hanks to perfection.8.2/10",8,0,1,28 December 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Bigger? Check!, Better? Check!, Mission Accomplished
","Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is the fifth instalment in the long running Mission: Impossible franchise and just when you thought they couldn't get any better Tom Cruise returns to prove that he is still one of the best action stars and that this franchise is still one of best in the action genre. But he couldn't do it alone, with the aid of an incredibly strong and entertaining supporting cast, very likable characters and an entertaining plot, this is definitely a must see in the spy thriller genre. When it comes to high octane action set pieces, no-one does it better than Mission Impossible. The absolutely extreme stunts and high speed chases return in full force and take the franchise to new 'heights' and 'depths' (literally) and with Ethan Hunt at the helm, the IMF have a new covert operation on their hands. The stunts and action set pieces in this film are awesome to watch you have your fair share of fast paced shootouts and chases and also your more low-key dangerous stunts, all of which were gripping, intense and had you on the edge of your seat. The fact that realism is mostly out of the question when dealing with these stunts really helps to up the stakes and gives the writers and director more creative freedom to wow us in as many ways as possible. The team from Ghost Protocol has returned in this film and i think it was a great thing to keep Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Ving Rhames together in this film because their chemistry comes through so well in the film and you really get behind these guys. Their characters are always funny when they need to be and badass when required making for some fun, humorous moments that keep the mood very light amidst all of the intense action scenes. The villain of the film i thought was very strong also, 'they' weren't a moustache twirling evil mastermind, they actually had some interesting and mysterious qualities that kept me more engaged in the film. The performances were all incredible and convincing, even from newcomer Rebecca Ferguson as Isla Faust who adds a lot to the film in terms of stunts and especially in terms of plot. Speaking of the plot, i thought it definitely was a very well thought out plot with a lot of pieces and hints throughout that all come together in the finale. It seems to have been very intricately planned out and isn't just one of your throwaway stop the bad guy plots. There are a few organisations and characters that you have to keep track of in order to completely follow where the story is going. And i have to admit, the strength and focus on having this very well thought out story caught me off guard a few times especially towards the beginning and later on towards the end. I went in half expecting to see some mindless action and fun with some form of easy to follow story that tied the whole film together, but i realised fairly early on that it was going to need some concentration. Once i managed to understand what was going on and who exactly the multiple parties going at each other were it all began to make sense and was pretty interesting and entertaining. I am not saying you can't go into this film and watch it just for the fun and action but just be warned that during the story centred scenes and the resolution at the end you will be very lost and maybe even bored. But it's tough to knock this down too much for anything story related as it accomplishes everything a Mission: Impossible film sets out to do; great action and stunts, characters you know and love and a plot to tie it all together. If you are a fan of the franchise, no doubt you have already seen it, but in case you had any doubts, this is definitely a good, fun time at the theatres. - 8/10P.S, I have to say i am incredibly impressed with the action spy thriller genre this year, we have had 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E', now this and 'Spectre' later in the year, all very different and all very great (Spectre excluded).",8,0,3,28 September 2015
Inside Out," A roller-coaster of 'emotions'
","Inside out was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it definitely did not disappoint. This movie was a roller-coaster of emotions the whole way through. It sends you from happy right down to sad and a little teary really quickly and then manages to get you laughing again within a few minutes, and to be able to pull that off is incredible. Lets start with those characters - the emotions, all of the emotions were very funny in their own unique way and seeing them all interact and clash made for many hilarious moments. They were most definitely the highlight of the film and rightfully so take up most of the screen time. I honestly cannot pick a favourite because they were all so different and so damn good. The voice acting performances were just do great and they all sounded exactly the way you think they would just by looking at them. Even when they switch over to the human perspective you still get great characters in the form of Riley, and her mum and dad to keep you entertained. Also the plot was great, it didn't slow down that much at all and was hilariously entertaining, it all made sense and offered many new and original plot points to keep you constantly interested. The only issue i had and a very minor one was that there were a few very short patches where the film was beginning to lose my interest a little but it very quickly got back on track and had me laughing again. In the end this was a fantastic film that has plenty of laughs for both the kids and adults, and also prepare to find yourself getting a little teary throughout the film, as it really is in fact a roller-coaster of emotion. - 9.2",9,9,46,12 June 2015
Dirty Dancing," A good, entertaining romantic drama that even today someone can enjoy
","Dirty Dancing is a movie that was made before my time, and seeing that i am going to the Broadway soon i figured, why not check out the original film first. This was a romantic drama that was actually pretty good, for someone who didn't grow up dreaming about Patrick Swayze i thought this was still a pretty entertaining film. Now the overall plot isn't the most original thing because everyone knows what is going to happen in these movies but it does enough to surprise you and keep you interested. The main way they do this is through the characters, the characters are all so different that right from the get go you know the type of character they are and can see them change over the course of the film. The character chemistry is also really well done especially between Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Their dialogue and the way their relationship evolves throughout the film really holds the film together. Some of the other characters aren't as well setup in the film and only show up when the plot needs them to but you forget about that as you realise they aren't the focus. They both play their respective roles really well and you are at all times convinced that their relationship could be very real.The dance sequences are also some of the highlights of the movie, they really bring a positive and uplifting feel to the film to counter some of the more emotional scenes. And what would be a dance sequence without some music, the soundtrack in this film was great, filled with classic songs that even i knew some of the words to and really get you in a good mood. Where i would say the film gets let down is with its pacing. The movie does move at a pretty steady pace but there are quite a few moments in the middle that kind of drag on a little too much, and although it is for the character development, some of the longer scenes could have been cut down. But in the end this was an enjoyable film, not the greatest romantic drama of its era but definitely a really good one to watch. - 7",7,0,2,28 April 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Anderson's unique directing style makes this film stand out above the rest
","Wes Anderson delivers a film that is presented in one of the most unique ways i have seen especially in modern cinema. Everything from the dialogue to the amazingly unique shooting techniques have been carefully thought out and refined to create this comedic and heart felt film. The acting performances were all very distinct and all very well portrayed by the actors. The standout performances being Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori, one putting in one of the better performances of his career and the other making himself known to the world with this amazing debut to film. This film had a very different and specific style of humor that is not typically used in modern comedies. This both helped to film but i think also slightly hurt it. It did take a little while to understand the humor the director was going for, but once i did it became more clear how it was being used with the overall plot. The plot was an interesting one that takes you back through time and doesn't spend too long in a single location, which really helps to move the film along quickly and provide a variety of scenery. In the end it is the directing techniques used by Wes Anderson that really make this film shine. - 8.3",8,2,4,16 December 2014
Foxcatcher," A slight disappointment that drags on for too long but redeems itself with great acting performances
","Foxcatcher was a movie that i was eager to watch since the very first trailer hit. With a cast of Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, and an almost unrecognizable Steve Carell portraying characters in a true story; it was very hard to turn away from seeing this. After watching it i can say that i was a little disappointed by this film for a number of reasons, but the performances of the actors was not one. All three actors mentioned above gave pretty amazing and very convincing performances that were the driving force making me continue to watch this film with eyes open for the entire runtime, a runtime that went for far too long in thought. When a movie makes me constantly look at the time from just after the half way point that is a sign of the film being too long. The 2 hour and 10 minute runtime would have been more sufficient had there a few more key moments for the film to build up to. But the writing let the film down and didn't get me as invested in the overall plot as i should have been. The finale of the film was one that definitely caught me slightly off guard, and redeemed a little of what i was looking for throughout the film. So in the end Foxcatcher was still a good film with great performances but suffered from a long runtime with unfortunately not too many key events to keep me very interested - 7",7,0,4,2 January 2015
It Follows," This is the stuff of nightmares
","It is indie horror films like 'It Follows' that are the reason why i still have much faith in future of the horror genre. Whenever a film like this comes out where it manages to scare you from start to finish without using jump scares and other modern horror movie clichés i get really excited. This film utilised amazing camera techniques and sounds that alone just absolutely scare the crap out of you just like old, classic horror films used to. I found myself constantly trying to hide from the screen because the imagery was just so damn terrifying. Much of the film uses the idea that someone might be following you at all times to get you to always be in fear no matter what is happening. As well as being a device to scare the living daylights out of you it really helps to keep the story moving and adds to some pretty major plot points. Also there are scenes where this mysterious thing actually shows up and that is just the stuff of nightmares. I felt like a little kid looking up and getting the life scared out of me by anything that looked even remotely weird. In terms of the plot, the film does well to stay away from 95% of predictable moments and that really helps in a horror film so you don't have much time to brace for a huge scary moment (not a jump scare). In terms of performances, i thought they were pretty good all round, with the standout being Maika Monroe who i also remember did a great job in The Guest last year. You always bought into her actions and the way she reacted to certain events which made the film a lot more believable. Where the film let me down was towards the end. The ending sequence of the movie was still pretty damn terrifying but not as terrifying as the rest of the movie, it felt a little cheesy or messy and i was just taken out of the film for a little over 10 minutes. Not only did the ending sequence disappoint me but the very very end didn't work for me, there are quite a few films that do this and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't and this time it didn't. So despite a disappointing ending, this directorial debut for David Robert Mitchell will keep you up for days with endless nightmares. - 8.1",8,56,113,7 May 2015
Legend," Amazing central performance in an average film
","'Legend' is a Crime Thriller Biopic focusing on the lives of twin gangsters Ronald and Reginald Kray at a time where they were large influences in London's East End during the 1950's and 60's. As a crime thriller/gangster film this had many issues but mainly after the 45 minute mark where the tone almost completely flipped and it tried to be a very serious and dramatic retelling. But the biggest highlight for this film and the main reason to maybe check it out is the dual performance by Tom Hardy as both of the Kray twins. This film is a testament to his incredibly diverse acting ability, as he manages to play these two very distinct characters side by side and make the audience look past the actor and see two very different people. Could a Best Actor Nomination be on the way? I don't think so as the year is already pretty stacked with better performances but i wouldn't be against it. The biggest things this film couldn't get right were A) The tone they were going for, and B) What the overall focus of the film was. Firstly, the overall tone of this film was all over the place, it was quite focused in the first 45 minutes apart from 1 or 2 scenes but after that it flips and i kinda lost interest for a lot of the film. The film starts, and it has a pretty quirky tone, there is a blend of some gangster elements and it is introducing the characters, but there is also this very comedic undertone that had me laughing unexpectedly quite a bit. I was really enjoying the film and also confused as i didn't expect a crime thriller to be this funny, and so my hopes for the rest of the film went way up. But then at the 45 minute mark, it seemed as though the person in charge of writing the humour left the film, as that element was completely lost all the way until the credits rolled. I'm not saying it should have been that humorous the whole way through but to go from what it was to just a straight up crime film was quite jarring and i didn't enjoy the film as much as i should. Even after this section where it ditched the comedic tones, it still struggled with whether it was more of a drama or more of a thriller, it never really blended the two together and just jumped back and forth. Maybe this was a flaw, or maybe it was intentional as the film does deal with a paranoid schizophrenic and it did help to keep the film very unpredictable. The other thing was the overall focus of the film. The parts of the film i absolutely loved seeing was definitely the brotherly relationship between Ronald and Reginald. I thought how they interacted together and the way they treated each other at various points throughout the film was very interesting and whenever the film was focusing on them i was completely engaged. But there were times in the film where it felt like the primary focus was with Reginald and the girl he has taken a liking to, i didn't mind that side plot but it would have fit more in moderation. There were times where it started to take over the film and i just wanted to get back to the Krays and so i was getting a little uninterested. The third act also felt quite rushed, there were quite a few moments where the film jumps in time so quickly and it took me a few minutes to realise what the hell was going on.But even though the film seems to be very flawed, there were very interesting dynamics explored with Ronald and Reginald's relationship, and the way the romance in the film occasionally tied in to this main plot i thought was interesting. There were some very interesting moments and events that happen involving the Krays, but i felt like the film didn't give me enough to really understand their influence on London at the time and why they were so notorious. There were hints of it throughout, but despite the characters being interesting, the story itself wasn't as compelling as i wanted it to be.6/10",6,1,3,29 December 2015
Gone Girl," A Dark, Intense and compelling home abduction film
","Gone Girl is a dark and very intense home abduction film that delivers fantastic acting performances all around as well as a fantastic directing job by David Fincher that will go down as his best film to date. From start to end this film did its job in keeping me on the edge of my seat for the entire runtime, something not too many films have done this year. Although i noticed that after the half way point it felt like a different but equally as interesting film that could have been approached differently and would have fit more with the original tone. Rosamund Pike puts in an Oscar worthy performance and leads the race for the award. She is definitely the most interesting and compelling character of the film but still doesn't take too much away from the other great performances. It was a fitting ending i felt for the film although it left me wanting a little more. Despite the slight dip in execution after the half way mark and the slightly rushed ending it didn't affect the overall quality too much as this is still a must watch film for the year of 2014. - 9.3",9,0,6,14 December 2014
The Theory of Everything," An emotional and interesting telling of the life of Stephen Hawking
","The Theory of Everything is an emotional biopic on the life of Stephen Hawking that shows a lot of the struggles that he had to overcome in his tough life. Now initially upon hearing this you may think that it is going to be a much more serious film strictly documenting the key events in life of Stephen Hawking. Now although it does include these events, the film has a large focus on the relationship between himself and Jane and therefore does play out as more of a romantic film like a love story. This is what made the film a lot more engaging and interesting as it really captures the joy in Stephen's life at a time that many people would think was full of pain. The performance of Eddie Redmayne is one of the best of 2014 if not the best as he captures the looks, personality and attributes of Stephen Hawking which has to be one of the toughest roles to portray. He does all this so well that he stands out above the rest and really puts him in the race for Best Actor. The film at times did feel like it was getting a little predictable but that is kind of expected when dealing with a story that is very real and people may be somewhat familiar with. In summary this film was not the greatest film of the year and is certainly not for everyone, but if you enjoy romantic dramas or want to learn more about the life of Stephen Hawking; this may be a film you will enjoy - 7.9",8,1,1,18 January 2015
Room," Beautiful, Emotional, Intense, and Dramatic. A Truly Gripping Story
","*** IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS FILM - DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER AND TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SYNOPSIS' - THE TRAILER ESPECIALLY SPOILS WAY TOO MUCH AND GOING IN AS BLIND AS POSSIBLE IS THE BEST WAY TO EXPERIENCE THIS MOVIE***'Room' is a Drama that focuses on the relationship between a mother and her 5 year old boy as they are trapped within the walls of a single room with no signs of ever getting out. This movie was truly amazing, it was intense, emotional, had a beautiful, unpredictable and gripping story, fantastically written characters backed up by even more incredible performances, and was directed and shot amazingly. The plot of the film was amazing in terms of the events of the film, but where it really shines is when it explores this very interesting and unique relationship between Jack and his Mum, and you get to understand these very fleshed out characters and learn a lot about them. I was completely mesmerised from start to finish and not once was i bored, as the story of these characters is so emotional, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and dramatic that you care for them as if they are real people. Going into this film without seeing the trailer made this film infinitely more enjoyable and surprising. There were sequences that made me feel ways that no other film ever has. I have experienced intense edge of seat moments in films before but there were part(s) of this film where i could feel my heart beating like crazy and no other film had ever done that before. That is really a testament also to the amazing directing by Lenny Abrahamson, i have not seen his other films but the way he captures all of the emotion and all of the drama in such a unique and effective way makes me interested to see what he works on next. The way the film was shot was so confronting that you feel like you are going through everything with these characters, and that you are trapped in this room with them. The performances from both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were absolutely phenomenal. They delivered every line and gave off every emotion so perfectly that it sucks you into the film and it makes everything incredibly grounded, realistic, and personal. Brie Larson was astounding, you could tell her character was very damaged, and you didn't need much of an explanation of what she has been through, simply from the way she talks and acts in certain scenarios you can gather a lot of information about her past, and that shows how amazing she was in this film. But even more surprising was the astounding performance by Jacob Tremblay, this kid is going places, usually you have child actors who show signs of being great but never really make it, but this kid has just put in what is probably my favourite performance from a child actor ever. He commands the screen in every scene and was one of the biggest highlights of the film. But even more astounding was that neither one overshadows the other and both of their amazing performances are front and center the whole time. So overall this is an incredible film, from the directing to the performances, to the plot, everything tied together really well and made for a very gripping, dramatic and intense story. Late in the film it does get a few pacing issues here and there but nothing so substantial as to dampen my overall enjoyment. This is a must see film, and although it will most likely not win Best Picture, i think it is the dark horse in the competition. 9.3/10",9,1,6,29 January 2016
Ex Machina," A smarter sci-fi film that will have you engaged with the amazing characters
","Ex Machina is a Sci-Fi film that focuses on the testing of AI and really explores that idea of creating a conscious machine. What i loved about this film is that it ditched all of the high thrills you usually see in these sci-fi films for a more smart and intelligent approach to the genre. It deals a lot with themes and messages that are directed towards the viewer to get them thinking about the reality / problems with what is happening in relation to the real world. This film did an absolutely amazing job at creating what is really a character driven story, the film progresses as the characters change and interact with each other. It is just mesmerising to see the human characters interacting with the AI as there are many really intelligent moments that get you extremely invested in the story. If even one of the three main characters was poorly written or acted it would have ruined the whole movie because the entire thing is based upon you really liking, disliking or simply understanding the characters and their actions. So in saying that this movie was amazingly written, the characters were fully realised and the plot had enough engaging moments to keep you entertained the entire time. The film was also amazingly shot, the special effects and great camera work add to the unique experience. The performances by all of Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander just completely elevated the film and the characters. You completely forgot that they were actors as they all did fantastic jobs at transforming into their character, they have to be among some of the best performances of 2015 so far. The film gave off a feel of some old, early 70's sci-fi films, one that came to mind was 2001: A Space Odyssey from 1968. It had that classic feel sci-fi but with a very smart plot and characters, and also a light touch of some horror elements. Where i thought the film could have been a little better is in the beginning i thought it was a little too vague as to what was going on, you do get some back-story on why these characters are here and what for but i was a tiny bit confused early on. Also the ending sequence i thought really worked for the characters, you get to see how events throughout the film had affected them and the results of these affects but for the plot it didn't really feel like the rest of the film, it moved at a much quicker pace compared to the overall slow pace of the film. And they may have been going for a more high risk and eventful finale but it could have been executed a little better from a directing standpoint. In the end despite a few very minor nitpicks this film is one of the smartest sci-fi films in existence and if you are a fan of the genre you must check this out, with great characters and great story you are in for one hell of a ride. - 9.1",9,4,13,14 May 2015
Magic Mike XXL," Just some light-hearted fun and comedy, oh, and strippers
","When you review movies, there is occasionally that film that comes along that is not marketed to you at all, doesn't appeal to you at all, yet you still decide to sit through it and hopefully come out on the other end awake at least; this, was that film. This film was not made for me and i was not interested in the film, so before deciding to check this out i genuinely thought i was going to hate this film, but after watching it, there was just something about it that made this movie a surprisingly enjoyable one. I gotta say it; i actually enjoyed Magic Mike XXL. For the most part it is just a fun movie with a good amount of comedy and likable characters that happens to be about strippers. The film struggles with pacing during the second act but i would say the fun light-hearted tones during the first and third acts made up for it. I did not see the first Magic Mike so i was being introduced to these characters for the first time in this film and i gotta say, the film-makers did a great job at quickly introducing or re-introducing these characters in a way that gave me a quick overview of their personality and allowed the film to just move on. This really helped me get behind these characters' actions throughout the film, well for most of the film.The first 40 minutes of this movie i really enjoyed, it felt like a road trip film with a group of guys who had good chemistry and it was really funny. The film wasn't taking itself seriously, it knew it was just here to entertain its target audience so it had fun with setting up surprisingly very well choreographed 'dance' scenes that not only appealed to the female audience but i thought was some pretty good comedy that got me laughing quite a bit. Everyone played their part in making this section entertaining, Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, and Gabriel Iglesias were the drivers of this comedy and were putting in good performances. I won't spoil anything but at a certain moment an event happens and in a heartbeat the film just flipped its overall tone and just lost me. It ditched the light-hearted, careless fun tone and the fast pace for a more slow, plot driven, and i guess meaningful tone. It was almost like one guy wanted a fun comedic film and someone wanted a serious stripper film so rather than picking one, they went with both and split it down the middle. And for the next 45 minutes i was just barely hanging in there with the hope that it would go back to what was good in the first act. But despite the very slow and quite uninteresting middle portion of the film, the relatively short third act bought back some of the fun from the first act and some 'interesting' dance routines that actually helped the film finish off kinda strong despite the vent end going by really quickly. This is one of the surprises of the year, i never thought i would come out of a film about male strippers saying that i actually somewhat enjoyed it, but i really did. If you are a female then yes you will most definitely like this movie i don't need to tell you that, otherwise if you are not, you probably won't, but there is some fun to be had if you don't focus on the fact that you are watching a movie about almost naked men dancing. - 5.8",6,0,1,17 September 2015

I felt that this movie had a perfect blend of action, comedy and emotional moments that really work with each other and make the movie very entertaining at all times. At no point during this movie did i feel that i had seen the same thing before, as it was unpredictable and clever as a result of good writing.The animation is as usual amazing and beautiful just to look at. The characters in this movie were definitely the highlights, especially Baymax. Not only did each of the main cast have their own unique and entertaining personality but when they were together their chemistry made for many very hilarious moments.

This film showed not only how Alan was contributing to the government but also gives some insight into his personal life which was a surprisingly very interesting one and worked well with the film. That is what this film did the best, it really captured all of the best and worst things about Alan and portrayed him as something of an unlikely hero. The film would not have been able to capture Alan the way it did without a brilliant and even Oscar worthy performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. He did an amazing job portraying all of the things that made Alan so likable but also so difficult and he really stole the entire film, and made me see Alan and not Benedict. As well as him, the supporting cast also had some pretty solid performances, most notably Keira Knightley who was better than i had initially expected. The overall film was very interesting and gave some insight into a side of WWII that more people should know of and research. The film is very interesting, and dramatic with very good performances making it that much better. - 9",9,1,6,8 January 2015
Jurassic World," The sequel we deserve, as Jurassic World takes the franchise back to its roots
","Jurassic World was to put it simply; AWESOME!!! It was the sequel to Jurassic Park that we deserved, and after all this time we finally got it with this film. This film did somehow managed to capture all of the tones that were set by the first film, the thriller aspects were there, the horror, the fun, and the comedy were all present, making it a thrilling ride the whole way through. Chris Pratt was the one mainly bringing the comedic elements that the first film had and he was such a great character. As well as Pratt, the performances across the board were all great from Ty Simpkins to Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio they were all very convincing and you could see the fear in their faces the whole time. That fear of course was of the dinosaurs, and they come out in full force and are terrifying, giving you goosebumps every time they show up, from the velociraptors to the brand new guy they were all amazing. The CGI and light touch of practical effects were incredible and really made you seem like you were looking at the real thing.In terms of the plot i was really impressed, it didn't go all dumb like in Jurassic Park 3 and was very interesting and suspenseful. It manages to keep you thoroughly entertained for the entire duration offering enough new elements to be fresh while also keeping what made the original so great. There was a subplot involving Vincent D'Onofrio's character that is constantly hinted at throughout the entire film, and for most of the film it felt very out of place. The homages to the first film made me enjoy it a lot more and gave me goosebumps whenever something is referenced. From the very familiar soundtrack to some............ other things it really made this feel like a true Jurassic Park sequel. In the end this was a fantastic film and if you loved the first one you will also love this one, it doesn't quite reach the level the first one did but it blew 2 and 3 out of the water making this the real sequel. - 8.8",9,35,101,12 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A fun, comedic and action packed film that lived up to all expectations
","Avengers Age of Ultron was one of the biggest and most anticipated movies of the year and it did not disappoint. This movie was everything you want an avengers movie to be, a near perfect blend between Action, Comedy, and character development. I felt that they handled the large cast fairly well with each of the avengers getting a good amount of screen time. But it isn't just the individual characters that makes it so entertaining, it is the chemistry between the characters that works so well. All of the subplots and jokes that they carry throughout the film stay interesting and really elevate the film. The comedy is exactly what you expect from an avengers film, the back and forth jokes work to really lighten the mood and give it that Marvel film feel, even Ultron sneaks a few jokes in a couple of times.Now let's talk about the action, this film had plenty of action sequences from start to finish and they are just so fun and exciting and you are on the edge of your seat at all times. The way the film finds ways to capture all these characters fighting at the same time in a way so that you can see everything that happens is amazing. Ultron was definitely an awesome villain and maybe the strongest and best villain the Marvel universe has seen so far. He is so evil that when he is on screen you feel his presence and how intimidating he is. He really adds a lot to the plot and makes the film so much more entertaining in both the action scenes and plot driven scenes. Speaking of the plot, the subplots I thought all worked really well and the main plot for the most part was really interesting. I just thought that the first half of the film felt a little messy as it tried to setup Ultron and some other characters while trying to still include the characters we have known so far. The jumping between locations and all that could have been refined a little better, but they did what they had to do within the runtime. But that is the only issue I had with the film and a minor one at that. Everything else gelled together so well and created one of the best (and my favourite) movies of the year so far. If you love Marvel films and action films in general I believe you will love this fun, action packed film. - 9.5",9,37,77,22 April 2015
Everest," Get through the disappointing first hour and you get an INTENSE and DRAMATIC movie
","Everest is an Adventure/Drama film based on the incredible true story of pain and survival where a group of climbers in 1996 attempt to reach the top of Mount Everest but are hit with complications that test their will to survive. I was looking forward to this film for a few reasons, mainly because of the incredible cast, the intense drama, the 'Biopic' label, and Jake Gyllenhaal. And in the end, these were the things that i loved the most but it wasn't enough to make this a memorable film due to a narrative that really doesn't deliver and let the film down a lot.I will start with the performances because this was a very stacked cast with a lot of quality actors and actresses. So it runs the risk of having too many people to focus on resulting in no-one getting enough time to shine. But they handle it really well for the most part, Josh Brolin and Jason Clarke have a lot to do in the film and they put on great performances and carry most of the scenes they are in. They did a great job at capturing the fear and pain these people would have been going through and conveyed it really well. Also i have to say, in the limited amount of screen time they got, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keira Knightly, Sam Worthington and John Hawkes also did a great job. All of these actors added to the emotion really well, they added to the drama and tension you feel later on in the film and were great supporting roles. It still needed more Gyllenhaal because, well, the more the better but for what he was given he did a really really good and convincing job. In terms of the characters, i thought they were mostly really well handled, towards the end you end up getting a good idea of who most people are by name and face, but for the first hour you really only remember like 3-4 characters and everyone else up to that point was just there for a line or two occasionally. The film had a lot of intense drama and some really tense moments that have you holding your breath for minutes at a time. The film makers did a great job at capturing the scope and size of Everest and really showing the amount of dangers they have to avoid. The cinematography is astounding, the wide shots of them climbing the mountain were great, the large shots aiming down an endless pit were freaky especially if you hate heights. And the very close up dramatic scenes during the storm were filmed so great that you start to feel cold as you feel like you are right there suffering with them. The last 45 minutes to an hour especially were just insane. It was gripping, intense, dramatic and especially emotional and if it was like that for the entirety of the film i would have liked it a lot better. Emotion really did play a big part in the film, most notably in that last 45 minutes, but no emotion would be felt if they didn't introduce us to these characters in a way so that we cared about them. And that is why the first 20 minutes of this film were very valuable in having events later on pay off. They introduce these characters and have you really get behind their goals so that when they go through something bad, you feel it, same for when something good happens. But after saying all that the film was still a let down. This movie was 2 hours in length and i have to say, half way through this movie, i thought it had already been 2 hours. After they get most of the characters introduced in the first 20 or so minutes, the next 40 minutes really had almost no substance whatsoever. It was moving really slowly and you get a lot of them just preparing for the climb and then sections of the initial parts of their journey. It was wearing down the film a tonne and if it wasn't for the brief moments focusing on the development of the characters i may have just given up on the film then and there. It looked like it was really struggling that whole time to find something good to focus on and i was hoping it found something quick. A lot of that i felt should have been compressed down to like 20 minutes and it would have moved on much quicker and not left as big a mark on the film. In the end, Everest was a bit of a let down, we did get great performances all across the board from all of the actors. The characters were well introduced and some of them were very well developed which gave the last 45 minutes of the film a lot of emotional impact. the last 45 minutes was intense, and dramatic and made for some very engaging moments. But despite all of that, the overall narrative i felt was weak especially in the first hour, nothing much was happening of interest and apart from very few individual moments it was moving too slow and not really focusing on anything interesting. If you can get through to the last 45 minutes to an hour you will end up enjoying it as it does make up for the film's earlier issues. - 6.3",6,1,2,25 October 2015
Love & Mercy," A fascinating look into the life of Brian Wilson with incredible performances.
","'Love and Mercy' is a Biopic that doesn't really focus of the 'Beach Boys' and their music, rather it is a very personal story that explores the life of Brian Wilson from some of the highest points in his life right down to some of the lowest. I knew nothing about the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson except for their biggest hits but man i can't deny that i am really interested to find out more about Brian. This film really goes to places i never thought it would upon hearing about it, it does have its fun light- hearted moments but the majority of this film is really about the personal struggles of Brian Wilson and how he had to overcome these obstacles in his life. The film has an interesting structure, rather than focusing on a specific time in his life and showing how he changed progressively, the film follows a younger Brian played by Paul Dano and a post Beach Boys Brian played by John Cusack. This odd structure of highlighting these two times in his life concurrently throughout the film allowed the writers and director to get creative with the way they represented Brian in both times and how they ultimately depicted his transition without showing what happens in between. On a personal level, and in terms of the way they represented and depicted Brian in these two stages of his life and connected them this film was incredible. But from a storytelling perspective, it was a little off. The two times were shown in a way that made them feel like a series of events in Brian's life rather than a flowing story. The way it switched back and forth with all the jumps in time worked to show off Brian's story and quickly develop his character but as a cohesive start to finish story, especially with the younger Brian, it didn't work as well as i would have liked. As the film progressed, this structure of swapping between the older and younger Brian worked more and more but initially for the first 20 minutes it felt a little choppy and hard to get used to. If i go back now after having more experience with that structure it may work better, but just a minor thing.Oh, the performances in this film were just unbelievable. From Paul Dano and John Cusack playing different versions of Brian, to Elizabeth Banks as Melinda and Paul Giamatti as Eugene Landy they were all incredible, powerful and amazing performances. One of the more fascinating things was how Paul Dano and John Cusack managed to somehow play what are essentially these two different characters in a way that you still saw elements of Brian's younger self in his older self and vice versa. It really was great to see, but seriously already, when is Paul Dano going to get some Oscar recognition? This guy is a fantastic versatile actor, from Prisoners to this he really is shaping up to be an incredible dramatic actor and i only improving over time. Elizabeth Banks also puts in a very very emotionally driven performance and in her limited screen time still made her presence felt. But what may have been the most powerful performance in the film was Paul Giamatti as Eugene Landy. I don't know how this guy does it, he literally transforms into this character and where at first you go 'Hey, thats Paul Giamatti'', by the end of the film you completely forgot it was even him. You can draw many parallels between his character in this film and his role in 'Straight Outta Compton' and that is a really good thing as both performances are ones to remember from this year. Don't worry, even though the main focus on the film is almost exclusively on Brian Williams, you do get to see some of the behind the scenes of making some of the Beach Boys' biggest hits. Their music accompanies the film so well and they really did have a song that fit the tone of the film at all moments throughout. So in the end, if you are a fan of Brian Williams and the Beach Boys and you know the story i am sure you will get a good kick out of the film. If not, i would still recommend you check it out because it gives you very interesting insight into the troubled life of Brian Williams and shows off his character really well supported by great performances. - 7",7,2,3,29 November 2015
Sicario," Fantastic performances, and Villenueve directs another great film
","'In Mexico SICARIO means Hit-man''Sicario' is an Action Thriller / Crime Drama that follows an FBI agent who gets thrown into a war against the drug cartels operating along the border of the US and Mexico. Apart from the stellar cast leading the film, i was most excited to see this film because of it being directed by Denis Villenueve. For those of you who don't know, he directed 2013's 'Prisoners' and 2014's 'Enemy', both are incredibly fantastic films that were directed to near perfection and you should definitely check out. This was still a fantastically directed film by Villenueve, but compared to those films i just mentioned, this one has many other flaws that didn't make it quite as intense as i hoped it would be from seeing the trailers. If you are looking for a fast paced, high octane action thriller, this is not it. Much like his previous films, this is a very character driven story where the film at times is carried on the backs of the amazing performances by Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro. Despite these praises, there are elements of the film that i didn't enjoy and harmed my overall experience with the film. The film started off very promising, it showed off some some of the thriller elements whilst also introducing our characters and the main overall plot of the film which was pretty meh up until the last third of the film. I was initially intrigued by what was going on and wanted to find out more about what is really going on behind the scenes, especially with Del Toro's character. But for almost the entire second act of the film, i found myself checking my phone a few times because it dragged on and on and didn't look to be ending any time soon. It had some short moments that were quite interesting in terms of character development and getting me a little more interested in the plot. But overall, the second act wasn't all that compelling to watch like the rest of the film was. I feel like they tried to do a lot to set up the finale, and just the way it was structured became an issue for me. A lot of scenes didn't quite make sense and took me out of it a bit. It all ran at a fairly slow pace which i was expecting but there were no dramatic or intense tones to get me engaged with what was going on, apart from one or two moments. A lot of this middle section relied purely on the performances of Blunt, Brolin, and Del Toro, and even though they were fantastic it wasn't enough to make me enjoy this section. It's hard to explain, but just a lot of the writing in this section looks and sounds good on paper, but the execution wasn't great. That being said, the last 30 minutes of this movie....... SPECTACULAR. Not going to give anything away but it all hits the fan from a storytelling standpoint, a character standpoint and an action thriller standpoint and this really saved the film for me. All of the little bits and pieces that were set up throughout the film come full circle and you realise a lot of things that maybe didn't make sense earlier make total sense now, such as 'why is the film even called Sicario?....... **You know what, stuff this, i'm gonna revoke some of the things i have mentioned so far MID REVIEW but not edit it out, because thinking about the end, and then thinking about what happened earlier is making me realise that this film was a lot smarter and well crafted than i thought it was 5 minutes ago. I obviously can't talk about any of the things i am thinking about, but this is probably going to make me watch it again like i did with 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy', and i reckon i might enjoy it more the second time, only time will tell. But as i mentioned before, the performances of Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro were all absolutely fantastic. I am not necessarily surprised because they are all incredible actors but in this film when they came together no-one took anything away from the others' performances. One did stand out well above the others but it didn't make me love the other performances less, if anything each performance added to the others. There is also quite a bit of talent in the supporting roles but due to the scope of these three large actors always commanding the screen they will most likely go largely unnoticed. In the end, Sicario is a film that definitely not everyone will appreciate. It is more than an action thriller and incorporates great amounts of drama, and plenty of intense moments. The second act of the film whilst watching it did really hurt my enjoyment of the film in the moment, but as i mentioned, it didn't bother me nearly as much and i actually now praise some of the decisions they made. If you like Villenueve's previous films this one is not quite up to par but you can still see a lot of his signature all over this film and that is what i enjoyed about it. - 7.2",7,2,4,24 December 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," An aca-awesome sequel that doesn't quite live up to its predecessor
","I really enjoyed the first Pitch Perfect, the music was all great and it was just a very fun and enjoyable film to watch, so this film did have quite a bit to live up to, and although it may not have quite reached the level of its predecessor it was still a pretty fun film. This movie included everything you would expect Pitch Perfect 2 to include, great songs, aca-exciting music battles, pretty funny humour and all accompanied by a story that you can kinda get behind, so pretty much what you saw in the first film. And being similar to the first film kinda hurt the film a little bit but it also ensured that we got what we wanted from this sequel whilst also giving us some new additions. The songs in this film really are fun and great to sing along to but i do prefer the songs in the first film just a little more, maybe because i've heard them a lot since first seeing the film. Some song choices were..... interesting, but i understand they needed some variety in there. And a lot of that variety came from the German additions to the film who from the first moment you can tell are an A Capella powerhouse, unfortunately they didn't really factor in to the plot as much as i would have liked, instead they are more just there to perform and leave. And those big performances really are the highlight of the film just as they were in the original, not much changed in the setup from the first one with the always hilarious judges finding a way to make an appearance, but they really are the big wow moments. The humour in this film worked almost just as well as the first film but i felt that quite a bit of it was slightly recycled, still focusing on the stereotypes introduced in the first film. Some was new and got me laughing but some was obviously rehashing what was already done. The low point of the film had to be the overall plot, it had the same problems the first one had, i again found myself not quite enjoying some parts then mack to enjoying it and then not enjoying it a little, it was just a tad inconsistent. Some of the subplots i felt were just thrown in there to bring back characters from the first film, but they did factor in to the plot sometimes so that was OK. But in the end this is a musical, and the reason why i wanted to see this film and you want to see this film is for the music (and Anna Kendrick) and the music is aca-awesome and will make for a great soundtrack. - 7",7,6,12,30 May 2015
Whiplash," An intense and mesmerizing masterpiece
","Whiplash was the most intense and exhilarating movie experience that i had throughout all of 2014. This movie did not slow down a single bit as it told the gripping and mesmerizing story of a boy striving to be the best jazz drummer in the world with the assistance of one of the most hilarious and memorable characters of the year. J. K. Simmons put in the best performance of his career and the most exciting and exhilarating performance of the year as this very talented and at time frightening jazz instructor. As a supporting actor whenever he was on screen i was in awe at just how compelling his character was, sometimes you are afraid of him and other times you can't take your eyes off how spectacular he is at what he does. Miles Teller also killed it in his performance as the boy who had a single goal in life and blew me away with the level of his talent. The back and forth chemistry between these two fantastic actors made for the best highlights of the movie. There were hilarious moments, scary moments and even emotional moments as the movie explores how their relationship evolves over time in ways that you would not have initially expected. This film does a lot to surprise you and gave some of the most memorable moments of the year. And just as it starts off strong it finishes even stronger with one of the most intense and inspiring finales in recent years. This movie was such a great experience that it is one of the best films of the year, with some of the best performances seen in 2014. - 9.7",10,1,3,6 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The epic and emotional conclusion to Peter Jackson's Middle Earth
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the finale in the trilogy of Hobbit films and most likely Peter Jacksons final visit to Middle Earth, and boy does he go out with a bang. The film picks up from where The Desolation of Smaug ended and from that moment you know that this film is going for all out action. Over half of this films runtime is filled with what we loved the most from the Lord of the Rings trilogy; the battles. The fast pace and epic battles are what make this film so brilliant. From the enormous size of a single dragon to the epic spectacle of thousands of warriors all going against each other, this war of The Lonely Mountain was the real star of the film. And in saying this it leads to one of the minor downsides of the film, and that is that for the first half of the film Bilbo Baggins aka 'The Hobbit' is almost like a supporting character to many others. It is a minor detail but he didn't get enough screen time i felt over the course of the whole film. Despite the screen time he had, he still received a lot of character development, and along with Thorin were the only two characters who really developed throughout the film. Even though this film was shorter then the previous two hobbit films i do feel that around 20 minutes could have been cut out in the middle of the film where the pace noticeably slowed down to keep with the fast pace of the film. But these issues didn't take too much away from my enjoyment of the film as the fast paced epic battles along with the ties to The Lord of the Rings give a fitting conclusion to this trilogy of films. - 8.8",9,3,7,25 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An ambitious film about Broadway, life and relationships
","Birdman was one of the most ambitious films of the year and Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu managed to pull off this very unique film about a former movie star trying to get back in the spotlight through a Broadway film. At first that is what it seems it is going to focus on but it does touch on more deeper meanings involving his family and his relationships with himself and those around him. Michael Keaton was definitely the best part of the film, he portrayed Riggan so well that i began to believe that this could have actually been a real person. He showed so much passion in playing this character that you really get sucked in to his amazing performance. The supporting cast i felt also did a pretty good job but did not shine as brightly as Keaton. Another highlight from the film has to be the ingenious and mesmerising method used to film it. The one-shot sweeping camera technique used gave this film a very different feel than many other films and really let you follow these characters and get to see them in all different environments without all of the jarring cuts. The performances as well as shooting technique are what make this film what it is. But that was still not enough for me to absolutely love this movie, the overall tone of the film didn't really work for me, i understood why they went for a dark and comedic yet also dramatic tone as there were some sections that i really enjoyed but for the most part i couldn't really enjoy the entire film as much as i wanted to. Despite not being able to really enjoy this film as much as i had hoped, i still got to see one of the performances of the year in one of the more different films of 2014, if you are an admirer of some different, quality film this may be the film for you - 7.6",7,1,7,15 January 2015
The Big Short," Well...... That was disappointing......
","'The Big Short', nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay.... and i have just one question. Why? I thought the trailer looked pretty good, it was about a somewhat interesting topic that i knew jack about, but with big names attached and a very positive response, i was expecting more, a lot more. This is not going to be a popular opinion as clearly lots of people love this movie, but i must have missed something, or lots of things as for a good 50% of this film i was bored out of my mind. This was a Drama/Biopic focusing on a very serious and from what i gathered very complex topic revolving around the collapse of the economy, bank stuff, the housing market, and a tonne of other stuff i have no idea about. So it had an uphill task from the beginning, trying to get me interested in the film for 2 hours. And in the end, it only managed to do that for about half of the film. I thought the acting was definitely a positive from everyone, the flicker of humour was well implemented and some unique or interesting choices made in the editing of the film had me really enjoying it at some moments. But everything else..... yeh not so great.The film started out rather engaging, being introduced to all these various characters was fun. It had a serious yet slightly quirky tone, and i gotta say it was great that they kept that tone consistent the whole way through. I was following what was going on, and it was going at a nice calm pace allowing me to pick up most things and piece things together. The film at this point was very interesting and entertaining and had pleasantly surprised me with the editing choices made so far. And that lasted for about an hour, then it just kept going, and going, and i began to lose interest fast, to the point where 20 minutes later i just wanted this thing to be over. I was barely following what was going on with all these numbers and who all these people were and their connections to the story, and it severely hurt my enjoyment of the film. The film even tries to carry people along by stopping the film to have various famous faces explain some of the concepts and banking terms being used. Now although i found these moments surprising and rather fun to watch, i was still just as lost afterwards as i was before. All of this may just be my inability to understand what was going on, or the story maybe was presented in a shitty incomprehensible manner with terrible writing. I'm not right and i'm not wrong.The acting all across the board was really good, Steve Carrell did a great job as whoever he was, Ryan Gosling put in a strong performance, Brad Pitt was good i guess, and Christian Bale did a great job also and was probably the best of the bunch. They definitely committed to their roles and each one of their personalities felt different and their characters at times had some very interesting dialogue and things to say. But their performances just couldn't get me invested in what was going on. The humour was well delivered, i laughed a few times, and it was a pretty nice blend of humour into this very serious topic and breathed a bit of fresh air into the film. But for me, after that half way point i just couldn't appreciate any of that stuff anymore because i was so bored from my lack of interest in what was going on. I am not saying this is a god awful movie, and i'm definitely not saying that it doesn't deserve to be nominated for all of those Academy Awards, but if it was up to me, Terminator Genisys would be up for Best Picture before i even consider this.So if you really want to see this film, go right ahead, you will probably get something out of it that i most certainly did not. If you end up agreeing with me that's great, if you end up completely disagreeing with me then that's even better.4.8/10",5,4,10,15 January 2016
The Water Diviner," An emotional journey to find the lost sons of a man who has lost everything
","This directorial debut from Russell Crowe is an emotional tale of a fathers journey to find his lost sons that is full of love and hope. This movie, for a first time director was mostly well directed and very beautifully shot. The cinematography really engages you in the film both during and away from the action, it adds to the quality and overall enjoyment of the film. Russell Crowe's performance was as always just amazing, he really put a lot of emotion into his character and that showed through his endless efforts to not give up on a promise he made to his wife. The longer this movie goes on the more you realise that this is not only about a search for his sons but a movie showing the determination of an individual who has lost everything and will not lose any more. Apart from Russell the other performances were also well done, mainly by both Olga Kurylenko and Jai Courtney but they never really stood out too much. One issue i had is that the first third of the film during Russell's introduction to Istanbul, spent too much time focusing on establishing the supporting characters, i wanted it to move on to the main plot rather than spending more time there. Some of his other visits to this location felt more meaningful and interesting, if only they had shortened his initial visit. Also there were some co- incidences that i didn't really buy into during his time in Gallipoli and a potential romance that was pretty predictable right from the beginning, small issues, nothing major. Russell Crowe's directorial debut, despite some minor flaws, was an emotional and at times intense film that hopefully gets recognised outside of Australia. - 7.6P.S - If you don't tear up towards the end of the film, well then you have no soul.",7,3,13,24 February 2015
Back to the Future Part II," Everything you love about Part 1 but bigger!!
","Next up in my series of BTTF reviews is Back to the Future Part II, the film that wowed everyone with a glimpse at what the future could possibly look like, and although it is clearly nothing like it was envisioned in 1989 it is still very interesting to see the 'future that could have been' come to life on screen. Back to the Future Part II did what all sequels should do, it was larger in scale, it took bigger risks and it took the series to a whole new dimension by really focusing on the use of time travel. Now although it was bigger and the timelines got a whole lot more complex, topping the first film was nearly impossible but they tried their hardest and it payed off, making this film also an instant classic. Like its predecessor, this was also an endlessly entertaining film, still capturing the same humour that the first film did so well it manages to make you laugh consistently throughout. The characters of Doc and Marty again have great comedic timing and their chemistry is like no other film and it adds to the realism of these characters relationship. Whilst also maintaining that comedic aspect, the film also does spend quite a bit of time getting pretty serious and developing the plot for later in the film and for Part 3. This film had the daunting task of having to top the first one, and how do you do that? Rather than going 30 years in the past they decided to go 30 years into the future. But why stop there? lets go 30 years into the future then 30 years into the past in another timeline and then 30 years into the past again just to mess with people. Although there was a lot of jumping between timelines in this film it managed to hold itself together very well without seeming like it was moving too fast. As expected, with all of these time jumps, the timeline of events is going to get a little more confusing, but the film i thought did a pretty great job at keeping audiences informed as to what was going on. There were a few exposition scenes that were a little too 'heavy' on information that could have been spread out a little. Having just watched it for like the 10th time, it all makes sense to me but for a first time watcher it may take another viewing to fully grasp the timeline changes. A very minor thing in a film that still does time travel better than 98% of time travel films out there. One of the things that this film is remembered for is its visualisation of the future. Seeing all of these technological advancements in terms of cars, and clothes, and shoes, and hover-boards was incredibly mind-blowing for me when i watched it so you could imagine how it must have been for an audience that was even further away from that possible reality. It was a very interesting contrast with other more dirty dystopian futures you see in most sci-fi films, the cleaner, brighter look made it so much more memorable. Like i said, they are the scenes everyone remembers, the hover-board chase scene is an iconic action sequence that will never be forgotten, the sequence in Marty's future house was amazing seeing all of the small but significant advances in technology that people would only dream of. Many people often forget that the film also does represent the future in a very dystopian environment, and i thought in its own way, that was a very interesting juxtaposition to put in this film. Although it wasn't as fun and lively as seeing the cleaner future it was definitely interesting to see how greed and a money driven future would look like. Looking back on it now, i would say that the Dystopian representation of the future isn't any more far off than the Cleaner, more technologically advanced one, just saying. But one of the most impressive sequences for me was when Marty and Doc travel back to 1955, the setting of the first film, and have to go around this time period whilst avoiding their other selfs from the first film. This is what really wowed me in terms of the incredible film-making and visual effects that were used in order to make it look like they had actually travelled into the setting of the first film without compromising what the first film set up. The shots were placed perfectly and the use of footage from the first film in combination of recreations of scenes from the first film from different angles was incredible, and for a film released in 1989 it was amazing to see. It also has what i think was the most exciting and fun ending sequence of the series that had me laughing, and in suspense the entire time. It closes off the story of this film perfectly and sets up the next film in a similar way to what the first film did. It may even be one of my favourite movie endings ever, i get goosebumps every time i watch it.Again, the attention to detail was incredible, with fantastic call-backs to the first film and the little details that connect the alternate timelines timelines together, and also some foreshadowing for what is to come in Part 3, Robert Zemeckis' love for this world and these characters is on show. In the end, this film goes bigger, it goes to more places and it retains everything you love about the first film. It does lose some of that magic that you feel when watching the first film but it is still a masterpiece and a classic that even helped to elevate how good the first film was upon return viewings. - 9",9,2,4,19 October 2015
Straight Outta Compton," An incredible film and one of the best biopics around
","This is one of the best films of the year, that is all. Straight Outta Compton was just absolutely incredible. It was a biopic that told the story of how NWA came to be and what happened while they were active and after. Now i don't know the history of NWA to the point where i know what is accurate and what is not, but from looking stuff up if you are looking for the most accurate retelling, this probably isn't it as it is a biopic not a documentary. But with Ice Cube and Dr Dre as producers on the film i guess you could say some things were more accurate than not. The fact that this film managed to entertain me from start to finish even though i am not exactly an NWA fan speaks for how spectacular this movie was. It was intense at times, sad at times and in the end was just a really fascinating story that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It had incredible performances and covered many different events that all came together to tell a what is a really great story. Really, this film just had it all. I love a good biopic, and this is one of the best of them all, amazing. Lets start with the performances by the actors because every damn actor in this movie KILLED IT as their character, especially O'Shea Jackson Jr. as his own dad. For a group of people who were relatively unknown they did a damn good job. Every single one transformed into their character (especially visually) and were so convincing that they may have actually gone back and gotten the characters' younger selves. Having that realism of these actors looking exactly like the real guys added even more authenticity to the film and the story they were trying to tell. Even Paul Giamatti was fantastic as always and the fact that all of these actors got me to care about or not care about every character whether i knew of them or not speaks again for the effort put into the film on the actors' part. The plot of the movie was gripping and an undeniably exciting ride. The fact that all of this stuff (more or less) happened in real life is so fascinating that you just couldn't make this stuff up. These stories and events made for a plot that flowed so well all the way through and it was never too slow or too fast and never had a boring moment in its 2 hour and 27 minute runtime. Even though i had heard of some of the events that were coming up, the movie still had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation. The film also has a little drop of humour thrown in there to combat some of the darker more serious events that take place. Again, i'm sure they glossed over stuff and skipped certain things in order to not have this movie go for 4 hours but to someone not really familiar with everything going on with them at the time, it was all fine to me. Did it make me want to know more about these events? Heck yeh it did, mission accomplished. So in the end, if you haven't realised already, i really really loved this movie, a story that was very well documented (or adapted), and fantastically acted right through to end up with an all round fantastic biographical picture and film - 9.4",9,3,32,2 September 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," This should be renamed '50 ways to make a crappy movie'
","It is finally here, the movie every housewife saw opening weekend and every boyfriend was dragged to, and i feel sorry for what they had to sit through for two hours. For a book that was so highly praised by so many people this film was all kinds of terrible, from it's plot (or lack thereof) to its characters and dialogue this movie just failed to deliver in any way. Now i know i am not the target audience for this film but even if i am not the target audience i have to be able to have at least a half decent time watching it. Right from the very first Anastasia and Christian scene this move was just so cringe-worthy and a complete bore-fest. This movie did a terrible job of creating and introducing these characters, one comes across as a weird, over-controlling freak (some words i cannot include here) and the other a very confused ,dumb and poorly written woman. Whoever wrote the dialogue for this film whether it was the same as the novel or updated for the film needs to retire their writing career because the conversations between the two leads are so boring, all the lines seem very fake, like this writer has never had a normal human conversation. Most of this crappy dialogue is the writer's fault for writing it but also Jamie Dornan was just completely bland in this role, his delivery of the lines were so robotic and fake that you didn't buy what they were saying for a second. I do believe that Anastasia did a half decent job while having to portray one of the dumbest characters who is completely incapable of making any kind of rational decision. Her scenes when she is away from Christian are more bearable, it is when they are together that it just gets unbearable to watch.Now, the plot was just so plain and simple that for a whole 2 hours the movie went absolutely nowhere. The movie was not building up to any kind of event, it was just a series of conversations and sexual activities all spaced out over the two hours. Whoever read the script and thought that THIS would be able to capture the viewers attention the whole time was dead wrong. This film did its very best to make me fall asleep, but i fought it because i had to see what stupidity they would come up with next to keep the film going. This film was just filled with many, many weird and awkward conversations that just make you wonder why on earth this woman is interested in this man and why this man is so interested in this woman. With a bit of unsexy sex thrown in there a few times and one of the worst endings in film history this movie was a disaster waiting to happen. If it wasn't for Dakota Johnson actually making her character at times amusing this would have somehow been even lower. - 2.9/10",3,3,7,27 February 2015
Pitch Perfect," A really fun and enjoyable musical
","Well i am a little late to this party, well actually really late but with the sequel right around the corner i thought why not see why there is a sequel in the first place. And i can just say that i have no idea why or how i managed to miss this movie over the last three years. In terms of modern musicals it is definitely one of the biggest ones out there. This movie utilises great musical pieces and manages to incorporate an interesting plot and quite a bit of pretty good comedy that connects with the personalities of each of the characters. I will start with saying that i thought the characters were very well written, there may be some stereotypical hints in the way they act but overall you have a group of women who are all very different and recognisable for different reasons. This diversity really helps to keep interest in the film have certain jokes last for the entire duration. In terms of the performances they were all very good, especially Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson who just steal the show in mostly every scene. Rebel Wilson's comedy was one of the highlights, always lightening the mood every now and then. The only issue i had with the film was it being just a tad inconsistent for the first two thirds mainly. I constantly found myself gradually enjoying the film and then not as much and then really enjoying it before kinda wanting it to move on again. It felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride in terms of interesting and not so interesting parts, a more balanced film work have worked a lot more. So in the end, apart from that i really found myself enjoying this film, there was a good plot, likable characters, plenty of comedy and some great songs that really get you singing along. - 7.7",7,0,2,17 May 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A great blend of a spy film with crazy OTT action
","Kingsman: The Secret Service was just simply so much goddamn fun. I had heard that it was a fun film but i had no idea just how great it was going to be. This movie was filled with crazy intense action sequences and some more subtle jokes that show up every now and then. The plot of this movie you think is something you have seen before but it continuously surprises you throughout and just when you think you know is going to happen it throws you a curveball. These surprises helped to make the film so much more entertaining. Lets start with the action sequences because they are by far the best scenes of the movie. They are just awesome edge of your seat action sequences that are exaggerated in terms of the violence and gore to make them really unique. The way they are shot is incredible how they don't use conventional shots instead there are some crazy rotating continuous shots that make the scene that much more awesome. This film did have its fair share of comedy, and i thought it did pretty well to make me laugh. Only 2-3 times it didn't work for me but otherwise the smart and subtle comedy was very effective. And the jokes and bizarre action would not have been as awesome without the incredible cast they got. From the big names such as Samuel L Jackson and Colin Farrell to Taron Egerton and Sofia Boutella they all did amazing jobs in their roles and were so fun to watch. They do a good job at creating an enemy who you know is bad but you cannot resist to love him because of the character itself and the actor playing them.The main criticism i give this film was that there were a couple of moments that it slowed down a little too much before going into some intense action scenes. The jokes they crack during these scenes and just overall interest in the plot help a little to not get too restless. But they are a minor offence as all of the good this movie does overshadows the bad. In the end, this movie was a great blend of crazy intense action, engaging characters and plot, and a little bit of comedy to add to the fun - 8.9",9,2,8,30 April 2015
Minions," Not for me but a younger audience will love it
","Minions is the prequel to the Despicable Me franchise featuring everyones favourite Minions. I have to say i didn't really like this movie, i was quite bored for a lot of the movie as this movie didn't have much in it for anyone over 10 years old. There were a few funny moments here and there, but very few, and even then they weren't laugh out loud moments. Now, i am definitely not the target audience for a film like this but it would have benefited greatly from having a little more humour that a wider audience could enjoy, just look at pixar films aka Inside Out. The plot also wasn't anything great, it was your standard villain vs the heroes scenario but being a kids movie you can't knock it down for doing what it intended. The minions of course were the stars of the film (hence the title) and whatever good moments there were to enjoy came from them. If you loved the minions in the previous films you will love them in this as you get much of the same type of humour.There isn't that much i can say about this film, i guess it accomplished what it set out to do for its intended audience, but unfortunately didn't offer any more than that. The performances and the characters weren't the problem, both the new and old characters i thought were well written and acted. Just the humour didn't really work for me most of the time, so i'm going to rate it a little low but if you really love the minions or are taking young kids to see it you and/or they will definitely get more out of it. - 4/10",4,4,16,8 July 2015
Spectre," Plenty of better Spy Thrillers out there, go watch those...
","'Spectre' is the 24th Bond film and the 4th film starring Daniel Craig as the infamous agent 007. Now for me when it comes to the James Bond films, i was never a big fan, but i lost almost all interest when i couldn't get through 'Quantum of Solace' and i didn't even bother with 'Skyfall'. And going into this film i expected nothing new, just the same generic Bond formula we have seen over and over again. This film overall was just boring, it had some entertaining moments but for most of the film it came across as very dry compared to some of the other Spy Thrillers from this year and last. There were moments where i had to really try to stay awake because most of this film wasn't even interesting let alone exciting. And it didn't have anything to do with me missing the last 2 films as the majority of the connections are only minor side- things and the few major ones are shoved down your throat enough to make sure you get it. The film wasn't all bad though, there were a couple of cool action sequences that were well done and kept me up, a great performance by Christoph Waltz, and what i thought was a very good last 30 minutes.First i have to say, this film was just too damn long. 2 hours and 28 minutes is good for some films but not for this one, should have kept it down to 2 hours or less. I found that many many times this film was just dragging on and on and i was dying for something exciting to happen. And this wasn't just during non-action scenes. The first 30 minutes or more, including the opening sequence was just a bore, apart from like one or two quick cool moments the rest felt like generic bond stuff that wasn't exciting to me. Some people might have loved the opening fight sequence but for me it wasn't intense, new or interesting and so the film started out on a low note. From then on, any scene featuring Christoph Waltz worked really well and a few action scenes were cool. There is one fight on a train which i really enjoyed, all 3 minutes of it, but other than that, the rest of the action throughout was pretty meh. The biggest issue had to be its pacing, it would constantly fluctuate from being dreadfully slow to really fast paced sequences and back in ways that felt a little jarring. And the slow pace definitely out-did the fast moving sections in terms of their duration making the movie feel like 3 hours. The performances in this film were mostly just alright, the Bond girl in the film played by Lea Seydoux was serviceable to the plot when she needed to be and wasn't anything great. Daniel Craig was fine as Bond again, no surprises with him really. Ralph Fiennes returns as M in this film and i thought he was one of the better performances and one of the more interesting characters. He is such a great actor and so was really engaging and made me just as interested in his journey as i was in Bond's. But the best performance was undoubtedly Christoph Waltz as our Bond villain. He was by far the most intriguing character in the film and for the entire film i was just wanting more of his character. Mainly because he could have very easily been an evil 'I want to rule the world' type of villain but wasn't really. He was a very smart villain, and had some interesting motivations and an interesting past i would have liked to learn more about. Christoph Waltz is just such a fantastic actor in any role and he shows that here where he steals the film from James Bond. This film would have been a disaster if it wasn't for the ending sequence that i thought was really great. It was very engaging, intense, and dramatic, everything the rest of the film should have been. I won't go into any spoilers but it had to be noted that it did save the film from being way worse. So in the end, as a Bond film, it really wasn't anything new or interesting that you hadn't seen before. It doesn't come close to Casino Royale which i thought was really good. But if you are a Bond fan, you will probably be more interested in the film than i was. If you are looking for a better spy thriller, watch 'Mission Impossible Rogue Nation', or 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', even 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E' is more worth your time. - 5.1/10",5,2,5,11 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away
","Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10",10,903,1697,13 May 2015
Donnie Darko," Intriguing yet very, very confusing
","Donny Darko is one of the more unique and original mystery thrillers that you can find. This movie had you completely clueless and puzzled right from the get go, and the longer this movie went on, the more confused i became. In a way, this was one of the things i liked the most about the movie but it was also one of the things i didn't like. The fact that it was so puzzling got me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire time trying to make sense of what what happening whilst trying to figure out what will happen next, this made me very interested and invested in the story trying to be told. But then the bad part about that was that it got a little too confusing and mind bending so that at many points i had no idea what the plot was and just what exactly i was trying to realise. It was definitely an experience like no other with many hidden messages and clues that try to give you explanations about what is going on and why or how. As well as the directing, this movie would not have been as effective without the stellar performance by Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie Darko. He manages to capture both the kind and regular school kid side and the dark and almost evil side so well that you are just amazed by the character whenever he is on screen. Through this role i can totally see why he got the role as Lou Bloom in the more recent film Nightcrawler. He seems to be able to play this type of character so well that every time you forget it is Gyllenhaal. His performance was the standout as the many other performances were still good but lacked the spark that Gyllenhaal could bring to the role. The overall pace of the film was quite slow and i felt could have been sped up a little at certain points but i can understand why the director decided not to after spending some time thinking about the significance of certain events. With a very intriguing scenario and lead character, this movie will not fail to get you confused and thinking about it for days. - 7.9",8,0,2,17 February 2015
Macbeth," Gripping, Intense, Beautifully shot, with Unforgettable Performances
","HAIL MACBETH, HAIL MACBETH, HAIL MACBETH.WOW, that was a gripping, intense, beautifully shot film with unforgettable performances and has to be the best retellings of not only 'Macbeth' but all of Shakespeare's plays on screen. This movie did an incredibly amazing job at sticking to the source material whilst also incorporating a visually stunning cinematic style. It has a very interesting cinematic style using slow motion effects and sped up film in order to capture the emotions that the characters are feeling at every moment. I was in awe at how beautiful this film was, the wide shots of the landscapes were incredible whether there was something going on or nothing at all. And i don't know where the cgi in this film was if there was much at all because it all looks so incredibly real and grand and it only adds to the scope of the film. The movie's amazing cinematography is accompanied by many amazing performances including two of the best performances this year. Sean Harris and David Thewlis were standouts in their supporting roles as Macduff and Duncan and really displayed some of their best performances but the show was stolen by the two leads. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth were absolutely mind- blowing and amazing and encapsulated these characters as perfectly as you could get. They did incredible jobs at playing these extremely complex personalities and led me to see only Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, forgetting their previous roles. They pull of their monologues so well that you are fully engaged in what they are saying and can see that what they are feeling is not only expressed through what they are saying but just from the expressions on their faces. And Lady Macbeth's most iconic scene/monologue was represented so perfectly that it was one of the best and most gripping scenes in the film. The Oscar race is heating up and Fassbender and Cotillard have to be the front-runners for Best Actor and Actress, truly amazing. Having read the play a little while ago i was able to still recall many of the key events and know mostly what was coming up next. So hearing plenty of familiar lines from the play and seeing these scenes was incredibly rewarding. And reading the play i feel helped to follow along with what is happening at all times. But for someone unfamiliar with the story of Macbeth i think it might be a little hard to follow at times. This is definitely not a film where you can look away for even a minute and still know what is going on. If you miss a few lines of dialogue or zone out during a scene, when you zone back into the film you will probably be lost. The Shakespearean dialogue is probably going to be a barrier for people to understand and if you can't understand that dialogue you really won't like this film. But as i was saying i felt that if i hadn't read the play i would have been quite lost during the film. If you aren't paying careful attention and reading into even the most subtle of hints some scenes will seem random and you'll have no idea what is going on. So i think this is definitely not for general audiences who just want to relax and check out a film, it requires a fair amount of attention. So in the end, it is beautifully shot, intense, extremely well acted and a great adaptation of this incredible play. Maybe not for the general audience but any fans of the source material or lovers of film should love this movie. - 8.6/10",9,84,116,14 October 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A return to form for the Indiana Jones Trilogy
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third instalment of the Indiana Jones trilogy and brings the franchise back to what made it so memorable in Raiders of the Lost Arc. Now for me this film didn't do it better than the first one but it was a definite improvement over the not as good Temple of Doom. It bought back the action adventure elements that were missing in Temple of Doom and made this so fun and entertaining to watch. Along with the classic action sequences there was still plenty of room for the comedy that you expect in the series and it delivered a lot more that the previous film, as the first one did. Plot wise, it took an approach more similar to that of Raiders of the Lost Arc, which i found to be a very interesting and engaging plot. At some points it did feel like i had seen similar things in the first film but it was for the most part full of fresh new ideas, better comedy and surprise twists. The best thing about this film had to be the addition as Sean Connery as Dr. Henry Jones, and his amazing chemistry with his son Indiana Jones. These two really led the movie for the last two thirds and they only made it better. Their relationship was entertaining, funny, and felt really natural. Once again John Williams with another great score that can instantly improve any film with its classic, memorable songs. In the end Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade brings this series back to the tomb raiding that made the first film so memorable and provides another fantastic action adventure film that anyone can enjoy. - 8.7",9,2,3,13 March 2015
The Martian," Smart, Funny, Intense Action and one of Matt Damon's best
","The Martian excelled at telling a gripping story with amazingly real characters, many intense edge of seat sequences all the way through and quite a bit of humour that also made the film surprisingly really funny. This film marks the return for legendary director Ridley Scott, who after a few misses has created yet another masterpiece that will go down as one of his best. Ridley Scott is known to be a master at making his films visually incredible and that is no different in this film, the wide shots in space are amazing and Mars looks so real that you wonder how they actually got to Mars to film this. This may just be the best space film to come out in the last few years, even though i loved Interstellar this may just be a step above and a little more polished. This film managed to still remain very smart whilst also dropping a lot of the complex science talk that weighted down Interstellar, making it very easy to follow (Yes i understand this film doesn't have interstellar travel to worry about) What was amazing is how they managed to tell a very smart and coherent story about one man spending many years on a deserted planet in 2 hours and 20 minutes without feeling like too much time was skipped. From start to finish you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen next, you are so engaged in what is happening right now that you don't even think about what's going to happen next and that is just an example of great storytelling. What i also thought was a great element in the film was that it was not only about one mans survival but also about the struggles of the people back on Earth who have to figure out a way to retrieve him. And this allowed for the film to constantly swap back and forth between the two locations allowing you to see how everyone reacts at each moment of the film. And it felt very natural unlike some of the transitions between Earth and space in Interstellar feeling rushed and unconnected. When you have almost the entire film featuring one man on screen you must have an incredible talent who can capture the audience's attention and keep them entertained the whole time. And Matt Damon manages to accomplish that so perfectly i can;t imagine anyone else doing a better job as astronaut Mark Watney. This is by far one of the best performances of his career and he has done a lot of amazing stuff in the past. He manages to carry the film on his shoulders with ease and was so fun to watch. He is such a world class talent to be able to portray this fictional character in a way that made me at many times think that i was watching some kind of true story, he captured all of the emotion and struggles this guy was going through so well, and just added layers to his character. Not only was this a serious and at times emotional film but it was also hilarious and much of those comedic elements came from Matt Damon. The quick one liners all hit and made the entire full theatre laugh every time. But he did not do it alone, Damon was accompanied by one of the most incredibly talented supporting casts of the year and they only add to the enjoyment of the film. Heres some of the supporting cast to give you an idea; Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Kate Mara.... WOW thats big. And even more impressive is that every character seemed useful and wasn't just thrown in there for a meaningless cameo, they all had an important part to play at some point in the film and they all deliver on their performances. They add to the story, the emotion, the humour and were all great additions to the film. And seeing Kate Mara act in this film confirms to me that she was not part of the problems that sunk Fant4stic.And i thought space could not get any more intense than it did in Gravity and Interstellar. But this film delivers on a level above those films, there were countless moments where i was frozen still due to the anticipation of what may happen next, featuring sweaty palms and all that. And these moments weren't just quick 3 minutes of intense dramatic action, it had me stunned for like at least 15 minutes at a time multiple times and had me in awe, holding my breath, and on the edge of my seat...... it was truly amazing. So in the end this was a very smart, humorous, intense and entertaining adventure full of insane dramatic action, and emotion. Great characters, a compelling adapted script and beautiful shots makes this another masterpiece in the space film genre. - 9.2",9,5,73,1 October 2015
Furious 7," Out of this world action that will keep you entertained all the way
","This movie shows perfectly what this series has become since it decided to change from a serious racing film to a fun and over the top action film. And i am so glad they made that decision because this was packed with over the top stunts and fights with some comedy thrown in there, it was just so damn enjoyable. Not saying that i hated the first three instalments but this is just almost like a completely different franchise. You have to go into this film knowing that they aren't taking themselves seriously and making the stunts realistic because almost every stunt that is pulled in this film would result in certain death. But the lack of realism does not make this film any less enjoyable, in fact it is those moments of just totally crazy action that make this film so great. The only negative i can really give this film is story wise it wasn't all that amazing. You can tell that the flow of the story wasn't really the focus, they didn't spend a whole lot of time figuring out how to move these characters to different locations around the globe, they just made it happen with little to no explanation. But within 30 seconds you completely forget about that and get back to focusing on the real star of the film, the action. The stunts and action sequences throughout the film from the fairly grounded ones to the completely insane ones are all just as thrilling and entertaining. All these sequences are really spaced out well and executed amazingly. Not to say that the climactic action sequence is a massive onslaught of fight after fight, stunt after stunt and has you on the edge of your seat for a constant 20 minutes. The cast were all great everyone got a fair amount of screen time, and you just always seemed to care about them. They had been set up and developed so well in the previous films that you just went into this film already liking them. Stepping aside from the action this film did mark the final film for Paul Walker who past away during the filming of this film, and it did a great job of honoring his work and effort he put into this series of films spanning 15 years. In the end this is a fun action thriller that you can just sit back and enjoy pretty much every minute of and laugh, maybe even cry but you will always be invested in the film. - 8.1",8,0,3,4 April 2015
