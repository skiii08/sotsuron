The Ring," Enjoyed this more than I thought I would...
","I got to say I enjoyed this more than I thought I would I mean I have never seen the original Japanese version so I have nothing to compare it to but as a stand alone horror film there are so many things about it are good I know this is an American remake and most people who have seen the Japanese version did not enjoy it or avoid it but for me I avoided it for a different reason I thought that it would just be boring because a lot of people over the years told me how it was dull and not worth watching how wrong I was to listen to those people I regret not seeing it earlier. Everybody who's seen this knows the story it's about a videotape and after you watch it you get a phone call telling you you'll die in 7 days now to me this was a very interesting and creepy concept there was one scene in the film that really scared me I saw there were kind of 3 main characters in this you had Rachel Keller who was investigating this videotape after her niece died,you have Aidan who is her son and you have Noah who's helping her to investigate the rape after he watches it the scene I'm talking about is when Noah dies his television screen comes on when he is working and he goes to look then Samara crawls out of the screen and kills him the whole film to me was very creepy and intriguing but to me that was the scene that really stood out I'd highly recommend this for people who haven't seen this it's one that gets to you it gave me chills down my spine I give it a 9/10.",9,1,1,19 February 2017
Star Trek," Not bad but not great...
","I am reviewing this as a stand alone film because I have never seen any of the original Star Trek movies or series so I can't exactly comment on those what I thought of this film was that it wasn't bad I mean it was quite slow at times and not too much action but the acting was quite good by the entire cast now I don't know too much about their characters but the performances were good and it wasn't poorly made or anything like that the special effects were great this wasn't hard to understand the story was pretty straightforward I know a lot of people who are fans of the original series,Next Generation and the films didn't enjoy it and they have their reasons but as a stand alone it's quite enjoyable I think of it as that because like I said this is my first Star Trek film I will definitely watch Into Darkness soon as well I hear that's the best one and Beyond after that because I am somewhat intrigued I give it a 6/10 for the most part I enjoyed it.",6,1,4,14 February 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Better than The Amazing Spider-Man and Raimi's trilogy...
","I finally saw this tonight was looking forward to it ever since I heard about it and when I saw the trailer I was even more pumped for it and I was not disappointed this was a pretty good movie I really did enjoy it Tom Holland was the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man I didn't like the fact how he never really did anything about his love interest though I mean he asked her to the homecoming dance then left her there that was about it but he was great as the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man for sure and we did have your side characters like Flash,MJ except this time her name was Michelle not Mary Jane I'm kind of fine that they changed that the girl was this loner didn't have any friends but later on kind of made some she was a pretty awesome character and Peter's love interest Liz was great but the character I was most surprised about was Marisa Tomei as Aunt May I didn't expect her to be that great but she was amazing I thought I'm glad they went for a younger actress this time...I also liked the villain Adrian Toomes/Vulture which also turned out to be Liz's father which I was not expecting that was a shocker for me and Tony Stark was great as his mentor kind of prepping him to be in the Avengers he offered him a place closer to the end but he turned it down also there was a scene on a ferry that kind of reminded me of one of the other Spider-Man movies. The Amazing Spider-Man was good for the Spider- Man origin story but this movie was great because of Tom Holland he is definitely the best Spider-Man I was glad when he made an appearance in Captain America Civil War I was excited because he finally would get to be in the Avengers but it was just one mission and was hyped to see more of him and was really satisfied I can't wait for the sequel give this a 9/10 highly recommend it this is better than The Amazing Spider-Man 1,2 and Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy altogether although the origin story in The Amazing Spider-Man was great but this movie is better Andrew Garfield is not the best Spider-Man to me he's second best.",9,1,5,16 July 2017
Suicide Squad," A very good movie...
","When I first saw Suicide Squad in theaters I thought it was just decent not bad not great but then I ended up re-watching it recently and actually liked it better the first time around the highlights of the movie for me were The Joker and Harley Quinn their backstory was awesome how she fell in love with him and how she jumped into that vat of acid for him this is definitely not my favorite movie of 2016 but I really do like it the 2nd time around it was better. I liked the other characters as well except for Killer Croc who I felt was just not necessary in the movie Deadshot was my 3rd favorite and Will Smith was awesome as the character I liked his backstory as well how he got caught by Batman and ended up in prison. Another minor problem I have with the movie which isn't really a big deal is the so called villain Enchantress I didn't even get what the point of her character was but to me that doesn't ruin the movie. Now I'm just going to go ahead and talk about Jared Leto as The Joker I thought he was awesome I was assured he didn't have that much screen time but he had more than I was told and he was awesome no offense to Heath Ledger may he rest in peace but I liked him better...I understand that each Joker is different each actor played him differently Jack Nicholson was more of the funny Joker,Heath Ledger was more serious and Jared Leto to me was crazy but funny I loved him I never really saw him in anything else except for American Psycho but I think he's better in this than in that. I liked the chemistry between him and Harley Quinn who was played by Margot Robbie I thought she was awesome as the character now I haven't read any of the DC comics so I don't know anything about these characters except for what I saw in this movie but to me I think it's enough to me Harley Quinn is a female version of The Joker I liked how they introduced her how she was a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum,how she fell in love with The Joker and started helping him just doing anything for him. I liked their makeup as well and felt sorry for Harley when The Joker died...or did he? I'm not going to spoil the ending for those of you who haven't seen it to me this was a very good movie I did have fun with it a lot of good action as well I'd recommend it for sure if you love superhero movies except in this one it was kind of strange to see the bad guys be the heroes but at the same time a good change of pace.",7,0,1,18 October 2016
Bad Teacher," Not as funny as I thought it would be but not bad at all...
",Watched this for the first time and it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but it still wasn't bad I didn't really laugh out loud but I was kind of laughing on the inside Cameron Diaz as Elizabeth was really good she pulled off her character this gold-digging teacher who seemed to learn that money isn't everything in the end the whole movie she was raising money for breast implants which she didn't even end up getting there was also this gym teacher who kept going after her while she was trying to sink her claws into this other teacher who she knew was rich but after she realized money wasn't that important her and this gym teacher got together which was played by Jason Segel now that's another great actor very talented the whole movie she acted like he was beneath her just because he taught gym then she chose love over money which was a good choice and ended up as a guidance counselor at the school which I thought was cool but before that she was lying and cheating to get her way she cheated on the test of the students by getting the answers illegally to win a $5700 bonus that was the worst thing she did but before that she supervised a car wash that was meant to be for charity and took it for her breast implants another pretty bad thing too anyway if you're a fan of comedies or Cameron Diaz I say check it out I give it a 6/10.,6,1,5,16 June 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Really enjoyed this...
","I finally saw this movie and I got to say it was awesome I really did enjoy it it had a lot of action and it was good to finally see the first appearance of Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man the airport fight scene was probably my favorite one in this movie apart from the scene closer to the end when Iron Man finds out that Bucky killed his father but he didn't know what he was doing as he was not himself after that a huge fight between Captain America,Iron Man and Bucky began this movie is so action packed apart from the one scene where Tony Stark goes to Queens to see Peter Parker and ask for help in this Captain America and Iron Man are at each other's throats because everyone else in the Avengers signed this new thing that would let the government tell them where to go,what to do and who to help but he refused to do it as he thought that the Avengers should still have the right to do that that's the main reason why it caused this rift between them. I also like how Bucky and Steve reunite that was an awesome scene as well I honestly can't find a single flaw in this other than the somewhat long and slow conversation between Peter and Tony that dragged on a little but I was glad to see Peter on screen for the first time also Ant-Man was pretty cool too I've never seen the stand alone movie about him and how he became that though this is probably my favorite of the 3...The First Avenger was good to me but was kind of corny the action was good though but wasn't a fan of Hugo Weaving as Red Skull this is the only time I didn't really like him much in a movie,The Winter Soldier was awesome I really enjoyed it but this this outdid both by far in my opinion and I would highly recommend it if you have not seen it yet I give it a 9/10.",9,1,3,3 February 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Was very disappointing...
","So I finally saw Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them and all I can say is that it was a disappointment and felt like it had no place in this Harry Potter universe I know this is meant to be a prequel set 70 years before Harry finds out he's a wizard and attends Hogwarts the only signs that it's even remotely connected is this is about witches and wizards,mentions Hogwarts and Grindelwald who was mentioned in Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1 as well only in this he's the big threat he's the main dark wizard I just found this film to be boring and it really dragged on wasn't intriguing even for a second to me the Harry Potter films are enough we didn't need a prequel but it seems they are thinking of turning this into a franchise as well there is already a sequel planned for next year but I say don't bother the special effects weren't even good in this and the acting was kind of bad too you see one appearance of Johnny Depp as Grindelwald to me that was the best part and you have this fat muggle with Newt Scamander the whole time this is the main character and the so called 'hero' of the film I do not recommend this if you're a fan of the Harry Potter films this doesn't fit into that universe at all for me stick to those films that's my advice.",2,3,5,14 February 2017
The Conjuring 2," Was a really good sequel...
","The Conjuring 2 was a really good sequel first time I watched it I was a bit too skeptical so I didn't end up enjoying it as much as I could have but now I've watched it a few more times and I got to say it's awesome. I like the part in the beginning where Lorraine is in a trance at the Amityville house and she kind of was reliving the murders in that house while in a trance she also had a premonition of Ed's death which I thought was a pretty messed up scene plus when you see The Nun for the first time it really creeps you out sends chills down your spine to me the creepiest part of this movie is The Nun you don't know who the hell she is,what the hell she's doing there or anything. That was just the beginning though the Amityville haunting it's mainly based on the haunting in Enfield that's in North London it's basically this girl Janet slowly being possessed this spirit of this old man called Bill Wilkins who used to live in that house and died in the chair in the corner was supposedly the one doing it but then you find out it's something much more sinister an inhuman spirit I know this is a huge spoiler for those of you who haven't seen this but I have to talk about it it turned out that Bill Wilkins was actually being used as a puppet by The Nun from the beginning of the movie and she really wanted the girl Janet she wanted to fully possess her for some reason I didn't really understand why. Every time I saw The Nun on screen I couldn't help but jump they do reveal the real name of this demon in the movie but I don't really want to spoil that the thing about Bill Wilkins was enough. Anyways I do like this movie and I think there should be a 3rd one this definitely great to me this is one of the new necessary sequels I felt they needed to add more to this the first one wasn't enough for me after I saw that I did want more I really did. I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it.",7,0,1,10 October 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Disappointment for the most part...
",This film was a disappointment with only a few decent moments and one saddening scene which I will get into soon but first let me point out that I only went to see this because me and my friends couldn't get in to see Alien Covenant which is what we really wanted to see right now I'm going to talk about everything that I didn't like...1. I didn't like the fact that Jack Sparrow wasn't the same pirate we know and love he seemed washed up like he didn't have it in him anymore 2. The villain Captain Salazar played by Javier Bardem he was just terrible and so corny they tried to make him come off as funny but that just didn't work 3. It wasn't as action packed as the first 3 Pirates of The Caribbean films were now I'm only saying the first 3 because I haven't seen On Stranger Tides I actually heard that wasn't that good of a film but at some point I may give it a chance because I'm sure it's better than this. Now the things I did like and the one thing that kind of saddened me...1. I liked the scene where Jack Sparrow robbed the bank that was kind of funny and the only scene where I thought that he could be the same pirate we know and love but after that I threw it out of my mind because it just went downhill after that 2. The fact that Will Turner was showed in the beginning talking to his son Henry who wanted to lift his father's curse by finding the Trident of Poseidon 2. The sad thing is when you see Barbosa die who is the father of one of the other main characters of the film who I didn't really care about because her acting was so horrible but her name was Carina Smyth I mean that just seemed unlikely that a pirate was the father of such an intelligent girl but like I said it was quite sad to see him die because he was a huge part of the series but it was time to write that character off I didn't like that scene at all though 3. The last thing I liked is the ending of course when Henry broke Will's curse and they were reunited with Elizabeth that was just beautiful that happened because he broke the Trident of Poseidon but in the process he also broke the curse of Captain Salazar and his crew I won't get into how or why he was cursed because that explanation in the film was just boring to me I can't believe a film series based on a Disney attraction went on for so long to me personally I think it should've stopped at 3 which was At World's End that would've been a good ending this is definitely the worst Pirates of The Caribbean film I've seen but who knows maybe when I finally see On Stranger Tides that may change although I'm really not sure. Anyway I give this a 4/10 I mean if you're a huge fan of Pirates of The Caribbean you might like this but you also may not an example of a fan who didn't like it would be me.,4,6,14,30 May 2017
Don't Breathe," Great home invasion thriller...
","Really not sure where to begin with this film I mean it really exceeded my expectations I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did this is definitely a great home invasion thriller Fede Alvarez definitely did do a good job I wasn't really expecting his second feature film to be something like this that's what made it more surprising for me. This movie basically centers on 3 thieves Rocky,Money and Alex who break into the house of a sick old man who's a war veteran that had lost his only daughter because they're told he has money hidden in there but they didn't expect him to wake up and start defending himself I say that loosely because he kills 2 of them Money and Alex shoots both of them...Money is in the beginning when they first break in and find the closet where he keeps the safe which is locked and as I said the man wakes up because he heard how the lock was blown off that was most likely the reason and he catches Money out because he steps on it then ends up shooting him in front of Rocky that was a pretty messed up scene Alex is killed later. Later in the film as well when Rocky and Alex are trying to escape they found a woman in the house handcuffed and tied up that was the woman that killed the man's daughter he was keeping her there because she was pregnant with his baby he promised her he'd let her go as soon as she gave him a new child which is why he was so upset when he'd realized that she had gotten shot by a bullet from his gun. I don't really want to spoil much more but if you haven't seen this movie I'd definitely recommend it it's now one of my favorites.",8,1,4,1 January 2017
Sausage Party," Enjoyed this more than I thought I would...
","Finally we get an animated film strictly for adults I always wondered when they would make one and now my dream came true but I didn't have high expectations for this after I saw the trailer but now after watching it I can honestly say I enjoyed it more than I thought of it anyone who has seen this will know the premise the film is set in a supermarket and centers on Frank the sausage,Brenda the bun and all their...let's call them friends they basically dream of going to the great beyond to be chosen by the 'gods' which are actually the humans but then Frank finds out that it's a lie and that what really happens is they get eaten that the 'gods' kill them and eat them well in their eyes as least. I'm just gonna go ahead and get my one problem with the film out of the way which is the douche who ended up with a bent nozzle,raped a juice box which was really over the line and went after Frank for revenge. I loved the animation it was so well done,I found the jokes hilarious I was just cracking up laughing pretty much the whole way through,Frank and Brenda were lovable as a couple and so were all the other characters I loved them all,Seth Rogen was great at voicing Frank I just think this is one of his best yet and it's now one of my favorites of 2016 I would highly recommend it I give it a 9 because that's what it deserves.",9,8,15,11 November 2016
Wonder Woman," Great entry in the DCEU...
",Finally got to see this film and I got to say that I really did love it Gal Gadot as Diana/Wonder Woman was just perfect I'm not going to get into any spoilers because this is definitely one that you should see for yourself without knowing anything about it I mean I read some reviews before seeing it so I was pumped to see it and it definitely lived up to the hype this is the best DC film I've seen so far for sure I mean I enjoyed Batman v Superman but this was definitely better in my opinion I loved the main villain which was Ares the god of war who Wonder Woman went to Earth with Steve Trevor to kill because she knew that he was the one causing the first World War now that isn't really much of a spoiler because I won't go into detail about how she does it. I can't wait for Justice League it'll be all the DC superheroes together it'll be awesome I'm sure of it but this is definitely one of my favorite films of 2017 so far I'd highly recommend it if you're a fan of the DCEU and superhero films in general I mean I like Marvel more because they develop the characters and films more but DC is a close second I can't wait to see more Wonder Woman and what it will be like with all the DC heroes joined together even though I feel it was a little bit rushed but still sure it will be good. Give this an 8/10 definitely one you should see in theaters.,8,0,5,6 June 2017
Step Up," One of my favorite movies...
",A lot of people hate on Step Up but to me it's an awesome movie and one of my favorites I love Channing Tatum in this he plays Tyler Gage a character who vandalizes the theater Maryland School of The Arts and gets 200 hours of community service while doing that he meets Nora who needs a partner to temporarily rehearse with when her permanent one twists his ankle and can't rehearse for awhile he offers to help basically from then on while rehearsing they start to fall in love he also thinks about applying to the school. To me this is a beautiful film and story the choreography is amazing as well. I just love it except for one scene that made me cry. I don't want to really spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it but I strongly advise that you do because you're missing out.,9,1,2,21 January 2017
Me Before You," Sad but amazing love story...
",This movie to me was a sad but amazing love story now I have never heard of Sam Claflin until now but he was great as Will Traynor in the beginning you see him with his girlfriend in bed then you see him leave it's pouring with rain he ends up getting hit by a motorcycle while crossing the road that's obviously how he was paralyzed and ended up in the wheelchair then you get a bit of background on Emilia Clarke's character Louisa Clark and how she's hired to take care of him from there they slowly start to warm up to each other and fall in love when she finds out that Will has attempted to commit suicide that he wants to die she does everything in her power to change his mind even takes him on vacation with him and his nurse but there is a scene the last night of their vacation this is closer to the end so this is a huge spoiler don't read any further if you have not seen this...she finds out that she's failed and that all her efforts were pointless she had fallen deeply in love with him by this time he tells her that he still wants to die and nothing will change his mind that he is leaving for Switzerland with his parents his intention was to die there she starts to cry calls him selfish and tells him she wishes she'd never met him now this was probably the most emotional scene in the movie for me apart from the ending which I won't spoil I had to physically force myself not to cry I really did love this it was beautiful this is the 2nd movie I've seen with Emilia Clarke I haven't seen her in anything else except for this and Terminator Genisys which I also love. Now I'm not sure if the director of this is British or American but wherever he's from he did a great job with this movie and I applaud him for it I hope to see more movies like this in the future I really think Emilia Clarke should get herself out there more because I'm not sure that she has done that much but I think she's an amazing actress even though I've only seen her in 2 movies. I highly recommend you watch this if you haven't yet I give it a 10/10 to me it was perfect.,10,2,3,13 March 2017
Furious 7," Amazing film and a great tribute to Paul Walker...
",I've seen this film quite a few times now I remember first seeing it in theaters in May 2015 the tribute to Paul Walker at the end with the song See You Again really brought tears to my eyes I still can't believe that he's gone...gone but not forgotten by his Fast and Furious family I loved I could tell that what Dom was saying at the end was really from the heart Vin Diesel really thought of Paul Walker as his brother in real life as well as in the films and that really touched me. We all know what this last film is about...Deckard Shaw seeks revenge on Dom and his crew for crippling his brother in Fast and Furious 6 you see how he goes after Han first then hacks into Hobbs' computer to find out who else was involved after calling Dom and sending him a message by blowing up his house so this is pretty much an action/revenge film in the end Deckard and Dom have a street fight which is pretty epic the soundtrack in this is also amazing to me this is probably Vin Diesel's best performance in the Fast and Furious series I also loved Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw and I'm glad he's coming back in The Fate of The Furious which is coming out this April but for me I don't think it will top this one it looks awesome but not as good as this. Paul Walker you are missed R.I.P. I give this a 10/10 and if you're a fan of the films and have not yet seen this I strongly advise that you do.,10,0,3,21 January 2017
