50 First Dates," nice feel good film
","Normally I don't do reviews but this one I liked so much and still not many good reviews out there. This is just one of those movies- light-hearted, funny, good direction, a couple of tear-jerking scenes, feel-good movie, something you'll wanna watch time and again. I saw this in the theater and a year later watched it at home and loved it even more!! I never really liked Drew Barrymore, but after this movie I have new profound respect for her, and Adam Sandler, well he delivers the goods. The storyline is pretty interesting as well, about Lucy (DB) suffering from daily memory loss and Sandler making her fall in love with him everyday......Give this film a try, i know it;s not for everyone but if you're into a nice feel-good movie....give this a try...",10,0,1,1 June 2005
