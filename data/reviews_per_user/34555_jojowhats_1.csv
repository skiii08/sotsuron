Blade Runner 2049," Why?
","I can't believe this movie got made, it was really horrible. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer in the original movie were fantastic and that movie was ground breaking but this movie is slow and dull, and not worthy to have the name Blade Runner in the title. The new lead playing opposite Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard is no Harrison Ford in his prime, nor did I care for the villain whose character is one dimensional, I laughed at one point because I thought is the actor going to twirl his mustache? In the original film the villain Roy Betty, is played by Rutger Hauer who is great actor and I will always remember his monologue on the roof at night in the pouring rain with Harrison Ford, but he was given a phenomenal script. Perhaps a better a script, a re-edit and a different cast and it might have been great film as well. But with what they have made here don't waste your time on this film. Watch the Original it is timeless and perfection it self.Jo",1,3,5,23 June 2018
