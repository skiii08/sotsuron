The Ring," If you think since this movie is rated PG-13 it's not scary....think again
","If you think since this movie is rated PG-13 it's not scary....think again. I thought the same way and after I saw it I was hoping that my television wouldn't turn on.  I thought that it was a great horror movie with some flaws but what movie doesn't have them.  This was a great remake of the original Japanese movie.  It was a great, heart pounding, adrenaline pumping, edge of your seat Thriller/Horror movie with fairly good acting and a great and freaky plot.  This is one DVD that I'll get as soon as it comes out.  I give it a 10.",10,0,0,5 December 2002
Memento," A Great, Weird, and Twisted Film All Rolled Into One
","Memento is a Great, Weird, and Twisted Film All Rolled Into One.  I loved the way the director made this movie.  How the whole story starts at the end and goes to the beginning.  Who ever wrote this script has some mind.  No wonder it is #11 on the 250 greatest movies.  This movie you may have to see twice or even three times to actually understand it.  I saw it in the theater and I had to see it again because of two reasons I loved it so much and...well...I loved it so much.  Trust me, this movie was a great drama. Look how many people loved it on this website.  I loved it.",10,0,1,25 April 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A Great, Hilarious, Well Thought Up Masterpiece
","When I think of Dr. Strangelove, I think of a Great, Hilarious, Well Thought Up Masterpiece, directed by the great Stanley Kubrick.  This movie had many great old time actors that make a great comedic performance (especially George C. Scott and Peter Sellers).  Most of the humor is dry which may not get everybody's attention but if you really listen to the jokes, you'll get them.  I thought this movie was not only funny but very well thought up especially that this was the only real comedy that Stanley Kubrick made.  I give Dr. Strangelove a 10 because it is just that good.",10,2,2,19 May 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Jacket, One Of The Best War Movies
","Full Metal Jacket, is one of the best war movies.  The director Stanley Kubrick is a master at movie making.  This movie is not only brilliant but also emotional because it is, of course, about war.  The movie is like two movies put into one.  The first half is when the men go into training and the second part is when they go to the Vietnam War.  The tracking shots were a very big part of the movie because it felt like you were actually in the war with the American soldiers.  The acting of Matthew Modine (Joker) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Private Pyle)is superb.  The scene with the men walking on the field at night singing the Mickey Mouse Club Song is brilliantly thought up of and brilliantly made.  I gave this movie a 10 because let's face it, it was THAT good.",10,0,0,2 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great Everything
","In all my years of going to the movies, this movie has to be one of the top ten.  The Lord of the Rings works well in so many levels.  I like the way that Peter Jackson portrays the movie and the certain camera angles that he uses (For example the Depth of Field).  Not only does he show the characters journey, but he also shows the beautiful world of Middle Earth.  The actors all played their roles well and deserve only good things to say by the audience.  This movie made me feel like I was a part of the journey, of the fellowship and it made me feel like I was living in the world of Middle Earth.  Some said it was too long.  Well it was supposed to be I mean it was a journey.  Besides it was not really that long to a fan.  It went pretty fast for me and others I went with said the same thing.  Lord of the Rings had great acting, great camera work, great visuals, great music, great directing, great everything.  Kudos to Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew of Lord of the Rings.  This movie deserves a 10",10,1,1,24 December 2002
The Shining," One of the Greatest Horror Movies Out There
","The Shining is one of the greatest horror movies out there.  Based on the novel of Stephen King, The Shining which was directed by Stanley Kubrick had a great plot, essentially great actors, and great music.  What I really liked about this kind of horror movie was that it was a psychological horror about the supernatural and the paranormal.  This movie had blood (especially the elevator scene) but it did not have any gore or guts spewing around, which is a good thing.  This movie also had many of todays memorable quotes from 'Redrum' to 'Here's Johnny' (in a twisted way).  All and all, The Shining is one of the greatest horror movies in the 20th century.",10,0,1,25 April 2002
Apocalypse Now," One of the greatest war movies of all time
","Truly, Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest war movies of all time.  This film had great music, great actors, and had a great plot.  When I first saw it, I was mesmerized by the way it was all put together.  I am a big fan of war movies and I have to say that this is one of the top five war movie in history.  Not only did it have great actors but it also had a great director.  If you love or even like war movies, you should definitely buy or rent this movie.  You will be very pleased that you did.",10,0,0,25 April 2002
Spider-Man," One of the Greatest Movies of this year
","Spiderman is One of the Greatest Movies of this year.  After the movie I was in awe.  There were special effects but not that much that really kills the movie, but there were enough.  I like the way that the writer (David Koepp)made the story by putting some old Spiderman with some new Spiderman. The acting was great and all the actors really looked like the characters in Spiderman.  This movie deserves a 10 because it was just that good.  Will there be another one, one could only hope so.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out (which will definitely not be soon).",10,0,0,15 May 2002
Independence Day," A Good Science Fiction/End of Humanity Movie
","Independence Day was a good science fiction movie.  It was a good movie to see in the theater but now it is even better on DVD.  This movie was not one of the greatest science fiction movies but it had many good points.  All of the destruction of the major cities was pretty cool, the orchestrated music was very peaceful sounding, the actors were very good at playing their parts, and the speech that Bill Pullman gave in the movie was very touching and memorable.  I gave it an 8 because it was good but it was not great, and because they don't have decimals.  If they did I would have given it an 8.6.",8,0,1,25 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Even Greater Than The First One
","After I saw the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, I was so astonished inside that all I could think of was the great battle scene and part of me wished I was in that battle scene myself (someone who made it out alive, of course).  The second installment of the Lord of the Rings was even better than the first one.  That is very rare for a second installment to be better than it's predecessor.  It had everything that I said in my comment for the Fellowship of the Ring and even more.  Gollum was excellent everything that I hoped he would be.  What I really liked about Gollum's part was the argument between Gollum and Smeagol.  The camera cut at two different positions to make it look like there was two of him to show is 'split personality' and them arguing.  The Battle at Helms Deep was one of the greatest battle scenes I have seen in quite a long time.  It beat Episode 2 in so many levels especially that Episode 2 was pretty much a video game and was not that good but... I'm supposed to be talking about The Two Towers. The Two Towers was definitely one of the greatest and most triumphant movies of this year.  I can't wait for the third installment, The Return of the King.  Once again Kudos to Peter Jackson and the cast for a great second installment of Lord of the Rings.",10,0,0,24 December 2002
Saw," One of The Greatest Horror Movies I've Seen In A While
","Saw was one of the greatest horror movies I have seen in a while. The movie was a disturbing, pop out of your seat movie with so many twists. What is great was that it was a new director (James Wan) that made this movie. It looked like he has been directing for a while. The acting was good for the most part and the jigsaw killer was a pretty creative character. The jigsaw's methods were pretty disturbing, especially the girl with the reverse bear trap on her mouth. I liked the clown manikin and the voice kind of reminded me of Sweet Tooth from 'Twisted Metal Black' which was pretty cool. I had to give this movie a 10 because of it's creativity, it's storyline, and it's directing. Kudos to the director James Wan, Saw was a great horror movie.",10,0,0,1 November 2004
A Clockwork Orange," A Violent, Dark, Twisted, Sick, Eye Popping, Disrespectful Film....and I loved it
","A Clockwork Orange is a Violent, Dark, Twisted, Sick, Eye Popping, Disrespectful Film....and I loved it.  It might actually be one of the most controversial films in the 20th Century.  The director of A Clockwork Orange, Stanley Kubrick had the most twisted mind in making this film, but not only was he twisted but the author of the original novel had some part in the distorted visions or beliefs of Alex and his 'droogs'.  I loved this movie because it was different.  I also found it a little humorous when Alex did some of the things that he did in the film.  Call my crazy, call me wrong, call my sick in the head but that's what I believe.  If you are not one of those always moral people, you will like this movie.  I guarantee it trust me on that one.",10,1,2,25 April 2002
Die Hard," Action, Explosions, Gun Fights and More
","Die Hard has Action, Explosions, Gun Fights and More.  This movie has great actors (you still see now),great action scenes and many lovely and funny anecdotes of John McClane (Bruce Willis).  This is a great hardcore action movie to see.  I would have given this movie an 8.7 if they had point ratings.  Go see this movie if you already haven't.",8,1,2,19 May 2002
Blade Runner," A Great Story of the Future back in 82
","Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott was a great adaptation of what the future would be like to someone living in 1982.  This movie had a dark, moody, and gloomy type of atmosphere.  It is a gothic movie with a great plot, good actors, and great orchestrated music.  I think of Blade Runner as a futuristic Film Noir Movie.  It is a great Retro movie to see and if you liked Harrison Ford in Star Wars, you will like him in Blade Runner.",9,0,0,19 May 2002
