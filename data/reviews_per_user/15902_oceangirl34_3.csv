Rocketman," Wanted more!!
","My only objection is I wish they had played his entire 2nd studio album, Tumbleweed Connection album, Madman Across the Water album and Honky Chateau album and then I would have been REALLY happy! Great movie anyway though!",10,1,1,4 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Amazing
","I loved it - sad to see all the trolls bashing another great Star Wars movie (and I saw the first movie when it was released in theaters when I was a teenager, so I'm not a new fan although I am female).",10,8,19,20 December 2019
