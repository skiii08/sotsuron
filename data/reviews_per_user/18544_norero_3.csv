Skyfall," Excellent! The Best Bond ever
","This is for me the best bond in franchise history Outside the Daniel Craig's Bond is the Best of All time.The direction of Sam Mendez is great as well as the work of Javier Bardem, playing the Villain of the movie is supreme In every scene where he steals the movie appears, transforming it into one of the best villains in Bond history. Another of the interesting things in this Bond, is being able to dive a little deeper into the history of the character. The actions of all the characters also help the very good work done by Sam Mendes who debuted in such films. In short, and although many will disagree or not, this is the best Bond film in cinema history",9,2,10,3 March 2013
Oblivion," Excellent and brilliant
","Last night I had the fortune of being in the world premiere of Oblivion in Argentina and see it with Tom Cruise in person in the Theatre,The film is entertaining and the many drafts of the script is very well led by Joseph Kosinski, Cruise is the perfect job, as well as that of Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman.The visual effects are outstanding, using a method of illumination and image overlay replacing the green screen.The plot, besides presenting a few small holes, which are imperceptible catch the beginning of the film until the final climax. Perhaps the presence of the same Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko in the room has boosted the expectations a bit to see this film, or how to analyze it, but the general public went very satisfied of the last jobs I've seen Cruise, this is certainly one of the best without a doubt, the story takes science fiction to another level, what would you do if the fate of your race depended on your memories? Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is one of the last mechanical drone for Earth. It is part of a massive operation aimed at extracting vital resources after decades at war with the terrifying threat of Scavs. But Jack's mission comes to an end. Walk and patrol the sky thousands of feet until your 'high' existence collapses when a beautiful stranger rescues a ship demolished. His arrival sets off a chain of events that will force Jack to question everything he knows and you end up putting the fate of the human race in their hands. My final opinion is that it is a successful work of Kosinski, based on his own book, and good entertainment, it's the end of the day what a viewer will find the movies",9,1,3,27 March 2013
Cloud Atlas," Marvellous and extraordinary piece of Gold
","Cloud Atlas is like nothing I've ever seen before. It's a bold cinematic treasure from a brave collaborative filmmaking collective. Mad geniuses Tom Tykwer (Perfume) and the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix) boldly take on David Mitchell's layered epic novel, which connects six generations through the power of storytelling. While not everyone will embrace the overarching theme of spirituality and reincarnation that links the threads of Cloud Atlas together, there is still so much rich material within the tapestry to offer something to just about everyone - regardless of who they are, where they're from, or what their personal beliefs and values are. As stated at the start: this is a unique blockbuster experience and is the type of bold choice in filmmaking that (in my opinion) deserves to be applauded – if for no other reason than the ambitious intent to say something greater about life and experience. Best of all, the journey to that destination touches upon just about every emotion possible – while at the same time challenging both the mind and the eye with big ideas and small (but important) brush strokes of detail. If there was ever a movie that truly engaged the viewer, this is it. At nearly three hours, it does begin to wear on you as it comes down the final stretch, but the payoff at the end is worthwhile – and, dare I say, even beautiful.",10,3,6,18 March 2013
