E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Spielberg's Greatest Love Story
","This was one of the first films I saw at the cinema, all the way back in 1982. I only really appreciated it's wonder and magic several years later. This is not just a science fiction tale it is a beautiful love story between a young boy and his almost imaginary friend.I think the wonder of this film is based around the strong performances by the leads. It has always amazed me that Henry Thomas and the underrated Robert MacNaughton have never made more success of their obvious talent.But this is Spielberg bombarding his audience with emotion. My mum tells me I cried as a 5 year old in the cinema, there is a lump in my throat still now as a 24 year old, though this is due to exhilaration as much as emotion.A great film for everyone a must for Spielberg fans even though there cant be many who havent seen it.",10,1,2,15 October 2001
Forrest Gump," A great film
","Forrest Gump is one of my favourite movies and has to be one of the most feelgood movies of our time. However I feel that people are unnecessarily harsh on the film due to the success it recieved at the academy awards. It beat Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption to the Best Picture Oscar and has been criticised since. All three films are superb movies in their own right, ( Shawshank just shading it as my favourite), and should be enjoyed on their own merits rather than on what they prevented others doing.I may be wrong but I feel a lot of the criticism of the film is due to the academy awards and that if Forrest Gump had won on a different year it would not suffer the criticism it does.Anyway on with the film. Hanks was brilliant as usual and the support players especially Sinise, and Williamson will live long in the memory. OK towards the end there are too manny references on how Forrest misses Jenny ( e.g naming the boat )but overall I think Robert Zemeckis balances out the emotional with the humorous and it is close to a perfect film.1994 was truly a great film and the arguments about who should have won will go on and on, just be grateful that 3 splendid films came out together. It has not happened since.",10,1,2,15 October 2001
American Beauty," fascinating
","American Beauty is a film of real substance with performances right out of the top draw. Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning play the couple who's marriage ended years ago in love if not in writing. The idea of the film is to show you that, people are very good at hiding their true feelings. We the audience are told that Spacey's character is going through a mid-life crisis, yet by the end of the film you feel he is the most sane character there. Superb performance by Spacey and a career best by Mena Suvari as the 'Lolita' like object of Spacey's desire. Benning is also fantastic, if a little over hammy at times. The script is brilliant and it is brought to life by the powerful cast. A top notch film that is worth repeat viewing.",8,0,0,27 August 2002
Saving Private Ryan," moved to tears
","Steven Spielberg is a visionary, I knew that before I went in to see this film at the cinema, however I was not prepared for the opening 20 minutes or so. At the same time it brought the horrors of war and the wonder of film making together at the same time. This is matched with an end battle sequence again that gets the pulses racing and the emotions rising. People have actually complained about the middle segment of the film, claiming it to be clunky, boring and cliche but this is just the unwinding of the plot. The scene where they storm the radar base and capture the German pow is one of the most powerful in the film. Hanks is as always superb but my personal favourite in the film is Tom Sizemore who is the pick of an all round excellent supporting cast, big mentions also to Jeremy Davies and Adam Goldberg who excelled in their roles.",10,0,1,28 August 2002
Hercules," not the strongest
","Hercules is solid fun for all the family. Whilst never reaching the heights of The Lion King or Tarzan. The animation also looks a bit dated now with the arrival of Shrek and Toy Story etc, but Disney has always prided itself on glossy colors and emotional stories. The usual mix of heroic characters and show stealing sidekicks make this a firm entry in Disney's portfolio, but it probably wont live long in the memory.",5,1,4,29 August 2002
Shrek," Brilliant
","This was an excellent take on an old fairytale. The animation was superb and the performances were excellent, especially from Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz. Mike Myers was also good but I was baffled as to why he had made Shrek Scottish! There were so many sequences in this film that made even the hardest nosed adult laugh, none more so than the Rip-off of the Matrix and the karaoke sequence at the end. Very funny.",8,1,2,29 August 2002
