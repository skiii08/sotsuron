The Expendables 2," Fine for a matin√©e I guess....
","The good....Jason Statham. I like anything he does.The rest....This is not a bad movie. I knew what to expect, I got it.I think Charisma Carpenter even at 42 years of age is amazingly hot. Why does she get only about 1 minute if that camera time? Why even have her in it? She was wasted yet again. At least have her in some lingerie or why not even have her in some sexy outfit going on a mission? This is the biggest fault of the movie. More Charisma next time!!!Sorry, but except for Statham and Willis, these guys have dramatically aged. They look really old and tired, just going through the motions. Expendables 3 might be about some terrorists invading their nursing home I'd imagine. I loved all these guys in their prime, but c'mon, it's getting silly, grandpa.VanDamme is a good bad guy. He looks old, too.The best thing is injecting the Chinese girl in this movie. She doesn't really add anything except just a fresh character, but it helped a bit.If you know the drill and just want some boom boom fun, it's decent. If you don't, why would you bother except to gripe to try to make yourself look superior to the masses?",4,36,58,9 September 2012
Mulholland Drive," Garbage..admit it.
","C'mon, quit trying to appear clever and hip. Nobody is watching....just admit it, you don't have a clue what this movie is about. We just want to see the girls nekkid and making out. We can't let people know we are pervs, so we act like this movie is so clever and blah blah blah.Lynch is a hack. He's clever, but he knows he can't write a coherent plot if his life depended on it. He just throws a bunch of red herrings and garbage in his movies that seem funny to him.Nerds try to say he 'let's you draw your own conclusions.' Baloney. The only conclusion is this film means nothing except that Harring and Watts are hot and it's fun to see them making out.",1,5,19,21 May 2012
