The Expendables 2," A missed opportunity for coming to terms with mutual homoerotic desire
","From the outset, the handle-bar moustaches, the glistening biceps, the closeness of the male bonds and the verbal 'bromance' exchanges in admiration of the 'hanging' of each other's 'big weapons', you can be sure to be in for a highly homoerotically-charged action movie, like none other. The desperate desire for intimacy between the characters is almost bursting through their pumped-up swollen veins throughout.Unfortunately, none of the characters ever comes to terms with this forbidden deep corporeal desire for one another and they are thus cursed into a life of externalising these feelings as mindless violence in wiping-out hundreds of non-western people who they cannot see as real humans due to the blindness of their US imperialism and the crisis of their suppressed love and sexual desire for one another.Such a missed opportunity to not allow the underwritten tensions come to the surface in the context of modern action filmmaking.",2,0,0,1 March 2020
