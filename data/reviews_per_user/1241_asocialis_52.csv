Source Code," Best scifi about time travel, extremely motivational!
","This movie has all I expected to see for such title. Dreams, different dimensions, devices, science, government projects, secrets, terrorist... It combines scientific explanation with undiscovered new stuff (fiction). Lots of surprise. Very mysterious and challenging, like chess, puzzles, finding real suspects. Similar to The Commuter (2018) which has similar scenario, in train too, with even same actor Vera Farmiga. Gives us extreme motivation to save lives, enjoy, be more aware, and makes us aware of little enjoyable moments. Somewhat similar to Non-Stop movie too. Very emotional, positive, and about making dreams come true!",10,0,1,24 April 2019
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Mix of Lord of the Rings + Prison Break + Matrix
","I am amazed by this sequel and movie. Although it was more extreme in some things it is still overall same in rating like previous sequels. I am amazed by the two actors from Prison Break tv series and their role being almost same as in that movie (engineer, prisoner, betraying person), and by graphics especially of that large monster, its axe/hammer and buildings, new abilities of umbrella and zombies. But it is too extreme that it just makes it more unreal and not convincing. This sequel tells us that there might be more positive and problem resolving sequels, like light at the end of the tunnel. There were also feelings of hope and excitement with bit of fear. The feelings are somewhat from the above mentioned 3 movies.",9,2,2,23 February 2020
John Wick," almost same as Taken (2008)
","This is same topic and characters as Taken (2008) movie. Meaning male character caring for somebody who is in trouble, making revenge, doing it all by his hands, without help of police or anybody. The only difference with this and that movie is that this one is more focused on action and ego, while that movie more on emotions, reality, and mystery. Very funny, and not boring even for a moment. High quality movie! Similar to later sequels, all are good, can't be compared!",10,0,1,5 December 2019
World War Z," emotional, adventuristic, realistic, but too quick end
","I liked this movie for being emotional, showing us real life relationships such as work relationship, family relationship, and national relations. There is also much effort put into reality, action, including as much people and places as possible. Topic is good, more real like than in other zombie movies. Good inspiration and insight into disease and science. Very scientific and realistic. But zombies still do not look real completely and end is too quick. I expected more story, outcomes, details. This is my 3rd best infection movie.",9,1,1,28 March 2020
12 Monkeys," funny, but nonsense, not for corona virus motivated watchers
","I wanted to watch this just because of corona virus, and I am disappointed. Nobody should watch this except if you wanna lose time on bit funny comedy and psychiatric part and bit of sci-fi in form of time travel. Story is nonsense, not finished, immoral, random, complicated, has nothing to do with pandemic. It was more about joking and some weird dimensions. Meaning sci-fi and comedy part is too strong that everything else is so insignificant in this movie, almost non-existing. Not pandemic, not good story, no conclusion. Overal, bad moie, but still has many funny small parts.",4,2,20,6 February 2020
Orphan," high quality and extreme
","Although I am rewatching it for 3rd or more time, I still like this movie. It is very high quality, and even smallest details are recorded in high quality. Scientific, extreme, scary, realistic, adventurous, interesting, exciting. There is all in one: crime, diseases, conditions, problems, emotions, relationships. All like in real life, just an extreme example. Good topic, good actors, good presentation. Example of perfect thriller. Liked mentioning and appearance of orphanage, hospital, psych ward, police...and good locations, not monotonous like most bad movies.",10,0,0,22 October 2019
Terminator Salvation," Worse than all previous sequels
","I only liked this movie for its technology part, meaning robots are shown in detail. Also not so bad intro and somewhat relationship with hot girl. But everything else is too quick, unexplained, a rush. Lack of previous main actor which now only showed for a minute. Lack of normal things like bars, humans, peace made me not interested in this sequel. Still higher quality than most movies at least because of the technology part. But too heavy, difficult to grasp. Lack of earthly things.",6,1,2,26 December 2019
Resident Evil: Extinction," more realistic and survivalistic than previous sequels
","I liked this sequel for being more about survival and very real, including its zombies, vehicles, nature. Unlike in previous sequels where there was more dark and indoor space, here we could see the landscape and daylight, and everything from all viewpoints like from air and distance. Also more human parts and less scifi parts. Hope to see next sequel. This movie will never be perfect because there are some too fake looking parts, and lacks more mystery and less action. But for its genre, it is perfect. Also nice that locations and story constantly change with each sequel. Except that, nothing special in comparison with previous sequels.",9,2,2,23 February 2020
The Terminator," perfect even today, at least as a sequel
","We can see at the end that this is unfinished business and there must be sequels. That is what I like the most. Without it this movie would not make much sense. Also good topic: time travel. I am amazed by technology and stunts display considering how old this movie is. Better than most today's. The only bit bad thing is unexplained and unreasonable appearance of two guys who chase girl or each other. Although explained somewhat it is still somehow too quick, unexplained, unnatural. Unlike most movies, this one is not better than its later sequels.",10,0,3,19 December 2019
Final Destination 2," bit better than 1st sequel
","I liked that graphical effects were bit better than in 1st sequel. But all together it deserves same rating. For example there are holes in the story, not completely explained, unreliable, and not completed. More like some movie with bit of fun, jokes, graphics, and luck. Too random. Can't get better rating but also can't get worse rating.",7,1,1,28 January 2020
The Godfather: Part II," Old boring drama, can only possibly be enjoyed by older audience
","Just like old songs, maybe only older people born in this movie age could enjoy it. I hate everything, culture, colors, style, dressing, sounds, devices... There is too much ordinary boring political talk. Seriously, more boring that listening to those politicians in any country. I gave it few stars because there are funny parts, a bit of action, etc. But most is just boring. And additional complaint is that this movie lasts 3.5 hours! So long, complicated, bad!",4,1,7,10 May 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," best of the 4 sequels, teaches us humanity
","This one is the better than other 3 sequels with same actor Matt. There is Bourne Legacy which contains some same actors, but I won't compare it with that here because main actor is missing. Of course, others are not much worse than this, they have better intro than this one. But there is more emotions, humanity, forgiveness, trust, justice, honesty, and relationship between people. While no sexual or romantic ones, here is more moral ones. About justice, trust, believe, care, and awareness. There are occurences with two women which could progress into much more stores, relationships, sequels, but unfortunately it did not, as far as I know, because I already watched newer sequels. We can see in many instances how main character is reasonable, moral, and doing stuff out of insight, which I liked. He is in his control. Also we get motivation to do good deeds similar like him, and to know that all is possible, even the most complicated, difficult, suspicious, and unclear stuff.",10,0,0,10 April 2019
Nightcrawler," Goals should be pursued, but only up to limits!
","This movie teaches us to be the best at whatever we want and like to be. Career, skill, knowledge, hobby, whatever. But its safest and will not hurt us to obey laws, rules, limits, and respect others. Movie is filled with lots of crime, police, vehicle, roads, that all look real and professionally recorded. Main character is the best in acting, just like he is in other movies like Source Code. Others are not the worst either. There is lot of reality and relationship stuff here. Like in real life, it shows that there will be always issues with people in form of competition, dealing, extortion, threats, demands, and complaining. We need to set our limits in each of these said aspects. Money, number of people, time, everything is a number and has its limit. Otherwise we may suffer consequences. There is also evidence of prioritized survival and business over relationships and religion and other people, although it may seem evil, it is reality, we are all fighting to survive.",9,0,0,7 May 2019
The Bourne Identity," bit older and therefore worse than Taken (2008)
","This movie lacks some new current technologies and lacks better explanation. Story is obviously incomplete and not fully understood. We can predict that there will be newer sequel based on so quick finish and new characters appearing at the end. Taken (2008) is better than this one because it has better explanation and content is newer (updated) for at least a decade so it makes movie look more real for our current perspective. Bit too much action and too little mystery. And too much boring unnecessary details like expected reactions, talk, relationship between two main characters. Interesting beginning, positive ending, but everything in the middle is too quick, with holes in the story, and more boring. Had middle been like beginning, it would be much better.",9,0,4,3 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," magic adventure
","I liked this movie, which I also watched in childhood, because it feels magical and adventuristic. Meaning, even if unreal, graphics are making magic and unreal things looks very real, unlike in cartoons or some 3d movies. There is feeling of war, fight, adventure, belief, hope. Similar to real life wars but with some more magic and adventure. Mountains, marshlands, mines all have their beautiful advantages and disadvantages. There are bit of feelings of adrenaline and excitement, especially when somebody has to run from enemy and hide. The only bad thing is that this is unfinished and some things are, at least by the story, if not by graphics, too much unreal. But considering that there is sequel, not a big problem. Intro is better than end, because end is sudden, without outro talk like in intro, or any promise, just leaving us with lot of worry, doubt, hope, guess. Cool that characters each have somethings unique and look differently, just like their nations or kingdoms, which makes this easier to remember, associate, and compare. Similar to computer strategy games and games where there are different teams.",9,1,1,6 January 2020
28 Weeks Later," bit worse than 28 days later
","I hated to see that this is too typical zombie movie. It was more about zombies and war than about science and infection. Movie is unclear, confusing, negative, desperate. No clear end. Neither positive nor negative. Many twists make us question of purpose of this movie. Looks more like documentary describing war and disease outcomes. Makes us very tired and disappointed. Better beginning worse end. Overall, boring typical war zombie movie. Lacks more explanation, science, emotions, positivity. Looks like there will be no sequels. Not good to watch. Not inspirational or motivational.",6,0,0,16 March 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," worse than previous sequels
","Still not bad enough, but somehow worse than two previous sequels. Somewhat done in a rush with less explanation and intro. Forgiving for previous sequels watchers, but unforgiving for newcomers. Too fast so it looks unreal, unexplained, and unfinished. Obviously this must have more sequels. Lacks simplicity and details and intro. Actors are bit worse than previous ones. Also bit less emotional and funny. For previous watchers this deserves rating 9/10 but for newcomers much less.",9,0,1,26 December 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," perfect example how old can be good
","I am amazed by story, technology, emotions, and funny things. There is all in this movie. Yet it is very old one. Good actors, discussions, explanations. There are of course imperfections, but so is in real life. Even better than part one. Good ending. Sure, there is negativity, bit fake and low quality stuff, but that is very little compare to how much is good stuff. No wonder there are so many sequels of this movie. It is making us happy, sad, worried, amazed. There is obviously not fully explained or not finished business, but that is what future sequels are for.",10,0,0,20 December 2019
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," more adventurous and positive than two previous sequels
","I am amazed by so much new and positive stuff in this sequel. There are all the beings we hear in fairy tales, and other similar pc games and movies like Nancy Drew and Lord of the Rings like werewolf, dementor, effect of the full moon, magic map, and best of all - time travel. There is constant feeling of excitement, unpredictability, adventure, fun, and hope. So much small funny and realistic stuff, all which reminds me of childhood, jokes, pranks. But unlike in worse movies everything is looking so real and interesting, even the unreal stuff. This movie looks like deep dream, magic, and is enjoyable, probably better than all other sequels.",10,0,0,17 May 2020
The Conjuring 2," Good as previous aka first sequel
","Good. Liked mixing religion and science in horror, exactly like in previous sequel. Good effects, realistic, scary, and nothing is overdone. But like first sequel there is still room for improvement, by convincing us bit more and being bit more realistic and less monotonic. Meaning bit more location, people, variety. Bit more logic, science, causative and not sudden happenings. This is one of rare high quality horrors, but still not perfect. Lot of room for improvement, which I hope to see in soon-to-be released 3rd sequel.",9,0,1,20 October 2019
Resident Evil," good topic, genre, graphics, feelings
","I liked this movie which I watched also long time ago for its feelings of excitement, fear, adventure, hope, intimacy, sexuality, luck. Experience, although somewhat science fiction is more of science part, considering that we don't know the future, so this could be considered possible science in the future, is like that of real life war, riot, survival. The graphics of the monsters are scary and perfect. Except of the zombies which in most cases look fake, and amateur. There are twists, unpredictability, and constant feeling of hope, mercy, and bit sexual because of the presence of two somewhat hot girls. Also realistic and convincing buildings, materials, masks, scientists. The ending is even more fun and although completed with one part, leaving us with even more questions, and motivation to watch the next sequel. Story, although is not completely clear, is explained as movie passes along. I only expected a bit slower movie, less sudden things, and more emotions and better graphics of zombies (human ones). But still better than most movies. Similar to pc game counterparts.",9,1,1,20 February 2020
The Butterfly Effect," Time-travel unclearly explained!
","This is typical time travel scifi. Motivational. But there is lack of explanation, reality, effects, details, and story. Some parts are missing and most stuff is obviously fake, bad effects used. They could have at least more convincing way of time travel, not just something unexplained random. That's what makes it look like movie for kids. But good is the lesson. Lesson is to improve our present and future as much as possible every day, because we won't be able to go back to fix or improve things. There is always something we can do, although we can never do it all. One more complaint about this movie is characters behavior, most of it is unexplained, unreasonable and sick (crazy).",7,0,3,7 May 2019
Liar Liar," funny and emotional
",Good topic and actors too. Perfect for its genre. It is raising our moral and awareness of some basic matters in life which can play a huge deal. Additionally liked this movie for its positive end. Looks realistic too. No complaints.,10,0,1,26 December 2019
Non-Stop," Similar to Commuter (2018)
","This is very good movie. Similar to Commuter (2018) movie. The major difference being that this is happening on the plan, while in that movie it is happening on the train. Good idea, acting, emotional, teaching, high quality. Has some small funny things. Realistic. Raises our awareness about airplane highjacking and similar crimes. Worth watching and rewatching. And very mysterious, that is what was the best part of all, the mystery in the beginning, that causes us to think, figure things out, guess, similar to playing chess or puzzles. I think that air marshals, police, and anybody working with security is gonna like this one. Perfect like most other Liam Neeson's main actor movies.",10,0,0,7 March 2019
28 Days Later...," adventuristic, survivalistic, emotional
","This movie provides us great insight into infection, disease, and especially today's corona virus. Although not completely realistic, it is close to that, giving us insight into one possible outcome. Not perfect, has many amateur, fake, boring parts and acts, but still better than most movies because it is more real and has better topic. Also good because it shows us many locations, all taken from real world, which additionally motivates us to watch. Bit emotional. Best part for me was feelings of hope, for example seeing aircraft two times, which give us good feelings at the end and bit before it. Looks like this may have a better sequel.",7,0,0,13 March 2020
Gone Girl," Too long, about spouse distrust!
","This is one more movie about psychopath, but this time it is woman. And a bit of one man maybe. Love problems, marriage, being a liar, distrust, disappointment, society, crime, suspects, complicated stuff. It teaches us to be more aware of who we fall in love with and who we marry. It is too long, and story is a bit unfinished, it doesn't end clearly, and more likely returns to beginning. If you like drama you should watch this. But if you are looking for thriller, action, crime, you may disappointed by this movie, as it is filled with too much talk and drama. You know, the boring slow useless stuff. For such unclear story, it should definitely lasted at least as twice as shorter than it really is. I liked the topic, that is relationships and psychopaths, and in that such things are reality. This film is reality. There are emotions like hope, trust, hate, anger, and disappointment. Downside is that this lasts too long, meaning requires a lot of time and energy to watch.",5,1,2,25 April 2019
Get Out," funny, scary, weird, discrimination and exploitation
","I liked this movie for presenting us in funny, scary, and ironic way the discrimination (racial) and exploitation of people. It has many funny and weird small events in form of odd behaviors which are the best part of the movie. There is also the presence of variety of people, location, police which makes this movie not that boring and empty like some worse others. I also liked the presence of typical modern stuff like girlfriend, friends, smartphone, laptop, cars, jokes, and variety of unique characters, all of which we can associate with real life counterparts of todays modern age. Also I liked that movie is very detailed and graphic. The talk is clear, minimum, and details are easily notced, for example the manners, devices, software, nature, characteristics of characters. Ending is also although not perfectly solved, still interesting and filled with excitement and other feelings. From when I first watched this movie in 2017 and then again in 2020, it did not leave any different impression than the first time. Not perfect, but definitely a higher quality movie, much better than most todays movies which are somehow unclear, blurry, and not understandible. This is one of those movies that give everybody the creeps. Most characters looks so real and genuine, for example the woman psychiatrist looks like typical psychiatrist, hypnotiser, mom, rich woman...guests look like guests...friends like friends. They all act unique, immersed, and give the impression and association of being real.",8,0,3,8 February 2020
Ghost Rider," perfect and easy to remember childhood action movie
","I am watching it for 10th time probabucly, and experience is almost same as the first time. Perfect childhood movie and comic. Similar to other famous comics and movies of most people's childhood like Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Spider Man, Batman, Power Rangers. Not so ideal for grown ups because of too much graphics effects which are too fake. But still good enough, has all the elements one movie should have: emotions, adventure, challenges, graphics, hero, secrets, surprises, reason, purpose. Best for lovers of action genre and comics readers.",9,1,1,25 June 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," best movie about magic
","I liked this movie just a bit less than in childhood because it has some magical feelings and scenarios. Emotional, bit funny, adventuristic, unpredictable, realistic. Motivates us to be warriors or soldiers and motivated me to play similar pc games like cossacks, age of empires, stronghold, warcraft... Cool story, beings, devices, weapons. Historic and teaching, like good presentation of the history. And the 4 hour length movie is ideal for such a good movie, in fact it is too short, therefore no wonder there are sequels.",10,0,0,12 January 2020
Schindler's List," Fifty Fifty
","This movie is half good, half bad. Since I like newer movies, and don't know how people lived before, and don't like old times, that would be major reason why it is bad. There is lack of technology, colors, all the new stuff we got used to. If you are watching this because of Taken and Liam Neeson, I will tell you, it's worse than that, but not the worst. The good half part of this movie is good actor Liam Neeson, good effort to make it real (so many people and so much effort to make it look real). My advice is to watch this only if you like Liam Neeson (because of Taken) or if you like this genre. You won't be disappointed, even when much younger, Liam still looks like in Taken. And I prefer his role in action, thriller, mystery movies. Good movie for people especially teachers who like history, drama, biography, documentary. This movie's main topics are history, war, jews, world war, and evil.",5,1,14,25 April 2019
I Am Legend," good, but not finished
","I liked that there were emotions in form of relationship between humans, zombies, animals. Also nice landscape, action, story, intro. Nice idea such as that zombies are sensitive to light, performing experiments on them, and even bit human. But bad that story is not fully explained and not finished. We do not know what will happen in the end, and names of medications etc. Could be better maybe with more people and more drama. We do not even know is medication really working and are zombies really good or healed. Still too many questions and holes.",7,0,0,26 March 2020
The Bourne Legacy," good movie and actors, but can't replace Matt (Bourne)
","Can't be replacements or continual of previous The Bourne Ultimatum. We can see that this is totally different movie, and not substitute for the old sequels. So movie by itself is good, just like actors. There is emotions, humanity, reality, and surprise. Adventurous, good intro, good end. Even end music is same as in previous sequels. But it will never be like realot Bourne where actor is Matt. This is just another good movie which is just not really replacement for original one, but alternative. Good alternative. Very realistic, deals with real life issues although with small bit of sci-fi chemicals.",8,0,1,10 April 2019
Unknown," perfect intro and idea, funny, good actors
","This is another perfect Liam Neeson's movie, another two being the Taken sequels and Commuter (2018). There are so much small funny things. There are emotional and facial reactions and expressions that make it very interesting movie. Most actors are perfect. There are few things that could be better explained and make more sense, but considering the movie length it is not a big deal. Doctors looked like real doctors, and security and police looked like real. Unlike in most other newer bad movies. Adventurous. Perfect. Almost nothing is missing.",10,1,1,6 March 2019
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," similar to previous (first) sequel
","Nothing special to say here in comparison to 1st sequel. Scary, explained, graphic, high quality, good topic, good actors. The only reason I can't rate this max is because I would prefer more mystery, thinking, emotions, instead of too much action. Maybe bit worse than first sequel because it happens too fast.",9,4,6,21 February 2020
Prisoners," Worth rewatch, good for detectives, good actors.
","I rewatched this from few years ago, and it still wasn't boring. The only drawback is its negativity, and no clear ending. You won't get bored, and there are intense moments, characters are realistic, serious, honest, familiar, famous. I remember characters from this movie in few other good movies, at least that detective and boy. Also it teaches us lesson to be more aware of our real life sorroundings, people, crime and motivates us to do good deeds, protect ourselves, be conscious, smart, etc. The only stuff I did not like was bit unfinished and quick ending and too difficult detective work.",9,0,0,28 April 2019
The Dark Knight," for kids only, worse than spiderman
","I think this is movie about so-called batman. I expected to see batman word in title. Basically there is too much action and lack of science and story. Everything happened too fast, too many twists, and like a game only. Weaker emotions than in Spiderman. No explanation. Too random. No details how some things and why they happened. Unfinished, meaning there will be more sequels obviously. Overally I am disappointed, even tough I heard for word batman long time ago. Not worth rewatching or watching newer sequels. Except if you are kid, like only action, and do not care about explanation and details.",4,0,9,18 April 2019
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," similar to previous sequel, not as good as first 3 ones
","Nothing special to see in this sequel than what was expected. Maturing, story resolving, getting ready for more. Not as complicated or extreme as previous sequel, meaning more easy to understand and adapt to. This one and previous sequel can't be compared to first three ones, but still good enough. For example Dumbledore sounded more cool, authoritative, confident in 1st 3 sequels than in this one. Bit disappointing to not see Filch not reacting enough or explaining his behavior to listen to just about any headmaster or order, and some stories not finished like what happened to expulsion, final ratings of homes, cantaurs and Hagrid's brother...",9,0,1,18 May 2020
Taken," motivational movie about human trafficking, worth rewatching each year
","One of the best and maybe the best movie. Can be rewatched at least once each year, and won't get boring. Contains all elements of real life like emotions, problems, crimes, facts, realistic behavior... Extremely inspirational and motivational. Raises our awareness to real life problems like human trafficking and kidnapping. As if movie was not acted but real happenings recorded secretly from real person, except in few rare extreme occurrences. This one is the best of the 3 sequels. And if you wanna watch something similar, I would recommend Commuter (2018) by the same actor Liam Neeson.",10,0,0,1 March 2019
Limitless," Sometimes we need support until it we form a habit!
","This is typical scifi movie about superpowers. These superpowers are what everybody is interested in, and reason why movie is good. I recognized one actor from Transporter movie I think. Then there is lesson or insight. Lesson is that we need some support in the beginning of anything great, be it in form of magical potion, drugs, medications, people, book, internet, family, wheelchair, prosthesis, or any object or advantage. But we do not need it forever, because later everything becomes a habit. Like a little bird learning to fly, it only needs its parents while it's still small. Our brain builds neural pathways, so called plasticity of brain. There are scenes of survival, relationships, enemies, and all as we can expect in real life. Had it a little more mystery and details, could be rated best.",8,0,0,7 May 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," perfect magic movie, just like Lord of the rings
","I am amazed by this movie even after rewatching it so many years after it's release. Although it is better for kids and was better at time it was released and at times when pc game and books was released, and is best for those who previously read books or played games, it is not a disappointment for adults or people who hear for it for the first time, even if late. There is so much stuff why this is enjoyable. Magic, adventure, emotions, relationships, comparison and analogous to real world, and associative with religion. For example it reminded me of religious history and explanations of various invisible worlds that our eye can't see, and which is presented in this movie better than in any religious book probably. Exciting realistic and graphics are the most realistic and best. Even newest movies in 2020 are not comparable by so ralistic graphics to this one.",10,0,0,14 May 2020
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," mature and developing, but not good intro and feeling
","I am ama amazed that this sequel could be put into existence in the first place, because compared to book here we had to finally see real Voldemort, the scariest creature in this whole series. And unfortunately that part looked somehow too quick and not convincing and real enough. Not serious enough like in the book, and too quick happening. Also this sequel lacks good intro which previous sequels had better. Instead too mature, like it requires some previous experience to get adapter to this sequel, experience we could not get in previous sequel. Too random events, too complicated and less explained stuff. Worse than previous 3 sequels because it is not simple enough.",9,0,0,17 May 2020
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," perfect and more mature sequel and similar to Lord of the Rings sequels
","This movie and sequel is similar in development to Lord of the Rings sequels, the similar magic movie. There are more mature characters. which are ironically having the same situation in their real life outside of acting. Therefore very convincing and realistic. Although bit too amateur for adult watchers, it is perfect for it's release date and best for people who already read a book, played a game, and watched previous sequel. Bit more complicated and mature than 1st sequel, but nothing too much, too quick, or too harsh.",10,0,0,14 May 2020
Inception," Similar to Matrix sequels
","This is very similar to Matrix. Just like in that movie, in this movie too, there is too much complicated, unknown, unsolved, difficult, unpredictable stuff. Just like Matrix, you have to rewatch this movie at least once more to understand it. And coupled with length of over 2 hours, that makes watching this movie very demanding and energy intensive. Only people who have much time and science and math should watch it. Most people, probably like me, will not have enough time and do not like complicated stuff. It's probably more than that, meaning not only complicated, but unexplained. Nothing to figure out really, but leave it mysterious and unknown as it is. I also did not like it for it length, I prefer shorter movies, so one less rating star there. What I did like is that this movie is very emotional, positive enough, and has good ending. There are feelings of hope, love, faith, salvation. Although most of movie is abnormal, filled with weird physical laws and happenings, it is normal enough at the beginning and ending. Comparable to real life dreaming. That makes it look real. But considering that most of movie is filled with unreal part which is middle, it is not good enough. I think reality part should have lasted more, and there is missing explanation, details, and even ending is mysterious unfinished, although positive feeling.",7,1,3,27 March 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Shall be considered Prison Break season 0
","When I seen this movie in Top250, I could not believe it, thought it was a joke. It is probably some boring old movie, maybe even without colors. But I was amazed. Similar to Prison Break series, just older version of it. Adventure, Lesson, Inspiration, Motivation, Insight, Experience, Confidence, Emotions...all in one. Good ending too. It lacks nothing. It teaches us to fight for freedom, and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards, but freedom from people, diseases, poor life, anything negative or bad. It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it.",10,0,0,10 May 2019
The Conjuring," good, but not perfect
","This is one of higher quality horror movies. Bit funny, religious, scientific, realistic. Good how evil or scifi part is associated with religion and science. Funny and realistic effects, graphics, ideology. In few moments causes high emotional reaction like hope, belief, and questioning our sanity and morals. Unfortunately I did not like that everything somehow happened very quickly, such as everything already starting to happen from the first day without enough details and intro into life of more characters. Also at few moments does not sound real enough, which could have been supported by more reasons, science, story. Meaning few holes in the story and bit too fast. Good actors, they look immersed into all of it. Also noticed those are actors from other cool movies.",9,0,1,19 October 2019
Taken 2," almost as perfect as first sequel, just a bit more harsh
","This is one more perfect movie. It's continuation of Taken (Taken 1) by same main actor Liam Neeson. Very realistic, with real world places, customs, traditions, religions, rules. The only thing why this movie is not better than 1st sequel is lack of good introduction and a bit too harsh bahavior. Meaning same but with more violence and less emotions and talk. It still does not deserve less than 10 stars rating. Positive ending, inspirational, motivational. Raises our awareness for real life problems, criminals, and 'shady' places. For those who liked such movie I recommen to watch 2 more sequels (Taken 1 and Taken 3). And if they are tolerant to different actors and story, but same title and topic, to watch Taken (tv series).",10,0,1,1 March 2019
Bruce Almighty," perfect topic
","I liked this movie the most for its topic. I always wanted to see some movie about science of life and something meaningful and realistic such as purpose, love, God, all the topics which this movie is based on. Also good 3 main actors. I've been rewatching this for some time, but can say that although it may seem bit unreal for todays age and older population who know difference between fake and real, I can say it is ideal for bit younger population and religious people interested in God. The age I watched it for the first time. Emotional and human. Also Morgan Freeman has that specific godly look which made him maybe the most interesting actor here. And Jennifer is for emotions. And Jim is for fun.",10,0,0,19 December 2019
Final Destination," extremely good topic, but not the best acting
","Perfect general, scientific, religious topic. Something I always was curious about. The topic of destiny, could it be changed, could it be avoided. I think this should also be classified as sci-fi movie. But except topic movie is not that well presented, because most things are boring, too dramatic and annoying. Meaning, nothing special to see except the main topic and scenes depicting it. Had this been explained as some higher quality movies or better actors, could be perfect, for example like Source Code and The Commuter movies by Vera Farmiga and other famous actors.",7,0,0,27 January 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," best movie about age of kings
","This movie best describe something i would call age of kings or castle age. Similar to computer games like Age of Empires, Cossacks, Stronghold. It motivated me to play such games because they are very similar to movie. It is emotional, realistic, moral, cultural, religious, adventuristic, magical. It reminds me of those religions such as Qur'an and movies about religions and religious war, but also other types of wars like national. Although most things in the movie are unreal, they can be compared to real life analogues such as habits, culture, manners. Everything and everybody looks so real and this is not a low quality movie. I am amazed that there is vast number of newer but worse convincing and looking movies. This one looks like it is ahead of its abilities for that time (year 2003). Meaning, even today I am amazed by graphics, quality, reality of it all. Good history lesson and good religious inspiration. It inspired me to never give up, to fight for something better, to be prepared in advance, and to not get discouraged. This movie is probably the most interesting to those interested in history, because despite most thing being fake, it shows us great deal of history, including buildings, weapons, nations, behaviors, technology, nature - like it indeed was. There is some magical feeling at the end that feels out of this world and could be best described as inspiration and insight into the victory, freedom, success, relief.",10,1,2,14 January 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," ahahahaha
","This is better than most comedies. So funny. I liked seeing small funny things like sarcasm, extremes, and talk. Like driving broken car, shooting secretly each other in public places, and acting like nothing happened even worst things happen, and crying over emotional things, yet not after being physically hurt. Also funny how people have culture in their talk, even during biggest revenges. Some parts are better than 1st sequel, if not whole movie. High quality acting, actors, sounds, locations, video. Bit unreal at the ending like all people listening order of only one person, like they are not accidentally on strees, ordinary passengers. Liked seeing John Abbruzzi from Prison Break series. Similar to Taken (2008) and its sequels, just bit more action and fun, and less emotions and mystery.",10,0,0,30 November 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," good as 1st sequel, in bit different way
","Reason why I rated this 9 stars is because overall it is good as The Bourne Identity. But while this time there was bit less adventure and more action. Meaning less talking and more running. I did not like that beginning and ending such as explanation of killing of his wife and explanation of him killing somebody's parents was too quick, without details and not convincing. Reactions were bland, inappropriate, and too short. We could not even see what really happened to dead bodies and other details. There were opportunity where it could be more interesting like when other character realized that he is watching her, but it ended up too quickly, not so interesting. So good, but could be better, maybe if this lasted half more hour, which I would like.",9,0,0,8 April 2019
The Godfather," Unfinished unclear, can't believe this is top250
","Basically you see messy things like killings, distrust, disappointment, suspicious people and stories, sudden things, and it does not seem like it has ending, neither positive nor negative. Ending is like beginning, except that this time it is his son. Very negative and long. Not worth watching! Maybe good for older audience, as movie is old too. Old times, no devices, cars, or anything new I got used to.",4,4,10,10 May 2019
