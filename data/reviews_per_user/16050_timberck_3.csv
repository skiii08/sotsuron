The Blair Witch Project," Totally overrated, 20 minute film stretched to 90 minutes
","Totally Overrated!  This would make a pretty good student film, but that's about it.  It certainly shows what hype can do.  The story is only good for about 20 minutes, then you're just waiting for the end...nothing new happens after the first act.  The kids get lost and stay lost for the remaining 40 minutes.  The acting is not bad, but the characters are hateful people that you're sick of being with after about 1/2 hour.  The worst thing is that the film isn't scary!  It's hyped as a horror film, but there's no fear!  This is mostly due to the distracting camera work and the stupidity of the characters and their situation.  Anyone with half a brain could get out of that forest.  Because the characters are irritating, and stupid, you lose all sympathy with them, and then your suspension of disbelief goes away as well.  I saw the film with an audience of suburban teenagers (the target audience), but they were obviously bored, too.  One guy made the loud comment 'Is that IT?' when the movie finally ended.  Overhyped for sure!",2,0,2,18 December 1999
Once," Hmmmm
","This is a film that badly needed an editor and even more badly needed a cinematographer. All I could think while watching the film is 'Imagine what this film could have been'. It was an interesting concept that failed. The performances were good, and it had some 'moments', but no story of any significance and no reason to really care. I read that the project started as a music video and 'grew' into a movie. Well, that explains it's problem. It's a 5 minute film that runs for 88 minutes. I have a feeling this is like 'the emperor with no clothes'; the hype makes people believe that it should be good, so then think it must be good.",2,9,26,6 December 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," LOTR should not have been made into and Action film
","Unfortunately, as good as the film is, and as 'accurately' as Middle Earth' has been portrayed, Peter Jackson has made an action film of Lord of the Rings.  This is not the spirit of the book, nor Tolkein's intent, I am sure. The film has obviously been geared to teenage audiences to the detriment of the atmosphere and intent of the book, which is much more about fantasy, magic, history and depth of character than it is about sword fighting and kickboxing.  I am afraid that the film has been over-hyped, due to it's visual splendor, but it is not Lord of the Rings.I had a gut feeling, when I heard that Peter Jackson was hired to direct the film, that it was not going to be 'right'.  He is simply too focused on blood, gore and snappy action.  Fight sequences that should have had 10 orcs and been a simple scuffle had 100 orcs and lasted for 20 minutes, while important character development and story points in between were rushed so fast that you missed the moment.I am sure the film is great for those who have either once-read, not read or have basic knowledge of LOTR, but if you have really read, re-read, researched and come to understand the Trilogy on all it's levels, the film will be a disappointment.",7,0,1,14 January 2002
