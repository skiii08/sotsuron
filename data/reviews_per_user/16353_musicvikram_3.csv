Fifty Shades of Grey," Couldn't deliver theme
","A movie with shear example of failure of direction. The theme is not delivered. Anastasia keep rolling in waiting for changes in Christian but he finally changed half or quarter of what expected. Anastasia been shown such a stupid , dumb, moron that keep going submissive for christian.. That's odd storyline.. Again boredom continued in sequelae in Dark & Freed.. ohhhh such timewasters..",2,0,2,30 January 2019
Green Book," Human Nature explained
","Well as we get at some point in life that once our Human Nature/Character is developed it gets fixed forever whatsoever comes in way as influence it won't change... The movie is about the very human nature that makes change in character of these two guys Don & Tony by mutual behaviour at stage of midlife.. interesting to see how they retaliate it & enjoy the karavan..
Though the racism is revolving around but it doesn't impact much on liking the movie as it progresses.. Afterall it's our very lovely instinct of forgiving & accepting others is crucial to live happily..merry Christmas",9,0,0,26 March 2020
