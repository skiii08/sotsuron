Mission: Impossible III," Stop making these now!
","The original Mission impossible TV series was fun, and involved disguises and villains being fooled. The film series started in the same way, but this latest offering was just a vehicle for average special effects, a worn story line and some very average acting.The series has now run its course and Tom Cruise et al should move on. He can be a fine actor, and should perhaps move to a genre where he can demonstrate his ability.My viewing pleasure was also spoiled on the DVD I bought as it kept freezing. It is ironic that Paramount issues countless warnings about piracy but produce dvds where production quality is below average. Yes, I could have returned it for a new one, but would paramount pay for my time and effort - no way.Altogether a poor experience and I am so glad I never went to the cinema to see it.",4,4,7,10 November 2006
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Very poor
","Not sure this adds anything. It is disjointed, there is some appalling acting, and too much mumbling. The picture is dimly lit, there is far too much cgi (including the infamous cgi mask of Peter Cushing) and quite frankly the story often makes no sense. Perhaps Sir Alec Guinness was right when he thought the Star Wars trilogy was tosh. If only it had stopped at the trilogy. Now it's just about making more and more money.",6,6,11,18 April 2017
Battleship Potemkin," Very dated now but a very good piece of propaganda
","I first saw this film when it was shown on the BBC for the first time in the seventies. I remember it being a real event, and feeling very sophisticated as I watched it.The reality today is a very dated film that is 90% fiction, with wooden acting and unbelievable events. However, it is of interest to me as a Naval historian and researcher, and the conditions it depicts are typical of the time. Of course, the German High Fleet and the Royal Navy didn't mutiny but conditions on board their ships were similar. It is also of interest for the filming of the small sail boats that go out to the Potemkin with provisions. Hundreds of them and it is an important film record of the type of craft still being used in the 1920s.As for the rest, so much of it never happened but it is etched onto peoples minds so much that people visit Odessa expecting to see a plaque or a statue commemorating the massacre on the steps.Once you know the true history I think the film loses some of its impact but as an example of film making, of its time, it will always be studied and commented on. Definitely worth watching but prepare to be a little disappointed.",7,12,18,17 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Why all the hype - its not that good
","The strength of the early star wars films was the novelty and the acting. The heavy reliance on CGI for episodes 1 and 2 mean that the acting has taken second place and there is no novelty value as we know how the story turns out and there are very few new characters in episode 2.I saw the film with someone who has never seen the original trilogy, but has seen a tape of episode 1. This means they don't know how the story turns out. However, they simply weren't enthralled the way we all were 25 years ago.That's not to say the film isn't fun, but it drags a bit in places and I found myself wanting the boredom to end with a bit more action. However, the action is not always that well done with some continuity problems.I seem to one of the only reviewers who liked episode 1, as there was novelty and good acting. There is neither in episode 2, and Ewan McGregor in particular fails to convince. I agree with another reviewer that Yoda is the best actor, but even this role has changed since the early films. I suspect Yoda was not CGI in the seventies and the added texture of a muppet made for a more convincing screen presence.Episode 3 will have to be very very good, with less CGI and more acting to convince me that these prequels have been worth the hype. Incidentally, it is worth remembering that the acting in the early pictures came from relatively unknown thespians, if one forgets Sir Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing. Perhaps Mr Lucas should take this into account when casting episode 3. Famous luvvies do not always make a good picture.",5,0,0,12 June 2002
Divergent," Harry potter with guns
","Utter rubbish with that Hollywood veneer that tries to make the film look more thought provoking than it is. The initial faction sorting reminds me of the sorting hat scene from the first Harry Potter movie. Indeed, I wonder if JK Rowling should sue for royalties. The acting of the lead characters is also as dire as the kids acting in Harry Potter, and Kate Winslett just goes through the motions to earn a pay check.The film ends in an equivocal way with one of those annoying voice overs that is supposed to make you leave the cinema thinking you have just watched something deep and meaningful. You haven't. This is just a Hollywood formulaic shoot em up movie aimed at kids and I regret wasting 2+ hours of my time watching it.",4,0,0,11 August 2014
The Men Who Stare at Goats," clear your mind,ignore the reviews and enjoy
","Very few films over the years have given me good belly laughs but there are moments in this film that had me in stitches. It doesn't take it self seriously but still manages to comment on the American War Machine in a thoughtful and self deprecating fashion.It has a lot of in jokes and the actors are all superb and believable. The power of some very simple dialogue is astonishing and as all intelligent films should, it leaves the viewer to comment rather than forcing opinions on the audience.This is a must see film that is difficult to categorise as it is a war film, serious yet a comedy. Get the DVD, settle down to watch it with friends and have a great night in.",9,2,3,17 May 2010
American History X," Powerful film with multi layered messages
","One of the stand out films of the last few years made strong by great acting from everyone, superb direction and outstanding photography.The film left me with as many questions as answers. Is the USA really torn along racial lines, can someone with such a hate filled and violent background have reformed so quickly, and many more.One of the first questions I ask after watching any film is 'has this been a good use of my time'. the answer is yes to this film - 2 hours well spent.My only concern is the Avery Brooks character who seems a little too good to be true, but if such men exist then it is a better world. However, in some ways he can be seen as every bit as manipulative as the Stacy Keach character, albeit for the forces of good. In the world I live in people are seldom so clear cut.",8,0,3,10 January 2011
Tigerland," really worthwhile watching
","I never heard of this film until the video shop offered it.An excellent film that is right up there with platoon and full metal jacket. Acting is good, excellent camera work and superb direction.The script has the odd cliche but doesn't that just relect the cliche that is the USA.",9,0,0,25 March 2002
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Standard fare, rent it don't buy it.
","All pretty predictable but an enjoyable way to kill a couple of hours. It's not a film I will ever watch again unless stuck on a plane.The acting is perfect for the genre, the direction and effects very good. However, there is nothing that inspires and allows the imagination to work. I can only assume Simon Pegg was cast to provide light relief but his character, whilst well played, is out of place and belongs in a Johnny English film.If you really want to buy it, wait a couple of years as it will be heavily discounted in the supermarkets. Let's hope there are no more IMF films as the franchise has run it's course.",6,2,5,4 May 2012
Beasts of No Nation," Very convincing and painful to watch
",Very difficult to watch at times as it is so harrowing but this is a must see film that brings home the viciousness and terror of war. Iris Elba was very brave to take this part and his acting and that of all the cast is top notch.Made on a low budget by today's standards it has the gloss of a Hollywood film and the rawness of an Indy. Hollywood will never tackle such difficult subjects with the same aplomb. Politicians in the West and the East need to watch this and begin to understand the tragedy that is still unfolding in parts of Africa.I highly recommend this film.,9,2,4,20 October 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not as good as I hoped for
","It was always going to be difficult to equal the fellowship, and the two towers doesn't.I have now seen it three times and I really do enjoy it. However, some of the scenes and the dialogue are so awful that should never have seen the light of day.The ongoing Antipodean joke about Dwarf tossing is simply unnecessary, and why does John Rhys Davies do the voice of Treebeard. Indeed it is the Ents that were the most disappointing part for me. They were always going to be difficult, but I found their deevelopment as characters superficial and the storyline fluctuated between being true to Tolkein and expediency.I will see this film again and again because I really do like it, but I suspect many attracted to the story by the fellowship will be put off by this attempt at developing the story. And as for Legolas skateboarding down the stairs on shield - it just isn't needed.",7,0,0,7 March 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Best film I have seen for a long while
","Maybe its my age, but I haven't seen a film so poignant for years. The acting is superb, the script is full of surprises.I went to see this because I love Boxing and boxing movies. This is not a boxing movie, and Clint Eastwood is on top form both as Actor and Director. Morgan Freeman just goes from strength to strength, and Hillary Swank pulls off an acting performance that must have been both physically and emotionally demanding.This would have been a 10 but for the simpleton character in the Gym who is not believable. Such characters exist in real life, but my experience is that Gyms never let them be ridiculed or bullied. It was also less than germain to the plot and a distraction with a highly predictable outcome.I just wonder why I took so long to get around to seeing it.",9,0,0,1 July 2005
Logan," Too many unanswered questions
","A good film with a lot of positives. Jackman is on fine form and Patrick Stewart brings all his acting talent to the party. Dafne Keen is extraordinary in her role as Logan's 'daughter' and I'm sure we will see much more of her in the years to come.On the negative side I thought there were parts of the film that were mumbled, Stephen Merchant was simply wrong in his role and as much as I love Richard e Grant, he was out of place and not at all convincing. I was left with questions over the virus that was destroying mutants and the serum that temporarily restoring powers. In fact, I'm not even sure I've got that right.Spoiler - I don't believe for one moment that Logan won't rise from his grave and I believe Jackman has said that wolverine will return but without him. So, the Marvel universe continues but I am left with the feeling it is getting a bit tired.",7,1,4,12 July 2017
The Dark Knight," Best Batman movie yet but..............
","This is a very well made movie that takes the dark side of the caped crusader to new places. The DC comic hero of my fifties/sixties childhood is unrecognisable in this reworking of the story.The action is non-stop, the effects are the very best and the acting is excellent from all the players, with Michael Caine, as usual, acting everyone off the screen.My two criticisms are the way in which Batman adopts a deeper huskier voice than his Bruce Wayne alter ego, and the loudness of the music over the dialogue, particularly towards the end of the film. Perhaps it is my late middle age hearing, but at least 3 of the characters adopt a deep husky pitch to their voices and its just not needed. As for the music, maybe it was just the London Cinema I was in, but some tweaking is needed.Much has been written about the late Heath ledger's performance and it is excellent and very scary. Too bad he's not around for the next one. RIP - he will be missed.",8,3,8,14 August 2008
Green Street Hooligans," Nice tight film showing the worst of Britain
","For the purist there is plenty not to like about this film, such as the police always turning up late, the easy way in which an inter city train is stopped, and the way in which people recover so quickly from brawls and hangovers.However, I have live in the area depicted for all of my life (over 50 years), and the film accurately portrays the way in which seemingly decent and well educated people can be pulled into gang warfare.Elijah Wood's performance was a revelation for me, but the British supporting cast is excellent and I hope we see a lot more of Charlie Hunnam who is on form throughout.The film is tightly directed and a must see for anyone interested in understanding one of Britain's less publicised sub cultures.",7,0,0,31 December 2007
War Machine," Nice try but doesn't quite hit the mark
","This is a well cast satire with Brad Pitt looking like a young George Peppard playing Hannibal Smith. And that's part of the problem. This film is all Brad Pitt and the writers have given him some pretty thin material.The Film can't make its mind up whether it is a satire based on real events or a docu drama. It's brave of a US film maker to produce a piece that shows the stupidity of US involvement in overseas wars, how they don't learn from mistakes and how no matter what happens, PR is paramount and never let the truth get in the way of a good story.Whatever the press releases say, this is based on real events and although the real military personnel might have lived and acted differently, the involvement of Rolling Stone Magazine, the disconnect by the White House, and the difficulties faced by troops on the ground and the Afghan population are well portrayed.However, there is a sharpness missing and the laughs of something like Bluestone 42 are missing. I think this is worth watching but it feels too long and at the end of it I wasn't left wanting to watch it again, or with any moral questions.",7,2,4,6 June 2017
Taken," disjointed and mindless
","Its a real shame that an actor of Liam Neesom's talent can't be given better scripts. The dialogue is hackneyed and the film just relies on action and fight scenes of the type seen in a thousand other movies.This is exactly the sort of film Steven Segal would star in and the only thing stopping this going straight to DVD is the presence of Mr Neesom.This film could have been so much better if the Director hadn't tried to pack so much in, and only American's must believe that you can run up such an impressive body count and then just get a commercial flight back to the USA.There are much better films dealing with Eastern European gangsters and much better action films. Only watch this if you have time to waste.",5,3,6,6 March 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not worth the price of a cinema ticket
","Again, too much CGI and no real acting. What acting there is came over as laughable, and not just because the actors had a weak script. It is a long time since I have been in a cinema where the audience laughed at how bad an actor is. This Darth Vader is as scary as a cardboard cut out in a well lit room.To say that fantasy is not believable might seem like a contradiction, but the Princess giving up the will to live when she has two new born children makes no sense. Surely she would have cared for them, or drowned them at birth.Please, please, please, no more star wars films.",5,2,4,1 July 2005
The Great Escape," The perfect war film
","This film has everything, great music, great acting and a script that allows humour to temper a very serious story based on true events. From a British point of view, the Steve McQueen character is a little unbelievable, but it wouldn't be the film it is without him and the great motor cycle sequence.This film is full of character actors, some of whom went onto bigger and better movie roles but as an entire cast, the blend has rarely been bettered.Elements of the script show up in everyday conversation, and in identifying characters within your own business you will be able to ascribe characters from this film to their personalities. Who is the scrounger in your office, who is the forger etc.A must see film",10,1,4,29 July 2008
Annihilation," Confused
","I watched this whilst waiting for a dental appointment. Turns out the dental appointment was more enjoyable.This film is a waste of good actors and also gives space to some very average ones. The script is confused, the dialogue is stilted and delivered so slowly throughout the film, I can't help wondering if 5e whole sorry mess could be 30 minutes shorter.Ultimately the director must take responsibility. This is a film masquerading as clever - don't be taken in by the hype. It is a bore fest",5,5,11,12 March 2018
Braveheart," Complete historical balderdash
","It is simply wrong to pervert history in the way this film does. Reading the reviews, the many American reviewers seem to believe it as an accurate representation. It isn't. It takes more liberties that a Walter Scott novel The acting is also very mixed. The Irish accent of the actor playing the father of Wallace shines through for instance, and Gibson's attempt as a Scottish accent is almost on a par with Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Beautifully filmed with some fine performances (eg Brian Cox) it also has a haunting score, and it has entered movie history with so many of its effects and sayings entering popular culture, like Scots sports fans painting their faces blue. But it is tosh. Hardly any of it happened, the time line is way out and Gibson is far to short to play Wallace who was a giant of a man. For me, the reaction of Americans who constantly seek imaginary roots only goes to prove that as a nation they are on the dimmer side of average. Enjoy the film as a fairy tale but just remember it is a fairy tale.",5,3,5,9 June 2016
