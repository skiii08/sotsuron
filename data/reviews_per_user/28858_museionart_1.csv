Raiders of the Lost Ark," A script so tight you can bounce a quarter off it.
","A perfect storm of creative forces, acting and production talent. This is the Little B Movie That Could. A career peak for Spielberg, Lucas, Williams, Allen and Ford - whose careers are full of high points. One of the most rewatchable films ever shot. I must have seen this on the big and small screens a hundred times. Never gets boring.",10,0,0,27 February 2020
