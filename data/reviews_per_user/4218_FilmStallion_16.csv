The Avengers," Avengers...3 out of 4 Skittles
","You can sum up Avengers in one wordFUN. Some of the world's greatest comic book characters all together in one movie, kicking ass to save us puny humanswho wouldn't want to see that? And as great as it is to see the Avengers come together to save the world, some of the most fun is had when they butt heads and pound on each other just like in the comics. Iron Man vs. Thor, Thor vs. Hulk, Iron Man vs. Captain America.great stuff.Director Joss Whedon does a solid job showcasing all the Avengers without forcing too much story into one movie. Rounding out the individual superhero movies that have been leading up to this was no easy challenge. From Jon Favereau's good Iron Man movies, to the marginal Captain America, and the abysmal Thor pic. Whedon molds the good and bad that he had to work with from the past stories and made an entertaining film.I'm not so sure I would crown The Avengers as the top comic book movie of all time (which is currently still The Dark Knight in my mind), but it was a blast seeing all the Marvel characters finally uniting in the same movie. I can only hope that all the movies this blockbuster season are this much fun.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",7,3,7,6 September 2012
Men in Black 3," Men In Black 3...2.5 out of 4 Skittles
","The third installment brings the original cast (Smith & Jones) and director (Sonnenfeld) back together for one more romp of alien fun, and delivers exactly what is expected. If you are a fan of the MIB franchise, then you will probably enjoy this one. If you aren't a fan...then you might want to sit this one out.Was a third installment of this highly profitable film necessary? The answer is easily no. Completing the Men In Black trilogy doesn't feel very epic, but what it does do is send the franchise out on a solid note. It's obvious that Hollywood is cashing in its chips by making this movie in the first place, but at least it delivers a somewhat entertaining film for a couple of hours and provides an escape from the real world that most movie viewers are looking for in a popcorn flick.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones provide the normal banter they have developed throughout the franchise, and Josh Brolin (True Grit, W.) has good fun playing the spot on younger version of Agent K. Even Emma Thompson (I am Legend, Love Actually) gets in on the fun delivering a funeral eulogy in a high-pitched squeal alien language.I was pleasantly surprised by MIB 3's unexpectedly touching ending. It was the perfect way for this story to go out. Hopefully the franchise will resist the urge to ante up again, and walk away on top with their pockets full of chips.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",6,1,3,6 September 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows...1.5 out of 4 Skittles
","The sequel, like 2009's original, is average at best. Michele and Kieran Mulroney, best known for writing and directing the bizarre movie Paper Man in 2009, find a way to produce a screenplay that makes the literary legend of Sherlock Holmes boring. Heavy descriptive dialogue scenes make every conversation feel very forced, and makes you pray for the next action sequence to hurry up and come.Unfortunately, even the action couldn't save the movie from drifting off into snooze-ville. Guy Ritchie's directing style worked well in his past films Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but comes across as very jarring here. His endless quick cuts and slow-mo action shots stripped the film of any excitement and give it an endless snail pace.Downey Jr. and Law deliver a few laughs together, and their chemistry attempts to give this movie some semblance of entertainment value, but in the end the it has too many strikes against it for them to overcome. This movie does a disservice to the legend of Sherlock Holmes, and made me wish I would have just stayed home and read about one of his adventures in a book instead.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",3,2,4,6 September 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter...2.5 out of 4 Skittles
","Okayso let's get this all straightfamed president Abraham Lincoln's mother was murdered by a vampire, which led Abe to become a trained vampire hunter and seek revenge on his mother's killer. Ohand vampires controlled the slave trade in the Confederate South. WellIf you're okay with the new rewrite on history, you can probably get into this movie and enjoy the ride.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is delectably dark. The film's special effects team did a great job making vampires that are actually terrifying. The fight scenes are action packed and gory. Think Underworld meets The Walking Dead. And if you're a fan of the kinds of intensely gruesome deaths found in those kinds of projects, then do yourself a favor and watch the film in 3D. You will get to experience first hand how the vampire blood splatters from honest Abe's silver ax and fly out towards to the audience. Finally a 3D effect I can get on board with.The film is set to a furious pace that refuses to allow the audience to dwell on the insanely dumb plot, and doesn't give way to any scenes that may slow down the vampire killing action, like Abe and Mary Todd falling in love (I mean who really wants to see that when there are so many blood suckers that need to be destroyed).Director Timur Bekmambetov who also directed 2008's Wanted, proves he can handle a big budget film & writer Seth Grahame-Smith apparently saved all his entertaining vampire writing for this one, and not his dud script for Dark Shadows.The film's premise is obviously completely ridiculous. What comes nextGrover Cleveland: Mummy Stalker or Ronald Reagan: Werewolf Tamer. But in the end the film comes out as unique and exciting. And it's kind of cool to see the most infamous president destroying evil with his bare hands while adding a new credit to his historical resume. I meanwho wouldn't want Vampire Hunter listed right above proficiency with Microsoft Office.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",6,1,4,6 September 2012
Ted," Ted...3 out of 4 Skittles
","First things first...the concept of Ted is completely ridiculous. That being said...Ted is also completely hilarious. Writer/Director/Actor Seth MacFarlane, best know as the creative force behind the TV animated hits Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show, brings the same kind of humor to his feature film debut. Jokes that offend everyone from all walks of life and expected and delivered.Although Ted is a walking talking teddy bear, MacFarlane's script keeps the story grounded in the real world, which actually makes it more realistic and believable then the recent comedy duds That's My Boy and The Dictator.Mark Walhberg (The Fighter, Boogie Nights) and Mila Kunis (Black Swan, Friends With Benefits) form a strong basis for MacFarlane to bring the cuddly little Peter Griffin'esche title character to life. And major props have to go to Giovanni Ribisi playing the awesomely creepy stalker who plots to steal Ted away for his own son. His gut-busting scene where he sexually dances by himself in front of his TV to a 1980's Debbie Gibson music video while drinking apple juice through a straw is one of the funniest in recent memory.Parents beware...if for some reason you think this would be a funny movie to bring the kids to...think again. Ted curses like a sailor, smokes pot and bangs hookers. If this seems like a movie you want to enjoy with your children then the Parent of the Year award went out the window for you a long time ago. If you don't let your kids watch Family Guy, then you won't want them to see Ted.If anyone could make a funny movie out of a teddy bear that has come to life, I'm glad it was MacFarlane who attempted, and not someone at the Disney cheese factory. Now that he has a taste at feature films it's excited to see what he will come up with next.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",7,0,2,6 September 2012
Hugo," Hugo...3 out of 4 Skittles
","LOGLINE: Set in 1930's Paris, a young orphan who lives in the walls of a train station and works maintaining the public clocks within. After an accident kills his father (a short and memorable performance by Jude Law), Hugo works to finish rebuilding an automoton found by his father believing that a mysterious message will be released to him once it is complete.Hugo is breathtaking, but not because of the over-hyped 3D. Although the 3D is a step above the scores of other movies released in the recent 3D boom, it doesn't rely on the technique to wow the audience. Hugo relies more on heart from John Logan's amazing script and Martin Scorsese's direction rather than on the thrills to be found wearing your cheesy 3D glasses.Scorcese directing a kids movie seems like a weird move, but the master of telling intense crime dramas handles this challenge with ease. Hugo is not your usual children's tale. In fact, I'm not sure I would even label it as a children's movie. The story may go over the head of the kiddies used to seeing dumbed down garbage such as Alvin in the Chipmunks or Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill. The story line runs parallel to a time when movies were truly a magical escape, and gave the audience a live look into what dreams must look like. With Scorcese behind the wheel, Hugo delivers the same excitement as the first movies ever made.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",8,7,10,6 September 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man...2.5 out of 4 Skittles
","The Spider-Man franchise is launched again, only five years after Sam Raimi wrapped up his highly successful trilogy. After watching the latest installment it makes you wonder why.Other than the obvious reason of making more money, the latest installment brings nothing new to the table that the Raimi versions didn't. So the reboot starts up with Peter Parker in high school and Uncle Ben is still alivebig whup. The writing is cheesier and the special effects seem virtually the same.Director Marc Webb, who worked his magic in the 2009 indie hit (500) Days of Summer, missed his chance of leaving a lasting impression as Raimi did. Raimi gave us iconic scenes like a car flying through a coffee shop window in slow-mo, and the infamous upside down first kiss between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Webb gives us a montage of Peter Parker learning more about his new Spidey powers whilst skateboarding to a Coldplay soundtrack (this is no joke), and the most awkward first kiss since Harry Potter hooked up with Ginny Weasley.The trio of big time writers, James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, The Losers), Alvin Sargent (Spider-Man 2 & 3), and Steve Kloves (All the Harry Potter movies), show that too many chefs in the kitchen can sometimes only leave a big mess. Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, Never Let Me Go) and Emma Stone (The Help, Zombieland) make a valiant attempt at bringing the lead characters to life, but the pathetic script leaves them coming off like the B-version of the chemistry put together by Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man. The actors also seem to be out of place in high school. Buying Garfield (28 years-old) & Stone (24) as high school kids requires a large commitment from anyone with a brain. Maybe the people who cast the original 90210 series had their hands in this one too.If you don't compare The Amazing Spider-Man to Raimi's trilogy you can probably find enough positives to enjoy it and find it somewhat entertaining. But for the most part the latest Spidey flick is just another example of Hollywood forcing out another big budget stinker that they know they can make a quick buck from. I would rather see a comic book reboot for characters that need it. Can someone please do justice for The Fantastic Four? For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",6,0,3,6 September 2012
To Rome With Love," To Rome With Love...3 out of 4 Skittles
","In true Woody Allen comedic fashion, To Rome With Love intertwines different stories into one larger piece with the title city set as the background. Some of the story lines are good...some not so much.The best story arc stars Alec Baldwin playing an architect visiting the city to retrace his steps from thirty years ago when he lived in Rome as a young student. Baldwin runs into his younger self, played with usual neuroticism by Jesse Eisenberg, and follows him through an affair he had with his girlfriend's best friend (played by Ellen Page). The entertaining and amusing story line could have easily been made into a feature length story of its own.Roberto Benigni stars in what is probably the least entertaining story line as a man with a boring office job doing the same thing everyday who wakes up as a famous celebrity for no apparent reason. The idea is beaten over the audience's head and quickly loses traction. It's one that I wished Allen would have scraped from the story all together.Even with some of the slower moments To Rome With Love is light and fun, and will entertain Woody Allen fans. It doesn't dive in as deep as some of his other recent flicks, but for Allen, who continues to pump out at least one movie a year, it keeps the train rolling.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",7,2,5,6 September 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol...2.5 out of 4 Skittles
","The 4th installment of the Mission Impossible franchise is a thrilling ride from the opening scene, and unlike its predecessors its story line doesn't out think itself and topple over. Although many of the action sequences could only happen in the world of Hollywood make believe, it actually felt more plausible compared to the other moronic blockbusters such as the Fast & Furious flicks or Michael Bay's Transformers crap-o-rama. I'm not sure if that is necessarily a good thing, but at least I didn't walk out of the theater feeling dumber for watching it.Cruise vaults himself back into the role of action film king after his recent duds Valkyrie and the snooze fest Knight and Day. Jeremy Renner follows up his Academy Award nominated performances in The Hurt Locker & The Town with a strong performance and continues his rise to the top. Paula Patton in the exact opposite role from her performance as a teacher with a heart of gold in Precious is a steamy, kick ass bombshell, and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead & Hot Fuzz) delivers his usual dry wit laughs without taking it over the top.I wouldn't place MI:4 at the top of my greatest movies list for the year, but it does exactly what is sets out to do. It's intense, high energy and very entertaining. Anyone who enjoyed the past Mission Impossible movies should definitely get a kick out of Ethan Hunt's latest antics, and those of you dragged to this one kicking and screaming may be pleasantly surprised.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",7,2,5,6 September 2012
The Bourne Legacy," The Bourne Legacy...3.5 out of 4 Skittles
","The Bourne story livesbut without actor Matt Damon reprising the title character and director Doug Liman at the helm it makes you wonder about the direction this beloved movie franchise is heading. Within the first five minutes The Bourne Legacy erases any fears, and proves itself as the solid next chapter that should appease Bourne fans and continues to push the saga into the future.Writer Tony Gilroy is back with the new script, and this time takes over as director as well. Gilroy's latest Bourne installment incorporates the story from his original trilogy as its backbone, and tosses out a wider net by introducing the latest CIA trained assassin agent gone rogue, Alex Cross, played by Jeremy Renner with a perfect sense of gritty power that is expected from our action heroes. Renner has climbed the ladder of success all the way to the top. From his Academy Award nominated performances in The Hurt Locker & The Town, to the big budget box office smashes The Avengers & Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, Renner has proved with good reason he belongs in the Hollywood A-List Club.The Bourne Legacy is in perfect balance with the spirit of the previous Bourne films. It's a fast paced, high energy, action packed success. Bourne fans won't be disappointed, as the saga lives on with limitless possibilities for the future.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",8,18,29,6 September 2012
Brave," Brave...3 out of 4 Skittles
","Brave is charming, funny, heart-warming and filled with excitement. Everything we've come to expect from a Pixar animated film. Built on their reputation from past classics Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Wall-E and Up, Pixar continues to prove that when it comes to great animated family filmsthere's Pixar.and then there's everyone else.Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire, No Country For Old Men) brings the lead character Merida to life with such likability and honesty that you tend to forget she is generated by a computer. Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, Men In Black 3) and Billy Connolly (The Last Samurai, The Boondock Saints) round out the lead voice characters providing a warm and truthful environment that help paint a portrait of realism and showcase why Merida is the young woman she's become.I can't rate Brave at the top of the modern masterpiece class with the likes of Up and Wall-E, but it is very good and definitely lives up to the Pixar standard. It's a family film that the entire family will actually enjoy. Thanks Pixar for being one of the only studios that seems to understand how to make that possible.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",8,2,3,6 September 2012
Dark Shadows," Dark Shadows...1.5 out of 4 Skittles
","LOGLINE: In the 1770's the wealthy Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is cursed to spend eternity as a vampire by his lovesick servant and secret witch, Angelique (Eva Green). Upon discovery of his new affliction Collins is buried alive by the townspeople, and spends nearly two centuries underground until he is accidentally dug up by the construction crew building a new restaurant called McDonald's. Collins discovers times have changed as his family heirs are struggling to get by and the witch is now the most powerful and popular woman in town.Yesthis is the actual premise that some Hollywood jerkoff thought would be a great movie to throw millions of dollars at to get made. Dark Shadows, based on the marginal late 60's/early 70's Gothic soap opera, is basically the story of what happens to a 18th century vampire who wakes up in the 1970's after a 200-year sleep. Jokes about all things the 70's decade had to offer are constantly thrown at the audience and the gag runs thinvery quickly.The all-star cast struggles to find their footing, and the story plot is underdeveloped and pushed to the side to make way for the generic jokes that don't stick. Tim Burton seems to phone this one in. Burton's directorial detail and effort of his past classics such as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands are nowhere to be found in this one, but I guess that should be expected from a guy who made boring movies out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland.Dark Shadows is a misfire and a perfect example of how confused Hollywood currently is. When the mass audience already has a bloated belly full of vampire stories why trot out another movie that strips the genre of its essence and excitement? Maybe this will be the holy water or silver dagger that will be shanked through the heart of the current vampire trend and put us out of our misery. One can only hope.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",3,4,6,6 September 2012
Prometheus," Prometheus...3.5 out of 4 Skittles
","For those of you who don't already knowPrometheus is a prequel to the 1979 legendary sci-fi classic Alien. Ridley Scott is back at the directing helm and easily shows why he is the master touting his routs as a game changer of the genre with the original Alien and 1982's Bladerunner.Prometheus contains everything a fan of the original would expect from the latest installmentit's violent, scary, action packed, disgustingly gory, weirdly hilarious, and features kick-ass special effectssomething the earlier version can't compete with. The result has you leaving the theater knowing you just watched a badass movie, and provides a satisfying and extremely entertaining result that most Alien fans should be happy with (except the uber cynical ones that can't be pleased no matter what).The script by Jon Saihts and Damon Lindelof (Cowboys & Aliens and TV's Lost) sets up the alley oop slamdunk for Scott. Even if you haven't seen any of the previous Alien movies this flick easily stands on its own and will entertain story novices. I mean surethere a few plot points that feel slightly forced into the story line, and some moments that may take you out of the reality of the situationlike how was Noomi Rapace's character running and jumping after (without spoiling any of the gory details) an intense stomach surgery. But in the end the script and Scott's spot on direction keep the story moving forward at a thrill rushing pace.The cast is exceptionally fun from Noomi Rapace, the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, becoming the film's new Sigourney Weaver-esque heroine, to the excellent Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Bastards,Shame), who plays the not quite human role to a tee, to Charlize Theron (Monster, Young Adult) who steals every scene playing the stone cold bitch Meredith Vickers. And huge props go out to cast members Idris Alba, Rafe Spall and Kate Dickie who fill out the spirited crew members and bring the human element to an alien story.I'll admit I've been extremely excited to see Prometheus since I first saw the heart pounding preview trailer last December, and that I walked into the film with very high hopes that made it hard to live up to the hype. That being said, I still left feeling I just watched a kick ass movie, and am strangely happy that Ridley Scott brought my childhood nightmare back to life for another scare.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",8,4,9,6 September 2012
Win Win," Win Win...3 out of 4 Skittles
","Win Win is the third film from talented writer/director Thomas McCarthy, and like his past indie gems The Visitor & The Station Agent he finds a way to bring out an unexpected humor from the scenes in unique ways. Although his third film isn't necessarily a step up from his past endeavors, it's obvious McCarthy knows how to tell a good story.Win Win is blessed with a talented cast, and although there isn't any major stretches or performances to be blown away by, it's a talented cast from top to bottom who are very comfortable bringing these characters to life. Paul Giamatti (Sideways, American Splendor) showcases his usual mastery of the lovable loser schlub that most real people can relate to. Amy Ryan, playing the Jersey wife and protective mother with a love of Jon Bon Jovi, continues to show off her acting range from her role as Michael Scott's soul mate Holly on The Office, to her tour de force Academy Award nominated role in 2007's Gone Baby Gone.Newcomer Alex Shaffer displays a subtle maturity as a teenager hiding the pain from a neglectful childhood. Burt Young, best know for his role as Paulie in the Rocky movies, is terrific as Leo, an aging man dealing with the early stages of dementia. He says so much with just the smallest grin across his face.Melanie Lynskey, probably best known as the crazy neighbor Rose on the popular sitcom Two and a Half Men, playing the greedy daughter and washed up, absentee mother continues to find ways to shine with the smallest of character parts. From her bit roles in Up in the Air, The Informant & Away We Goit's only a matter of time before she gets her shot at some starring roles.Although Win Win isn't as deep as McCarthy's past films, and didn't leave a lasting impression and keep me thinking about the movie long after the credits rolled, it found a way to accomplish something most films don't. It tells an entertaining, realistic, believable storyand I'm okay with that.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",7,3,5,6 September 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises...3.5 out of 4 Skittles
","Director Christopher Nolan has done it. He has turned his Batman franchise into quite possibly the greatest trilogy of all time. True fans of all great trilogiesStar Wars, Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, The Godfather, Bourne Identity, or even Toy Story can argue the points of why their movies are the greatest, but Nolan's Dark Knight series has deservedly staked a claim at the top of the heap.The Dark Knight Rises is the delicious cherry on top of this version of the Batman sundae. From the beautiful panorama shots that are scattered through out the film, to the superb writing and acting that bring to life the gritty and dark realism that make this version of the beloved DC Comics character more believable than ever.Sure, the film has its flaws. For oneit's bloated with some unnecessary story. With a 2 hour and 44 minute running time The Dark Knight Rises has its slower moments, but for the true fans of Nolan's tale the extra detail will be welcomed with open arms, and the film's fantastic 45 minute action packed finale will make the slow start all worth while. Seriouslythis may be the most satisfying ending for a trilogy of all time easily destroying the stupid ewok celebration from Star Wars, or the sappy never ending goodbyes of The Lord of the Rings, not to mention the waste of space that became The Godfather 3. Like it's two predecessors, Nolan's script penned with brother Jonathan is in perfect sync with the DC Comics spirit delivering nugget after nugget that should appease the hoards of comic book aficionados and movie lovers alike.Batman veteran actors Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are solid as expected putting their characters to rest in pure style. It's the acting newcomers who get to come in and have the most fun in the finale. Anne Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada, Alice in Wonderland) is surprisingly perfect as the kick-ass cat burglar Selina Kyle (she's never mentioned as Catwoman, but we get the point) playing her fake damsel in distress act and towing the line of good and evil as needed. Tom Hardy's (Inception, Warrior) take on the villain, Bane, is utterly frightening and fascinating. Marion Cotillard (Inception, Big Fish) and Joseph-Gordon Levitt (Inception, 50/50) round out the talented cast that could intimidate any other big-time movie cast.The Dark Knight Rises is the finale of what all big budget Hollywood films should strive for. Yes, it has the money to splash around and dazzle on special effects, but also the script to give this story a reason to be told, the truly talented cast to fully bring the comic characters into the real world, and the right director to put all the pieces together and make a film that lives up to the advertising hype. The Dark Knight Rises is the fantastic final piece to one of the greatest movie trilogies in the history of cinema, and what all blockbuster movies should hope to one day become.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",9,3,8,6 September 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Moonrise Kingdom...3.5 out of 4 Skittles
","Moonrise Kingdom is easily described in short as a Wes Anderson film. There aren't too many directors in the world where you can simply state their name, and it quickly conjures up the style of film before you even see it, but Anderson is one of the rare few. With his usual weird quirkiness, hilariously bizarre dialog, and offbeat characters Anderson delivers on his reputation as past classics Rushmore, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Royal Tenenbaums.Moonrise Kingdom feels like the next chapter in the Wes Anderson life work that he continues to build. His script penned with continued partner Roman Coppola delivers the kind of laughs that run deep and social themes that make the viewer reflect on themselves and their lost childhood.The film's young love story is excellently cast with newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward in the lead spots. The teen actors easily capture the insanity that goes along with feeling true love at an age when awkwardness and unknowing stupidity fill our minds.The rest of the cast is brilliantly filled in with some of Anderson's usual suspects Bill Murray & Jason Schwartzman along with industry titans Frances McDormand, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton and Tilda Swinton. As always the cast blends in perfectly to showcase life that can only be found inside Anderson's world.Whether you love or hate Wes Anderson's films, he continues to make his mark on the current cinematic scene, and Moonrise Kingdom is no different. Some viewers feel Anderson is one of the only current filmmakers that can be considered a true artist and won't be truly appreciated in his own timeothers simply think he's a hack. I for one am glad to be invited into Anderson's world, and am thankful to be a part of the journeys he continues to deliver.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",9,1,3,6 September 2012
