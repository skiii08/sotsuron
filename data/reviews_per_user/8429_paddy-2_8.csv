Come and See," unmatched in world cinema
","Quite simply - one of the greatest films ever made. Not for the faint hearted, and paced to try the patience of those accustomed to fast edited pap, this movie has stayed with me since the day I first saw it. Every few years I gather the courage to watch it again, and it never fails. I doubt if Hollywood - or any other film-making centre - will ever be able to equal Come and See in terms of intelligence, strange beauty, and sheer emotional power.",10,5,8,25 January 2000
Minority Report," a disappointment - disjointed, incoherent and silly
","I had high hopes for this movie, but left the theatre feeling pretty disappointed. A messy, disjointed script with undistinguished dialogue and a plethora of lazy high-gloss S.F. cliches made for a backside numbing couple of hours.I *should* love this movie - it was certainly trying to push my buttons as a lover of Blade Runner/Clockwork Orange Brazil/Mission Impossible etc etc, but it just wasn't happening. For me the 'futurism' was too unimaginitive for one thing. Desktop computers in the year 2054?! Cars, roads, video projectors, advertising; it all seemed too drearily familiar.And the whole shebang about the pre-cogs floating in a vat of fluid comes straight out of the 'how to make a glossy SF film' book. The one already well-read and better understood by the Matrix guys. Having a whole crime-fighting force based on the powers of essentially one woman (who is described as 'sub-human' at one point, and then, half an hour later is walking, talking and making eyes at Tom) seems just too arbitrary and precarious a hook to hang a whole movie on. Suspended disbelief comes crashing down around our shoulders. This is not how the world works - not now, and not in 2054. It smacks of script writers' desperation, as do so many of the movie's twists and turns. It would have been smarter, perhaps, to have the precogs as a whole police department, smart-suited workers, not a trio of bleached newts.It was, sadly, a waste of a great high-concept pitch, mired in a muddy, silly script and some very uncertain direction. This is the Spielberg who made the dire Lost World, not the Spielberg of Close Encounters or Schindlers List. The theatre, I'm sad to say, rang out with derisory laughter at quite a few points. If only Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Truman Show) had written and directed this one.",6,0,0,11 July 2002
No Country for Old Men," hugely disappointing
","I deliberately avoided reading any reviews or seeing any clips of this film before seeing it, thinking that it would be nice to come to it completely fresh. I generally like a lot of what the Coen brothers do - Hudsucker Proxy and Fargo in particular. But I hated Miller's Crossing, and that should have warned me.No Country got off to a bad start, in that the initial voice-over was almost completely incomprehensible to me. OK, I'm English, and maybe I find a deep Texan drawl as hard to understand as someone from Texas might find Glaswegian, but this just put me in a bad mood. If you've got a character who's got to impart some information, then please get him to open his damn mouth while he talks. Through the whole movie, people talked to each other in this glutinous mutter, and I just sat there rolling my eyes. CAN'T HEAR YOU! Fargo had people talking 'funny', but at least you could understand what they were saying. So yes, maybe I missed some vital information.As for the movie as a whole, well, there were good things - the landscapes, the photography, some neat protagonists, some good tense situations. I liked the lack of music, and the slow pace. But at the end of it all, it all added up to very little. A bunch of americana clichés - motel room, garage-owner, people driving around in cars, mute banal violence, sweet white-trash wife in a trailer, yeah yeah, seen it all before. It all started to feel like a mix and match style exercise.I don't mind a bit existential alienation - Two Lane Blacktop and most of the films of Tarkovsky are among my personal favourites. But there was something pointless about this film. Terminator-style remorseless killer chases opportunist around, and lots of people die. Um. Old cop sees lots of dead people and gets a bit depressed, but is too lazy or stupid or filled with ennui to do much about it. Bad people wander out of the picture. The End.Actually, the end was simply dreadful. I don't mind a sudden, strange, open ending. If the film ends like that, and the audience rocks back in their seats and you hear a massed intake of breath - well, that's one thing. But with the end of this movie I could sense a collective thought... 'Is that IT?!'",5,12,23,29 January 2008
28 Days Later...," great.. annoying... great
","So many reasons to love this movie, and so many reason to hate it...First of all - the concept is great. Full-on apocalypse, decent attempt to provide some topical justification for the infection, reasonable cause and effect in the main story. But only up to a point. Because, try as I might to run with this film, I just keep tripping over puzzling directorial and script decisions. Over and over again - about every five minutes - there's something in this movie that just makes you go - 'Hold on, that doesn't make sense?!'Just a few examples (so many to choose from!): <ul><li>Why does Cillian Murphy run through the house shouting 'WE HAVE TO LEAVE!!!' at the top of his voice? Er - dude, whispering would make more sense! But no, someone has deemed that it would be more exciting and cinematic to have them running around shouting at the top of their voices. Makes no sense. I'm starting to lose interest.</li></ul><ul><li>Why park the taxi so far from the petrol tanker? Why not drive up close, keep everyone together, and FILL UP THE TANK OF THE TAXI ITSELF!!??? Rather than just a can? Oh yeah - so we could get a pointless couple of shots of the girl doing a handbrake turn. Right.</li></ul><ul><li>Why does Cillian Murphy (in ridiculous 'terminator' mode) set free the infected guy in the yard (cutting the chain with totally implausible blast of machine gun fire) when he's just as likely to attack the girls as he is to get the soldiers? </li></ul><ul><li>Is it really feasible that the young girl driving the taxi MEANT to reverse the cab up to the infected guy so he would then smash through the rear window, grab the bad major and kill him? JUMP THE SHARK, JUMP THE SHARK, JUMP THE SHARK!!!! Insulting to the audience. A Jackie Chan/Sammo Hung fight sequence has more credibility.</li></ul>You see - it's just a slow decline from a great premise and a dynamite first 20 minutes to an ending that can't come too soon. There's so much to love - the DV camera work, the stark lighting, the great angles, the nutty details like the girls in ball dresses in a rain drenched manor house while mayhem erupts around them, a main character who is spaced out on Valium during said mayhem, the sequences in silent, dead London, the blood puking, the basic attempt to make a gritty original SF horror action movie that pulls no punches etc etc.Like I said, there are so many reasons to love this movie. But I can't - it annoys me, there's always the feeling that the makers are saying - 'Yeah, OK, this bit doesn't make sense but no one will notice because it looks cool!' Nah - it doesn't make sense, and it's annoying.Having said all that, to be honest, I'd recommend that anyone interested in the genre would see 28 Days Later. Just prepare to be irritated.But... as it happens I have seen 28 Weeks Later, and it's a much better movie. It rocks! AND, it more or less makes sense! You see? You CAN have your cake and eat it.",Null,7,12,4 May 2007
Transformers," dismal storytelling and direction. So-so spectacle.
","The film - what you'd expect from Michael Bay. Big, brash, dumb, peppered with irritating plot holes. Thin clichéd characterisation, fetishising military hardware, fetishising ridiculous bloated SUV vehicles. Incoherent and confusing action with diminishing returns (by the third hour, we are really getting sick of watching giant robots punching each other). All that regular stuff. Oh yeah - and at least half the movie takes place at magic hour. It's like sucking on a giant chrome exhaust pipe, while someone hits you over the head, while shining an orange lamp in your face.My point is a small one - but why is that American film makers (and audiences?) find it so hard to accept that other countries in the world have high technology? OK, in the movie we get a crack about the robot probably being Japanese, and about Nokia phones coming from Finland - but what the heck is the point of having a character describe the failed Mars lander 'Beagle 2' as 'NASA/JPL', when in fact it was a British craft, carried on a European Space Agency mission! Yes, America, sorry if it upsets you, but Europe (and Japan, and India, and China etc etc) all have space programs!!!!!",6,1,3,15 August 2007
The Dark Knight," Over long, rambling, episodic, pompous. Nice effects though.
","Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters, and ranking up huge box office, I thought I'd give it a swing.I mostly wish I hadn't bothered. Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is 'County'?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.So, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way.",6,46,103,14 August 2008
30 Days of Night," Does not deliver on its premise
","I wanted to like it, I really did. But here's the thing - the real Barrow is 60% Native Alaskan. Yet, if you watched this film, you'd think it was 95% Caucasian. There's a couple of token glimpses of Inupiat kids near the start, and there's one character who's allowed to loiter in the background til he gets his head chopped off with an axe. But this is a film with no interest in what life in an Arctic community is really like. Which - racism aside - might be fine in a stylised genre movie, if the coolness of the basic premise was delivered on. But it isn't. Barrow - isolated on the far northern edge of Alaska, with a month of sunless darkness - is attacked by vampires! Sounds great, but the trouble is, there is very little sense of landscape, the barren midnight wastes from which attack might come. Everything looks like a back lot or a digital set extension, apart from a couple of location scenes. The story has no interest in where the vampires came from or why they are here. And I got no feeling for the life of the town before or during the attack. The little people are disposed of during one long aerial shot of vampire carnage. What remains are just a couple of white cops, and some other similar people whose main job is to exchange scared looks. I kept wishing the denouement of the film would be when a bunch of hard-as-nails Inupiat stormed out of their houses and saved the cast, but no such luck.And as for the 'darkness' bit - the whole film looks like it is enacted under supermarket strip lights. Is that moonlight? Why are the town's streets so brightly lit, when the sky is shown as midnight black and cloudy? Why, in an abandoned house, with the windows boarded up and the power cut, is everything as bright as day? I sense the dead hand of some exec here telling the DP and the colourist to brighten everything up. Which was the worst decision possible. Fear of the dark is possibly the strongest human fear. But this film should've been called '30 Days (or was it 3?) of Over-Lighting'.",3,0,3,26 November 2016
Donnie Darko," original cut is better
","Just a short note:Having seen the 'original cut' on DVD, and enjoyed it (enough to watch the movie again straight away with the commentary) - I saw it recently on the big screen. It was the 'director's cut' and, while I usually find the big screen experience much much more satisfying than watching a DVD on TV, I have to say that I thought the director's cut was far inferior to the previously released version. It is, frankly, a bit of a mess. It manages to include, seemingly, a lot more material, while being even more confusing. Not mysterious, not fascinating, not tantalising; just confusing. I would guess that an intelligent film fan, watching the director's cut without having seen the movie before, would not have a clue what 'happened'.Not true with the other version - you get it, you can piece it all together, and the original film is a little delight in that regard. You are given enough information to work it out, but not enough to sense that, actually it doesn't really add up (which is hinted at in the DVD commentary). In the directors cut, you are left thinking 'huh?'. Furthermore, the mystery as to the nature of the happening is spoiled with a load of pointless 'computer vision' inserts, on-screen graphics that add nothing but a jarring note.So - forget the director's cut. It's an indulgence and a mistake. Go for the original film as released. It's just a better movie.",Null,1,2,2 November 2004
