The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," An overload of swoony, cheesy romance, but that doesn't make it not good.
","The twilight films are always going to be the easiest film franchise for people to make fun of, but honestly I don't think they are that bad, well New Moon was pretty bad, But Twilight, Eclipse and this are all rather good. People have complained that the story is split in to two parts but I think for a book as long as Breaking Dawn there's no other way it could be done.Being split in two parts allows the first film to concentrate on the very melodramatic but still nice romance between Bella and Edward, the wedding and honeymoon scenes are quite lovely to watch. I'm guessing that all the action is being saved for Part 2, which is wise I think, putting it in this film would have been too much I think.This is easily the darkest and most adult of the franchise, it has some truly awesome scenes, in particular the dream sequence at the beginning and the birthing scene, they are both pretty messed up. The only thing I can say is bad is the acting by most of the cast, Kristen Stewart is the only one with any type of acting ability,this may sound silly but I think if this weren't a twilight film people would be wowed by her performance, she's exceptional and the heart and soul of the film. The same can't be said about Ashley Greene though, she is a terrible actress *ahem Summers Moon ahem*, she's kinda laughable as with the rest of them.The sex scene is a bit of a cop out, but we can always hope and pray for a directors cut DVD. Hooray.",9,2,10,30 November 2011
The Hunger Games," Jennifer Lawrence was born to play Katniss.
","When the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence was cast in the much coveted role of Katniss Everdeen there was a lot of uproar from devoted fans of the novels on which this film is based, I however think that she is perfectly cast. From the early images which surfaced online all the way to the trailer and the final poster I thought she looked the part, and after seeing the final film it's safe to say she nails every facet of this wonderful character. Miss Lawrence is a supremely talented young actress and it's great to see someone with mega talent being rewarded by getting the big roles. She just absolutely nails it as Katniss, from the emotional side to the violent tough side, she is the character.The movie itself is a fine adaptation, all the best parts of the book are present and accounted for, a few bit and pieces have been omitted but it doesn't affect it majorly, the beginning of the story is set in a barren land known as district 12 and it is presented exactly how I imagined it, this chapter is only slight though which is really the only disappointment, i would have liked to see a bit more of that but oh well, the middle part of the story is hilarious with Stanley Tucci stealing every scene, again the eccentric Capitol is presented in great detail, again exactly the way I had imagined it while reading the books. And finally the third act, the one every has waited for is a truly action packed adventure, it's non stop action and you don't fare tear your eyes away even for a second.The romance element is very very slight and not overdone thankfully, I'm glad they didn't over do that, the rest of the cast are mostly great, Josh Hutcherson is nice to watch and you care about him just as much as you do Katniss, and Elizabeth Banks like Stanley Tucci is a scene stealer and great comic relief.All in all the film is excellent, a great book has been treated with care and it's paid off, fans of the book and just general movie goers will love it. Excellent excellent excellent.",9,11,32,21 March 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Not as great as everyone says but it's still a notch above the usual romantic comedy.
","After seeing the trailer a million times at theaters I was looking forward to seeing Crazy Stupid Love as it has one of my favorite actors in it, Julianne Moore. It looked to me like a smart romantic comedy for adults with a bit of an edge, which is exactly what it is, the story is fresh and appeals to a broad age range, the Steve Carrell/Julianne Moore storyline appeals to the older married demographic and the Ryan Gosling/ Emma Stone storyline appeals to the younger hipper generation.Steve Carrell gives a terrific performance as the poor guy whose life just seems to go from bad to worse, I think he will be nominated for a golden globe or something like that, he is a very funny guy to watch no matter what role he is in, the rest of the cast is fine also, Miss Moore once again proves she us an actress with a spectacular, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have excellent chemistry together which makes them entirely believable as lovers, however one person steals the show and that is Marisa Tomei in all her nutty glory, her scenes are exceptionally funny but they are too few and far between.This movie does have it's flaws, the end twist is too far fetched and unbelievable, I think it would have been better if they gave you some clues as to how the story all comes together in the end, the Gosling/Stone relationship isn't given enough time to make you really care, and also it's a tad too long. But other than that this is a nice, funny and overall enjoyable film to watch.",6,19,28,8 October 2011
Midnight in Paris," Just like the 20's, this film dazzles in every way.
","The trailer for Midnight In Paris is so deceiving, I saw the trailer and thought oh great another film about Paris, the city everyone but me seems to love, but the when I sat down to watch it I was so pleasantly surprised at just how different this movie is to what you would expect.Firstly I have to say that the story of a man traveling to another era after midnight is terribly clever, it took me a second to realize that the main character has actually time traveled and hasn't just run into people who are dressed in 20's attire for the evening. It's even different to the usual Woody Allen material, it's highly original in every way imaginable.The cast in this movie is exceptional, I'm not usually an Owen Wilson fan but I found him wonderfully likable, he is so at home in this type of film, it's nice to see him in an intelligent comedy and not a cheap silly one. The entire supporting cast are wonderful, Rachel McAdams playing against character is great at making you dislike her character almost instantly, the same can be said for Michael Sheen, the 2 supporting cast members who were the best were Alison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald, she's hilarious and just plain fantastic, Marion Cotillard is lovely and sweet as well, all of them are great, they all get a great scene, another worth mentioning is Adrian Brody as Dali, another hilarious encounter. Woody Allen sure knows how to write fir all his characters, no one is left unmemorable.It's kinda hard not to like this movie, I loved it in every way, I hope you will too. The best Woody Allen film since Match Point. :)",10,2,6,10 October 2011
Horrible Bosses," Jennifer is EXCELLENT. The rest is lame!!!!!
","I never thought I'd say it, but yes, Miss Aniston is the only thing great about this movie. If it wasn't for her tremendous comic timing I would have fallen asleep plenty of times throughout Horrible Bosses, it's great to see her playing against character.The rest of the movie is pretty mindless, the 3 male leads are flat, the gags are cheap, the ending is so far fetched I felt insulted the filmmakers expected us to fall for it, with each new movie I see Jason Sudekeis in I dislike him mote and more.I think in a better directors hands this movie could have been great, also replace the 3 leads and it may have been a tad better. There's not much else I can really say, it's just so disappointing. I do hope Jennifer Aniston dies more roles like this though, she shines.Thoroughly disappointing.",2,5,11,30 August 2011
Hugo," Lush, beautiful to watch, great acting but a tad boring in parts.
","Hugo has been lauded as a modern masterpiece and I can totally see why it has got the great rap that it has, Martin Scorcese is a director who doesn't do anything half great, it's always perfect and exceptional, and Hugo is no exception to that, however I do think that there is a severe lack in plot. The gorgeous look and feel of the film didn't override the fact that for 2 thirds of the film I was somewhat bored and uninterested, the plot doesn't seem to really take off until the third act, after that it is a truly wonderful film going experience.The production of this film is just exceptional, from the opening scenes of Paris to the closing scenes of the automaton the way the film looks can simply take your breath away. The music is divine and beautiful to hear as it is perfectly suited to the time and place. And the acting is wonderful, Asa Butterfield who is in pretty much every scene is a great young actor who I'm sure will be mega, and Chloe Moretz impresses with a very different role to her usual roles, she is already huge and just seems to get better and bigger, she will definitely be winning awards very soon I think, and the supporting cast are swell, none really standout but they are all great.A few other things I had a problem with was continuity. I picked up on quite a gee things that didn't match up, and also Emily Mortimer's role was very underwritten, I think for a tiny part such as hers it should have been played by an unknown, not a distinguished actress who is far beneath a tiny role. I mean if you can forgive it for it's few tiny flaws, it's slow pace and it's lack of plot you will really enjoy Hugo, it does pay off in the end.But really it's worth seeing purely for the way it looks, and in 3d it's even more beautiful to watch. Give it a go. I'm sure you will probably love it.",6,19,35,18 January 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rooney Mara carries the whole film, and wow does she carry it well.
","Everyone had their pick of who they wanted to play the Lisbeth Salander in the American remake if The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, there were slot of really big names and a lot of great actresses who came very close to bagging the role, but Mr Fincher did the right thing and chose a little known actress who had the acting chops to make this difficult role something memorable, it must be said that Rooney Mara is phenomenal in this movie, I would go so far as to say that she out does Noomi Rapace, which is saying slot because she was also amazing in the original.Remakes of foreign films are either hit or miss, sometimes they can change it too much and it is just lame, or sometimes they can stick to closely to the original and it seems kinda pointless, this remake however is pretty much perfect in sticking to the story but bringing it's own little bits and pieces to it that make it different, it's pretty much the exact same storyline and all important scenes are almost identical, it's just the right amount of same and different. Daniel Craig is rather good as Mikael Blomkvist, but he really us no match for scene stealer Mara.Sweden is shown in all it's freezing cold glory and it's presented in an equally inviting and non inviting way, im glad that Fincher decided to keep it set in Sweden and not transfer it to America, it wouldn't have the same vibe if it were any different. Another awesome thing about this film is the epic opening credits, your eyes and ears are attacked by dripping tattoo ink and Miss Karen O's screeching voice, it's truly epic and sets you up for the film you are about to watch.Fans of the original and fans of Fincher will be impressed, it is a worthy remake of an already excellent film but it also stands as a film on it's own. And long live Rooney Mara, she is the pure driving force and Im praying they remake all 3 films as her as that character is acting gold, so tough, so perfectly cast.Check it out.",6,7,17,20 December 2011
Drive," A great film which surprises right up until the very end.
","When I recently saw Drive I went in with not much of an idea of what it was about, just that it had Ryan Gosling in it, he's one of my favorite male actors so I was happy to watch a film with him it. The storyline is something very different than what you'd imagine, once the plot gets going it's certainly a story you are interested in seeing unfold.Mr Gosling plays a tough as nails and confident as he'll Hollywood stuntman who doesn't say much, but in trying to help out his friendly neighbor gets himself caught up in a crime ring, and let me tell you these crime guys are people I'd never want to be associated with. The are read badass guys. But like I said, Mr Gosling is a tough bitch.I found the film to be quite beautiful to watch, it has a stillness too it similar to someone like Sofia Coppola or David Lynch, the use of David Lynch's composer is a mega plus also. The female characters is the film are somewhat underused which is a tad disappointing because Carey Mulligan and Christina Hendricks are great talents, Hendricks has a bit more if a gritty role but both the females are fine with what they have to work with. Another great thing about this movie is the slow techno soundtrack. So if you're after an intelligent film that isn't just car chases and race scenes and more of a quiet study of humans, this one is for you. Enjoy.",7,0,2,5 October 2011
The Mist," A good film in the long list of mediocre Stephen King films.
","The first thing that must be said about this movie are three little words, Marcia Gay Harden! She is phenomenal! Her performance in this movie is probably the best I have ever seen her. Not very often does a supporting character out shine every other cast member in a film and that is exactly what she does in this movie.So I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that in recent years the film adapted from Stephen King novels have been extremely underwhelming, so it's good to see one that hits the mark. The story is adapted from a novella about a small town that is overtaken by a mysterious fog that inhabits supernatural beings, who I might say are chilling.Thomas Jane is great as usual as the leader of a group of people who escape from the mist in a local supermarket. The film is primarily about the must and what horror it has brought to the town but there's another element if this film which is great, the human instinct to turn against each other in stressful situation, this is when Marcia Gay Harden really starts to shine, her character, the psychotic and super religious Mrs Carmody is equally as terrifying as the beings that inhabit the mist.The production of The Mist is excellent, the scenes where the locals venture out of the supermarket into the mist is so edge of your seat stuff. Excellent.It's great to see a horror film that doesn't rely on blood and guts to produce the scares... A+",7,0,1,26 September 2011
Friends with Benefits," A comedy like all the rest, but still fun.
","Who doesn't love Mila Kunis? Not many people! She's so compulsively watchable that it's hard to think of an actress more popular with males AND females at the moment. Her teaming up with JT makes Friends With Benefits everything No Strings Attached wasn't. Obviously the two films have the same plot line, there are a few bits and pieces which are different but all in all pretty much the same, the characters in this film are so much more fun, sexy and worth your time.There's a bit more raunch in this movie which I think adds a lot to the plot, the fact that the characters actually do seem like friends is definitely a plus for this movie, for me the chemistry between Mila and JT is electric.Full props to Justin Timberlake too, he gets better and better with each film, he has made the transition from music to film quite well. Patricia Clarkson is divine as usual, I take it that she's a friend of the director, now being in 2 of his films, the other being Easy A, she is fantastic in these wacky parent roles. Speaking of Easy A, Emma Stone's cameo at the beginning of the film is priceless...... I was on the ground in stitches, I've been yelling 'John F**kin Mayer' at random times ever since. Love Emma Stone!!!!!!!!!!In closing, Friends With Benefits is a fun romp to be had with friends or your partner, it towers over NSA in spades. Well worth the price of admission. :)",6,2,5,23 August 2011
The Artist," A smile from ear to ear, from beginning to end. :)
","A film like The Artist doesn't come along very often, but when they do sometimes to novelty can be overrated, not here, after viewing The Artist I think it lives up to any type of hype that is associated with it, it exceeded all my expectations. The lead actor is really really exceptional, his suave face and charisma is so fitting for the 1920's and he has an extremely handsome face to match, Berenice Bejo is just darling as it girl Peppy Miller, both actors are so extremely well cast that it just wouldn't have worked with anyone but them, and the supporting cast do well in their roles, in particular Missi Pyle.I am a fan of silent films so I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to watching a silent film but even non enthusiasts would be charmed by this lovely film. Also worth mentioning is the scene stealer, the dog, hands down the greatest animal in film ever. This film is very funny, from the get go I was smiling and was charmed off my socks. The production is perfect, everything is recreated exactly the way it would have been back in the flapper days, the music, the costuming, everything is perfection.After seeing The Artist it gives me faith that films like Return To Babylon could finally get released, how great it would be to see that film on a big screen, so hopefully with the success of this it may finally after so many years get a release.Just watch and enjoy, you'd have to be a serious grump if you couldn't just go with it. Terrific.",8,3,6,19 February 2012
In Time," The best sci-fi film I've seen in seen in a very long time. Excellent!
","In Time is a fine film with a terrific storyline, excellent acting and a pace that will have you glued to the screen. I'd seen the artwork and trailer for this movie quite a while back and I thought it looked good, a bit of fun trash with an attractive cast, however it's so much more that that, it really is an exceptional film that exceeded my expectations enormously.The story is set in an unknown time in the future when money has been abolished and time is the currency, when you turn 25 you have a year to earn time or your life is over, your clock stops and you die. It's a pretty complex storyline but the script enables you to get a hang of it rather quickly, and you get drawn into the story instantly. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried are excellent together, they have a chemistry on screen that is electric. Amanda Seyfried is the wealthy girl who comes 'from time', who is kidnapped by JT but then abandons her previous life to become a fugitive, her character is one of the best in the film, she is a tough lady, and Justin continues to get better and better.Basically to me this movie seemed like a futuristic sci-fi version if Bonnie And Clyde, it's just as awesome as that and I definitely recommend that you go and see this film on thebig screen. A grade. :)",8,12,26,31 October 2011
Dark Shadows," Entertaining. Funny. Enjoyable.
","In my opinion Dark Shadows is probably the best recent Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp collaboration, well I think it's certainly a lot better than Alice In Wonderland anyway, but if course there are the haters out there, and I must say that the hate from die hard Dark Shadows the series fans is probably warranted as it steers heavily away from the original subject material but the hate from the general movie going public I simply don't understand.There is not one other filmmaker out there that can make movies that are stylistically goth and moody the way Mr Burton does. I think his films create the perfect kind of goth / comic combination. The storyline is exciting, led by a hilarious performance by Depp, the movie speeds on a pretty fast pace I thought, there weren't any times that I was bored. The rest of the cast are pretty superb also, Eva Green is terrific playing something totally different as the villain you just love to hate, Angelique Bouchard, and up and coming Aussie actress Bella Heathcote adds a sweet touch also, I did however think that Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter are a little underused but oh well. Obviously like most movies there are things that are wrong, and Dark Shadows does have it's flaws, the ending is almost not an ending, it kind of seemed like only one part of the story was finalized and the rest was left open ended which was a tad disappointing, but generally the film is great, it's got lots of humor and heart and a nice message about family. I enjoyed it plenty but I guess each to their own.P.S the soundtrack is excellent, the opening with the moody blues, perfect. :)",6,2,6,14 May 2012
Prometheus," I don't understand it, but I still like it.
","Pretty much straight off the bat I realized Prometheus was a very intelligent sci-fi horror film that wasn't to be taken lightly, in saying that though I didn't understand parts of it because sci-fi is a rather new genre for me but I still really enjoyed it for the entertainment. I'm sure maybe after another viewing I would probably see the big picture a little better, also I hadn't seen any of the Alien films, so I didn't pick up any of the underlying links between those movies and this one. The story in a nutshell is people go to space, they find a big planet, they find a big cave and then all hell breaks loose as the astronauts play a dangerous game with an unknown and unseen but definitely there presence.As I said, I'm not a big scifi person, I enjoy them but I don't necessarily run out to watch the new star trek film if you know what I mean, the main reason I went to see the film is because it has Noomi Rapace in it and she impressed me in the original millennium trilogy, and it's great to see that she can still carry a film of an entirely different type, she's great and a really cool leading lady, it's not an easy job to compete with Charlize Theron on screen, but she does so very well, I will continue to look out for her new movies. The rest of the cast is good too, Fassbender is very convincing as a robot and Marshall-Green stands out too, and Theron, well she's always good.Everything production wise is top grade, the music, the effects, the costuming, everything is excellent as you would imagine it to be, and the script and pacing doesn't lag at all, there's not really any boring moments which is good. This movie is entertaining for everyone, I'm sure more scifi intelligent people will understand the bigger picture but for everyone else it's just a cool night out at the movies.Great for moviegoers, even better for the fans. :) Enjoy it.",6,0,7,15 July 2012
The Woman in Black," Superb chiller that is a breath of fresh air for the horror genre.
","As an avid fan of the novel of which this film is based, and a big fan of Hammer, I was very excited to hear that it was finally getting a big screen adaptation, and in my opinion it's an extremely fine adaptation of an extremely spooky story.The story is about a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who is still fragile after the recent death of his wife, because of his grief his work has suffered, so as a final chance to prove himself he is sent to Eel Marsh house to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman, it's here at Eel Marsh house that all the chills, thrills, jumps and bumps start beginning, a mysterious woman dressed entirely in black is seen throughout and around the house, taunting Arthur, this sends Arthur on a mission to find out who the woman in black is and why she haunts Eel Marsh house.I really loved this film, it simply must be seen on the big screen, the moodiness/darkness/dreariness is suited so well to be seen in a dark cold cinema. The production is top notch all the way, the eerie score, the dilapidated house, the almost barren town are all presented terrifically, in particular the trail that leads to Eel Marsh house, it totally has an overwhelming feeling of dread around it, everything in this aspect is done to perfection. The acting is stellar, Daniel Radcliffe is extremely fine in his performance, his emotions and the way he expresses himself are all done very well, not cheesy or overdone, also worth a mention is Janet Mcteer, who is always great, she is almost another mystery worth solving, her character is certainly intriguing and she is great in every scene.The Woman In Black works very well as a horror film as well as a mystery, even though I knew the outcome as I'd read the book, you still get very interested in how it's all going to end, the ending is a tad different from the book but I do actually think this ending films a bit better. An all round excellent movie which is well worth the time, I would recommend it to anyone who loves decent cinema. Here's hoping this is the first in a long string of great new Hammer films. :)",8,0,1,1 June 2012
Win Win," A nice film for a quiet afternoon.
","Paul Giamatti is awesome, simple as that. Such a talented actor, I have yet to see him in a film that I haven't enjoyed. So of course Win Win is the next on the list on his impressive resume, the story was surprisingly quite complex but not difficult to keep track of which is the work of a great director.The character of Jack is very reminiscent of Giamatti's character from Storytelling, a guy somewhat down on his luck who just can't seem to get ahead or on top of things, of course these films are very different but the similarities are definitely there.Amy Ryan impressed me a lot, I've never seen her in anything before but after seeing this I look forward to catching other films with her, she has a great presence in screen and her and Giamatti work excellently together... Also worth mentioning is the always fantastic Jeffrey Tambor, equally as cool as Giamatti.The only thing I thought didn't work was Melanie Lynskey, that woman has one of the sweetest faces and personalities, and seeing her playing a gold digging, backstabbing selfish mother just didn't work. I still love her though.A nice film that is not groundbreaking, but especially entertaining and pleasant to watch.",6,26,32,15 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Yeah..... It's pretty damn excellent.
","It's strange to think that anyone could watch The Dark Knight Rises and nit be impressed, Christopher Nolan has done the impossible, created a superhero movie that isn't a superhero movie, and wow is it an absolute masterpiece. Everything that was excellent about the first two films in the trilogy is multiplied by 10, mixed around a bit, and out back together to create 2.5 hours of pure cinema mastery.The plot is in my opinion the best of all 3, the characters are better, there's really never a dull moment, from the get go I was glued to the screen. I think the main driving force of what made this movie so epic is the ultravillian Bane, far from the dumb sidekick to Poison Ivy we saw in Batman and Robin, Bane here is an absolutely terrifying person who is by far the most villainous of Batman's mercenaries, from the moment you hear that nightmarish voice you are commanded to sit up and pay attention, this character demands to be seen, and Tom Hardy is just flat out awesome in the role. Also I guess it must be said, Anne Hathaway is a revelation as Selina Kyle, the character is severely underdeveloped but what she does have to work with, she does so extremely well, although I am still a staunch fan of Michelle Pfeiffer, no-one will ever top that in my mind, and Christian Bale third time round is equally as good as he was the other two times, minus the weird Batman voice he does, three movies and I'm still not over that.Honestly just go see it, exceeds the first two movies in spades in every type of way. Excellent Excellent Excellent. It's a shame it's all over. :)",8,3,8,21 August 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Pretty sweet and charming.
","Moonrise Kingdom is one of those movies best enjoyed on a quiet afternoon, sit back and just bask in the childish story taking place in front of your eyes. First and foremost I will say that I think this movie is definitely a kids romance, just without the cheesy stuff you see in other such children's fare like the wimpy kid franchise, and for the adults it has a subplot dealing with the parents and other eccentric characters of the town. The driving force of the film is the young cast, Jared Hilman, who I think looks like a miniature Rainn Wilson, and Kara Hayward are electric together on screen, and their quirky eccentricities are perfectly matched, the chemistry between the two just lights up the screen and you're rooting for them from the get go.The supporting cast are good also, it's nice to see Bruce Williston doing something totally different, at this point in his career it's great that he is so comfortable in his career that he's willing to do a movie such as this, and a personal favourite of mine, Tilda Swinton is also very cool and wonderful. The only time I ever thought the film suffered was when it focused on the adults more than the children, in those parts it seemed as though it didn't know if it was a kids movie for adults of an adults movie that kids can also enjoy, it lost it's balance for a little while but that aside the movie is pretty good all the way through.You'd have to be a bit of a grouch to not enjoy this quirky romance, it has a bit of everything, so hopefully you'll see it and really enjoy it, and let's hope we see a lot more of the exceptionally talented young cast. :)",6,5,8,9 September 2012
Footloose," Fun enough for a Saturday night at the movies. Or cheap ass Tuesday.
","Footloose is mindless entertainment with an attractive cast which is easy to watch and will have you wanting to strap on some cowboy boots and join a line dancing troupe, it really is just a fun movie that doesn't exceed any expectations but is still highly enjoyable. It is very loyal to the original film which brings to mind the question of why remake it at all? Well it has been modernized to suit todays teenagers and it still works well storyline wise.The cast is pretty good, Kenny Wormald is great to watch and is a very handsome leading man who i can't wait to watch again, mighty fine eye candy indeed, the female lead however is horrible, the character is just a detestable b**ch, i didn't like her one tiny bit, her character somewhat redeems herself towards the end but for me it was just too late, but i suppose thats not the actress's fault but still she is easily the most unlikable female character ever in a teen film.One thing i loved about this movie is it is a dance movie with a country theme, the country soundtrack is excellent, it's nice to see a mainstream film that doesn't use contemporary dance to tell the story, here it's all boot scootin' and honky tonkin'.The only thing that really disappointed me was the lack of a Kevin Bacon cameo, surely they could've written a small role for him, even just a blink and you'll miss walk on role, oh well.So if you don't ask any questions and sit back and turn off your mind this movie can be very enjoyable. Cut Loose!!!!!",7,2,13,14 October 2011
50_50," A tad over hyped but still pretty funny.
","Who doesn't adore Seth Rogen? And who isn't lusting after Joseph Gordon Levitt? Not very many people, that's what makes this movie good, the unusual team up of these two polar opposite actors. So JGL gets cancer and of course he starts to lose his hair and all the other stuff that goes along with cancer treatment but there by his side is his trusty best friend Seth Rogen in all his comedic cliché but excellent glory.It's pretty good that the subject of cancer can be used in TV and film and it not be a total drag and make you depressed, between this film and The Big C I think a lot of people are enjoying TV and movies about cancer. Seth Rogen does the film so much good, he's just such a lovable guy it's hard not to like him, JGL is also pretty good as usual also, although his character does sometimes get a bit boring. Anna Kendrick is so great in everything, she is a very talented young actress and I hope people like her continue to get the good roles, she manages to stand out in everything she's in.I've heard so many great things about this movie, and I agree with a lot of it but it is a little over hyped, I mean it's good but i have seen better this year , in all honesty I don't think this movie will clean up in awards season, there's just too many other movies that are better.This movie kinda brings together two audiences, the older generation who like serious films and the younger crowd who enjoy the Seth Rogen style comedies, and both audiences will be pleased. Check it out. :)",6,3,6,29 November 2011
The Cabin in the Woods," Horror, with lots of cool thrown in. :)
","Finally, this amazing movie gets released, ever since I saw an early promotional image I wanted to see it, also the fact that it was written by Joss Whedon sparked my interest, so its terrific that it has finally been released. I had read the official novelization of the book before I saw the movie, so I knew everything that was going to happen, but that didn't take away the awesomeness of it, some reviews say 'turns the genre on it's head', and I must agree, The Cabin in the Woods indeed is unlike any other horror film you've seen.This may sound strange but I think this movie takes a lot of the good things from good horror films and tweaks them, and puts them all together into one big puzzle that may or may not make sense, but is a hell of a lot of fun to watch, pretty much from the first scene to the last it's a feast for the eyes.The cast is great, the lead actress is nice to watch, I haven't seen her before but I still liked her, and Chris Hemsworth continues to stand out, Anna Hutchinson is also pretty great, as usual, I was a fan of her Underbelly days so it's great to see her on the big screen, and of course it wouldn't be a cultish film without the presence of Sigourney Weaver, who everyone knows can make any film cool. It's kinda hard to say much without giving a lot of the story away, but it's definitely worth seeing, it's horror-cool with a massive amount of humor, it's just great. :)Love love love it. ^.^",8,1,6,26 June 2012
