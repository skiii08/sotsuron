Black Swan," Don't Believe the Hype
","I really don't understand all the awards buzz surrounding this film. It is so over-the-top campy! Maybe a little bit of this was on purpose--casting Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder is already perhaps something of a clue to where this film's sensibilities lie. Even Vincent Cassel camps it up, and he is too good for this not to be on purpose. The premise is just so tired: 'You must break through to the dark side to create real art, even if it means destroying yourself.' Yawn. Maybe the film was really, at heart, making fun of this credo? I just don't give it that much credit. But credit is due to Natalie Portman, who manages to weather the storm and play her role convincingly enough. Maybe this is what is so jarring--she plays it straight while most of the other actors in the movie do not. Anyhow, this film didn't gel for me, though I could not fail to be moved by Tchikovsky's music for 'Swan Lake,' the most beautiful ballet score of all, and overwhelming in its beauty.",5,8,17,7 January 2011
Brokeback Mountain," Story+Acting+Directing
","Big movies like this are reviewed and reviewed to death--over 2000 people have written here alone. And yet I write one more, because this movie moved me and means a lot to me as a gay man and a human being. I don't think this movie would have worked without the transcendent power of Heath Ledger's portrayal. When Ennis Del Mar ends his life ruined by his internalized homophobia, the pain he makes us see brings us all immediately to his experience. This is what can happen to you if society and your relationship to it conspire to keep you from attaining something so important to the human condition as love.This is a big Hollywood Epic, but masterpieces are not the exclusive terrain of quirky, off-beat films. When everything works right--superb acting from all four principles, restrained yet purposeful direction, a fantastic story--you must admire the result. This is a beautiful movie, a gay movie, a human movie, an example of high achievement in the art of film.",8,19,21,18 October 2007
Across the Universe," Very Good
","I think this is a very good film that succeeds on its own terms, as a musical revue of the 1960's. A lot of the criticism of the film centers around the fact that it glosses over the tremendous upheavals of the 1960's by reducing them to glorified music videos. It is expecting too much to ask for a musical to really deepen our understanding of such a large historical moment. What the film does do well is remind us that there was a context for the Beatles' music. The settings for the songs serve as a kind of shorthand reminder of the larger context. Case in point: the setting of 'Let it Be' as a funeral hymn sung at the funeral of an African-American boy killed in a race riot. On the one-hand, it reduces the racial tensions of 1960's America to three short minutes--on the other hand, it reminds us that 'Let it Be' is really a hymn, a prayer for peace in a time of tremendous upheaval. And it is exquisitely sung. It is a moving moment in the film.On the whole, Julie Taymor really makes the music come alive on the screen. Some of the voices are fantastic. Dana Fuchs is wonderful as the Janis-Joplinesque singer, and T.V. Carpio's tender rendition of 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' early in the movie drew me in completely. One of the other criticisms of the film is that the versions here can't hold a candle to the originals, and here I have to vehemently disagree. Lennon and McCartney were great performers AND great songwriters, and it is a testament to their strengths as the latter that their music can be reinterpreted with such success. But it is also a testament to the music producers, arrangers and singers that the new versions work so well. 'Helter Skelter,' for one, is every bit as engaging as the original. The film is all the more impressive as many of the Beatles' recordings have become almost clich√©--especially now that they have begun to be used more in advertising.On the whole, a very imaginative film, which leaves you wanting more from director Julie Taymor.",7,2,5,13 October 2007
There Will Be Blood," An American Epic
","This film pulls together three key elements of American mythology--the West, capitalism, and religion. It is an incredibly ambitious film, which doesn't operate by making statements about these elements, but juxtaposes them to provide the audience with a chance to ponder their relationship--that is, until the end, where an over-the-top, and overly simplified final scene brings the movie to an unsatisfying end.But, up until the last 15 minutes, the film takes one's breath away. And it could not be so without Daniel Day-Lewis' fine portrayal of a misanthropic oil man. He is both hero (for holding out against the monopoly of Standard Oil) and villain (for his treatment of his son, and the townspeople). He is not wholly bad, but one realizes that his good deeds ultimately are in service of his greed, and, paradoxically, are a function of his hatred of others and his desire to ultimately be alone.The other acting is good as well, especially Dillon Freasier in the role of Day-Lewis's son, H.W. I felt that Paul Dano was outmatched by Day-Lewis (who wouldn't be?). Whereas Day-Lewis played magnificently the juxtaposition of irony and sincerity in his 'conversion' scene, I felt Dano tilted too much towards an ironic portrayal in his early scenes as an evangelical preacher. Yes, we do find out in the end that he was a charlatan, but, in order for him to gain a following, he would have had to come across as more charismatic in his preaching scenes. And there is the problem of his looking and acting the same as an older man in the problematic final scene.The score was amazing. Many film scores just linger in the background, having more of an unconscious effect. This score constantly intruded, sometimes contradicting the action, sometimes reaching a climax before the filmed image did, which helps to heighten the uneasy feeling of danger one must have felt working on an oil rig at the time. The use of silence, especially in the opening scene, where we just observe Day-Lewis alone as a prospector, was very effective. The cinematography was beautiful, and the film was a pleasure to watch.",9,1,7,7 January 2008
American Gangster," Good, Entertaining
","This was a good film--coherent script, fine acting, interesting story, efficient directing. Ridley Scott gives an effective picture of the New York that was, the one that threatened to implode in the 1970's, and of the rise and fall of the gangster Frank Lucas. Lucas took the lessons of American capitalist entrepreneurship to the heroin trade, offering a better product at a better price than his competition, and was rewarded with wealth and a certain sort of fame.Washington and Crowe are excellent throughout, especially in their long scene in the prison interview room near the end of the film. The other actors are fine, especially Josh Brolin, who should pick up a supporting actor Oscar nomination for his work in this film--he was utterly convincing as a corrupt cop. And Ruby Dee was a pleasure to watch in her few scenes as Lucas's mother.Though long, the film kept the viewer interested through effective pacing of events. The Vietnam War is the background of this story, as it allowed Lucas to develop his drug distribution network, and events of the war are always peeking through on televisions throughout the movie. All in all, it is an effective evocation of a time and place, and a singular story that unfolded in that environment.",7,0,2,13 January 2008
La Vie En Rose," La Mome Cotillard
","Whether or not one appreciates this film depends on one's opinion of Cotillard's performance--the rest of it is perfunctory. I think that her performance is indeed remarkable--she is the Piaf that this film wants us to see. Others have mentioned omissions and deviations from Piaf's life story--but a lot of it is here. It is just filmed and told in such a conventional and plodding manner that it can be hard to get through. There are some very moving scenes--when Piaf loses her lover in the plane crash, her struggle with drugs--again, a testament to Cotillard's acting. I am not unhappy that I saw this film--the parts where Piaf/Cotillard is singing are pleasant enough, but on the whole, not a great film.",5,2,5,11 December 2007
