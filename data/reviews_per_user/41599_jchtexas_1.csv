Deja Vu," Like this flick
","I really liked this movie - lots of great time-slip foreshadowing and well-thought 'time machine' twists. It is very difficult to impress me with a time twist anymore - and this one was a lot of fun to watch. Denzel is also a lot of fun as a plainspoken ATF agent amidst what initially appear to be stuffy techs who don't really know how to apply their amazing technology. In the end I think most everyone will really like this ride and find a surprise around every corner - I won't write any spoilers - but if you really like time-travel or techno thrillers, this one's for you.And by the way - pay closer attention to the first time you watch it - then watch it again. There are just tons of little twists that you'll pass over when you first watch the movie - and watching it a second time is a blast because they all come rushing at you. I think the directors intended this considering the theme of the film.",10,3,6,20 June 2007
