It," This is how a novel-to-film adaptation should be.
","Before I begin, I would like to state that the book is a masterpiece in nearly every sense. As disappointing as it was to not see certain aspects from the novel such as the Smoke Hole and Mike's bird at the Ironworks, and so on, I have for the most part come to terms with the fact that some things just cannot be translated well into film. I understand that adaptations and changes must be made in order to make a film work with a general audience. Because of this, I will choose not to complain about things absent in the movie. With that in mind, I believe the movie works very well. The acting is obviously superb with amazing performances all around. Personally, I believe it far surpasses the original in everything but corniness. I saw the original 1990 'It' when I was young, and never once was I intimidated or frightened, or even impressed. Some people say this version relies too heavily on 'jumpscares', but I disagree. A cheap jumpscare would be when there isn't a buildup. An obvious setup for a jumpscare is often seen as cheap and predictable, but then these same people would complain about a jumpscare with no buildup. I did not think any of the jumpscares felt forced or cheap. Another major complaint from most people is the CGI, and while I can't argue with anyone about how much CGI can ruin an experience for them, but expecting practical effects in movies nowadays just seems futile to me. I've accepted CGI at this point, and it never really took me out of the film, but I can definitely see that it could be an issue to some. But overall the characters were likable and funny, the plot worked, and I went out of the movie happily anticipating a sequel.",8,2,3,2 October 2017
