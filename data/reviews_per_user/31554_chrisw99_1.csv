The Blair Witch Project," Worst film ever made?
","This is probably the worst film I have ever seen.  The 'scary' elements account for perhaps 10% of the length, the remaining 90% is just devoted to three people wandering about in the woods.  And they're such an annoying, irritating bunch of characters that you just hope they'll die as soon as possible.If you really do want to watch this, skip forward to about 5 minutes from the end, it's all you need to see.  And even then, it's probably not worth wasting 5 minutes of your life on.",1,2,4,6 June 2001
