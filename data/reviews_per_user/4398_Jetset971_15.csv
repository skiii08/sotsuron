The King's Speech," Colin Firth's finest moment on the silver screen.
","This was an exceptionally well crafted historical drama. The set and costumes add immensely to the atmospheric mood of pre-WW2 England. The direction is crisp and through to detail. Best of all is the superb cast of Helen Bohnam Carter and Jeffery Rush as the Queen and Tutor of the stammering and shy King. However the one person that made this movie soar above the clouds without a doubt was Colin Firth as the king that wanted to be just a man. I have always been impressed by Colin Firth. Through the years his career has grown at a gradual pace displaying his great acting chops in such films as Conspiracy, Bridget Jones Diary, and other great films. In this movie, I think Firth has reached his zenith of excellence. He will always be a top notch actor and will give strong performances. But, I must say that it be very difficult to top his performance here. Watching Firth, nervously stammer through his torturous king's speeches made you feel as if you were seeing the real historical king George going through his ordeal. His performance won him a richly deserved Oscar and massive critical acclaim. See this movie!",9,0,0,6 April 2011
Star Trek," The casting is the real star of this movie.
","Let me cut to the chase and say the best thing about this sequel was in the top notch casting. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were completely convincing as the younger Kirk and Spock. Each not only looked the parts but must have done extensive research on the mannerisms and quirks of the older counterparts. Simon Peg gives a delightful impersonation of Chief engineer Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott. I have to give the highest praise to Karl Uban who looked, sounded and for all accounts was the incarnation of Deforest Kelly's Doctor Mcoy. Man, when he was on the screen i was totally sold. The only problem with this movie, ironically, is the plot. It seems so ambiguous and lack luster that it just seems to be there to give the cast something to do. The villain is uninteresting as well. To be completely honest i was just captivated by each of the new cast members take on the familiar old cast members. I just hope when they make more sequels with this cast, and trust me they will, they will put a lot more thought into the plot. Now that we know the new cast can do the job, give them a worthy script.",Null,0,3,22 October 2011
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Great Movie! Back when Robin Williams' movies were funny.
","I recently saw this movie again after seeing it over and over again in the late 1980's. It remains as intriguing, funny and thought provoking as it did way back then. The only thing that upsets me watching this movie is the painful reminder how just how much Robin Williams' films have tanked in the last two decades. I hate to say it but the fact is that Robin Williams sold out a long, long time ago. Sure he had a major breakthrough with 'Good Will Hunting' back in 1997, but that was a Drama. All his supposed 'Comedies' have gotten less funny and more stag-net as time has gone by. There are far too many to list but the major stinkaroo titles would be 'Fathers day', 'Patch Adams' and that bottom feeder of a comedy 'RV'. Take more time to look over these scripts your getting Mr. Williams. Think Carefully!",8,0,0,14 May 2010
The Thing," Totally underrated!
","Now this movie was back when horror masters like John Carpenter where really hitting their stride! This 1982 remake of 'The Thing from another world' was a sheer delight to all fans of gore and horror! Kurt Russel is perfectly cast as the boozing anti-social helicopter pilot R.J MacReady. His performance hit the right tone of the last guy you would ever expect to take up the mantel of leadership in a situation like this. Actually, I have to commend the entire cast in this movie. They all are individuals with strengths and weaknesses that come off as genuine. The big temptation in a movie like this is for everybody to ultimately rise to the challenge and work together to fight this alien menace. Here everybody is an individual that cant trust anybody else because the enemy is hidden and could be anybody. The setting of the barren ice Continent of Anarctica was so apt to convey the isolation of these men. This and the tight almost claustrophobic way the camera shoots tends to send shivers right up my spine. The soundtrack was truly scary with its primitive methodical tempo of impending doom. The special effects in this movie, for 1982 or even for today, were jaw dropping! I had nightmares for weeks at some of those transformation scenes. Like, remember when the thing-dog is put into the kennels and transforms into some horrific space creature and starts to absorb the other dogs. Or when the 'test' to discover who is the thing is done and the blood literately screams and jumps out of the dish. I could go on and on. Whoever did the effects for this movie should have gotten at least an Oscar nomination. In conclusion, see this movie if you like horror, or even just suspense. You will not be disappointed!",9,1,2,4 December 2010
Armageddon," This movie is just like a cloud, absolutely no substance.
","Yet another prime example of what I term the 'Michael Bay method of movie making', you take an overdeveloped script with every cliché in the book and pump in decent actors and have them ham it up oh and make sure you throw everything you can at the screen at such breakneck pace. Oh, don't forget some really annoying slow motion editing that enhances nothing in the scene. The rest of the editing should be scattered an choppy and top it all of with a blaring, to the point of annoying music score, Place in blender and mix it up, with no lid so it spill everywhere, and voilà! You have a 'Micheal Bay frothy shake with absolutely no nutritional or substantial value'! Enjoy! ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Michael Bay movies are So bleeping annoying! Its been 12 years since this festival of inept mediocrity came out and Bay still gets work. This movie was a real waste of such a talented cast like Willis, Afleck, and Thornton. The script feels like it was written by people that never elevated from junior high dialoage. The effects are acceptable, but not nearly enough to salvage the rest of the film. Of course when Bay is at the helm, making all the decisions, they is no hope for you movie at all. In conclusion: Michael Bay you suck.",4,1,3,5 December 2010
Pearl Harbor," Leave it to Michael Bay to give action a bad name.
","First. This movie had great sets and decent actors and could have been something more than just window dressing if not for one major fly in the ointment...MICHAEL #@!$ING BAY!!! Why does this no talent hack continue to get work? I'll tell you why, because he has a sure fire formula working for him. He signs on to big budget flicks loaded with oodles of special effects and he knows all he has to do is launch all of the effects on the screen and people will pay big bucks to see it. Never mind the fact that every other element he is in charge of is going to suffer irrevocably. The Michael Bay motto seems to be, Bells and whistles to the point of irritation. I have never seen a movie of his yet where you couldn't stop groaning at the tired clichés, shotgun editing, and junior high dialouge.Pearl Harbor, I think, Is a special turd in the Michael Bay kitty litter box. Not only is it too long, its too trite, too hokey, too dull and too saturated with missteps that only a joke of a director like MB can perpetrate. Mark my words, If they keep giving MB more directing jobs he will soon be on the fast track to beating out legendary schlock director 'Ed Wood' for the title of 'Worst Director of all Time'.",1,6,9,5 September 2010
The Princess Bride," Flawless.
","Rob Reiner's 'The Princess Bride' is about as close to perfection as any movie I have ever scene. Believe me I RARELY give 10 out of 10 stars to a movie and when I do it has to not only be superb but withstand the test of time. Its been almost 25 years and this movie has never lost a step in its brilliance. The story is completely captivating the locations are breathtaking and the array of emotions that this movie evokes from the audience is sheer perfection. You laugh, you cry, you cheer, and you smile. You couldn't ask for a better cast. Robin Wright Penn and Cary Elwes are top notch. Wallace Shawn is hilarious as the bandit leader Fezig. Andre the giant is such a sweet and gentle soul and Mandy Patinkin is nothing short of miraculous in his performance. Even the cameos in this film are priceless. Billy Chrystal and Carol Kane are so great as 'Miracle Max and his wife Valarie' they could have there own sequel. A very young Fred Savage and the always entertaining Peter Falk have tremendously funny and touching scenes as the Grandparent and Grandson. I could go on and on. If you have never scene this movie do yourself a HUGE favor and rent it.",Null,1,1,4 April 2011
The Elephant Man," You cant prepare yourself enough.
","I thought i knew exactly what to expect going in to see this movie. I knew it was about the life of the horribly disfigured 'Elephant Man'. I knew it would be sad and very depressing and hard to take at times. I thought i was prepared, i was wrong. This movie hit me so hard that i cried throughout the whole film. My tears all represented my emotions for this film, tears of sorrow, anger, despair and finally as the movie reached its climatic end, tears of hope. Despite being buried under massive amounts of impeccable make-up. John Hurt was able to represent the inner humanity of John Merick. It is truly a credit to his talent to be able to convey genuine feeling through that make-up. Everybody quotes his 'I am not an animal line' but the line that just rips you apart inside is when he shows a picture of his mother and says 'I tried to be good for her', revealing how she rejected him. If your not moved by that scene, go out and buy yourself a conscience. See this movie!",Null,3,3,21 July 2011
I Am Legend," Doesn't even come close to OMEGA MAN!
","Folks, I have to be honest with you. I was so looking forward to seeing this remake, that its all I thought about for weeks. I figured Will Smith was a good choice and what wonderful things they could do with todays cinematic technology. Being a huge fan of the 1971 classic 'The Omega Man', a far superior concept, I was really anxious to see what they could come up with. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Now I know some people will say that this movie was not meant to be a carbon copy of Omega, and that I am judging it based on a unfair criteria. My response is this, if you try to remake a classic and you fail miserably, you desevere all the razzing you get. Being as specific as possible, here are my main complaints.1. VERY POOR SGI. I have to say that the SGI in this movie was not in the least bit convincing. The plague victims looked like cheaply made Zombies that were scraped from a cheesy rendition of House of the dead. Even the freaking animals, that became infected, were crudely done. 2. LAME Villains. There is an old saying, 'A movie is only as good as it's Villain.', And in this movie the villains are boring as hell. One dimensional blood thirsty mutants that look like rejects from the Curly Stooge fan club, running around trying to suck Nevelles blood when all they actually do is just suck. Remember Omega Man? Yes the mutants were dressed in black robes and had heavy white makeup on and white contact lences but compared to this movie it looked far more real. Furthermore, in Omega Man, the mutants actually TALKED! Yeah, they were homicidal savages but they had character! With names like Mathias, Zachery, and so forth! Mathias and his 'Family' may have been completely crazy but at least they could dialoge with nevelle. I really hated they way they went with the mutants in this remake.3. Social Commentary. Very weak social Commentary in this remake. Will smith does a fair job with what little he's given here. In the Omega Man, The first half of the movie superbly shows the desolation and melencoly that has come over society as Charlton Heston drives aimlessly through the deserted streets and buildings looking at whats left of mans legacy. But here, The scripts doesn't go nearly far enough, I never felt the same poinentcy that Omega man displayed. Backpeddling a little, maybe if some interesting villains were added like in Omega Man, You could feel more meaning into what has been lost in this world and what remains. Let me give an example, In Omega man, When the mutants first capture nevelle, he says to them that he is a scientist, Despite being a homicidal maniac, the head mutant Mathias answers, 'Definition of a scientist, a Man that understood nothing, till there was nothing left to understand!' Sheer brilliance. In I Am Legend The best dialoge the mutants can muster is 'Grr, snarl, Rahhh,'.3. Slaped together ending. This is my biggest complaint. And to be fair I thought Omega Man suffered a LITTLE bit of this too. However, I am Legend is much worse off. After two thirds of this movies Lame villains and their CGI, and lame social commentary, we finally Meet the uninfected survivors like in Omega Man. Unlike in Omega Man, They zip in and out giving us no time to really get to know them or care about them. You know nevelle has got to sacrifice himself for them but its done so hastely that you feel like the movies saying 'Hurry up and die already, I am running out film'. I know that had to rap it up sometime but jeez in Omega Man You got to get to know the human survivors a lot better and felt a lot more sympathy than in this shoddy remake. All in all, for reasons I have already stated, this remake was at worst a traviesty and at best extremely mediocre. My advise to anyone about to see this movie, do yourself a favor, rent The Omega Man watch it and then watch this movie. You will see that everything I have stated is a fact. One last comment, After seeing this movie I walked out of the theatre and was reminded of the final words of Mathias in omega Man, 'The Bad Dream is over...Now we must sleep'! AMEN!!!! Oh I almost forgot to metion the Black and white version with vicent price...Well, let me sum it up quick. Not as good as Omega Man, but unlike I am Legend, not meant to be campy and cheesy!",3,8,10,22 April 2008
Transformers," Micheal Bay have you no shame?
","I loved the Transformers. Always haved. Big fan since they started way back in 1984. I was so looking forward to seeing the big budget live action movie, it filled me with high hopes that they would do justice to a cherished childhood love of mine. Then I found out who would be directing it....My hope scattered like cockroaches do when you turn on the lights. Micheal Bay is one of the worst directors in main stream Hollywood today. His movies are ALWAYS hopelessly overblown and overproduced exercises in irritation!! This movie is not only no exception, it reinforces that fact. This movie just dragged on and on and on till when we finally get to meeting the transformers, you just don't care anymore. The script was lame the story was plodding and as I have already stated the directing was disastrous. The worst part about Micheal Bays direction was the way the action scenes were shot. Because this is Micheal Bay, he feels a need to make every single bit of action fit into every single frame. The camera work was so all-over-the-place that I couldn't hardly focus on what was going on half the time. In summation, Bad Acting, bad writing, bad story, bad movie, and above all else...Atrocias, egregious, draconian, malicious, and every other negative term for bad in the English language, directing by Micheal 'I really know how to make a sucky movie' Bay. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2,0,3,17 August 2008
Pulp Fiction," This IS the best film of 1994, no of the 90s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I am not ashamed to say it. This may very well be Quentin Tarentino's very own Citizen Kane. This is LEGENDARY film making of the highest caliber. I have sat through this movie countless times and never have gotten board by it. In fact, I always seem to find and appreciate a new aspect when i watch it. I don't even know where to begin when it comes to praising this film. Directing, writing, acting, cinematography, are all flawless and beyond reproach. I really dig the style and mood this film generates and absolutely love the dialog. Tarentino and Roger Avery wrote a script so insightful and intriguing that even mundane topics like 'Fast food in Europe' or 'The merits of bacon' are impossible to ignore. These guys could make reading a tax audit engrossing! Along with the script, i have to re-credit Tarentino's direction. I am convinced that in anybody Else's hand this would not have been nearly as great a film. They camera angles the scene shots and oh yes, the editing, are so innovative that they are beyond words. The cast. John Travolta gave, i think, his best performance ever as the drug addict hit-man Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson, who is brilliant in any performance, brings out new dimensions in acting excellence here as Jules Winfield. Uma Thurman is breathtaking as Mia Wallace, the coke head who does drugs because her life is so superficial she thinks she cant feel anything without them. Bruce Willis, as boxer Butch Coolage, commands the screen with a reserved but seething intensity. Havey Keitel has a great scene stealing moment as the problem solving expert Mr. Wolf. I could go on and on but you will not find one week performance from anyone in this movie.How this movie did not win best picture in 1994, instead losing to 'Forrest Gump' is way beyond me. Don't get me wrong, Gump was a good movie but to me, it couldn't hold a candle to Fiction.",10,0,3,5 April 2011
Die Hard," Great Flick, But did anyone notice....
","I loved this film. But it had one little fly in the ointment that always bothered me. This is going to sound nit picky but I just have to say it. Did anyone notice that when the Germans have Maclean pinned down and Hans knows that Maclean doesn't have any shoes or socks on, He gets an Idea. Hans says to Karl, in their native tongue of German mind you, 'Shoot the Glass'. Karl gets this confused look on his face like he has no Idea what he just said. Hans gets miffed and says to Karl in English, 'Shoot the Glass'. Almost like he is saying 'Whats the matter Karl? Don't you speak German!'. I mean its was almost comical. Here these guys have made it abundantly clear that they are from Germany and that there first language is German, yet, some of them have to have things said in English in order to fully comprehend? Just a little observation. Still a great film!",9,1,1,6 October 2007
Jaws," Still great after all these years!
","It's amazing how this movie has held up against time. Roy Schieder is at the top of his game as the beligured cop on an Island. Richard Dreyfuss gives, in my opinion, one of his best performances as the eager sharkoligist Hooper. Robert Shaw, is nothing short of mezmorizing as the salty old shark hunter Quint. As for the Shark....Well, I must say that it is a credit to Steven Spielbergs genius that he wisely choose to save showing the shark until the last act of the movie. Its really the 'Lack of what we see' that is the most terrifying. John Williams score will be forever seared into our memories whenever we think of something ominously stalking in the ocean. I never grow tired of this movie and strongly recommend it to future generations. The effects may not have CGI, but 'Jaws' proves that what we don't see is far more spooky than what we do see.",10,2,5,14 May 2010
Jackie Brown," Another Hit for the master Tarentino!
","The more times I see this movie the more I like it. To me, that is the trademark of a truly exceptional director. Quentin Tarentino hits another grand slam with 'Jackie Brown' and homage to the 'Blackspotation' movies of the 1970's. I really like this movie! The cast is fantastic, not one weak performance in any of the characters, Pam Grier is in top form in the tittle role and comes across as nothing but genuine. Samuel L. Jackson, as always, gives a mesmerizing performance as Ordell. Supporting players Robert DeNiro and Brige Fonda, are spot on. As for Robert Forrester, Man, I have never scene him give a better performance. He hits just the right tone as Max Cherry. The dialoge, as always in a Tarentino film, keeps you enthralled from beginning to end. One of my favorite scene has to be when Ordell,( Sam Jackson), has just shot Beuamont and is showing him to Lewis, (DeNiro), Here is A sample of the dialog. 'Who' that' 'Thats Beuamont' 'Who's Beamont? 'An Employee that I had to let go.' Love it! Quentin Tarentino does not churn out a movie every year or every two years. He is a master craftsmen, who like Stanley Kubrick, makes a movie when he finds something that interests him. I think that Tarentino will go on for decades to come and not amass large numbers of films but will leave a body of treasured gems. Mr. Tarentino, I salute you sir, To me you are on the same level of Stanley Kubrick! You take all the time you want, I know I will not be disappointed.",9,0,0,24 November 2010
Gladiator," Good summer movie but Oscar worthy?
","I have had a great deal of discussions with people about this film. I agree it is a good movie. Its entertaining, action packed, worth the price of a ticket. However, I don't think I have ever seen a movie win so many awards without questioning the validity. Gladiator, while still a good film, is hardly deserving of all its accolades. I mean it might be worthy of winning cinematography or production awards or special effects but Best picture? Best Actor? I could think of a 100 other movies in the year 2000 more deserving than this movie. Don't misunderstand, I like this movie, but the problem is that movie awards like the Oscars,presumably, are there to honor high quality and High achievements in each respected field. Russel Crowe does an adequate job, but his acting in his other Oscar nominated films like 'The Informant' or 'A Beautiful Mind' were light years ahead of his performance in 'Gladiator'. Furthermore, Giving best picture to this film was mind boggling. I personally feel that the only reason this movie was even in the running at all, was because of the money it made. It was a good action movie and nothing more. Hey, remember that 'Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' was also up for best picture that year. In my opinion, It ran circles around 'Gladiator'. Wheras 'Gladiator' was just a good action film. CTHD was a phenomenal action movie and love story and should have won the top prize.",7,6,9,14 May 2010
