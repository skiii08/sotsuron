The Hangover," most likely the best comedy ever made (especially for guys)
","This has GOT to be the BEST comedy/ road-movie EVER. I can not remember another movie that made me laugh more. The story is SO whack (without going into detail), that it becomes plausible. People get married all the time... and they all have bachelor- parties.Unless you're sad and have no friends of course. This is the ULTIMATE male bachelor-party!!! And it even has a happy ending. The casting is perfect, 4 types of guys thrown into it.... this is how comedy should be. To complement the feel of the movie, the music fits like a glove. I SOO hope there will be a movie just like it ( maybe a sequel)...but those are tricky when the first one is AWESOME.If this movie doesn't make you at least giggle or more likely LOL/ LMAO... you need counseling for NOT having a sense of humor",10,2,4,21 February 2010
