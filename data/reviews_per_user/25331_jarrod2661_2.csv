It," A thrilling take of King's classic novel
","Little kids and middle-aged men beware!IT, the 2017 reimagining of Stephen King's classic novel, is hands down one of the best modern horror films in years. The film works as a coming of age tale, a horror film, and as a thriller. However, the film is so much more than that.IT 2017 is directed by Andres Muschietti and stars a group of very talented young actors, with the stand out being Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things fame, as well as Bill Skarsgård playing the classic Pennywise that will give you nightmares for months.The film is about a group of kids who live in Derry, Maine who ban together to stop a killer clown, Pennywise, from feeding off children's fears. The film's story has been told before in the 1990 miniseries of the same name, however in the 2017 reimagining, the film is told entirely from the kid's perspective and is light years better than the miniseries. Skarsgård, who plays Pennywise, the dancing clown, gives one of the most bone chilling and memorable performances of the year.Skarsgård owns the role from the way he moves to the way he talks and completely sells the creepy nature of Pennywise as well as still maintaining the mystery and mystique of the character. Even though Pennywise is shown more they some might deem necessary, he owns the screen and has the power to scare the hell out of anyone with a pair of eyes. The character is selling point of the film and will be remember for years to come.Muschietti has crafted a beautiful looking film with scares that will keep you awake thinking about them. Particularly, one in a garage, have fun sleeping! Not only do the scares work, the humor is also, very funny. The writers have done a great job on having the dialogue sound believable. The things that the young cast say are very much how young grade school kids would one another. From dropping F bombs to talking about each other's sisters, the humor works.As I said before, this is a beautiful film. From some very nice wide shots of Pennywise to the look of Derry, Muschietti has made a film that could be realistic while also sticking to King's classic feel. This is very much a Stephen King film, thick and through. From the kids jumping off cliffs into the lake in only their underwear to a father that really likes his daughter, King's signature touch is all over this film.However, with all the positives, come the negatives. I have one minor problem with the film. That problem being that when the scares come and when Pennywise appears on screen, the film never gives the scares time to breathe. When the tension is at an all-time high, it is broken with funny dialogue. When you have a scene that is very intense only to break the intensity with humor can become rather annoying for the audience.Out of all the great films this year, from Get Out to Baby Driver, IT has, without a doubt, been the most fun I have had all year at the theater. From the great scares the film delivers, to the hilarious dialogue, IT is not only a great horror film, but one of the best films of the year.",9,2,3,29 September 2017
Taxi Driver," A masterclass in film!
","For the longest time, I had never seen Taxi Driver. As a film fan, it is a huge disgrace to have never seen it. Now I can say I have and what a film it is. Taxi Driver is a film that has stuck with long after I watched it. Taxi Driver is a weird film. A film that takes it's time to tell it's story. Not only is it a masterclass in how a story should be told however it is also a remarkable character film as well and that is all because of De Niro's iconic performance. From his mannerisms, to his dialogue, everything that he does is incredibly breathtaking to watch and sets the standard for how a character performance should. Also a stand out is Jodie Foster. Foster, now a movie star in her own right, makes great use of the screen time she is given. She is not in it much, however she is memorable as well as a young hooker trying to break free of the life she lives. This is a great film. Filled with memorable lines and screens. Taxi Driver is the standard for crime dramas and will be remember forever as perfect film.",9,1,1,7 December 2017
