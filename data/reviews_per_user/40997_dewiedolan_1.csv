Your Name.," Regularly entertaining
","I am very conflicted with this film. On one hand I liked the technical aspects of it: it's music, color, scenery and amazing animation. All of that is good. On the other, I didn't liked the story, for me it was too forced and melodramatic. Of course not all of it is bad, the characters were OK and some moments were entertaining. But when I look back at the film, the bad moments overshadow the good ones. I think that my main problem is that the 'fantastic' aspect of it was used as a plot device. It gave the movie a good premise but it also took a lot of fun from it. For me, it felt that it didn't had rules, that the movie was just inventing something new all the time and improvising its own plot. They didn't even gave an explanation for many of the things in the film.Another think I didn't liked is that it feels like this movie is manipulating you into crying. Of course, every movie manipulates us in a certain way. But here it is very obvious, this is proved by its use of very melodramatic music and constant uses of over dramatic monologues. I didn't hated this movie, I just thought that it wasn't as good as it could have been. Kimi no na wa had an interesting premise but its story is what holds it from being good. Maybe if it was told another way, for example like a mystery, it could have been better.",5,14,28,8 December 2017
