50 First Dates," Interesting story-line however fragmented it is at times
","Here we have another interesting look at the comedic genius abilities of America's most loved - Adam Sandler, and the corresponding girly charm of ever-likeable Drew Barrymore. Sandler turns in a mediocre performance with Barrymore in this almost unique plot(similarity in some small measure to Ground Hog Day) where a concussion has caused the protagonist Lucy to lose her short term memory. In an endeavor to fall in love with his most challenging conquest yet, Sandler's character attempts a series of wild and imaginative stunts to combat her Achilles heel. Knowing that every new day signals the beginning of winning her over once again, Sandler bravely and stubbornly persists in trying to indelibly etch himself into Barrymore's deeper subconscious. In an emotionally draining and sporadically amusing relationship(If one day flings with an individual with no short-term memory classify as a relationship) Sandler must try to stay the course and through some inventive way manifest their mutual 'love' for one another deep within her. Ultimately the trials and tribulations pay off and through clever scheming via prerecorded video cassette the nuptial is concluded in a lovely Jewish Style Wedding!",Null,0,0,29 August 2004
Spider-Man," Daring stunts and special effects galore!
","It comes as no surprise that Marvel Comics has produced a full length modern-day feature film of one of the most loved superheroes of all time. My personal favorite - the amazing Spider-man. Following the huge public interest in Superman, Batman and the Incredible Hulk to name but a few, it was only natural that the dexterity and agility of Spider-man hit our silver screens. Peter Parker is the average guy-next-door. He isn't the stud or the icon that our heroes often appear to be, rather he is goofy, rather conflicted and shy. The film explores his difficult time as a bookworm at high school. However with a little help from a radioactive spider, he is soon transformed into a marvelous hero. One who soon realizes that with great power comes great responsibility. The first film laid the platform for the ultimate success of the second, however the first is a better film in many aspects.",Null,0,1,26 August 2004

X2: X-Men United," You want entertainment value plus much more!!!
","X2 is an awesome movie, with daring stunts and special effects galore. The comic-book characters have been brought to life with startling realism and ferocious intensity. The story once again focuses on the loner Wolverine whose destiny it is to uncover  his origin. The entire dazzling array of Mutants is here to behold. Magneto and his cronies, determined to wipe out humanity must once again be halted by those who have decided to safeguard humanity from the embittered Magneto. It is world order that can only exist through co-existence of Humans and Mutants. We have several new mutant additions in this film and their extraordinary abilities are displayed in a series of riveting scenes. With good sequels so hard to come by, this one has proven its worth in gold and I for one eagerly await X3 whenever it is scheduled for release!",Null,0,0,29 August 2004
The Sixth Sense," Enthralling and riveting viewing!
","This was truly a gem of a film, in which Bruce Willis once again displays his exceptional versatility as a quality actor. The audience is drawn into a thrilling and eerie adventure through the eyes of a terrified youngster. It makes for captivating viewing and is so wonderfully crafted that it can only be appreciated fully through a second cursory viewing of the material. Full credit to the writers and actors of this nail-biting thriller. As a psychologist juxtaposed alongside his grieving wife, the plot slowly begins to unravel.Along the lines of 'Fight Club', this film is worthy of viewing and is a guaranteed KO in entertainment value. It is one of those films that evoke deep thought and the twist in the tale is well worth the viewing.",Null,0,0,26 August 2004
