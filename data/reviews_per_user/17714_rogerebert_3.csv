Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A film Classic like no other
","To make a great classic film i think it has to work on several different levels and this one not only plays on many different levels It scores tremendously.It is a great childrens movie. With zany classic characters such as Roger, the Weasles, and Benny the Cab. They are original crazy and fun. Also it is a mystery. It plays perfectly as one of those Old 50's detective stories. It is a milestone in film making. The scenes of the 'toons' and humans sharing a world is great. I think the best scene as special effects go, is the one where Eddie and Roger are handcuffed together in his office. It looks so real!!!!! This movie is fun and creative and will go down in movie history. I don't know what else to say it is simply the best.Also do your self a favor and steer clear of the bad rip off Cool World.",Null,74,91,1 August 2001
Once Upon a Time in America," Terrible time in America!
","This was just a horrible, horrible movie. NO actors no matter how great could save this junk. This flat script with terrible dull characters, that you don't care one ioda about. Stupid cheezy things like when a friend dies he looks up and utters his final words 'i sliped'. I rented this because James Woods said that it was a great film that never got its due. Umm, Mr. Woods this never got its due because it never deserved one. It uses things like rape and murder, and theft, and robbery, and taking advantage of drunks to highten its impact i guess, but all it does it make this 2 1\2 hour movie seem like forever. A word of advice avoid this movie like the eboli virus!",Null,1,4,18 July 2001
Rocky," The ORiginal and Far better Hercules
","This is a fantastic and original movie. Hercules is obviously just a rip off of this film. Everything from going the distance, the love story, the gruff coach, everything. This film is not about boxing it is about beleiving in yourself and finding courage. All the odds are agianst him and the whole world is laughing in his face but that doesn't stop him in fact he trains even harder. What a great message this has.THis is a great movie because not only does it have a wonderful theme it is great film making. THe script is both funny and touching, the characters are original. THe camera angles are fantastic and the cheap budget this was made on is mindboggling. NO wonder this film is hailed as the 78th best film ever made. It was the first of a long series of underdog sports movies and is the greatest sports movie ever.",Null,0,0,10 August 2001
