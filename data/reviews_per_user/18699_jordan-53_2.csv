The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," One of my favorite films
","I've been waiting ten years for this movie to come out on DVD, and I wasn't disappointed. It's every bit as haunting and magical as I remembered.I can't explain why it affects me so powerfully, or argue with the people who didn't like it. To me, it's an elusive, ephemeral masterpiece by one of the great artists of all time.Or should I say, one of the great artistic collaborations of all time. It's hard to imagine this movie without the music of Zbigniew Preisner. Or the amazing performance of Irene Jacob. Or the puppetry of Bruce Schwartz, of whom all we see are his hands.The Criterion DVD transfer is excellent.",10,2,5,8 December 2006
The Polar Express," Creepy
","Just had to write to say that my 4-year-old daughter, who LIKES scary movies, started whimpering 20 minutes into this one and asked to go home... This is a 4 year old film buff who watches Wizard of Oz, Black Stallion, Secret of Roan Inish, Castle in the Sky, etc, all the way through without batting an eye. But this one really freaked her out.Why? It's an assault on the senses. It's as fast, vertiginous and noisy as a roller-coaster ride. The story and idea themselves are creepy- it's a peculiarly adult fantasy, not a child's -- and the fact that the characters are so realistically rendered only makes it creepier... the kids seem more like the 'not quite right' zombie children of a Stephen King horror movie, than like book illustrations come to life. As in the first 'Final Fantasy' movie, the illusion of life is powerful enough that it strains the suspension of disbelief that cartoons normally have, and in its place creates the uneasy feeling of not being sure *what* we are watching.. only that it's *something that was never meant to be alive* which is really disturbing and freaky. And scary, for a kid.It's a shame because obviously a lot of loving care and technical brilliance went into this very expensive movie.. but as family fare, it's a total misfire.",Null,17,45,14 November 2004
