Resident Evil: Afterlife," Kick-ass!
","About time. GOD! i've been waiting for this movie since last year. I am a huge fan of the RE games and played em all. I know that a lot of fans weren't happy with the movies and the creation of Alice. I think it's amazing. Paul's done an amazing job. The first RE was pretty different from the game yet so entertaining and scary! It would've been a lil boring to watch an RE movie almost identical to the game. Alice is such an amazing character. Her evolution... pure awesomeness!Resident Evil Afterlife was pure fun with kick-ass action sequences. The first 15 min were like 'OMG moments' the clones breaching Umbrella HQ, the explosion and what not! Shawn Roberts was definitely an amazing Wesker. Milla Jovovich looked hot like always. The movie was a lil darker than the previous 3. The post-apocalyptic/special effects were too good. Although i felt the movie could've been a lot better, the emotional element which has always been a huge part of the RE series was missing. The reunion between Claire and Chris was dry. The fight sequence btwn Wesker and Claire with Chris was out of the world. It was as if it's been taken direct from Resident Evil 5 itself. The best part was that they actually included elements from Resident Evil 5. The Executioner, the majinis with tentacles coming out of their mouth. The plagas infected dogs.. added a spark to this sequel. Oh and how can we forget the POST-CREDITS SCENE where we... umm, for that you'll have to find out yourself! (I literally screamed 'hell yeeeah')The movie is not the best RE movie (Extinction was better) but definitely a kick-ass sequel. I've seen it once and i've got the tickets for tomorrow AGAIN, 3D this time. Critics have been really mean to the movie, they're always. SO IGNORE the CRITICS! And watch it. CRITICS suck. Trust me you wont be disappointed.",8,6,14,10 September 2010
