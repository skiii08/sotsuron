Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill Kills
","It takes more than good editing and cameras effects to make a good film. After Kill Bill Vol1 I was hoping that the second film would have been a bit more fast paced. Unfortunately it wasn't the case lots of unneeded dialogue which was used to fill in, until we got to the action. I thought the scene where Uma got herself out of the coffin which was buried under a ton of soil was so unbelievable that it killed any credibility the film had gained that far into the movie. This film might appeal to the Mtv crowd but I'd give it a miss, if Quentin Tarantino believes he can cover up a mediocre film with flashy editing and a slick cast he certainly has succeeded, judging by the votes he has gotten here.",4,2,4,5 August 2005
