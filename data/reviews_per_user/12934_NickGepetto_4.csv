Skyfall," Home Alone 3
","I'm a major bond fan and historian and this film makes me sick. I didn't think the indecipherable Quantum Of Solace could be beaten but this is a heavy contender.I can't add a lot to what other 1-star reviews have said. I just want to say that the end scene (Bond at the Skyfall Castle) is so ridiculous and so flawed that it's laughable. It's Home Alone for Adults - AKA Home Alone 3. Sadly there is no Joe Pesci to liven the mood. Just a depressing, silly, unconscionably stupid plot that tries to entertain but fails in every area. No gadgets and in fact outright contempt for gadgets (did the writers see any previous Bond flix? -- this is a major part of Bond movies)Bond seduces and has relations with a girl who confides in him that she has been harshly sexually abused her entire life. A truly stomach-turning scene. This sweet, innocent girl then gets brutally murdered in front of Bond as he does nothing to stop it. Never, ever, ever would any previous Bond allow this to happen. Not only does he not stop it, he shows no remorse.Baring Quantum Of Solace, the worst Bond ever.",Null,9,17,6 August 2013
The Big Lebowski," OMG - Not Funny, Not Funny, Not Funny!
","Why the heck did I tell you the Big Lebowski is not funny three times? Because this is once for every 50 people that told me this movie was the funniest most entertaining movie EVER. After years of being berated at parties and get-togethers with people spewing line after line from the movie, I gave in last week and rented it. Wow.It's so bad on so many levels it's hard to describe. Let me be very very clear: It's not funny. At all. It's mildly amusing in parts but of the six people I watched it with, no one laughed once. Not once. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you the language is sickeningly bad. Up there with Team America bad. Like Scarface bad. There is one reason and one reason only that this movie is popular: College aged men (or guys who wish they were college aged) own the DVD and watch it repeatedly. After watching the movie once (and not laughing), they then watch it repeatedly memorizing the movie. They sit around the DVD owner's sectional couch elbowing each other before each 'big' scene almost spilling their friend's beer and yelling, 'HERE IT IS! HERE IT IS! HE'S GONNA SAY IT!' They then laugh at how clever they are. They're part of 'The DUDE' club and they are very, very special indeed.This is the most unfunny movie I have ever seen. Other than Scarface and Team America, the movie contains the foulest most unnecessary language I've ever heard in a movie, and overall is one of top five worst movies I've ever seen (and yes, this includes You Tube cat movies).",1,52,104,15 August 2013
Inglourious Basterds," I'm a well informed Tarantino critic . . .
","I will keep this short. I'm a fan of all Tarantino movies and screenplays. We even share our favorite movie - Assault on Precinct 13 (ok, my second favorite after Where Eagles Dare). This movie truly misses the mark. It is entertaining in a sense. It is clearly carefully written, acted and edited. So the problem? Many of the scenes are just too long with little payoff. No, not the opening scene as this is key to the movie. I'm talking about almost every other scene. For example, there is a scene where we are waiting for the Eli Roth character to enter the movie for the first time. He is walking down a long dark underpass of which we just see the exit. It literally takes him 90 seconds to 2 minutes (didn't time it - felt like an hour) to exit. All the time hitting his baseball bat against the tunnel wall. It was soooo long and sooooo uncomfortable, I was getting upset. Boy, this better be a HUGE payoff! No, just Eli Roth after doing some weightlifting. Yawn. Stare at the wall for 2 minutes. Is that fun? If yes then you will enjoy this movie. If not, wait for it to hit cable.",2,9,29,25 August 2009
American Hustle," Prepare to get Hustled.
","There are no spoilers in my review:I have never been so disappointed in a film. With all the hype, I expected another House of Games (1987) or Grifter (1990) or maybe a hard edged drama like The Departed. Instead I saw a very boring film that had no idea what it was. Before I went in, I read that it was a drama. Others said a comedy. Others said a dark comedy. It attempted to be all of the above and succeeded at none. The movie was so boring, after 45 minutes I started to watch the reactions of the viewers around me in the packed theater. It was very telling and far more entertaining than the movie. Over and over, we would be presented a dramatic scene with deep consequences to the plot and to the characters that is then immediately followed by what was supposed to be a funny scene. For example, we have a deep complex scene of someone worried he is going to get killed at anytime. Well done writing and scene. You'll be invested. It's then IMMEDIATELY followed by a housewife cleaning her house while humorously singing and dancing to the song 'Live & Let Die.' Do you laugh? What just happened? At the very end of the scene when you realize the director is holding up the 'laugh' sign, you uneasily chuckle- just a little. In another scene, you have a character do harm to his superior. The superior is beaten badly. Not only is the subordinate not punished, it's played for laughs. Not knowing what reaction I was supposed to have (laugh, cry, be concerned, be worried) actually made my stomach queasy - and I eat habaneros for breakfast! I said several times to the people I was with that this is boring and bad and made no sense. This is not well done. They all agreed. The ending and wrap up will leave you in awe at its lacking.So much talent and potential wasted.",Null,119,224,3 January 2014
