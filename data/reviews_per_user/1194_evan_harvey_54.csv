The Avengers," Was it great? No. Good? Only just...
","Lots of money, lots of CGI, high-powered cast, half-assed story. That about sums up the latest Joss Whedon extravaganza.**spoilers** The story: clunky. It doesn't flow easily. Joss Whedon's script is okay, and even hints at deeper themes, but is ultimately a bit tacky and shallow. Some welcome laughs here and there, but pretty average scripting.IMDb at time of writing has it at 8.6. 8.6? Not even close. Flat 7 at best. I'm giving it 5 because, for all that money (and there was a hell of a lot of it), it's a pretty poor effort.Big time films seem to be in a trend of having convoluted stories rather than great storytelling, and The Avengers follows that trend. The whole 'causing dissension among the ranks' fails significantly because it relies on the super-heroes forgetting all the struggles & personal growth they've been through in previous films. The Avengers tries to present them as reluctant, and egotistical (which of course they luckily overcome), but they've already been through things like this in their own films. Why have they regressed? Perhaps the reason is that Hollywood largely eschews the time-tested concept of character growth for flashy SFX that the kiddies like so much. It's sad, and results in hollow films. Like The Avengers, for example.The CGI: Pretty good, but has flying worms ala the latest Transformers flick, but not as cool.The cast: Not too bad. Scarlett Johansson in a tight outfit, and the usual cast of Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans etc etc.Overall, it's got high-wattage stars, lots of CGI, and not much impact, tension or heart.Better than Battleship (as if that was hard), not as good as Iron Man 1. Enjoyable and immediately forgettable. It'll make loads of money and probably even a sequel.",5,22,91,25 April 2012
Blade Runner 2049," It's okay
","Blade Runner 2049. Saw it Saturday night in Xtreme screen at Hoyts Woden. No spoilers.Short: It was okay. Long, slow, with some gorgeous visuals. An interesting plot that extends beyond the original film in a new and inventive way. Ryan Gosling is a terrible actor. Zero facial expressions or emotion. Harrison Ford is old. Musical score is way, way inferior to Vangelis' work on the original. It's a good sequel, but an average film.Long: The story is interesting, and expands on the original film in a good way. My friend found it predictable at times, but I was intrigued for most of it. It's a long film, and I'm not sure that was a good thing. It really fails to build the world that the original created, although there are a few throw-back shots that you'll recognise if you're paying attention. Aside from a few random sparse scenes, you never get a feel for the larger universe. The original did. This one doesn't. It lends itself to a very lonely feel, maybe designed to reflect the main character's state. This is a good thing, but it still feels empty.The characters are a bit half-assed. The main villains are pretty one-dimensional, although their motivations make sense. There's no lines as profound as Roy's final dialogue from the original to be found here. In fact, there's very little depth to be found at all. Ryan Gosling brings no emotion to the character at all. As far as the rest of them, at least one character dies and there's zero repercussions. That makes the story feel kind of slapped together for convenience's sake.The cinematography is great. Wide shots, great colour palette. Looks brilliant on the big screen.The music, as before noted, is vastly inferior to Vangelis' score. This one is loud, chair shaking, a tad instrusive, but also lacks character and memorability.Overall? Yeah, it's okay. It's not great, but not bad either. It'll appeal to some and not to others. I am happy to recommend it, but not enthusiastically. Apparently they're planning a sequel, and if it's good, this will be a great bridge between the two. If not, it's an oddly thin romp through an unexplored world.Finally: Is Deckard a replicant?",7,4,10,8 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Lost at Sea
","There's nothing really wrong with the latest Pirates film, but it still fails to gather any real steam. Here's why:Characters: The real disappointment here is Blackbeard. Apparently he captured the Black Pearl, but we never see that. Apparently he's a notorious pirate and is feared, but we never see that either. The first three films all had good antagonists. We saw Barbossa and his men in action. We saw Davy Jones and how he'd become corrupted. We saw the East India trading company and it's ruthless ways. We never see anything of Blackbeard. That alone almost ruins the film.Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom also do not return for the fourth installment, which sucks mightily. It's not the same without them.Plot: Why is Jack Sparrow on another adventure? He has no real motive here. There's some weak attempt to do so with someone impersonating him, which makes no sense at all, but the premise is flawed. Without a real reason, well, there's no reason.UPDATE: I noticed that I missed the reason Jack is apparently on this quest: Penelope Cruz and whether or not he loves her. Well, that's not a particularly good reason, and certainly not a compelling one.SFX: okay, nothing amazing like the first three films.The real reason: why this film sucks a bit? The script/story is weak. The basic idea is okay - the continuing adventures of Jack Sparrow and what not - but the story is poorly told. As I said, there's no reason for Jack to go on this adventure. He's really just along for the ride, and it ruins the film. Blackbeard's reason is okay, but not particularly good. The other characters largely don't matter in this regard.So, to summarise, the main problem is that while it's okay, it's really just a poorly written, tacked-on new film. All the basic ingredients are there, but it fails to make an impression. Not bad, but average.5 out of 10.",5,1,2,28 May 2011
Sucker Punch," Great visuals, disappointing story
","Okay. Saw it a few days ago. I liked the film, I'll buy it on DVD. Now for the part that will make everyone will click 'Not helpful':*Spoilers* (of course) The story is half-assed. Snyder is a brilliant director, but a poor storyteller. It's like Snyder has taken the concept of 'dream within a dream', but then not given us any real narrative or point. The ending is very disappointing. It just doesn't make sense. What that means is that the film is immediately rendered very one-dimensional, because it relies so heavily on the ending. That's the point that ties it all together, and it's missing.Maybe I went into it expecting the story to have meaning. Alas. As one reviewer put it, 'It's astonishing that you could take this many potentially incendiary elements and make something that crushingly dull'. I admit I did find parts of it dull. Yes the fight sequences are cool, and yes the visuals are neat, but it's very flat and shallow. There are potentially incendiary elements, but they're wasted. Maybe they'll come out in the director's cut?Because the characters/storyline are/is flat, the film is dull. Yes, there's explosions, a cool Japanese battle-bot, steam-powered Nazi zombies (it's not actually steampunk, contrary to the buzz), Lord of the Rings Orcs, a dragon etc etc, but my main issue is that the film promises more but doesn't deliver. It almost does, so I don't know why Snyder couldn't pull it together. There's a throwaway line at the end about how the things that occur in the alternate reality actually occurred in the 'real' reality, but that's lazy storytelling. It's like he filmed a bunch of stuff, and then said, 'Oh, by the way, all that really happened'. Lazy storytelling.So. If you want a film of chicks in tight clothes blowing stuff up, this is for you. It's a wild ride and looks great. If, like me, you wish that Snyder was a better storyteller who could have made a film that had depth and meaning, you'll not enjoy it so much.7 out of 10 for great visuals. Worth the money. 2 out of 10 for being poorly written. Final: 6 out of 10.",6,1,4,9 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Not too bad
","I read some reviews of this that panned it, and at the time of writing this review, it's got a score of 3.8 on IMDb. It's not actually that bad.Synopsis (spoilers ahoy!): Edward and Bella get married. Bella gets preggers. There's a werewolf & vampire fight. Bella becomes a vampire.Overall, the story was reasonably handled. The start of the film is a bit dull - it's the wedding part, and the dialogue is very weak. It's also not too interesting, and I wondered if the screenwriter couldn't have livened it up a bit. There's at least some attempt at humour, but it's a bit forced (Kellan Lutz gets the best line in this part).The honeymoon scenes are a bit dull too. I felt that the director really missed some nuances here that would have elevated the film. Such as where Edward and Bella play chess (presumably if she wins he'll have sex with her again), but it's a tad emotionless. When the audience realises what is at stake in the chess games, it's already too late, and the opportunity for real impact has been lost.This part of the film also seems to focus on Edward and Bella, and if that doesn't interest you, it'll feel long and dull. I did hope we'd see a bit of Kristen Stewart nude, but alas, it's all well-placed arms and just-out-of-camera shots. Apparently they had to tone it down for the coveted PG-13 rating, so maybe there'll be some spicy extended scenes on DVD.But it gets better! Once Bella is knocked up, it actually adds some more tension to the film. Will she die? Will she live? Who knows? Well, if you've read the book, you know. This part was handled pretty well, although I felt that the film lost the impact of the book at the crucial scene. Maybe it'll be picked up in the next part.The wolves are back, but one of the main plot scenes is them communicating in wolf-thought, and it doesn't quite work.Unfortunately, I felt that the screenwriter missed some vital points that, while not really altering the direction of the film, would have helped. For instance, after learning that Bella is up the duff, Edward comments that they'll get the 'thing' out of her. Bella repeats this to herself. Whist the intent (to me at least) was clear - Bella sees it as a child, not a 'thing' - the scene could have benefited from a simple line like 'It's my/our child' or some such. Whether director or screenwriter, it's another of those simple nuanced moments that would have produced a more satisfying film (as long as you can get past the whole Twihard/sappiness bit, that is).Maybe it's because I thought it was going to suck harder than a vacuum, but I was pleasantly surprised. You know what it is. It's not like it's going to ultimately be any better than the other films in the series. It's more Twilight. But, for what it's worth, it wasn't too bad.7 out of 10.On a final note, I still think the that the first film was the best. Not that the story was any better than the others, but it had a really good style and look/colour palette to it that the others have eschewed for a more mainstream/brighter feel. The director of the first one should have kept going, and I'd like to have seen how they'd have turned out.",Null,3,12,18 November 2011
Source Code," It's okay, different, a bit dull
","Lots of people seem to think this was a great film, given that it's scored 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. I disagree. It was okay, but not great. Different, but a tad convoluted. Formulaic and a little dry. Here's why:Plot: Not a bad idea at all. However, the writer tried overload what is a simple story with a little too much heavy-handedness. For instance: Jake G (whatever his character's name is) wakes up from an apparent dream, and doesn't know where he is. Fair enough. So he asks 'Where am I?' Also fair enough. But then it's case a case of him not being given enough information, as if trying to keep something hidden. Well, something is being kept hidden, but it all goes on a little too long. He could have just been told what the source code idea is etc etc, but instead this atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust is rather artificially forced.The focus is misdirected. Rather than hiding what 'source code' is, it's easier to just tell the audience, get them into the basic concept, and save your energy for the more important twists.The big 'reveals' in the plot are okay, but they lack narrative strength. The storytelling is a little muddled and formulaic. By creating this artificial atmosphere (undoubtedly to try to keep the audience guessing), it takes something away from the simple storytelling aspect. That makes the twists have less impact, I found. My attention was diverted by the faked tension, and so I couldn't settle into the basic plot premise as much.Characters: Pretty bland. Michelle Monaghan is very cute, although her role was pretty limited. Jake Gyllenhaal is okay, but he's not given much to work with. The others are average as well, for the most part.SFX: Nothing much. It's a relatively non-SFX film, for the most part. I did actually see a trailer that had a bus or something explode, but that didn't make it into the film. Maybe the story changed midway or something. Maybe I'm off my head and saw some different movie's trailer.Overall, it's okay and forgettable. The ending is weak, and lacks any emotional punch. It's too unbelievable. The big screen doesn't do much for it, so look to catch this one on DVD. 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,3 June 2011
Skyfall," Dull and worthless
","This is supposed to be the 50th anniversary of the James Bond franchise, and what a waste of time it was. The story was dull and the villain average. The plot was a reasonable idea, but the execution was poor.Traditionally, James Bond films have had fantastical plots: Moonraker had an evil genius stealing satellites (and a giant thug with gold teeth), Golden Eye had some kind of space laser (as I recall), Casino Royale pinned the fate of the free world on a poker game, Quantum of Solace had a slimy guy stealing water. Skyfall (whilst having a cool name which incidentally had functionally zero relevance to the story) by comparison had an unknown MI6 agent from the past bent on revenge against M.**SPOILERS** Bardem's (apparently) gay lunacy was not compelling in the least.Bond gets shot. You see that in the trailers. Then he comes back, all within the space of about 10 minutes. It was a worthless speedbump, since it added completely nothing to the story. Apparently he loses some of this skills, but again, that made ZERO difference to the film. What could have been a major plot point with interesting ramifications became a mere side incident. Talk about wasting time.Maybe Judi Dench was bored with her role, so they wrote this film just to kill off her character. That's the only justification I can think of for such a lame film.The direction was average. The acting was okay. Uninspired car chases, boring plot, some dull high-tech gadgetry, Adele's insipid theme song and that's 2.5 hours wasted. A truly dull script that turns into a truly dull film.A noticeable low point in Danial Craig's up-til-now stellar showing as the latest James Bond.",4,9,19,22 November 2012
Gravity," Great film, average acting
","tl;dr: gravity is a good film with some incredible visual scenes; Sandra Bullock can't act worth spit.Long: Gravity is better than I thought it was going to be. Some great space scenes, shots of the earth etc. Would look incredible on IMAX.Basically, some astronauts get into serious trouble and have to struggle to survive and make it back to earth.Has some seriously great SFX scenes, and few slower moments, but it never feels like it drags. Luckily the script is packed with disasters, so it manages to move along at a brisk pace without ruining the feel of space as a vast, endless... well, space.It's essentially a one-actor film (Sandra Bullock) (with a supporting role (George Clooney). Unfortunately, Bullock's acting is so uneven that it almost ruins the film. For example, during the initial disaster moment, she's terrified, and understandably so. Her character is not an experienced astronaut, and it's a disaster of unimaginable proportions. However, this terror vanishes soon after, even when faced with other serious disasters. Whilst you don't want a character that's a useless terrified blob the whole film, the complete unevenness of her acting is bizarre. The end result is that the majority of the film lacks a lot of tension, and that sucks. Things go wrong, and she just takes it all in her stride. There's just no emotion there, except for the obligatory 'finding the will to survive' scene.Overall, a great film. Well directed, gorgeous cinematography (well, SFX, but well-composed), some great tense scenes. Definitely a big screen film.8 out of 10.",8,5,15,3 October 2013
Iron Man 2," Messy storyline, no real plot, no theme
","Just saw Iron Man 2, and while I thought the first one was a bit overrated, I had hopes. They quickly dissipated.Firstly, there was no theme. The first Iron Man had a theme - it was about Tony Stark changing his life and becoming a better man. Iron Man 2 had no theme at all.Secondly, the plot was messy: there just happens to be another brilliant scientist who can build an advanced power source in a squalid Moscow shack? Okay, we had to swallow that Tony Stark could build one in the middle of freakin' Afghanistan, but twice? That's too much.Weren't Pepper and Tony supposed to get together at the end of the first film? In this one they stay at arm's length, and I wondered if there was any romance there at all. That scene from the preview where Pepper kisses his helmet and Tony jumps from the back of the plane after it? Gone.The Avengers? Samuel L Jackson with an eye patch? Who the hell wears an eye patch today and doesn't get laughed at? Why introduce paper-thin characters that really do nothing? And it's not like anything actually happened with them anyway, so why waste out time and goodwill?Thirdly, the film didn't really go anywhere in terms of advancing the Iron Man story. There were a few interesting concepts - what does Iron Man do now that everyone knows who he is? Will the US military get their hands on it? - but these, while addressed, where never really given much thought. Instead, Tony's best friend (Cheadle) steals the other suit. What? Even after being given an order to do so, why would his friend do that?Fourth, the acting: Gwenyth Paltrow is a terrible actress. So it Scarlett Johansson, but at least she's smoking hot. Don Cheadle is no Terrance Howard. While Howard himself isn't a great actor, he owned the role in Iron Man 1. Cheadle just didn't have the personality and charisma, and you'll note he gets very little screen time too.It wasn't a completely horrible film, but it wasn't worth the 7.9 IMDb gives it. Much closer to a flat 5.0. The direction is a bit messy - the action scenes aren't as clean as they should be. Some great SXF, as you'd expect. Save your money for the DVD.",5,33,66,3 May 2010
The Hunger Games," 6 out of 10
","I've not read the books, so I don't know what all the fuss is about. The Hunger Games is okay, but without the violence, it's a 'young adults' story. The point of that is I don't know why everyone thinks it's so great. It's certainly not worth 8.2/10.EDIT: There's nothing wrong with young adult fiction, I'll add. It's just that it's a bit afternoon TV-ish for such a violent premise, and lacking real narrative bite.Summary: Dystopian society where kids get selected to participate in a televised wilderness-arena fight to the death.The story is okay, if a bit clichéd these days. The script is alright, but it's a bit light. During the actual tournament, it's not particularly tense. There's very little feeling of desperation, which one would think would be a prerequisite for a fight-to-the-death kill-fest. That's a failing of both the script and the director.What really, REALLY annoyed me was the horrible camera work at the start. It's hideously shaky and painful to watch. Either I got used to it, or they realised what a dumb idea it was and stopped, but for the first 10-15 minutes it sucked. Cinematographers who think that shaky, hand-held camera work looks good should be slapped upside the head. It detracts from the story (which is the whole point of the film).EDIT: The point isn't that shaky camera work necessarily looks bad. The problem is that the camera work is shaky whilst zipping around, which makes it hard to watch. Other films use this effect as well, but they tend to be shaky whilst focusing on only one image, which allows the eye to compensate.It actually felt a lot like 'Tomorrow when the war began' for some reason. It's violent (although you don't see much gore), and devoid of any real thematic point. The author claims to have come up with the idea while 'channel-surfing the TV where she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the Iraq war. She describes how the two combined in an unsettling way'. Unfortunately, all that the author has done is create a story where we watch brutality for enjoyment. Maybe the rest of the series will discover some form of theme that contradicts this idea, but at the moment its a continuation of what it thinks it's parodying.Despite all that, it's a breezy flick. Okay, not great. Not well written, but passable. Not holding my breath for the next two installments. 6 out of 10.",6,5,12,24 March 2012
The Irishman," Long, dull, uneventful
","Remember Bugsy Malone? That gangster film where all the characters were kids?Well, The Irishman is a gangster film where all the characters are geriatrics. At the start of the film, De Niro's CGI youthened character still looked like he's 50. They all do. They're old, fat, hunched, liver-spotted killers, even when they're supposedly young(er). It's weird.The film just drags on and on and never really gets going. The plot is disjointed and never really tells a story or builds a narrative. Unlike Scorsese's classics like Casino or Goodfellas, this film really struggles to develop a story worth watching.3.5 hours. $160M budget. Good Lord. At least this rubbish will be 'free' on Netflix soon. There's a reason no one else wanted it - it wasn't going to make any money at the cinema. Even the $13 you pay for Netflix is too much for this film.",1,617,1130,15 November 2019
Point Break," Such a terrible film
","A truly s#!t film. It's so dull. The script is like it was written by a thirteen year old; it's shallow and unexciting. For a film about adrenaline junkies, no one looks like they're having any fun.Yes, there are a bunch of extreme sports stunts in the film, but the truth is I can see much better stunts on youtube. The surfing scene was reminiscent of the original, but lacked the heart. The wingsuit scene was less impressive than dozens of youtube videos. The snowboarding scene was less impressive than dozens of youtube videos.One of the characters dies during a snowboarding scene and it barely even registers. Why? Firstly because the characters are so poorly written that the audience literally doesn't care when one of them dies horribly. Secondly, the loss of one of the crew doesn't even affect the other characters. It literally makes no difference to the plot.The original film was great. It had style, it had a coherent plot, and it had heart. This film is just another soulless s#!tty remake. There's no sense of camaraderie amongst the crew, there's no examination of the lifestyle or of what binds the crew together.It sucks. It's a shame because it could have been great if they'd either made a faithful remake of the original, or just frigging written a decent script. It has glimmers of interesting ideas that pop up from time to time, but they're under-utilised.For everything this film fails at, and for all the ways in which something good seemed like it might happen, only to be submerged in more bulls#!t, I give this 1 out of 10.",1,6,7,30 September 2016
Alexander," Alexander fails miserably
","Alexander is a waste of money, both mine and the people who financed the film. While watchable and certainly not the work of an amateur, it lacks direction in the plot, and merely skims over the surface of the life of Alexander. It lacks the scope and vision of a great film about one of history's notable figures.The battle sequences are okay, a bit messy in direction. And for one of the great conquerors of the world, there is very little time given to fighting. The problem is that it tries to walk the line between epic and character driven, and succeeds as neither. Not enough fighting, and then not enough scope in the character scenes. There's plenty of dialogue, but it doesn't enhance the plot of the film. A reasonable amount is given to Alexander's character and whatnot, but it fails to develop into an interesting story, and so is simply an expensive, indulgent and ultimately shallow look at his life. There is no real attention given to the size of the empire (although it is mentioned, it fails to appear as anything more than a throwaway comment); the dissension in the ranks is only shown in some hollow-feeling false dramatic scenes. What we are left with as the film progresses is a disconnected series of scenes that fail to drive the story or allow the audience to actually engage with the characters and environment.The reason why it didn't do well at the box office and with me, is that its just not any good. Well shot, average acting, shallow story, steeped in gayness. 2 out of 10",2,6,10,1 November 2005
Aquaman," All the rubbish we dump in the ocean...
","... finally ended up in a movie.It's entertainment, so really, people are going to like all sorts of things. But this one was big, loud, colourful and not great (to me).Everyone is commenting on how Jason Momoa is having fun. I'd be having fun too if I was paid a couple of million $ to basically do nothing. Plus, when the film is a bad as Aqauman, what else was he going to do?Aquaman probably worked as a comic but on the big screen, no so much. The story is okay, but drowns in the ludicrousness of being, you know, underwater. The film drowns in CGI. There's lasers underwater, armour underwater, flying around underwater - you get the idea. Admittedly, what else could you do with a character as lame as Arthur Curry? At least James Wan had a go at it. He failed, but whatever. It made a billion $, so he wins and the rest of humanity pays the price.I think that it proves that CGI wins the kiddies over every time, regardless of how lame the story is, or even how lame the premise of the film is. Without the CGI, this film would still suck, it just wouldn't look as good.The acting is okay, if the acting equivalent of watching wet fish are your thing. These days in films like this, you don't really need to act. You just stand there. You may have to jump around a bit, but that's all. The 'acting' part is not really required.The story is bleached like today's coral, lifeless and cliched.The CGI is numbing, like your eyeballs getting slapped with a million tiny wet fishes.I'm sick over CGI, over-hyped comic book hero movies. Every Marvel film is the same. DC are at least different: they eschew even the semblance of story for bloated CGI.Hey, I mean, I paid to go and see it too. But the difference is that I regret it.",4,2,4,20 January 2019
The Town," Decent, but ultimately average
","Just watched The Town. It's not too bad, but lacks a certain something. It's not as good as Heat (Michael Mann's masterpiece), but is more accessible. I read some trivia that it had to be cut quite a bit, which might explain why some of feels a bit too forced at times.The plot is pretty simple: bank robbers, a girl, cops and so on. It's a little unbelievable, but not so much that you scoff at it.Ben Affleck, who I previously rated as a completely overrated actor both acts and directs. He does okay, but nothing special in either role. Affleck's character is supposed to be an intelligent, caring, sensitive hardcore thief, but it's completely out of place. These are men who rob and aren't afraid to shoot their way out of a corner. Having the main character as a really decent guy who just seems to be killing time robbing banks defies belief. The other characters are two dimensional, but server well enough. Rebecca Hall does quite well as the love interest.There's overtones of a deeper storyline going on, such as the florist who seems to run things, but it is only revealed towards the end, and not much is made of it. Maybe that was among the things that got cut, and if so it was a bad choice. It comes up as quite a significant plot point, but is given only superficial treatment. A similar example that worked well was Jack Nicholson's character in The Departed. A director's cut would be worth a look at, although I don't think that the material would support a much longer film.The actions scenes are okay, but Affleck seems to waffle a little bit. There's a scene where the robbers seem to hesitate for quite a long time before opening fire at some cops. If they're as hardcore as they're supposed to be, they should just get into it. It's another minor flaw that weakens the overall feel of the movie. See Heat for how to really take down the cops in a situation like that. However, they're done well enough to maintain interest.I keep mentioning Heat because the films are very similar in a lot of ways. Heat is by far the better film overall, although it's more cerebral and The Town is easier to digest as a throwaway flick. Where Heat set the standard, The Town kind of wanders in it's shadow. The director's cut might help address that, but it remains to be seen.Overall, it's okay. Worth a 7 out of 10 for a breezy action film. Unfortunately, outside of the action sequences, the film lags significantly, but the pace is brisk and it flows quite well.",7,0,3,7 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Muddled, disjointed and unsatisfying
","Haven't even finished watching it on Disney+ and already I am lamenting the complete waste of potential.The main problem (in my opinion) with all three of the latest Star Wars films (the main ones) is the lack of narrative and plot.Rogue One was the last Star Wars film that they made. We'll never see anything like it again (probably). Solo was complete trash, just incredibly dull and hideous.The Force Awakens was a complete rip-off of A New Hope. Shameless and also really disappointing.The Last Jedi's central plot point was a small spaceship outrunning a bigger spaceship by going slightly faster than it.The Rise of Skywalker is a muddled jumble, lacking any real narrative focus. Apparently the Sith have a new massive army... that does nothing. Kylo Ren wants to take over the galaxy... until he doesn't. Everything in the film is cheap and poorly written.The whole trilogy has wasted so many really good ideas and there's clearly been no coherent leadership at the helm from Disney. Each film goes in different directions and nothing really joins up properly. Characters are important in one film, and then not mentioned in another. Plot directions in one are discarded in another. They've made a bunch of money, but hopefully they're not fooling themselves that they've created anything special. The originals are classics; these are just more bland entertainment. All of the virtue signalling and agendas that has been half-assed into the new films are just distracting and ultimately pointless.Ben Solo turning into Kylo Ren - that would've been the perfect way to start the series. Introduce the new characters and link them to the past (Luke) and then move on with a new story. Have Luke training an apprentice, and then have Snoke lead him astray. Introduce Rey and give her a reason why she might turn to the dark side. Use that as the basis for her and Kylo throughout the trilogy.Kylo Ren and Rey - Kylo clearly has a major hard on for Rey (he keeps offering to take over the galaxy with her and she keeps turning him down). But! there's no hint of Rey possibly turning to the dark side, so the whole thing is pointless. And why does he want her at all? There's been no chemistry or even hint of attraction between them, so why? What happened to the 'anger is the path to the dark side'? They threw away all of the original Star Wars good stuff, but never replaced it with anything in return.As an aside, Daisy Ridley always looks sweaty. I am not sure what's going on there, but still...The characters have no arc to their stories. No development. No setbacks and no growth. Rey starts as super powerful, and that's it. She never needs to learn anything, never needs to struggle to become something new - the literal most basic aspect of life. Kylo is pure evil (even murdered his own father) til the very end and then he isn't for no good reason (apparently because Leia sacrificed her life for his - that's not a good reason).Look, they're okay, but mostly they're boring. The plot jumps around and never really forms any sort of story. There's no stakes, no danger. The originals had a story that was clean, simple and focused. The new ones are muddled, disjointed and ADHD.",4,7,12,12 May 2020
Split," Brilliant thematic sequel to Unbreakable
","Split is the thematic sequel to 2000's Unbreakable. Unbreakable is about super heroes and villains who are almost ordinary people, except for some small, almost coincidental, differences. It's a slow film, but a brilliant concept.****Major Spoilers****If Unbreakable is about the rise of a new super hero, then Split is about the rise of a new super villain. Kevin suffers from DID - Dissociative Identity Disorder, or split personalities. These personalities were created to protect Kevin from childhood abuse and trauma. There are 23 of them, and they are all distinct as individuals. There is a rumour of a 24th personality, known as the Beast. Just as the other personalities surfaced to protect Kevin, the Beast now protects the personalities.****Major Spoilers****James McAvoy is great in the lead role. Anja Taylor-Joy follows up from the recent film The Witch, but this is McAvoy's film. The set is sparse, the dialogue uncomplicated, and the sense of rising dread expertly handled.Any film requires you to buy into it's premise. If you're not prepared to do that, then why bother going to the movies at all? Unbreakable required that. Aliens required that. Split does as well, but keeps it's premise within the boundary of what might be possible. That's the underlying concept of both this and Unbreakable. It's not Marvel-style super heroes, but the everyday things that can't quite be explained away.The Beast. He's on the move and when he arrives, he brings with him a gritty, bleak new super villain.",7,1,9,7 February 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Dull, dull, dull
","What a crap movie. Just returned from watching Happy Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It's dull, long and boring.It starts out looking interesting, and then they end up spending an hour in a tent doing nothing. There's a weak attempt at fleshing out the characters, but it's woeful.The story is a mish-mash where nothing really happens. It's so badly put together. Oh, they destroy an horcrux, and find a sword, but it's so drawn out and boring. There's no adventure or excitement. All the interesting characters of the recent films vanish, and you're left with Potter, Granger and Weasley wandering about not really doing anything.I thought maybe they'd use the extra time to develop the story, but they didn't. Or couldn't. Maybe the screenwriter wasn't good enough. Whatever the reason, he's turned out a pathetic piece of work. For instance *SPOILER AHEAD*, they say that the place Harry is hiding is well protected, and it would be 'impractical' to attack him there, and then they just turn up and attack anyway and trash the place. I mean, hello?!There's a few jokes and comic relief, which is welcome, although sparse. The best scene in the whole film is when they try to infiltrate the Ministry. Great acting by those involved, but once it's over it goes back to being limp and dull. Some action, although not much. The SFX isn't interesting. Death Eaters fly around etc, but that's about it.As usual, it's pretty poorly scripted. I've enjoyed the Harry Potter movies, but they're badly written. They eschew actual narrative and just throw scenes at you with little or no set-up. They're not hard to follow, but you're just left wishing that they'd tried a little harder.Well, in HP7 Part 1, they don't really try at all. It's obvious that they just want to make as much money as they can (as if the other 6 haven't been profitable enough), but this movie just sucked.It's got some darker tones to it, as fitting with the progress of the other films, but it's a two torture scenes than any real foreboding menace.1 out of 10 for the following reasons. Dull, with very little action. About 20 minutes of actual story all up. Way, way too long. They've stretched 90 minutes of film into 2.5 hours. The 90 minute film would've been great. The 2.5 hour film drags and drags and sucks and sucks. Finally, even knowing that it is just a blatant money grab, they didn't even give us a decent film. Poor effort all round. The director and writer should be ashamed of themselves.",1,37,69,20 November 2010
Coriolanus," An excellent film
","These days Shakespeare is either dreary endless remakes of Hamlet and Kenneth Branagh films, or it's the glitzy Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet. Corioloanus is neither of those.The language is the original Shakespeare (which most people despair of), so lot's of thous and wherefores etc, but it's never dull. Rather, apart from one or two scenes, the dialogue is fleet and sharp. Some of it puts even the best scriptwriter to absolute shame for it's cutting, razor edge delivery.The setting is modernised, but not glam like Luhrman's efforts. You can see the original play behind the film, yet it works surprisingly well. By that I mean that you can tell that some scenes were originally set in a Roman-style forum, for instance. However, it translates very well, and has a dignified and serious tone.There's even a modern-day battle scene (with Marine-like soldiers) and a desperate fight to the death between the two main characters.Ralph Fiennes is superb in the titular role. Usually Hollywood actors do Shakespeare in order to get some respect, but Fiennes (also as director) has crafted a great film. Gerard Butler does equally as well, although his role is limited due to the nature of the script and story. This is Caius Martius Coriolanus' story, and he is the focus of it.What really appealed for me here was the characters. I know, I know. 'Characters' are what people speak of when describing boring films. Most kiddies these days just want giant robots and explosions, but it's interesting to watch this film after seeing 'John Carter' (which I also didn't mind). Whereas the lead in 'John Carter' had no facial expressions to speak of, Fiennes and Butler positively reek of emotion and depth. Gerard Butler is really only a supporting role, but he does it well.Shakespeare has survived 400 years precisely because he wrote about people well. Most of the crud Hollywood dishes out will be forgotten in the space of a year.9 our of 10 is pretty high for me, but I really enjoyed this film. See Coriolanus for something different and refreshing in between the expressionless 'A' list actors of today and the mindless explosions of the next Michael Bay extravaganza.",9,8,11,24 March 2012
Ender's Game," Almost great
","Just watched Ender's Game. It was almost a great film. Almost. Here's why: The director (who also wrote the screenplay) obviously didn't read the book. Or if he did, he didn't understand it. It's been a long time since I read the book, but from memory here's the main problem with the film.At some point in the original story, Ender is told that the Buggers are a hive mind. They attacked earth, thinking that humans were non-sentient. When they realised that the humans were actually individual sentient creatures, it was too late to reverse their mistake. That's why the Buggers never returned to earth again to fight. The film hints at this a couple of times, but it never says why.This is a glaring omission from the film. Why is it so important? Because it makes everything Ender achieved worthless. The Buggers were never going to return to attack Earth, so the human pursuit to the Bugger homeworld was unnecessary. Ender, though thinking his part of the war was just a simulation, is responsible for the death of what was ultimately a peaceful civilisation. That is the great tragedy of Ender's game; all that death was unnecessary, and Ender was the unwitting architect of it.By completely failing to understand this, the director made a film that is largely pointless. Yes, Ender was tricked into thinking the 'command school' battles were just a simulation, but the full extent of the horror he inflicted on the Buggers is unsaid, and that demeans the whole story.Poor, poor effort, Gavin Hood.",6,1,2,5 December 2013
Dunkirk," Excellent, if lacking a little
","Dunkirk: bit of a mixed experience for me, but overall, it was really well done and I left the cinema thinking about it, which is more than I can say about the majority of films these days. As Churchill said 'we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.' The first hour dragged a bit, and I'm not sure I really got a sense of what it was like on the beaches (from wikipedia: 'Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective mole onto 39 British destroyers of the Royal Navy and civilian merchant ships, while others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water'). Apparently some Dunkirk veterans claimed it accurately depicted the events though.The aerial sequences are excellent, and despite the RAFs involvement, a recurring theme in survivors' accounts is that they never saw the RAF in the skies above them. Apparently around 50 Spitfires were lost during the evacuation period. The Little Ships part is likewise excellent, and central to capturing the sense of duty and heroism of the civilian crews.The film does suffer a little from not having a central character narrative, which can leave the impression that it's a bit cold and clinical. Depending on your view, this could be a negative or a positive. I ended up viewing it as a positive. The coldness serves to heighten the sense of tragedy about it, and it was a tragedy. The director said that he chose not to delve into character stories, as that's not the point: the point is the overall disaster and the evacuation. I would've liked a better depiction of the brave French (and other nationalities) soldiers who stayed (and died) to protect the evacuation.The three interwined stories (the mole, the sea and the air) were handled well, although the timeline is, in typical Nolan style, mixed up for dramatic effect. Overall, a great film. See it for a dose of realism and history amongst the weak crud that Marvel churns out.",8,3,8,3 August 2017
Bad Teacher," Dull, stupid and crap
","Saw Bad Teacher. WIsh I hadn't. I would have rather eaten a plate of raw onions or had to sit through Ishtar again. So why was it so crap? The actors: Well, firstly, Cameron Diaz is getting old, and I mean wrinkly, tired-looking old. Secondly, she just doesn't have the skill or charisma to pull off a film like this. That's what was most obvious. Justin Timberlake was half-decent, but that's not saying much. Jason Segel. I have no idea what he was doing in this film. The other supporting actors equally sucked.The script: Terrible. I stopped counting the number of times I heard 'What?' and 'Huh?' from the (sparse) audience in response to the weird, unfunny and poorly delivered lines. The red haired girl (Amy, I think) was trying her hardest to be the quirky antagonist, but she just had no comic grace. Neither did Cameron Diaz either. The scriptwriters somehow thought lots of swearing and shouting were a good idea, but alas, they were wrong.The real problem here was that the concept of the 'bad teacher' just really doesn't cut it in a high school setting. It wasn't funny. I assume that the writers were aiming for a sort of cross between shock (swearing) and possibly black humour? I really can't define it other than to say it was pissweak. Weird lines, no comic timing, a half-assed romance. It all adds up to not much and a waste of money.To be fair, there were a few funny points, but it was just so poorly directed. The humour missed so many golden opportunities.3 out of 10. Don't waste your time.",Null,36,67,22 July 2011
Captain America: Civil War," This is not a Captain America film...
","... it's an Avengers film, which kind of sucks. The Winter Soldier was a great film, and I had hoped for a good wrap-up to Cap's trilogy. There's always been a reasonable amount of cross-over (such as Iron Man 3 drawing on events from the first Avengers film), but the Captain got short-changed on this one.The second issue is one of the plot. The idea of registering super heroes is a good one, and has been explored in other works (such as Watchmen). Here however it's a bit half-baked. The motivations are all mixed up and wrong. The split between the Avengers seemed forced and unnecessary.Iron Man's motivations for signing were okay. Captain's refusal is a bit shaky. It would have helped to show a situation where the Accord prevented them from doing something.It's not a bad film, but disappointing that it co-opted for the Avengers, especially when they have two more films coming up (Infinity Wars).",7,5,12,1 May 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit - Not LOTR
","The short: 48fps. Looks just like Lord of the Rings. Is NOT Lord of the Rings.The long: It's pretty good. It looks gorgeous. The colours, sets etc are exactly the same as Lord of the Rings, which is a good thing. But it's also not Lord of the Rings. It's based on a short story that Tolkein wrote for his kids, or grand kids. Either way, it's not 3 films worth of material.That's it's greatest flaw. There is not enough story for 3 films. What's there isn't done badly by any means, but it should have been 2 films, not 3 - and this is coming from someone who liked the film. The initial opening is dull. Long and dull, and oddly uninviting. It goes on for ages, but yet doesn't manage to introduce Hobbiton or characters the way The Fellowship of the Ring did. Which is odd, since The Hobbit has far less in terms of narrative events to work with.Guillermo del Toro was originally set to direct, and maybe it would have been better if he had, if for no other reason than it would have been quite different to LOTR. Jackson does a fine job, but it's just more of the same with less substance. del Toro might have brought a completely different vision.Should you see it is 48fps? Yes, even if just to see what it's like. For the most part, it's great. Creamy, vibrant and bright. Some few small flaws, like the occasional motion looking oddly too quick, but overall it looks great. Obviously people have different views on it. My view is that it's worth seeing at least once. There'll be two more films that you don't have to see in 48fps if you don't like it.The action scenes are fantastic. There's one flashback scene where dwarfs are fighting Orcs, and it looks superb. Which brings me to the next point: the dwarfs don't look like dwarfs. They look like normal guys, and Gandalf is just really tall. Compared to Gimli, these 'dwarfs' don't look like dwarfs at all. It's disappointing. Maybe the decision was made because the dwarfs are very prominent characters, as opposed to Gimli, who was really the only dwarf in LOTR.I'll be looking forward to the next installments.",7,0,3,21 January 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A pretty poor effort
","How on earth did this get 8.1 on IMDb? I have no idea. Admittedly I haven't paid much attention to the series since the first one, so I assume they've dropped the serious side and tried to go action-comedy, ala The Evil Dead series.So where does it go wrong? Firstly, the mix of comedy and seriousness is like oil and water. A film like True Lies did it well. Even though the stakes were high, the underlying comedy was well played. In Mission:Impossible 4, there's a weird mix of slapsticky humour, and serious action film violence. It doesn't work very well. Think Mission Impossible 1 crossed with Shaun of the Dead. To be fair, there's a few funny moments, but they're few and far between.The plot is awful. I have no idea why some random guy decided to start World War 3. There's some weak justification given, but it doesn't make sense. Apparently the bad guy is insane, and that's reason enough. I mean, hey! Why waste time actually telling a coherent story? The dialogue is okay, but the pacing and scenes are shambolic. There's no tension (as befitting the brink of World War 3) in the film.The action is okay. There's some explosions, the tallest building in the world and so on, but it's all pretty rushed and weak. Due to the fact that the writer decided not to have a decent storyline, everything the team does seems poorly planned and haphazard. There are no twists in the story, and no suspense. Because the audience is never really sure what the stakes are, it makes for a dull film. The characters are worthless, and there's no audience connection to them.Cruise is in pretty uncharismatic mode; Pegg is miscast (well, no, Pegg is a great comedy actor, but more correctly the role is miscast); Renner is dawdling in the corner; the other cast members are mostly just going through their paces. The bad guy is okay, but he's largely just an after-thought.I knew that the film would suck; I was just surprised at how much it sucks. The writer was very lazy on this one. The direction is competent without being great.4 out of 10. I wouldn't even bother til the DVD is off new release and in the weekly aisle at the video store.",4,34,59,17 December 2011
Django Unchained," Messy and empty
","The plot: Django is a slave, rescued by Dr Shultz because Django can identify some wanted men; the two then team up as bounty hunters, and eventually rescue Django's wife.The cinematography is good; the film has a nice gritty look to it, and looks authentic. Tarantino writes quite well, and the dialogue is snappy. There's plenty of gratuitous violence and over-the-top blood splatters.The script is a bit uneven. The plot meanders here and there, and some of the set-ups don't pay off. For example, the opening few scenes set up Dr Shultz and Django as bounty hunters, but the film never really takes advantage of it. Yes, we see them killing a wanted criminal, but it's just a minor piece that is referenced later in the film, rather than a plot point. A more substantial use of the idea would have benefited the film greatly.But while it's got plenty of style, it ultimately lacks substance. Whilst watching it I was mostly entertained, but by the end it had left no impression on me. I recognise that it's only meant to be light entertainment, but the film left me wanting something more. There's plenty of southern racism, and Di Caprio plays the villainous Candie very well, but the film really lacks any sort of emotional core.There's no cheering for the good guy because despite the evil baddies, the good guy barely acts at all. Jamie Foxx is so devoid of any sort of emotion it's hard to know if he's even got a pulse. The other characters are paper thin and lacking any sort of depth. With so much potentially incendiary material to be found in America's racist past, Tarantino is either oblivious to it, or ignorant of it.All in all it's not a bad film. Tarantino is a talented filmmaker, but a lousy story-teller.",7,4,10,28 January 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," Very average
","The first two films were great. They were also written by the same people. Bringing in a new director and new writers was a bad move. This film suffers most from bad writing. I think the script-writers tried to cover too much ground with not enough skill. It seemed like they just stuffed bits in to make up the story without giving any of it enough substance. The story-line was quite good, quite dark, but the way it was delivered is what is most disappointing. I liked the first 2 films. This one was only okay, not great as it should have been. It is the worst of the 3, but is rescued slightly by the dark story-line that was spot on for where the third installment should have gone.The special effects were fine, but then most films have the same quality these days, so its a non-issue.The director wasn't very good. The actors have proved that they are far better than they were in this film, so perhaps Brett Ratner was out of his depth. Some of the scenes were sub-standardly blocked. Still, that's not the worst thing about the film.Wolverine's character was much tamer than he has been. There was absolutely no mention of the sub-plot involving his past, which was still unresolved. Storm had more lines, but her character came across as annoying rather than more 'developed'. Her look, while updated, was also out of character. She was never a 'lead' character, and should have stayed that way.This film deviated quite considerably from the direction of the first 2 films in quality and the characters.Mystique and Scott Summers were both wasted characters in this movie, not because of what happened to them, but the way it happened. Their parts were far to small considering their impact in the other films. Scott especially should have been used much more, even if the end result stayed the same. The film should have documented his downward spiral.Jean Grey turned interesting, but is never more than that. She offers a few surprises, but is mostly wasted as a character.Wait till the credits have finished rolling for the lead into the next film, which is in line with the X-Men comics. It'll be interesting to see where it goes. However, if it isn't better than this one, they shouldn't bother.",4,3,7,25 May 2006
The Bourne Legacy," Poorly executed & average
","The short version: started out interesting, ended dull.The long: Jeremy Renner steps up as another Treadstone assassin, but he's hampered by the lack of decent script. Aside from an interesting initial 15 minutes, it ends up being the same story as the other 3 Bourne films: a US government assassin on the run from a bunch of other US assassins who want to kill him, is thrown together with an attractive woman, and who both manage to escape to the tropics with a FU message to Uncle Sam.The problem here is that it's the same story. For the fourth time. Yes, there is a difference in the details, but not enough to make it worthwhile. Renner does an decent job as the new 'hero', and so does the lovely Rachel Weiss. The stunts and set pieces are okay, but largely seen-it-before. The chase scene on the rooftops brought back memories of the excellent opening to 'Casino Royale', but it was nowhere near as good.The film takes place around the time of the 2nd Matt Damon Bourne film, but that's all it really has in connection to it, and after 15 minutes, any opportunity for a different kind of Bourne film is irretrievably lost. After that point the script devolves into a very generic story that fails to gain any sort of momentum. There's some little exploration of who Renner was before the Treadstone/Alcon drugs etc, but it's really just a plot point rather than a story.Average film. Could have better used the $125M to feed starving children. 5 out of 10.",5,5,11,18 August 2012
X-Men: Apocalypse," Average, average, average
","The short: Average. Lots of SFX, a dull villain, a convoluted story-line and none of it matches previous films.The long: The X Men franchise has been quite disappointing overall. X1 & X2 were both good, and then a dramatic nose-dive with X3. First Class was pretty good, and Days of Future Past was as well.The film suffers from an uneven quality of writing. Magneto. He's clearly a sociopath, but is he good? Is he bad? Is he even the same character from the first films? The same could be said for a few of the characters. Mystique, for example. Good? Bad? The mutant with wings: the same guy from X3? Who knows? For all his twisted character contortions, Fassbender does a good job as Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence is okay, but not great. James McAvoy again does well as Xavier. Olivia Munn looks smoking hot as Psylocke, but doesn't get much screen time.The villain is bizarre, purple and dull. And he wants to destroy the world. I'm getting a bit sick of world-ending villains. What's the sun-powered technology? Why is he a 3000 year old techno-looking mutant? Who knows? Maybe that's what he looks like in the comics, but it doesn't translate well to screen.Unfortunately, the franchise has also decided to go down the modern path of casting kids in big roles. I don't mean that kids can't act, but that it's now all about children and teenagers saving the world. Hollywood has had a taste of YA market money, and it's addicted. Whilst films with kids who save the world aren't necessarily bad, they're very light and shallow.So yeah, it's okay, but it's a bit crap too. Whilst you have to hand it to the writers for swinging for the fences, it falls short. We've seen it all before. Mutants vs humans. It's getting a bit stale as a plot line. Some good SFX. The really big scenes are a bit overblown.",5,25,54,24 May 2016
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," It's Twilight. Number 2
","It's Twilight. Number 2. I am not sure why people are so derisive about this film. You had to know what it was going to be like. If your girlfriend dragged you to it, then suck it up and enjoy the brownie points. If you saw it under your own stream and didn't like it, then as the sating goes, 'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me'. Stop going to see films you obviously won't like. Sheesh!**Possible spoilers***After seeing the first one and quite liking it, I was waiting in line today with all the kiddies to see this one. New Moon was my favourite of the series, and I was thinking that maybe they wouldn't be able to pull it off, considering that Edward isn't in it for the most part. However, Melissa Rosenberg has done another outstanding job in translating the book to film again. It's well paced and captures it pretty well. The film looks good, but doesn't have the moodiness of the first film. It works well as a sequel and is a good follow-up to the first Twilight.The downside is that the film's score is terrible. Twilight had quite a haunting score (by Carter Burwell), but New Moon is all badly placed pop songs.Unfortunately, I think that the director sucked. The film should have been a lot darker than it was, and more like Twilight in it's feel (It IS the same series, after all). The director said he wanted it to be a 'romantic epic', but the fact is that book ISN'T. What a dofus.Also, Kristen Stewart isn't a particularly good actress, but she is smoking hot. This film should have had far more emotional depth (yes, I am aware it's a kiddie movie). It wasn't terribly done, but not great either.Team Jacob has definitely ascended.",9,2,10,28 November 2009
The Football Factory," Low budget, no real storyline, poor effort all round
","I am not sure exactly what the point of the film is. The script seems to be trying to channel Trainspotting, but can't quite get a connection. It might have been trying for a 'gritty' sort of feel, but ultimately it ends up looking like a bunch of amateurs.While a film like Green Street may have been Hollywoodised, at least it actually portrays the English football firm mindset with some authenticity. With a techno soundtrack and tries-to-be-snappy narration, The Football Factory strives to be like notable British films such as Trainspotting and Lock Stock, but fails miserably.None of the characters have any depth to them, and the film is bereft of any actual plot. It's a thoroughly un-enjoyable and boring film. The main character is a loser, his best mate is a fat loser and the apparent 'hard man' of the firm is just a fat 40yr old loser. There's no personality and nothing worth watching about any of the characters.Notable failures: some pointless dream sequences thrown in that only serve to ruin further an already crap effort; a recurring taxi driver who is exceedingly annoying; the old guys that just waste more time. Unauthentic, unrealistic, meandering, pointless, and no actual football.",1,3,8,27 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not really Star Wars any more
","The Last Jedi. Some of you will like it. Some of you won't. I didn't like it. It was okay, but very average and missed so many opportunities. Both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are riding on the goodwill of the original series, and quickly draining it.No real spoilers here. Just comments about the film rather than the plot.It's a narrative & thematic mess with some of the hands down, lamest plot devices ever thought of. Some really interesting ideas as well, to be fair, but some entire sequences & characters are completely irrelevant to the plot and only seem to exist so the director could make some pointed social comment.No wonder the rebels/resistance keep losing. Militarily they're disorganised and stupid. At least in the original episodes they were half-competent. Here they're reckless and short-sighted.The biggest thing though is that it seems that Disney is desperately trying to drag Star Wars away from the original episodes. I think Rogue One was the last actual Star Wars movie we'll see (maybe Solo will be though). Obviously they need to do so in order to recoup their costs in buying the franchise. The Last Jedi also kind of trashes a lot of what The Force Awakens set up (which isn't a bad thing, that movie was crap).The Kylo/Rey parts were the best and had some amazing potential (which was summarily ignored), and I hoped they'd save the film, but instead we just got really thin characters and absolutely zero development for the next film. The original trilogy had the Emperor and Vader. Although they were pretty under developed characters (in some ways), at least they were villains who cast a long shadow. Here, the villians are barely part of the story in a lot of ways. Remember Darth Maul from the Phantom Menace? Remember how evil he looked and you just knew he was going to be a cool character? Then he did practically nothing and then died? Awesome, wasn't it?After these latest two, it's obvious that Disney has no plans for the current trilogy. Each film trashes what came before it and provides very little for what will come after it. There's almost zero continuity between The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi in terms of story. Thematically they're empty (although I suspect it may be part of trying to drag it away from the original episodes a little, ie: no Skywalker family).Ultimately, this is a corporate film rather than an artistic one. I dispair that the director has apparently been chosen to write a whole new trilogy after the hack Abrams wrecks the next film. It'll be less and less Star Wars.",3,1,3,19 December 2017
The Hangover Part II," Okay, but not that great either
","I haven't seen the first Hangover film. Having said that, I'm not sure I really missed much in terms of a continuation of the story, although obviously the characters bring with them some backstory from the first film. So how does this one rate by itself? There were a couple of funny moments, but only a couple. I kept waiting for some truly funny things to occur, but they never did. For a location like Bangkok, they didn't really film that much of it. It's an epic, hot, sprawling city, but they could have been filming it anywhere. Where were the night markets, the myriad bars and brothels, the heat, and the people? They seem to be largely absent, markedly so if you've ever actually been to Bangkok.Bradley Cooper was the star of the film. The other actors were all a bit crap. Zach Gifiankidis (or whatever his name is) sucked.Ehh, not much else to say here. I was pretty disappointed all round.4 out of 10.",4,0,0,20 June 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Don't believe the hype - the ending sucks
","The short: It's another Twilight film. What else did you expect? More about the hyped ending soon.The long: It's like all the other Twilight films: shallow plot, some humour, some lame sparkly vampires, some CGI wolves etc.Kristen Stewart looks hot. Robert Pattinson looks pale. The CGI baby looks fake.Basically, the film is what it is. I still think the first Twilight film was the best. It had the right dark mood, colours/palette and an excellent score by Carter Burwell. The following installments went for the more commercial/mainstream feel, and I think the franchise suffered as a result.**SPOILERS** So, what about the ending that everyone is talking about? Yes, there is a 'twist', and it ruins the film. Absolutely ruins it. It cheats the audience and diminishes the story.But why? Well, to begin with, the fight scene is great. There's werewolves fighting, vampires getting their heads ripped off and so on. All in all, it's not a bad fight scene. Some main characters die, on both sides. That is quite shocking, and it ups the stakes all round.But we find out afterwards that it's all just a vision that Alice shows the Volturi, and it never happens. And that robs the audience of the cathartic release of the tension that has been built throughout the whole film. True victory is only measured against the cost required to achieve it. A victory that is hard fought and incurs substantial loss becomes bittersweet and all the more important as a result. Those who died for the freedom of others did so because they thought it was worth it. Because this victory cost nothing, it is ultimately worthless, and robs the audience of that emotion.Liam Neeson's recent film 'The Grey' screwed the audience in the same way. We were all psyched up to see him lay it on the line to fight the wolf (and most likely die horribly), but the stupid director stole that moment from us. That Liam Neeson was going to get torn apart isn't the point; he wouldn't have needed to actually win in order to win, if that makes sense. The mere act of going into the battle and being fully committed to it would have been enough. His courage would have won regardless of the outcome. By stealing that from the audience, the immature director has weakened and diminished the film's theme.Likewise, Bill Condon (director) does the same thing. I'm sure they thought it would be a great 'twist' that no one sees coming, but that's cheap. Dirt cheap. To be honest, the film is pretty crap. Enjoyable, but crap. It's redeeming feature would have been the price paid by the friends and family to ensure that Bella, Edward and Renesmee (and Jacob) survived. The victory, though tinged with the sadness of loss, would have been all the more important because of the sacrifices paid to achieve it.That's my take on it.",4,9,22,23 November 2012
Jack Reacher," Better than I thought it would be
","Just saw Jack Reacher. The opening scene made me think about the recent Sandy Hook shooting spree, even though it is a different scenario.Overall: not a bad film. I quite enjoyed it. Tom Cruise wasn't brilliant, but he did have his moments. Rosamund Pike is quite attractive, although she was really just a side character, as are all the others. Robert Duval also shows up as a grizzled gun lover, but Cruise is the pony of this show. Quite violent, some minor plot holes, the usual good-guy-beats-all-the-baddies stuff, and a 50 yr old Tom Cruise not doing too badly til he takes his shirt off, and then he looks like he's straining to hold his gut in.Some snappy dialogue (the bar scene); some okay action here and there; an overly extended chase scene; and a mystery solved.**SPOILERS** The plot has the titular Jack Reacher investigating a sniper shooting spree in some unnamed US city. Pretty soon he's neck deep in a conspiracy involving embezzlement from the government.A reasonably solid outing for the aging Cruise. Weirdo Scientology beliefs aside, he still does okay as a lead.",8,4,10,11 January 2013
The Witch," Complete lack of tension
","Anytime someone says something like 'cinema as art', you know it's a rubbish film.The Witch is well shot, well acted, poorly written and poorly directed. The cinematography is good. The aspect ratio is unusual, but works well.The acting is good, and I liked the authentic-sounding dialogue, although it got a little talky at times.**** SPOILERS ****It's poorly written & directed. There's an real lack of tension. The film starts with a bang - a witch steals and kills a child - and then... nothing. The witch is almost completely absent from the rest of the film til the end. There's a rabbit and a goat that seem to be possessed, but that's all. The film would have worked much, much better if the witch was a constant presence, even if only half-seen.Without that, the film just plods along. After such a dramatic start, it gets dull and slow. It's a real shame, since there's a lot of good things going on. The problem is that there is no tension. Certainly strange things happen, but the director is unable to sustain any tension through it.",6,1,5,12 March 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Incredibly UNgripping
","Maybe it's because I'm not American, but I found this film to be quite ungripping. In style it's very like The Hurt Locker; hand-held, unproduced look etc. The cinematography is okay, the acting a bit flat, some unrealistic scenes, and an oddly empty journey.I found the beginning of the film to be a bit confusing with regards to the leads that the CIA were trying to follow, but maybe I just wasn't paying attention. The torture scenes appeared to be quite realistic (to someone who has never tortured anyone).It's a very pared down narrative. The story follows a single lead (with very little backstory), and doesn't give much info outside that. This isn't a bad way to tell the story, but it does present some limitations.In terms of telling a story, there's really only about 10 minutes worth (film time) in terms of useful information gathered on the part of the CIA. They're looking for a guy, can't find him, luck turns up an old report, they track a possible suspect, find he goes to a house, they suspect Bin Laden is there, storm the house and kill Bin Laden.This leave long stretches where nothing really happens, and there's nothing to fill in the time.The film really never gets out of a well-recreated narrative documentary feel. The reason why I think this causes an issue is that because there is zero character development, all you have is the threadbare story to follow. Character development doesn't mean building a fictional character with a journey arch; it means providing depth and insight into why a person does what they do. If you knew nothing about Osama Bin Laden, you'd spend most of the film wondering what was going on. Because the narrative is so sparse, all we have is the lead character, but there's nothing to connect with. Who is the Maya? Why is she so dedicated? Why wasn't she a crying wreck after getting shot at by gunmen outside her home? What drives her and why is it so important to her? Scenes are just sort of dumped on screen with minimal segues. The film skips years with no bother to tell what happened in the intervening time. The lead, Jessica Chastain, then appears as if no time had passed at all. It gives it a very clinical, hollow feel and reeks of a lack of substance on the part of the filmmakers. Terrorist attacks occur randomly with no relevance to the plot except perhaps to inform the viewer that the CIA work is worthwhile because the terrorist threat is still present.So, the film appears to just provide the facts that led to the raid. That immediately makes it a dry, drawn-out affair that lacks tension and heart. The film doesn't address the issues of the morality of torture, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Viewers can make their own minds up on that. I was at least pleased that it didn't descend into cheesy flag-waving Americanisms at the end.It didn't need to be an over-produced Hollywood flick, but there's also nothing to engage with. In terms of story-telling, it has largely failed. The end result is a 'based on real events' recreation documentary without any of the detail of a documentary. It's not a bad angle to take, but doesn't deliver the emotion that a film (and not a documentary) about the hunt for the 9/11 mastermind deserves.",5,3,11,17 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," A great film
","I don't know whether 12 Years a Slave does anything more to shed light on the history of American slavery, but it's a well-made film. The acting is all top-notch, and the cinematography is great.It's a film that deserves to be seen because it presents an honest (presumably) view of what slavery was like in the US. It has a few brutal scenes that will make people squeamish, but they're not gratuitous.Some people have complained that the film doesn't present a perfect snapshot of slavery, and this is true. By all accounts there were, for example, many runaway slaves, and a noble legacy of resistance to slavery by slaves themselves. However, that's an argument that is unfair to both the filmmakers and Solomon Northup himself. Solomon chose to endure and try and survive, and to fault him for that is not right. That there were many developments in terms of slaves escaping, and resisting slavery, and no film can truly cover every aspect of a given historical time. The film is Solomon's story, and should be appreciated on those terms.A great film, and a great story that needs to be seen, if only to gain a little understanding of the horrors that we do to ourselves.",8,1,2,22 January 2014
Joker," A grimy take on comic book films that misses it's potential
","DC has gone for that 'gritty' dark style as opposed to Marvel's bright and colourful style. One outcome is that DC films have become dour affairs, and another is that Marvel films are very superficial when it comes to characters.Joker continues in the DC vein, and hats off to Warner Bros for swinging for the fences with a film like this. It's a bold choice, but unfortunately it also falls short of said fence. At time of writing it has a 9.4 rating here and that is way, way to generous. This is a 7 rated film at best.Joaquin Phoenix is great as the titular character. The overall story is good, if a bit hardcore, at least compared to most comic book movies. This really isn't a comic-book movie, despite having notable comic book characters. It's a very realistic take on the origins of the Joker, and on that note it's a great effort.The real tragedy of this film is that's it's really close to being great, but falls short. The violence is a bit too realistic to be enjoyable in the way that James Bond, Mission Impossible or even Marvel films are. There's only a few violent scenes, but they're stripped back and raw. It definitely deserves it's hard R rating, but there's no fun either.The world of Joker focuses tightly on Phoenix and the un-comfortableness of mental illness. The Joker's character is not unlikable for most of the film, but he is not likeable either. This makes the film watchable, but not necessarily enjoyable. Aside from some great cinematography and shots, there's no parts that you'll think back on and go 'Wow, I'd like to see that again.'The problem with such a tight focus on the main character is that it eschews creating a setting for that character. With so many incendiary elements in today's world (Black Lives Matter, anti-capitalism, a sense of disconnection from each other etc) that could be mined for fuel, the writers chose the most unrealistic elements instead. Rather than creating situations that feel real for the characters to inhabit, the film instead chooses two-dimensional set pieces that fall flat and are unsatisfying.To wit, most people do not go crazy at the drop of a hat. Take the 1992 LA riots. There had been simmering tensions for some time, and all it needed was a spark. When that spark came, the whole city exploded. The spark in Joker is both too weak to inflame a city, and too unnatural. The anti-capitalist sentiments are not allowed to fester with the audience, and thus the final settings in the film of the 'revolution' are fake and unearned. If the writer's/director had done that simple thing of adding a little more context and meat to the Joker's world, it would have made the rioter's worship of a homicidal manic a little more understandable.This film made me think of Taxi Driver, but with some notable differences. In that film, De Niro's Travis Bickle is an olden day incel, but is at least redeemed by a 'noble' act - saving Iris - however twisted his motives were. It presents both a character that most people wouldn't like, but manages to make him into a good guy, in only because he does what people wish would happen and he's better than the really bad guys.Arthur Fleck by comparison is offered no such redemption. That would actually be okay if at least the world which he inhabits connected with us. Instead however, rich people are jerks, and the rioters are shown without any real context. They're rioting, but against what? Random anti-capitalism that we're supposed to recognise? There's always been rich people and poor people, but that's not what sets off riots. What sets off riots is (at least a sense of) injustice. There's certainly opportunism by some in those situations, but that comes after the fact.Fleck's first victims did nothing worthy of inciting riots and mayhem - they were boorish jerks worthy of contempt, but not burning a city down. There have been riots and protests against capitalism in the real world, but they all have context. Random, un-contextualized mayhem is unsatisfying, especially in a film that goes to such lengths to delve into it's character's psyche. Maybe that was the point; the very people who torment Arthur are the same people who worship him at the end. Everyone is irredeemable and everything is chaos.This is where the film truly failed for me though. The Joker as a realistic, insane, delusional character is a low-key take on the supervillain genre, but it works. I like that DC are going down the darker path. Is he an incel? I guess so. I can see how it could be construed to glorify horrific actions, but I really do think that those who claim that (the incel part, there's more than enough movie violence to inspire people everywhere) are reading into the film something that really isn't there. Senseless violence, yes, but not everything else (that I'm told) comes with the incel losers on Reddit. There's no violence towards women, no moralising on the excesses of sex in the media and so on.So yeah, hard R. Realistic depictions of violence. A stripped back origin story. And completely un-enjoyable to watch. Taxi Driver was saved by Bickle's redemption, but his world was understandable. Fleck didn't need that redemption (since he is in fact a supervillain and quite insane), but his world is half-baked and lazy.",7,4,11,3 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Actually quite good
","Not often I give 10 out of 10. It's not perfect, but it's great. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Keeps up the pace well with all of the time loop replays.It sags slightly toward the end, but not enough to undo all it's previous hard work. The very end is a bit weak and unsatisfying though not enough to wreck the film. I'd have done it differently, even if it achieved the same conclusion (ultimately).Tom Cruise does well (as usual). Emily Blunt is great. The other supporting cast are good too.Plenty of action, explosions, aliens weapons etc. A solid story that doesn't have too many plot-holes. Great popcorn cinema watching that is well directed, well acted and well written. I've not read the story it's based on ('All you need is kill').",10,6,10,4 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Flashy, but shallow
","The Wolf of Wall Street is not a bad flick, but suffers from an over-abundance of narration. Some will like that, some won't. Di Caprio is very good, as are his supporting cast. The direction is good, the script is snappy, and the audience is blind.The excess of narration generally doesn't work for me. Some on this site claim it should get an Oscar (and maybe it will in some category), but it's not good enough for Best Picture or Best Director.Jordan Belfort stole millions, ruined lives, and despite this, Scorsese prefers to celebrate him. It's one thing to praise a fictional character's bad deeds, but given the devastating recent global financial crises (which was itself just another con), I'm surprised that audiences are lapping this up. Actually, maybe I'm not so surprised, since the cult of money counts even average audiences amongst it's believers.Despite the film's good points, I struggled to really enjoy it, given that everything it preaches is the antithesis of morality. Now, don't get me wrong, I've watched and enjoyed my fair share of amoral (and immoral) films, but the whole GFC just makes me mad, as it should any rational human being. It was simply stealing money from people who can't afford it. There were no redeeming features about it, and this film chooses to celebrate that.If you don't care about all that, I'm sure you'll enjoy the film (and it is enjoyable). If you have a conscience, you might not be taken in so much by it's worship of money.",6,18,29,22 January 2014
Inception," Fantastic
","Ingeniously devised. Intricately built. Executed with a master craftsman's precision.Inception is basically a heist movie set within the world of dreams. It follows a crew of thieves who manipulate and create dreams in order to capture information from an unsuspecting mind.In itself, thats a nice concept, but the real beauty of this film is in it's execution. By the final stages of the film, you can see the set-up. It's so majestic, that even though you know what is happening, it is a joy to watch it unfold. It's like a puzzle that is amazing in it's pieces as well as the final picture.Christopher Nolan has a talent for creating amazing stories. As if that wasn't enough, he also has an incredible skill at creating a complicated and yet simple narrative.Don't believe anyone who tells you this film is hard to follow. It take more than just slouching in the seat, but it guides you so nicely. Don't expect a mindless action movie. This is a fascinating journey that is beautiful even when you know all it's parts.10 out of 10.",10,3,7,22 July 2010
Arrival," Interesting, but not fascinating
","All the reviews said this was an amazing film about big ideas and concepts. Well, there's really only two ideas/concepts. There's the aliens and why they're here (pretty standard stuff at it's core) and then there's the the two leads (this one is a bit more interesting).I really hoped to come away from the film with some things to mull over, but found that it was all pretty straightforward. The ideas were interesting, but not engrossing.It's a much more minimalist style of sci-fi, which really works well. The sets are pretty sparse, the locations are kept to a minimum, and it manages to capture a few moments of reflection amongst the confusion of dealing with aliens.The theory that language shapes how we think is an interesting one, and this film makes a great platform to explore that. This theory is still largely unsubstantiated, and while this film doesn't really challenge that, it does play along the same lines. Language is just a tool though, and it can't truly be isolated (from other factors such as culture, up-bringing etc) to the extent that the theory suggests. Otherwise all people who speak a particular language would see the world exactly the same way, which is clearly not true.The ending feels a bit rushed, and there's a particular moment (when saving the world) that I felt was a bit lazy. It didn't fit in with the rest of the story.Other reviewers will claim that the main character goes through a journey of self-discovery, but she really doesn't. Her character doesn't actually change at all during the film - this is the real indicator of whether there has been any self-discovery. There's no actual self-reflection, nor any real questioning of what makes us human (this isn't addressed at all). There's the usual fear of aliens etc, but it's presented in a flat two dimensional way.Other reviews have crazy headlines like 'Arrival is a stunning science fiction movie with deep implications for today', except, of course, it really doesn't have any implications for today, as it's a sci-fi film about things that will never (in the foreseeable future - pun intended) happen.I think the real problem is that so many modern films are weak and rubbish that when a film with even a hint of something more profound come along, people go gaga over it.It's okay, and it's interesting. It's a welcome change from the blandness of Marvel films, but it's also not a profound as the reviews claim.",7,1,6,15 November 2016
Prometheus," So why is Prometheus a dull film?
","So why is Prometheus a dull film? There's obviously a lot of money sloshing around; the direction is okay and the SFX is okay. What went wrong? The major, glaring flaw is the script and dialogue. To quote the great Bart Simpson, 'I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows.'SPOILERS AHEAD: The first Alien film is rightly a sci-fi masterpiece. One area where Alien clearly excels over Prometheus is in the crew interaction. Prometheus is a very similar film (in fact it's actually a remake: aliens, far away, android crew member is evil etc etc); the crew are on a spaceship (more or less) and stuff goes wrong, people die, aliens cruise around etc etc. Except that in Prometheus the people are artificial (and I don't mean the android); there's no realistic interaction between any of the crew. They don't talk to each other at all about what is going on. Some of them die, and there's NO conversation. Not even a tense _lack_ of conversation. Some of the crew are trapped in the alien base, and no one cares that they were left behind (except the poor trapped guys obviously). Charlize Theron burns one of the crew alive and there's NO mention of it afterwards. I cannot stress this enough. It is a fault so massive that I can only assume that Ridley Scott and the other people involved were deaf, since that's the only way you'd miss it. It's artificial and fake, and it sucks the heart right out of the film. Whoever wrote the dialogue ought to be ashamed of themselves and quit screen writing.There's also very, very few scary moments (the R rating appears to come completely from a single scene, which is also rather dull except for the squirm factor). Instead, the writers have decided that awe-inspiring alien vistas and star-map holograms are more important. What this functionally translates into is a lack of tension in the entire film. That's Ridley Scott's fault, and it's obvious that he's lost his touch here.Overall, it's dull, lifeless, and empty. Which is a shame because the ingredients are all there. It's just that the chef can't read the recipe correctly. 5 out of 10. Catch it on DVD. It's not worth cinema prices.",5,1,4,8 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," It's okay. Not brilliant, but better than Origins: Wolverine
","The latest X-Men movie is okay. The best one is still X-Men 2. #1 was good. #3 sucked. Origins: Wolverine was disappointing, and the latest effort is not too bad. Unfortunately, though, there's nothing really good about it either.Other than charting the rise of Professor X and Magneto, it's all a bit dull, I found. It lacks drive and at times feels more like a rehash of concepts from the first 3 in the series, rather than the exploration of something new.It takes place during the Cold War, which is because it's really the last event after World War 2 that the US wasn't facing unpopular coverage over. Unfortunately, the Cold War, and specifically the Cuban Missle Crisis doesn't really resonate that much anymore.The story was written partly by Bryan Singer (who worked on the first 2 X-Men films before Brett Ratner insulted us with X-Men 3), and it's a little out of sync with both X-Men 3 and Wolverine, not that it matters too much however.The cast all do okay. I was afraid that it was going to descend into a teen flick with all the mutant kiddies, but it managed to steer away from that.Kevin Bacon stars as the antagonist, but he's largely useless (apart from inexplicably going from a German accent to an American accent) and somehow becoming a super-mutant.Overall the script was okay, but lacked a certain something. It's hard to put my finger on it, but it just seemed a bit light and a bit shallow. The mutant powers were all a bit weak on the goodies' side, whilst the baddies had the cool stuff.Overall, 7 out of 10.",7,4,13,7 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Disappointing
","Okay, some major spoilers later on, but I'll let you know beforehand.First: Saw it at an advance screening after watching Batman Begins and The Dark Knight back to back. The story of The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is okay (except for a couple of things), but overall, it's long and dull. Maybe it was because I'd just seen TDK, which is a textbook exercise in movie tension and atmosphere, but I found that TDKR was simply lacking.It lacked tension, menace, and atmosphere. The story itself is okay apart from a few things that don't really make much sense (it's based partly on the Batman comic story Knightfall). It connects back to Batman Begins with the League of Shadows, which was okay.The villain, Bane, somehow lacks menace. He's big and tough, and beats a few people up, but not in any way that shows just how bad he really is. Maybe it's because you never really see much of his face, hidden as it is behind a mask of sorts (which they apparently made in a filthy middle-eastern jail), but there's no real facial expressions going on. This means that he's always kind of blank, even when describing horrors. Heath Ledger's the Joker was built on facial expressions (among other things), but Bane is devoid of them.His voice is also, I found, difficult to understand at times. Whether that's due to the cinema speakers or not, it was a little frustrating.The plot is pretty slow (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it too lacks tension and emotion. The ingredients are all there, but it just doesn't work too well. I'm not sure that's the story's fault as much as the way it's told. Yes, things happen, but there doesn't appear to be much at stake overall. The movie lacks an emotional core.**Major spoilers ahead!** Okay, so Bane does a WWE move on Batman and almost cripples him. That's fine, and part of the Knightfall story. However, the problem is that it just doesn't feel important enough. By that I mean that Batman should have been broken spiritually _before_ this, making his physical breaking all the more damaging. It does go into it all, but it's not good enough. Batman enters the fight because he wants to, but his death-wish isn't pronounced enough. There's just something about it that didn't feel satisfying, but I'm not sure what.EDIT: My mistake. The whole point of trapping the people in Gotham is documented in the film, but that brings me to this point (and one of the film's greatest failures): We don't see the ordinary people of Gotham suffer. There's nothing of the impact of Bane's nefarious plans on them, and that's where the emotional heart of the movie is lost. It's all well and fine that Batman is going through some crisis, but he's always been about protecting the people, and without that as context, it's not as satisfying.The twist in the story is okay, if unexpected. It doesn't really add anything though.Overall, it's not as powerful as The Dark Knight, and lacks real tension. I don't think it will be anywhere near as successful as it's predecessor. That's a shame, because I think Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors around. He seems to have lacked the vibrancy here of his earlier work, though.6 out of 10.",6,19,44,18 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," We've seen this droid before...
","It's a good film, but it's not really Star Wars (I'll explain that in a sec). It's a complete copy of Episode IV.To wit: there's a droid with plans to a space weapon; there's a black-clad bad guy hunting it; the droid crashes on a desert planet; there's a character on this desert planet who (later) discovers the force; there's a resistance (rebellion); the heroes end up on the death star and disable it, allowing the resistance to bomb the single glaring weakness in the space weapon's design; there's a light sabre fight between the good guy(s) and the bad guy.Does that sound exactly like Episode IV - A New Hope? Did it feel like you'd seen the story before? You betcha it does, and you certainly have. Unfortunately it's also the plot for this new film. Clearly Disney wanted to try and position this new film to create a new story-line (and money). JJ Abrams is just Disney's b*tch here. Creatively bankrupt. However, in order to do that they had to discard all of the original story line, as well as the extended Star Wars universe.So the prequels sucked. The acting was terrible, the dialogue was terrible, the directing was terrible. But the underlying story was fantastic. It told the story of how we ended up with Episode IV. This new film throws that away entirely, and doesn't really give us anything new to think about. Because of that, it's not really a Star Wars film. It's just a film that is similar to Star Wars.Apparently Abrams was asked 'Who is Luke Skywalker in 30 years?' Great question, but Abrams doesn't know the answer. Luke shows up at the end, but doesn't do antyhing. Force Awakens? Are you kidding me? The Force didn't awake in this film. The only thing that awoke was my disappointment.The original trilogy ended with The Return of the Jedi. You'd never know it from this film though, since the Jedi apparently never actually returned. Oh, there's some throwaway line about Luke starting a new Jedi academy that Kylo Ren (not a Sith) destroyed, but that's just lazy writing.The universal praise for this film is really just misplaced nostalgia. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but not an actual continuation of Star Wars. Disney clearly want the kiddie's money, and in order to do that they needed to throw out Lucas' story. No more Sith, thankfully no more midicholorians, but also less Star Wars.",5,1,7,20 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Okay, but disappointing
","After the dull abyss that was The Deathly Hallows Part 1, I didn't think that Part 2 would really be much better. And it really wasn't. I have no idea how it got an 8.5 rating.I have enjoyed the Harry Potter films, although I have never read the Books. However, I have found the films to be poorly written. The scriptwriters seems to eschew actual narrative and instead just drop scenes in here and there.*HERE BE SPOILERS* Firstly, the plot holes. So the elder wand is this awesome powerful device. Except it doesn't really do much at all. Well, okay. Maybe 'powerful' is a metaphor for something else. And the wand apparently serves Harry, not Voldemort, although that really doesn't make any functional difference at all. Poor writing. The Order of the Pheonix is destroyed, apparently. I'm not sure when that happened, exactly, since they never bothered to show that to the audience, and all the members are still alive til the end. Part 1 ended with no cliffhanger, and the whole subplot of the Deathly Hallows was largely irrelevant. The elder wand was pointless. The resurrection stone didn't make any sense. The invisibility cloak didn't even show up as far as I can recall.The end result is that it's okay. The acting is the same as all the others, the special effects the same and so forth. Thankfully they kept the same actors throughout the series. The real problem is that the filmmakers never bothered to build a strong narrative. It's fast paced, but shallow.My guess is that they tried to save all the interesting parts til Part 2. However, the functional result is that Part 1 sucked and sucked and they spent an hour in a tent doing nothing, and Part 2 had too much to cover to make a powerful narrative. What should have happened is a more even spacing of events.6 out of 10.",3,5,9,22 July 2011
Pitch Perfect," Okay, snappy, hollow
","The verdict: it's okay. Unfortunately, at it's core the film is a very well-worn path: bunch of semi-losers manage to win.Anna Kendrick is the only one who manages to infuse a character with any sort of personality, but she's too hot to be a genuine outsider, and her lines are way too scripted at times. She also listens to pure pop music, despite sporting various body piercings and being supposedly 'alternative'. Like, who at that age doesn't know who David Guetta is? Her character wants to create music, but all she does is cut up pop songs and remix them (which you never actually hear anyway). At college age if she isn't either DJing up a storm or at least writing her own material, then it makes her look like a naive kid.The rest of the cast are cardboard. Rebel Wilson is funny-ish, but not in any way that another actor couldn't have done.Some funny lines, some snappy dialogue, and overall very staged scenes. Almost every scene actually feels scripted, rather than organic. The 'awkward' scenes are highly unbelievable. This caused me to get taken out of the film's narrative.The Glee-style music is also way too good, especially for people who are mixing in high-energy dance moves. In the space of about 10 minutes the Barden Bellas go from getting kicked out of a fraternity show because they suck to managing 'pitch perfect' improvised singing in a disused swimming pool. It's like no one ever thought of singing anything other than 80s songs. That kind of simple naivety unfortunately makes the film feel a bit immature, like a Glee version of Step Up.Overall it's a pretty good attempt at a lite chick-flick, but I wish it had been directed and handled better. It's let down by the cookie-cutter nature of the plot, heavily scripted moment, and no heart.",6,0,2,20 December 2012
Looper," It's okay, but feels half-baked
","Looper isn't a bad film, but not a great film. Rian Johnson (writer/director) lives in the indie realm, and the film reflects that, even though he's suddenly got a lot of cash to spend. It's got an interesting idea, but somehow doesn't gather enough steam. There are heaps of minor plot-holes (as you'd expect with an ambitious sci-fi film). Overall I felt it was a low-budget film that got a whole bunch of funding.Some parts were ingenious, but others felt cheap. Like using killers who seemed to be more like wild teenagers than killers. I guess that was supposed to show the depravity of the youth of the day, but it lacked gravitas. I can see the appeal of the idea, but it felt faked.Or that Bruce Willis (**spoilers**) decides to go killing kiddies, but the audience isn't really shown the emotion that drives that decision. Yes, you see the wife get shot, yes there's mention of some future killer, but it's not enough to mention it. You have to show it. And the script doesn't.The story also doesn't show just how bad the 'Rainmaker's' reign of terror is. This is important because when the Rainmaker is shown to be a child, the juxtaposition would have been much more dramatic.And adding the fact that Bruce Willis bringing zero emotion to the role doesn't help much either.To summarise, I was mildly disappointed. To be fair, it was okay, and nice to see an intelligent sci-fi film (especially after the insult that was the Total Recall remake), but I just didn't find it tight enough narrative or plot-wise. And Joseph Goron-Levitt looked weird and plasticky. 6 out of 10.",6,1,3,13 October 2012
Easy A," Okay, but ultimately souless
","Saw Easy A tonight. It's pretty average. It's a film that had multiple references to classic 80's Brat Pack flicks, and so that raises it above the standard teen movies. Older audiences will get the 80s references more than the younger ones. There's quite a few laughs to be had, and some snappy dialogue. The basic idea of the film is good (a re-working of The Scarlett Letter, which the film unashamedly references and possibly over-references).However, the main problems are ultimately fundamental flaws in the script. Olive (the smoking hot Emma Stone) is too cool. She's too self- assured, and too smart. It doesn't have the authenticity of teen life, unlike Mean Girls which had it in spades. Olive wasn't the cynical outsider the role called for; she was the confident adult narrator. Films that portray the hero coming out stronger at the end work for a reason, but the character was the same throughout.The end of the film is a love story and fixes everything in only a few scenes, but it's tacked on, and felt contrived. The core of the film is the 'Scarlett Letter' concept, and it's a clever concept, but it kind of got muddled anywhere outside that. Olive's character didn't really suffer any great despair (at least the drew any empathy), so the ending (where she miraculously found love in about 5 minutes) was more a marriage of convenience than one of passion.Overall, it was a strong film. Very confident, witty and well-paced. At the end though, it was just souless. No real losses or triumphs, no character development. Olive was just as smart and self-confident at the beginning as she was at the end. The audience didn't cheer Olive through the rough times because there weren't any that felt rough. We didn't really care that she hooked up with a decent guy at the end, as that subplot was woefully malnourished and not given any real development time.Commercially? Okay. Artistically? Disappointing. It could have been the next Clueless or Mean Girls, but kind of wasted it's potential.Worth seeing if there'e not much else on, and definitely worth seeing for Emma Stone in tiny blue shorts.",5,58,94,25 September 2010
Fast Five," Pretty average, shallow story, what else did I expect?
","Fast and Furios has been going for a while now and while no one pretends that they're great works of art, for however many millions it cost, a blind, gimp monkey could do a better job. This particular installment seems particularly dull, however. The plot is pretty stupid, the one moral character in the story throws away everything she believes in and even the Rock can't help this dismal outing. Here's the lowdown:Plot: *Some* cars (not as many as you'd like), a harebrained plot to rip off a drug dealer (al a Ocean's Eleven) and the Rock busting some pretty weak moves not seen since his WWE days. Some really dumb drag racing in police cars because I think the director realised that there isn't too much actual racing in this film. And that's really the let-down: they've eschewed the only good thing about the series (the cars) and replaced it was a dumb and unoriginal heist plot. The timeline is also skewed. This one fits in before Tokyo Drift, but I'm not sure where in relation to #4 (presumably afterwards).Script: Poorly written. The characters don't do anything particularly stupid (they don't do anything particularly good either), but they waste a lot of time. For instance, they try to come up with a scheme to break in (I won't say where) which involves trying to drift around some corners, and then just abandon the idea when it gets too hard. WTF? It's substandard writing.SFX: Not too bad, but nothing really spectacular.Characters: Meh.Overall, it's pretty weak. This film feels like it had a low budget, and tries to pretend it really had more money than it did. The first Fast and Furious was actually okay, mostly because it had neat cars and a reasonable plot (even if it wasn't done very well). The next one was pretty crap. Tokyo Drift was likewise crap, but I actually didn't mind it. Then number 4 was average with a really dumb plot and lost the hottest chick in the series, and now Fast 5 continues that. At least it's consistent.Anyone who tells you that they're supposed to be like this, they are what they are etc etc, is retarded. In reality, good films actually have decent plots, nice cinematography and well-written characters. A movie about cars can have a reasonable story (it's not that hard) and be well acted. What these people really meant to say was, 'These films have been badly written by a pair of monkeys, unimaginatively shot by a sloth and half-assedly directed by a chicken, but I have no imagination and I liked it'.4 out of 10.",4,1,2,27 May 2011
The Cabin in the Woods," Mostly great
","The short: B grade with A grade production; different; great writing; lacklustre ending (you'll see what I mean).The long: Starts great, very inventive, funny etc. Some plot holes here and there, but they're more than made up for with the writing. A very different take on the horror genre that parodies itself as much as it tells a (semi) serious story.The direction is excellent. I don't know if that's the work of the director (never heard of him before) or Joss Wheedon (overrated), but, it's done very well. For the most part. I'll get to that later.Starts off with some young (although not overly hot, unfortunately) young-uns off into the wilderness for some weekend away. The 'horror' build-up is done very well. Great direction. Great jokes. Usual clichés etc, but done very well, and lightheartedly, which works so well that you don't really notice them. It's also got a seemingly bizarre subplot spliced into it, so it keeps you guessing for a while.The first real let-down is the choice of baddies. Although the idea is handled very well, they really fail to create any tension, which drags the film down significantly. The parody of horror films is excellent. Because of the way the writer is revealing bits and pieces here and there, you know that something is afoot, and the zombies (I know, I spoiled it) just don't work well. I'm not sure what would have worked better, but it's not scary, which unfortunately serves to let the film down. The writer (director and Wheedon) are treading the line between the story and their upcoming twists, but they didn't put enough into the horror part of it. You start to see the first signs of the B gradiness (of the story) at this point. I figured out what was going on about 2/3 of the way in, which wasn't too hard, but there's enough interesting twists to keep you entertained nevertheless.The ending though? It just fails to gain the tension it should have had. It's not that it's overly different from the rest of the film in tone, but that's the problem. It should have really kicked into high-gear horror mode at this point, but it stays kind of casual and flat. They really needed to hype up the scare factor and the mood, but it just kind of sails along a bit too casually.Different film, well made, great writing, 7 out of 10.",7,1,5,13 July 2012
Alien: Covenant," A good follow-up to Prometheus
","Alien: Covenant. Not too bad, actually. Not great, but still good. Fantastic cinematography. I like the way that the story has separated itself from the traditional Alien franchise. It follows on from Prometheus quite well and has a very dark tone. Prometheus tried to introduce some philosophical ideas, but was poorly paced and edited, resulting in an uneven film. Even so, it's a new direction in the Alien mythology, and Alien: Covenant furthers that direction.It seems like a lot of fans are complaining that it's not like the other Alien films, but really, we've had two good ones (Alien and Aliens), and then a run of b-grade crud (Alien 3&4 and then AVP). The b-grade films are not completely worthless (but close to), but I don't really want any more of it. The Alien franchise needed something different.In any case, Alien: Covenant has more alien in it (but not too much). The cast are all okay, but only Fassbender is actually good. There are a few complaints that I've read about the crew in the film doing stupid things, but really it's just par for the course. Characters in horror films always do dumb things, and these are no better or worse. In that sense the writing is a bit sloppy, but nothing unforgivable.I rate it 7 out of 10.",7,4,12,16 May 2017
