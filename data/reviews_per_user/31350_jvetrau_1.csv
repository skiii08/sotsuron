Skyfall," The most controversial Bond
",This is one of the best films in the series because of its fresh approach. It's focused on Bond's personal story and reveals a lot of his personality (it's happened only in Licence to Kill earlier). It's heartrending because of the development of the relationship between Bond and M. It's fresh because most locations are in the UK not in exotic countries.And this is one of the worst films in the series because it's ruined the unique way of telling the Bond story as a trilogy that was started by Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. They were building something massive with the idea of a huge global organization that is a total mystery. But they're buried it for a simple formulaic revenge story.I love it because of the fresh approach Sam Mendes took with the visual part and the story. I hate it because Sony has postponed it for two years (despite new Bond is one of their most profitable movies) so Daniel Craig is looking as a retiree now.I love it because it has so much respect for the classic movies in the series. I hate it because of the main villain is a clown (despite Xavier Barderm acting abilities) and the new Q is a joke.I love it because it turns the story around again. And I hate it because its broken expectations set by previous Daniel Craig movies. It's one of the most controversial Bond films ever.,9,1,7,8 December 2012
