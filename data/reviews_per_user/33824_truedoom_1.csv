Hereditary," What a waste of time...
","The plot was incoherent, made no sense.
The acting was horrible.
0 character development.
Time wasted by being dedicated to things irrelevant to the plot.It's like someone took the idea of a foreign horror movie, and randomly translated it a few times on Google Translate, and explained it using crayons.Cannot believe this has a 7.1 on imdb (at time of writing).Avoid avoid avoid.",1,1,4,4 January 2019
