Skyfall," A sad sold out, nonsensical turn for the worst
","I seldom post reviews but I felt this one was necessary. I went to see this, the latest Bond movie to date, encouraged by the strong reviews it was receiving online. I am a big fan of the Daniel Craig iteration of 007 (Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace), and of the direction they had been taking with the development of Bond's character and career through these films. They brought my enthusiasm to a screeching halt with this one. To put it briefly, this latest Bondscapade felt like a horribly senseless run-on sentence penned in a group effort by Mrs. Applebotttom's kindergarten class during a fun, fun creative writing activity. I could picture the excitement in Little Billy's face as he would chip in to the plot, '...and then... and then...!' Well, they took this meandering storyline, sold painfully deliberate ad space to beer, liquor, and electronics companies, threw in a big scoop of overacting (thanks Bardem, Harris... good job!), and some pretty yet disconnected cinematography to pinch off a tidy little loaf that bears the name and thereby smears the legacy of the oldest franchise in the spy film genre. Sorry for getting nasty, but I really dislike what they've done.The part I really don't get, and what this production has me pondering is: why are the reviews so strong? Perhaps the online tools for honest movie reviews have been corrupted? Maybe I'm just out of touch, but I really question the legitimacy of the ratings this movie has received.",3,20,41,28 November 2012
Alice in Wonderland," a waste of Burton magic
","Yeah, cgi and visuals... and nothing more? Shame. Had so much potential.What's most disappointing is that the hype won in getting quick box office gains for something this weak, encouraging more hollowed-out remakes of childhood favorites.I left the theater after watching this feeling almost as disappointed as I did after GI Joe, or even Transformers 2 (I personally thought the first Transformers was fairly close to the mark). As with those, the visuals were of primary interest and yeah, the recognizable characters were all there, but the meat and potatoes were replaced with those plastic food props from the Ikea store. Tasteless and dissatisfying.Might just be me but I picture Elliot Gould as a hell of a Mad Hatter... nothing against Depp.If you haven't seen it yet, my suggestion is that you don't. Wait till it comes out.. nah ... not even worth the rental fee.",3,4,10,11 March 2010
