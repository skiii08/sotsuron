Black Swan," The Best Of 2010
","A while ago, one of my coaches made a cruel joke about one of our best foot ball players who chose to become a ballet dancer. It was funny to me then, but now I see that it is probably more painful the process to acquire the necessary straight and technique the dancers have.The Black Swan does honor to his name, not only on the Tchaikovsky role Nina Seyers (Portman) tries so hardly to improve, but also in Nina by itself. She is a 'sweat girl': fragile, pretty, a dreamer, insecure. She is the White Swan. But, oh surprise, she doesn't have a Black Swan. She fakes it and, in a ballet, that's probably something that can be easily detected. The audience wants to see real feelings and Nina can't provide them. Her predecessor, Beth (Rider), surely has his good and personal version of it. Her ballet mate (or competence?), Lily (Kunis), should have not any White Swan at all, cause she is entirely a Black Swan, nothing more and nothing less. She's hot and vigorous. She's brave and confident. She has a two-black-wings-tattoo on her back, like to prove it. She's inaccurate but natural ('She's not faking' Thomas said). At one level, she's just what Nina needs to be to reach the so desired perfection. But, how can it be? That's what this movie is all about.Anronofsky successfully trapped Portman's twisted metamorphosis into the Black Swan everyone wants to see, in one of the most beautiful performances of the year. A frigid, spoilt and fearful girl, big enough to take care of herself, but weak enough to tell her mother she can take off her clothes on her own. Frighten by the freedom, but more by the conflict inside, reflected in so many surrealistic takes that the movie basically could have told the story without audio. In those brilliant (and even scaring) takes, Nina is being forced by the specter of her evil twin, who seems to wish the freedom Nina is rejecting, to be a real woman. In consequence, Nina scratches her back, rips her skin, breaks her fingernails, etc. She even prints herself in the only similar being around, who happens to be Lily, the Black Swan who can take her place in the stage in a blink of an eye, and Beth, the only being around who reached perfection and drop off. Nina's mother, Erika (Hershey), is most likely the antagonist of this story, for she is the one suppressing her potential with merely love. Inspires her to be conformist and consenting her, instead of letting her go or at least, giving her a little personal space in the bathroom. Hershey should be a good mother, thought.The most relevant character, after the end, is Beth Macintyre, who happened to be famous and could have given Nina all the answers. But she was too 'IN' with her own demons to lead with another person's. When she finds that she's being dumped out of the company, she falls in a depression driven by alcohol and rage that ended showing up a small amount of damage of what a Black Swan can do with a dancer. If Nina would have forgotten about the performance and concerned more about the trap Beth's pride placed on her way, she could have avoid a trap from her own mind. She ends devastated in the hospital (probably crazy, probably killed: you won't hear it from me), but she didn't leave the stage without a warning to Nina, that couldn't be taken seriously because of the ballet maestro and Nina's owner, Thomas Leroy (Cassel): 'Make the most of it, Nina! Yup'.Nothing stopped her from her mind deliriums and the unstoppable search of perfection until it was too late, and even then: her dreams turned into wishes, her wishes turned into fantasies, her fantasies turned into nightmares, her nightmares turned into hallucinations, her hallucinations turned into deliriums, and the deliriums drove her mad.Aronofsky used visual effects lightly, but one of them is in my favorite take from the entire year (even more that the rolling chamber in 'Inception'). Luckily, the story doesn't need all the CGI in the world, cause as I said before, the movie talks by its own. You'll see a good thriller, without exhilarating sound effects and with an exhilarating good screenplay. And yet, it would be one of the craziest, sexiest movies you'll see in a while. You'll found a relivable shiver (or a truly terrifying relieve) at the end, when the White Swan flags and the Black Swan break his cage, just to prove the perfection has a high cost and that thrillers like this are a real mind feast on a time when movies like 'Final Destination' sell tickets.So astonishing that I found that the last Oscar season wasn't about The King Speech and Inception, as I thought, but was about the Social Network and Black Swan. And, obviously, it is so strong that I needed to comment about it even half a year after the premier.",10,0,3,26 June 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," There Are No Differences!!!!! 'They both deserves to die!!!'
","Why would I lie?? i didn't know anything about Sweeney Tood before this film comes out, and as soon as I know that it was already a musical, I put it in my hands...And this is exactly the kind of musical I was waiting since long time ago, a bloody one, a creepy one and, for a wile, a scary one (all the closing scene). Id really love it, there is no doubt of why Tim chose it (the Burton's dark stile, the sweet music, the blood, etc.). He made an amazing work with this movie, especially. I mean, how could he get that beautiful voice from Johnny or Alan?? now, that could be the hardest part, maybe. Just, listen Johnny's voice while sings like crazy around the fire in 'pirates of the Caribbeans'... and right now...WHAT???. Every one should know what could be made with Helena's cute voice, but JOHNNY, ALAN...God. Every song in this film were very well done, I was really surprised.But I keep just a little doubt, since I first watch it, I notice, Judje Turpin knows Benjamin Barker, knows he was a barber ('Benjamin Barker' he said), always was visiting Lucy at is home and taking her flowers, and now appears Sweeney, in the same house, with a familiar face and with the same job. How couldn't know? He deserves to die!!! But beside that, Im satisfied with my blood desire.Well, I just still cant chose between live version or movie version, and I think that nobody could do it, 'cuz they're in fact the same thing. Tim didn't change the screenplay, or the music, or the lyrics or the characters (beside Toby), which is GREAT... in fact, he'd reduce some songs and skip some details from the script, but they're the same. And no matter what anyone could told me, I saw no differences between the characters, even if Angela Lansbury locks a little bit more crazy as Miss. Lovett, or Helena Carter more shy, it makes no sense, at the end, is the same character, no better, no worse (Helena prettiest, talk about it later).And don't even touch the Sweeney character, Johnny and George are uniques in the role. They both are the same demon barber at their own ways, even when George Hearn is already a tenor master and Johnny more like a rock stile (yeaa). They both really scared me, but i guess that the original creator owns the credits.Well I think that Deep did is best in this role and now he must be thinking in is next musical, definitely, he must cast for another one, he got skills. I'll be waiting for the next dark musical which I hear about, till then this is my very first choice and I hope that Burton made a sequel... (NO, just joking)",9,3,6,6 March 2008
Forrest Gump," RUN, FORREST!!! RUN!!! The Other #1
","I'd chose this movie the 'other number one' on my top, not because the Schindler List be better, only because I've already considered Schindler the best movie I have ever seen when I saw Forrest Gump.I'm not sure of how can I talk about how much I'd lean by watching this movie. This one was an inspiration to all my family, starring with my dad, that was the one who told me to sit up and watch it with him. The only thing I can say with out fear to mistake is that this is one of the few movies that I can sit and watch over and over and over and over again. I can easily say that I watch it over 100 times in the 2001.Its right now that I realize the hard work and the magnitude of the production of a movie like this.The Tom Hanks performance is the heart of the success of this movie. He create one of the most charming characters on the history. He lived the horrors that many suffer in that years tanks to the American ambition and trough is eyes everything looks just fine. Through his eyes everything seems so beautiful. The way Forrest live his life his kinda lesson to my own life.The movie itself is a wonder creation. This is the kind of Beautiful films that deserve the Best Picture Oscar and deserve to be remembered. The conflict between Forrest and Schindler will continue. Till then, I have two number one.Thats it.",10,1,3,21 July 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Every one should be right compadre!!!!
","Just like everyone said...This is a exceptional film.Made specially for the lovers of the speed,fight,drama,weapons,movies and... Spiderman???(short of). Bourne is definitely the best action character that I ever seen. Not just because he can fight,drive,maneuver or reason better than any other action hero , beside, he got something that I hasn't seen in another one, and thats could be possibly the humility. I mean, Jason is a murder but he doesn't want to be it anymore and thats why I love the drama of this and the other two Bourne movies.By other way,its true that the photography stile of the movie, just sometimes don't allows the audience to see the fight or race scenes, and even when is a great stile of shoot a movie, is really annoying to be moving your head like a maniac to see the action and YES... I drop a big guffaw of emotion in just a scene of the whole movie and that was when Bourne protects him self from Desh hits with a towel, but,in fact, I didn't watch a comic scene in this movie.But,beside that,there is nothing wrong in this movie and no-one really cleaver can refuse that. This is a terrific film and is obviously the best movies as the year so far and the best of the Bourne saga.Well, is the best and i think is really great but,personally, Im still loving more the Supremacy.And to conclude as I always said... I think that Paul wont hurt anyone if he chose to make one more Bourne movie...or two,or three, but he made something funny, he made a final that could be taking like a definitely closing, but also can be continued and still be perfect, so...Please...think about it Paul",9,0,1,31 October 2007
Van Helsing," really funny, exiting, scary and special film, with mean producers
","this film at the first sight as nothing special, but it is really kind of weird. the story lines is attractive and appropriate for the Count Dracula's fans. Is a truly awesome way to make an action-funny movie about such a legendary and told fight between Van Helsing and Dracula, and of course, the bound of the Frankenstein monster and the Wolfman to the story is a great contribution to the action, even if its not the best of the ideas, nor the most original idea, either. Thats for the Castlevania players, in which both of them, frank and wolf, make apparitions in various parts of the game. By the way, I was waiting for a mention about the Helsing-Belmont's clan relation, too. The most of the people that watched the movie with me didn't know about the long story between this two characters. And maybe thats why I fall in love with the big fight. I was waiting a lot of talking between them, and cross traps, and holly water spurts, like the Bram Stocker version (that is a great movie, too), but I had a truly good outcome, instead. Its a shame that the makers couldn't get more funds for best special effects, best costumes, best weapons and all that stuff. A project like that, must be very well done. But, otherwise, they got material for the next one, they got the mummy, the phantom of the opera, the hollow man,etc. they got the chance to make another good movie, and thats why I say YES TO VAN HELSING 2!!!!",8,1,1,1 March 2008
No Country for Old Men," Best Picture disappointing
","DAMN!!! I hate it and love it...OK...I love it...no, Hate it. Grrrr!!!!...Why????!!!OK I'm done. I just saw it, you know, the movies take a while to come out in Mexico, so don't blame me. I think I was over-exited with the Oscar and all that stuff. I don't have words to explain the feeling. DAMN!!! I just can tell that I miss the times when the movies had an end, and of course, when you don't have to read a book to know whats a movie talking about. Its a damn pretty good movie, with a pretty good script, but I am pretty sure that someone between all of you keep a pretty bad taste about this movie. Well, the movie was fine, but, its really the best movie in the 2007??? I mean, it got a good action, I was impressed with the naturalness of the action scenes and the credibility which one the actors perform the characters situations (When I say that I mean that the character act as I or anyone would act in a certain situation). The screenplay absorb you from the beginning and across the whole movie, but, WHAT HAPPEN THEN???? BUMMMMMMMmmmmm!!! the lights turn on and the projector stays black. You say: ¨Buuuuuhhh!!! the projector guy!!! don't sleep out!!!¨ but no, thats it. Its like if the Coens was running out of tape or film or whatever. What happen to everyone out there??? the wife? the murder? the money? the mafia? etc. And what was the Tommy Lee Jones character contribution to the drama beside of scrub it all for our hero Llewelyn??? Nothing!!! while you waiting that everything will be solved, thinking and waiting for the miracle that will never come. That turns it into an action movie, only, and that what I must think to like it.I say this is a good movie, but I keep think it as a disrespect. An ending like this just can mean a sequel or a jeer, who cares the book??? A movie must end bad or well but not stay unfinished.God, the Best Picture Oscar Winers were better in the past years isn't it????(Forrest Gump, Glatiator, Lord of the Rings, Beautiful Mind, Rocky, Platoon, etc.)",7,0,5,21 April 2008
The Number 23," great for smart people
","To be honest, when i first watched this movie I wasn't really focus on it. Thats why I didn't get it at all, but at the end I didn't lose the rhythm of the whole deal. If this isn't based on another idea, then i think this is the best screenplay I've read in this year. I don't know where did they get all those 23s but they really spend some time. Thats the deal with have nothing to do with your time, isn't? hehe...just kidding. Jim Carrey is a great dramatic actor, I'm a big fan but i've never watch a dramatic movie played by him, I usually watch him doing comedy, so he is another surprise . The ending was un-expected,too. In these days is very wear to find someone that takes the right chose in a movie",7,1,2,20 December 2007
Schindler's List," Spielberg's Best Movie. THE #1
","Its time to comment on one of the BEST films I've ever seen. The movie based on the real life's story about a Nasi guy, Mr. Oscar Schindler (Leam Nesson), who start to make money with the Jews in the infamous II War. With a ¨little¨ help of his finance man, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), not very happy with the idea, use the luck of the world and the situation of the German army to open a factory that pay almost nothing and get many money.As the time passing by the situation of the workers in factory get worst and worst, the Nasi army turn more violent and careless about the Jews, but Oscar Schindler keep watching them like people and feel the weight of the slaughter, specially by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) who treat the Jews like something less than animals.The deal is that the Schindler's factory, inadvertently, becomes a refuge and the mean of salvation for an entire community, and he tries, despairly, to get them out of the fire line.Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and a jewel in the films history. Spelberg brings the Schindler's List to life, the story of a man who got nothing and leave with everything.This is maybe the 5th Nasi story I've heard about, cause am not very interested in the whole Hitler's madness, who should have said it??? Up on the violence and the blood, there's a beautiful story of true power drived by compassion and humility. An action like this, weirdly, is inspired by suffering and the pain of a community, can not be seeing every day, but Schindler did it, and its showed like a daily act. Not like a saint but a defective and womanizer Nasi, and that's why its so charming and inspiriting.Leam Nesson is the chosed one to take you trough the Schindler's feelings in one of the most notables performances I've ever watch and so damn heartbreaking that made it so hard not to cry, serious.I'm pretty sure that if there wasn't Forrest Gump this would be the 1st, and it is, but I can't chose which one is best, thought. Otherwise, beside of being a Nasi movie, is the most beautiful movie I've ever watched, and a lesson to many people.",10,9,13,29 April 2008
The Mist," Very Well Done!!!
","Four reasons of why this is a very good thriller:Number one.- If you know Stephen King's works, you probably know that the man is crazy, so if you listen is name in a movie title, instantly, you can start to expect the worst for the characters, a lot of suspense and an entire-non-sleep-night, so, I wasn't surprised or disappointed. Number two.- I'm already sick of watching the modern thrillers, with stupid characters, stupid lines and stupid scenes... Here you gonna note that every character has is own reason to ruin the day (not the typical 'I'm going to walk into the darkness because I'm brave and stupid and nothing's gonna cut my head off' without a concrete explanation), here you gonna note true Screenplay. Number three.- It is a very scary, exiting and original story, that let you thinking for a while before you say 'WOW!!!'. I don't remember a King's novel that make me reflect as much as I did with this one, actually, I don't remember if anyone did. Number four.- Beside of being scary, bloody, weird, etc. I love the King's stile and I like the performances from this movie, specially Thomas Jane.My point is: Stephen King doesn't waste is time. If he want to scare you, he does; If he wan't someone thinking about the human cowardice, with-no-regrets, he does;If he want you awake all night long, he does. But he didn't do it with poorly written novels or stupid ideas, he didn't wrote horror just to sell books, he did it because he knows how to scare or call your attention and he take the time to search the for the right words to make you feel. He is the truly Master Of Horror!!! He don't play with you!!!",8,0,2,27 May 2008
The Dark Knight," .....And Christofer Nolan Give Us THE BATMAN!!!
","I wanna be fast, so lets get right to the point before I lose it again.Since I read the script from Memento, I'd already knew it: Christofer as the gift and he has future. On this one, he go over the score. He explode every possibility, in any sense and at all direction. In deed, this movie is all drama. May be is one of the fews action movies were I'm almost forgot the action cause I was very scared and fascinated, at the level that I didn't listen to my annoying friend nor his annoying brother nor my mind telling me ¨bathroom, please, give me one¨.CONCLUTIONS:1-IMPORTANT: watch out the kind of theater you chose to see this movie. Because its a dark movie and its very probably that the projector could make it twice darker than the normal. 2-In my case, I'd learn that the most of the Mexican fathers don't give a damn about what kind of movies are they taking to their children in. I mean, I was completely astonished by watching the Jokers madness. Just think in the poor creatures. 3-Its very sad that Heath Ledger couldn't be alive to receive with his own hands the Oscar that he deserves for his performance as the Joker. He was unrecognizable, like if they pay a truly maniac to film him working. Ledger let us one legacy, enjoy it.4-Nolan is one of the most promising leaflets in the big screen achievements and I hope that big things come from him. I think he is only beginning his career, but hes doing great so far. So keep the good work. 5-Harvey Dent story just break my heart. I didn't watch it come. Aaron Eckhart is a genuine actor, too. At the very level of Christian Bale.Even if they over do some scenes, every moment in the movie was very exiting (in the good sense), tanks, again, to the music department for do his homework. I'm possibly exaggerating or its just the best movie in the year so far and if right now The Dark Knight is the #1 on the IMDb top, then I'm in favor, 'cuz its fair, and I hope it prevails there (when the right movie comes, you must let the Goodfather go). You're paying for three hours of pure quality. I'll be going to watch it once more the next week.",9,1,4,20 July 2008
Shooter," No, this is really worst than what i thought !!!
","I buy this movie to see some nice guns, you know, I'm a sniper riffle lover (not a killer,lo juro) and in that way I was satisfy, Mark use a good variety of nice guns...mmmhhAnd respect to the movie. Well, I'm sure of know what was the directors objective making this movie and I don't really care if its part of the real life in USA, I actually hate this movie. Mark give a good performance of Bob Lee, but the screenplay was just a mess, because is nothing real or convincing. I don't know if everything was part of the original story, but I couldn't enjoy the drama at any moment. The action sequences in some cases wake me up but, even that parts where pointless and illogical.The screenplay was really poorly written.Whatever, the ending was the worst of the movie. All the characters lose their credibility...If were any. Everithing else was really boring or maybe I didn't understand (just maybe) but much things stay without explanation....But if you like the riffles watch this movie's variety. It Rocks !!!",3,2,5,2 November 2007
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Bay Could Be A Good Director
","The sad thing is, Bay has something others directors work out for years (even decades) to get: means. He gets what he needs, because investors know he sells thickets. So, when you hear about Bay and Spielberg, one can assure there WILL be something extraordinary going on. You will buy and people will be paying Bay for a merely entertaining moment and an absolute mess of a story. That's what I saw yesterday. There were big robot monsters exhilaratingly killing themselves in confrontations better even than the ones seen on the first one and the second one. There's where I found some kind of relief for my money. The amazing hand to hand combat seen on the first movie was better this time, as I found the most of the Autobots were involved this time in close combat sequences against a giant army of invader Decepticons. I met Dino, Sideswipe, Que and other Transformers from which my favorites were Soundwave and Ratchet. This time, is about one spaceship that crashed on the Earth's Moon in the ages of Kennedy. Therefore, the first step of mankind on our natural satellite (one of the biggest achievements in history) was not even for the sake of science, but a race between the U.S. NASA and the Russian aerospace intelligence to reach the ship and find out what's inside of it. The NASA won, but not much was the prize, only the location of the spaceship. Years later, after a mission in the Middle-Eastern (which has no relation, to me, with the context; just a mere reason to kill Iranians) and a visit to the ruins of the nuclear central in Chernobyl, Ukraine (my God: Russians needing Americans for research), Optimus Prime (Cullen) found some kind of proof of what the space mission was all about in the first place. The spaceship, The Ark, is the rest place of an old buddy named Sentinel Prime (Nimoy), the master of the actual leader of the Autobots. He left Cybertron in the middle of the war and took with him 'something' that could have given the Autobots the victory: pillars, hundreds of them. He got lost in space to hide those pillars and, after he crashed on the Moon, he locked himself inside the ship with five of them. The pillars are means of transportation which can be used by Transformers to bring troops to this world and, in Decepticon hands, they could be very dangerous, so it is imperative to keep them away from Megatron (Weaving) and his brand new band of robot-fellas, along Shockwave (Welker) and his giant robot-worm-pet, Soundwave (also Welker) with his scary robot-vulture-pet (Awesome!), and Starscream with his usual cowardice. Decepticons go after those pillars.The story with the Autobots and Decepticons is poor, but should work alone if it were. There goes Sam Wickity (LaBeouf) again, but this time with the hyper-sensual Carly (Huntington-Witheley) instead of Megan Fox (Bay is a man of word) covering the role of his hot girlfriend. The lucky guy keeps his supermodel in a ruined store and she lives on with his love, cause he still looking for job. She works in a male's paradise and has a female's paradise (and even some non-female) of a boss, Dylan (Dempsey), the guy who cares for her so much to give her a Mercedes (hell of a car), while Sam has a substitute of his Bumble Bee (joke of a car). I had seen this kind of treats, where the girl rather to be with the deprived guy even thought there is a rich (powerful) and handsome guy who falls for her, but this is way too much. It is just ludicrous. Dylan does a deal for Sam to get a shot in a cars company, where seemingly isn't any possible way of a quality standard (or human real emotions). There is where Sam meets a marked guy (Jeong) who has information about something the Decepticons cares so much to send robot-mercenaries to take human lives off At this level, the script is very complicated (not complex) without the characteristically absurd jokes Bay always frequents in his movies. Yes, there are a lot of them in this movie, tons of them. So much, that anyone can begin to doubt about the credibility of every single character. And there, exactly there is where Michael Bay fails every time. Sexy and uninterested supermodel girlfriend; rich Simons with gay butler; armed ex soldiers surviving the fall of a building. Those are affairs that would probably build a good plot each one in a different and separate movie, but in one single movie all of them could be (and they ARE) a complete and irrevocable mess; one that not even all the fights of big robots from all the galaxies would compensate. As the time passed by, I started to think about the Island. If there ever was a movie that made me feel the progress of a director in the matter of legibility it was his Island. McGregor and Johansson provide real emotions, real dialogs and even an amazing change of personality in the same movie But that was then. No real emotions in this movie. No real dialog Somehow, I know Bay don't want to be a real director. He does his own movies, I know that, but he doesn't take it seriously. He's like a child, a big child that sells thickets and makes movies appear good with exaggerated takes and freezing sequences. Fancy style is what it is. But, as long as he keeps selling, he won't change. If, in some way, I found this movie better than the second one is because the return of the body combat. But both movies are despicable, and if I had known that before I wouldn't have left myself to be tightened by the first movie to see all the other movies in theaters.",4,3,8,5 July 2011
