Lucky Number Slevin," A Sin City Style Kickass Movie
","I went into this film thinking yeah that trailer looks great but not actually knowing what it was about despite reading summarys. To my surprise this film was more graphic, more plot and more exceptional than i could have thought.This film keeps u on ur feet until the end, we thought we had the film sussed from the trailer, then again half way through the film, but no - the film didn't unfold the true plot until the end.I recommend this film to anybody that thinks the trailer looks good or likes Josh Hartnet or Bruce Willis. And Naturally any Sin City fan.Acting - Great Plot - Great Cinematography - Great OST - Didn't really notice it, but I'm sure it was great. Anything other factors - Great",9,6,17,25 February 2006
