Alien 3," A fair would-be conclusion to a classic trilogy.
","David Fincher ('Se7en,' 'The Game') put his own unique film-making style to work here in the supposed last installment of the 'Alien' trilogy. Fincher's darker, grittier look makes for an interesting change of scenery as Ellen Ripley fights to destroy the alien creature one last time. Many disregarded this film, due to the lack of Cameron style action and emotion. However, this films real emotion derives from sheer exhaustion on Ripley's part, therefore exhausting the audience as well. She never seems to fully rid herself of the alien terror or keep any of her friends alive. Although we never really feel too much for the 'reformed' ex-cons, we do feel sorrow and sympathy for Ripley and her never-ending battle for survival. But unfortunately, that is all we feel. There is no hope or triumph. No celebration or sense of victory when the credits roll. Anyone who enjoys Fincher's cinematography will find this film interesting, to say the least. 'Alien3' is a well made, wonderfully choreographed film, but sadly, mediocre as a 'conclusion' to the Alien saga.",Null,0,3,8 June 1999
Aliens," Sci-fi classic masterpiece on all accounts.
","Another James Cameron masterpiece that brings out the full potential of the 'Alien' saga with a whirlwind of fear, excitement, terror and heartache. I heartily recommend the newly released to VHS/DVD 'Aliens: Director's Cut' to anyone even remotely interested in the 'Alien' films. The cut scenes, restoring the 'Ripley's daughter' element, add so much more emotion to an already wonderful film. While all four 'Alien' films are very well made, 'Aliens' tops them all and belongs on any sci-fi fan's video or DVD shelf.",Null,0,0,8 June 1999
