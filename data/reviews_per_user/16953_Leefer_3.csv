Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Who?
","I am going to say it...people were yawning around me! Yes it's true and all you Star Wars fans know it. I wanted to love this movie so much. I have waited for 16 years for this. I feel that this is a movie in search of an audience. Lucas failed to identify his market, is it for kids? (12 year old boys?) as he said. Is it for adults, like myself, why then the insufferable Jar Jar Binks? This character is a pale shade to Chewie! (who never talked this pseudo Jamaican accent.) The best comedy relief came from R2 and C3PO and it was so brief! (pardon the pun) I thought they didn't know each other? How could a mother let her boy go with a strange man so easily? You mothers out there, would you do that? OK that's enough complaining. The visual effects were incredible, the pod racer was stunning. The light saber fight was interesting (but growing tired). Don't send me hate e-mail. I am a bigger Star Wars fan than you think. I guess I just have high expectations.",6,0,1,22 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Six for the visuals
","The effects and visuals were a+ but overall it was rather boring. The writing was so melodramatic and the acting was sub par as usual. I also found the editing a little rigid. No real flare or pace to it. I also was disappointed with the way he (Lucas)basically threw away Padames character. When did she get so dumb? The way that Anakin switches to the dark side is also very weak. He is also not to bright for the so-called 'chosen one'. And then all these 'powerful' Jedi's get assassinated without any trouble at all.George next time please hire a writer and give up a little control, please! Thank God that the sequels are finally over and Lucas can stop making movies without any checks and balances.",6,2,3,28 May 2005
Hart's War," Boring, 2 out of 10
","I lost track of how many times I looked at my watch to see how much time remained in this movie. I even got the DVD box out to try and find out how long the film was. Then, fortunately, I discovered that my new DVD player has a time remaining feature. So, by then it was almost finished. I'm going to try the book...",Null,0,1,1 July 2003
