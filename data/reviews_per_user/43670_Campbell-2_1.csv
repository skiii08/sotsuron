The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Hype
","The movie is akin to an aborter romantic encounter.  Where was the payoff? I felt the tension, I wanted to be truly frightened, but the film was mired in its own profane freneticism.  I was more entertained by the Sci-Fi channel's Blair Witch Infomercial.  I heard the grumbles after the house lights went up, I know there are others who think this film was lame.  Where was the so-called 'last shot worth the entire price of admission' that Harry Knowles claimed would haunt me forever?Artisan films, I want my money and my time back.",1,1,4,2 August 1999
