The Blair Witch Project," Ingenious or just dumb luck?
","OK people.  Let's stop throwing tomatoes at each other and face the simple fact of society.  We all like to see something different.  Something unexpected.  The Blair Witch Project provides just that, just like Titanic brought us unparalleled graphics, just like Jaws put us in the jaws of the shark, just like Star Wars made spaceships seem so real.  The incredible thing about this movie is that it did so in such a basic and inexpensive way.Some of you may remember hearing about how the 'weed whacker' was invented by a guy who constructed a prototype from an electric motor and an empty can of Pringles, or the guy who invented the windshield shade from a folded up piece of cardboard.Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have done precisely the same thing for the movie industry.  Society has gotten bored with multi-million dollar graphics that make things so real on the screen, it looks more impressive than scary. We're tired of seeing actors that look too good to be true (and in most cases are).  We want to be 'effected,' not 'impressed.'  If you weren't effected in the least by The Blair Witch Project, you need to have your pulse checked, or your brain scanned for activity.",Null,1,2,11 August 1999
