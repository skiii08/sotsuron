The Blair Witch Project," O Lucky Day . . .
",". . . that midnight Sundance screening was right on target, and the money! Talk about being in the right place at the right time!  With just the right audience, venue, and advance p/r . . . not to mention the hour, with already a film-weary, vulnerable audience in the wee-hours of the morning . . . this 'student' film hit its mark! Scaring the jeebies out of and shaking that audience, the movie makers signed a lucrative distributor contract by daybreak the next morning . . . and the rest is history!  If only there was a real film here to stand the test of time.  Alas, but a year later, with the faddish word-of-mouth and website generated hoopla faded, what's left?  A pretty ordinary looking experimental film which rather limps along unevenly, then builds up a bit of steam as it reaches its quizzical end.  Not much of a contribution to film history, this indie production must go down as a masterpiece of marketing and of latching onto public gossip. Faddish to a fault, it's really the 'cinematic pet rock' which took advantage of its p/r potential, culminating with a Time Magazine cover story.  More power to all participants in the BWP!",1,1,3,15 April 2000
Saturday Night Fever," This Was It . . .
",". . . the flick that made 'John Travolta,' a household name. Looking at this late 70s film in 2002, it's easy to see why this happened.'Saturday Night Fever' offers an extremely impressive 'guido' type characterization by Travolta. He's not only got the handsome Italianesque features (complete with clef chin) great bod and sensual manner, but also displays brilliant disco dancing and strong acting skills. 
Travolta's solid work dominates a film which, unfortunately is a mixed bag. Great 70s music, pulsating disco scenes, and a potential paean to teen under-achievers, is mildly defeated by a director and editor with apparently limited abilities or vision.Director John Badham allows the film to fall apart, as Editor David Rawlins sloppily cuts, splices and fades in odd manners.  True, the original version is much more coherent (and the ten minutes excised in an attempting a PG rating further undermines its continuity).But Writers Nik Cohn and Norman Wexler also seem to run out of steam, not quite knowing just where they want their story to go, or exactly what kind of statement they want to make.  The result is more murky confusion than inventive surprise, and the viewer is left with decidedly mixed feelings.It's interesting to note that, to date, 'Saturday Night Fever' represents Travolta's career peak.  Not that he hasn't tried in a long line of subsequent films, and one appreciates his hard-working efforts (with his total career being financially very successful).  Still, his work in this film has guaranteed that the name, 'Travolta,' is forever enshrined in the annals of Hollywood history.",4,5,12,2 September 2002
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Sports Metaphors and Mystique
","Robert Redford seems to have a thing about sports.  It's more than just a game to him, but rather some sort of portal seeking the essence of what life has to offer.In 'Downhill Racer' (1969) actor Redford engaged the craft of skiing to achieve metaphysical heights; in 'A River Runs Through It' (1998) director Redford likened the activity of fly fishing to something of a profoundly spiritual nature; now in 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' producer director Redford discovers the secret of overcoming adversity through the challenge of golf an ultimate peak experience.  While it's pretty hard to fathom where hurling one's self down a ski slope as being akin to a state of grace, or where killing fish enhances one's spirituality, in 'Beggar Vance' finding one's 'authentic stroke' makes more sense in aligning it to discovering the secret of mastery.
The story's idea that seeking perfection in sports can lead to clarifying one's true life values emerges as completely noteworthy.  The mystique of Will Smith's caddy is intriguing from an idealistic perspective; the same goes for Matt Damon's once-promising golfer trying to recapture the skill of his youth--only to find that it must be recreated.In the case of each of the above films, it helps considerably if the viewer already likes the respective sports. The films themselves don't do an especially great job of winning fans.  It must be said, though, that one may become intrigued at Matt Damon's Rannulph Junnah who, after over a 15-year period of combat fighting in World War I, and thereafter living in seclusion while drinking heavily, still looks like a fresh college junior. The film in this regard seems more like an paean to discovery of the elixir of youth. If you're an avid golfer, or loving spectator, 'Bagger Vance' might have special meaning. Otherwise, it might be a bit of uneven going.Smith, Damon and entire cast all give highly creditable performances.",6,3,6,1 September 2001
Vertigo," Hanging Thread
","During Det. Scottie Ferguson's first day of tailing Madeleine Elster, she goes up the steps into the McKiptrick Hotel, after parking her car.A few moments later she's clearly seen pulling up the shade in the corner room of the second floor.When Ferguson goes in the hotel lobby within seconds, the hotel landlady insists she's been at the front desk all the while and that no one's entered the building.To prove it, she takes Ferguson up to the room in question, to find no one there.  He looks out the window to find Madeleine's parked car gone . . .
Intriguing stuff, to be sure.  Trouble is, neither Writer Pierre Boileau nor Director Alfred Hitchcock come back to this perplexing point again.  It's an incident never referred to, never explained, and treated like it never happened.  Yet it is important, in a good mystery writing, that all loose ends be tied together at some point.  True, 'red herrings' are sometimes employed, but they must make sense within themselves while cleverly throwing the viewer off. But not like this.  An ultimately serious flaw in an otherwise well constructed and executed script.",Null,1,3,2 February 2004
Chinatown," Arresting Mystery
","Roman Polanski enjoyed his best film since his 'Rosemary's Baby' with 'Chinatown.'  An extremely intricate, well conceived crime thriller scripted by Robert Towne and Polanski, this film is reminiscent of (or pays tribute to) a number of cinematic predecessors.John Huston, who has a key role here, enjoyed his own great directorial success with 'The Maltese Falcon,' and in 'Chinatown,' the hero (played by Jack Nicholson in a Sam Spade/Phillip Marlow role) engages in a bit of deja vu with Faye Dunaway toward the end.  Nicholson phones the cops in the presence of Dunaway, then begs her to tell him the truth about her spurious 'alabi' before the fuzz arrives. It's a situation directly from the Huston film (when Humphrey Bogart acts out an identical scenario with Mary Astor). 
Dunaway played the same type character here as six years earlier in 'The Thomas Crown Affair,' and obviously did it so well that 'Thomas Crown' served as a shoe-in for her casting in 'Chinatown.'  Polanski's 'semi-subjective camera' honors Robert Mongomery's pioneer work in 'Lady in the Lake' (1947) as the viewer closely follows the action from the left shoulder of Nicholson as he craftily solves the mystery web.
An unusual score with sharp percussive strikes in the low piano register, balanced with a cool trumpet and strings, embroider the soundtrack, and lending an air of both suspense and sophistication to the ambience.
The business about private vs government controlled power and water seems a bit complex to fully fathom in a single viewing; still, the impression is that all the pieces of this involved puzzle fit together--the result of very crafty writing.The result is a film that holds up well despite it's forthcoming quarter century anniversary.  This quality piece of work didn't go unrecognized by either critics or public, and it remains an audience favorite occupying a respectable place on most 'all time best' lists.",Null,1,3,14 July 2002
Erin Brockovich," Of Boobs and Barbs
","'What makes you think you can just walk in there [public utility records office] and find anything we need?' inquires attorney Ed Masry.  Replies Erin Brockovich: 'They're called boobs, Ed.'  So it goes in this dramatic enactment of an allegedly true-life-based story. Just where facts leave off, however, and creative writing begins, may be another matter.Is it possible that an entire community near a large utility company can be duped by that company into believing that the widespread health challenges being faced by that community are in no way related to the company's toxic waste?  Even when that company is paying the medical expenses of certain community residents?  Is there something we don't know about civic awareness in this informed era that such a situation could exist with nary a citizen even remotely beginning to suspect there's something amiss?  No matter: in steps Eric Brockovitch armed, not only with persuasive physical endowments and sharp tongue, but also a quick mind and wit, to help bring this shocking situation to light and down this insidious company. Since Julia Roberts portrays Erin, the role is written to utilize Robert's uniquely hip, no-nonsense persona.  She makes a striking presence and commands attention and empathy with her skillful portrayal.After spending half the film recovering from the astonishment of the paunchy, aged appearance of once-handsome Albert Finney, we found his attorney Ed Masry to be an effective partner of research assistant Erin. Aaron Eckhart--as romantic interest, blue collar hippie, George--is almost unrecognizable from his starched white-collar, 'Chad,' of 'In the Company of Men' (which skyrocketed this enormously versatile actor to fame).The DVD-formatted version offers mini-interviews with both the film's director and Erin Brockovitch herself, lending credibility to the story's legal assertions. However, it's clear this film is not a documentary, and only through committed personal research can one uncover the true facts regarding this fascinating and significant class-action litigation of a multi-billion dollar utility company.It's a story which affects us all.",7,0,1,17 November 2000
Fight Club," Releasing Frustrations
","'The Fight Club' attempts to dramatize the frustrations of modern man caught up in routine and unfulfilling jobs . . . and ways in which this 'pent-up steam' can be released through violent male bonding.Unfortunately, the scripters got caught up in their own outrageous creations, taking their points to an ultimate extreme and ridiculous conclusion.Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter all give admirable performances.",4,1,4,26 April 2001
As Good as It Gets," 'An A for Effort'
","Comedy acting is difficult, but not nearly as much as comedy writing.  For that reason I tend to give special appreciation to comedy efforts.  We need laughs in our lives, and I certainly want to encourage projects in which humor plays a part. 'As Good As It Gets' features comedy, along with drama and romance. Jack Nicholson heads a hard-working cast in a script that tries hard to be successful. It has some humorous moments, some emotional ones, and some bland ones.  Part of the difficulty is in the calculation of timing by the director (and editor).  Generally the style is 'slow moving comedy' and it works a little more than half of the time. How one reacts to this depends on the individual; for myself, I found it generally interesting, laughed often, and became aware of its duration. So I personally give it a slightly above average score, and a hearty 'A' for the sincere attempt at creating a light entertainment with some subtle dramatic nuances.",5,1,6,21 April 1999
Citizen Kane," Welles's Masterpiece
","Orson Welles really put one over on RKO executives  through clever distraction and manipulation in the making of 'Citizen Kane.'  He made history by creating a true art film by using the Hollywood system.The trouble was, 'Kane' was simply over the heads of the mass audience at the time, and the film didn't make the profit the studio expected.  The total result severely injured Welles' reputation, and inhibited his future ability to work freely and without inhibition--necessary requirements of the true artist. The real-life scenario of Welles' being beckoned to South America to create a US 'propoganda movie,' was undoubtedly a pay-back to private funders, who had granted Welles the addditional monies needed to finish 'Kane,' but which place Welles in a vulnerable position of future obligation.With the debacle of 'It's All True,' the Pan-American project, which was parallel to the unauthorized studio hacking of 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' the dye of destiny was cast: it would be an uphill career struggle for this artist through the rest of his life.Nowhere in the annals of film history is there so great a tragic figure as that of Orson Welles, whose genius deserved as fine a working environment as possible.  Alas, the distored values of the motion picture industry is the culprit; likewise, the blame is extended to big business in general, with its primary objective being almost perversely profit-oriented.As the years pass, the great work of Welles will undoubtedly escalate in appreciation.  Come to think of it, isn't that the case with so many genuine artists of history and their creations? In the meantime, let us continue to discover and uncover the subtleties of a great artwork, 'Kane.'",10,5,8,30 June 2001
The Birth of a Nation," Split Personality
","I see a remarkable similarity between the personality of composer Richard Wagner and the director David Work Griffith, pariticularly as it applies to 'Birth of a Nation.' Both have the capacity of creative technical and even emotion genius, while at the same time, a penchant for prejudice and bigotry. What makes their work so difficult to judge is that it tends to slip in and out of sickness subtlely and surprisingly.  Their genius has the power to draw one into its fold, then manipulate one's emotions to its pleasure. Having gotten the viewer hooked into its context, it weaves its clever, overpowering spell of persuasion.Their is very little to uplift the spirits here, to make one feel good about one's self, not to mention one's fellow beings.  Where is the love and celebration of life as it's to be lived?  Where is the joy of this precious gift to be on this planet, enjoying its richess?  Where is the embracing of each and every human being who is our brother and sister, and trying to empower them to reach their full potential?I see none of that here, only a lugubrious attitude of hatred, superiority, and downright fear.  Parallels between the work of Leni Riefenstahl and her 'Triumph of the Will' and 'Birth of a Nation' are not without validity.
This work will forever be a contridiction, and there is no hope in making it better.  We can only strive to separate its technical achievements from its low-level mentality -- or avoid the work altogether.",1,18,42,27 May 2000
Memento," What the . . . ?
","Poor Lenny.  Or is it Leonard he likes to be called?  Dunno.  I've got a short-term memory when it comes to this turkey.  In order to care about a character or situation, I first must feel something for them.  The way Guy Pearce mumbled through his lines, he seemed drugged on downers and quite bored by the whole matter. In order to get my brain working to figure out this patchwork quilted scenario, I first must have some interest in what's going on.  During the period I lasted before fleeing into the night, I didn't care much who killed the wife, why she was killed or, for that matter, how those three kitty-claw scratches got on our doldrum hero's face. Maybe it was his house tom-cat in heat, after all.",2,5,10,28 May 2001
Ed Wood," Fun Flick
","Tim Burton's satirical tribute to Ed Wood here obviously paved the way for Bill Condon's more serious biopic four years later on James Whale ('Gods and Monsters'). Burton created a rather weird atmosphere for his entire opus, through eerie black and white photography, spooky soundtrack, offbeat camera angles and movements, and Martin Landau's mesmerizing impersonation of Bela Lugosi. Great date flick for the college crowd, that'll dig Wood's unusual wardrobe preferences, along with other Burton hip references. Johnny Depp does himself proud--all bright, chipper and optimistic--young man in love with movie making, no matter what.  And the thought of a no-retake approach to shooting is a hoot.'Great, wrap it, on to Scene 54! . . . '",Null,0,0,17 February 2004
The Beach," Potentially Interesting Theme
","'I settled in and found my vocation--the pursuit of pleasure,' shares Leonardo DiCaprio's Richard, shortly after arriving at his dream vacation spot: 'the beach.'  The trouble with this thesis is it is ultmiately an unsatisfying goal.  Vacations and parties must end sometime, and work begin.      As surely as human nature seems to require both projects and play in equal measure, life skewed toward recreation alone is bound to become a boring and unfulfilling existence.  This state can lead to dire consequences and may even point the way toward tragedy. Novelist Alex Garland and writing assistant John Hodge try to depict this in a quite dramatic screenplay.   Somewhere along the way, however, the essential theme got lost, and one may leave a viewing of 'The Beach' wondering what was its actual purpose.       Deleted scenes included in the DVD format surprisingly help to clarify some thematic features missing from the finished narrative.  Likewise, key character profiles, like those of Robert Carlyle's Daffy gain better understanding through these cut scenes.       As the writers' objectives seem basically sincere, it's too bad this narrative fails in its loftier expressive aims.  Utlizing inherent creative urges appear an important aspect of our satisfaction, and that encompasses a good deal more than what 'the beach' alone can ever provide.  ###",5,0,1,31 July 2000
The Best Years of Our Lives," An Excellent Film
","In a film as successful as this, it is difficult to single out any one factor. All departments work in perfect union to create on of the most moving human dramas ever put on film.  The production is a tribute to the ensemble efforts of the writers, producer, cast and crew.  To name but a few, the magnificent score of Hugo Friedhofer is a subliminal marvel, the subtle yet striking photography of Greg Toland, and the unbelievably effective direction by William Wyler all combine with an ideal cast to create an American classic.The DVD format version is a special treat to view.  What a pleasure to see 'The Best Years of Our Lives' so beautifully preserved for generations to come to enjoy.",10,9,10,22 December 2000
Glory," Distorted Perspective
","Military intelligence is inherently unbalanced to begin with; its logic is based on a fundamental untruth: that there is something out there waiting to overtake us, to overthrow us, to annihilate us. So we must have defense, and we must fight for our just cause. And our cause is always just.  It has to be, because it is ours. No matter that everyone else's cause is also just and right. Thus throughout history of so-called civilization we have right people with right causes fighting enemies made up of bad people with wrong causes. Into this Pandora's box 'Glory' may be found. That its sanctimoniousness is trenchantly presented does not elevate it from the truths, half truths and fallacies which comprise all such genre works. It's like looking at a city from afar versus being in the city itself. From the outside one can see its context; from within, only its interior.  I failed to appreciate the valor and heroism expressed in 'Glory,' finding its consciousness as skewed as other works of this genre. Which is to admit as to the inherent danger of drama, its essence being conflict.",3,12,48,17 March 1999
Forrest Gump," A Long, Difficult Journey
","'Forrest Gump' failed to 'grab' me from the outset. I kept wondering throughout what was its point: are we to float through life like a feather, barely being able to comprehend its meaning? Nothing which transpired did I find uplifting or involving. Indeed, it was one of the longest, most tedious journeys I've taken in a film.  Its merits to me are its technology, and not much more.",2,5,14,8 March 1999
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Sagas of Suffering
","As Bernadette Soubirous' story proposed suffering as a kind of pre-requisite to spiritual salvation, so Jeanne d'Arc's saga suggests a similar prospect. 
Whatever transpired in that remote village of Lourdes, public response widely bought into the concept of struggle as a requirement of genuine grace.  'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' dramatizes what was historically one of period phenomena, that of stalwart spiritualists facing the flames rather than denounce their voices and visions. So effective have been the various painters, playwrights and filmmakers in fashioning artworks based on these tales, that people have been profoundly influenced into tragically fallacious thinking. Such concepts are best laid to rest, along with ancient relics and rituals. They are as tired and worn as medieval self-flagellation whips and shackles.It's a new day of enlightenment, where we don't have to seek out gurus, soothsayers, or miracle healers.  We also don't have to buy into past mythology, no matter how persuasively it may be presented.As for myself, Mr. Dreyer's opus is one I personally shy away from with its dubiously downbeat message in the same manner that I avoid Gustav Dore's disfunctional lithographs of Dante's 'Purgatorio.'",Null,2,12,13 July 2003
Notting Hill," Nice Romantic Comedy
","Leave it to those Brits for mastering wry humor.  Reminiscent of some of the early Alec Guinness comedies in timing and tone, 'Notting Hill' strikes just the right amorous notes in this modern day farce.  Julia Roberts, looking lovely, and Hugh Grant, oozing charm, breeze through this lightweight, contrived but cozy romp with ease.  The two create a pleasant rapport, and the entire time spent in this engaging English community is delightfully diverting.  Makes one want to quench one's thirst with a spot of tea.",7,0,0,8 August 2000
The Bourne Identity," Compilation Thriller
","Matt Damon's character here seems to be built a bit upon both his earlier Will Hunting and Tom Ripley personas.  Talented, clever, skillful and adaptable, Damon's hero manages to glide with ease through this rather elaborate action yarn. However, there's sneaky suspicion that a lot of this has been seen before. It plays like a compilation of bits and pieces from other scenarios, without having either a distinctive point of view or making an original statement.Thus we have a great car chase through the city, various assassins and kickass encounters popping up periodically to shake things a bit and, of course, an inevitable romance in the midst of such hair-raising happenings.We also have a lead actor who, despite his still somewhat unformed, sqeaky clean image, manages to invest such commitment to his work that we tend to go along with him.  It's partly natural charisma and partly strong dedication to his projects that project into the theater.With deficits detracting from assets, we end with a plus/minus drama of lost identity amidst strategic unfoldment.  Viewers' responses will probably likewise tend toward wide division with 'The Bourne Identity.'",Null,0,1,20 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Gargantuan Escapism
","'The Lord of the Rings' initial entry has a negligible vibrational ring.  It tends to add nothing particularly significant to our lives, other than gargantuan distraction. Its value seems akin to those of comic books, only with a mega-budget backing; its cultural contribution appears more equal to those of video parlor games; and while there's nothing intrinsically harmful with such dallying, there's also nothing especially great in which to revel. 
What's more concerning about all this hoopla is the seriousness to which its attended, from its almost obscene budget size, to the deep dedication invested by its over-sized production team.  Like the 'Star Wars,' for which the great Sir Alec Guiness was tagged to add a dollop of class to those proceedings, so Ian McKellan now follows down that bony path with 'Rings.'
While Sir Ian may have fulfilled his thespian dreams for world-wide recognition; just what accomplishment has it offered to his career and reputation as a great actor may be another matter.  Only he (and his more serious followers) can come to grips with that. This first entry of 'Rings' left me, frankly, cold.  I experienced little or no concern for characters nor respective their plights.  And while I presume the production company's digital wizardry might become more impressive and even startling as the series progresses, I've had no special motivation to revisit either this terrain or its inhabitants again.",Null,2,3,22 March 2004
The Caine Mutiny," Standing Test of Time
","For a nearly fifty year old film, this one is remarkably compelling and engrossing. With a beautiful production design by Rudolph Sternad, striking cinematography by Franz Planer, solid direction by Edward Dmytryk, and a rousing score by Max Steiner, 'The Caine Mutiny' is a winner.Further, it's one of Humphrey Bogart's finest hours, with his Lt. Cmdr. Queeg absolutely riveting and unforgettable. Not far behind is one of Fred McMurray's most noteworthy pieces of work, with his Lt. Keefer a truly tragic, memorable portrait. Rounding out the excellent cast is E. G. Marshall, Jose Ferrer and Van Johnson, all rendering fine performances. The DVD restoration is bright, sharp and wonderfully vibrant.

American Beauty," Cool Reaction
","'American Beauty' frankly left me cool, unmoved, and repelled by its essence.  There seemed something sickly about its basic conceit, something off balance and disturbed.  While the quality of the acting and production was at a high level, the core of this work seemed unhealthy, exploitative, and overbaked. While there is room for exposing the homogonized and more sober aspects of suburbia, 'American Beauty,' in a quest to make itself more competitive with other versions of the truth, tended to exaggerate its own emphasis. The result is a film which can be more appreciated for what it tries to accomplish than what it actually does.",5,1,2,29 March 2000
The Exorcist," Audience Reaction Helps
","It's said that one thing which enhanced Hitchcock's now famed 10:00 a.m. 'Psycho' premiere in New York was the extreme audience reaction of shock.Like viewers' laughter for comedy, horror films often depend upon audience screams, gasps and general 'anxiety vibes' which sweep through the house.
Certainly such was the case for 'The Exorcist' when it first made its showings back in '73. It's impossible to re-create that reaction today and part of the film's initial success was how effective Friedkin (like Hitchcock) was able to manipulate his audience. It's constantly intriguing how each audience tends to take on a personality of its own (watch a film several times in a theater and note how variable and distinctive the reaction becomes from each group.Thus, when one sits alone today to watch a DVD, it's a world of difference from those initial screenings of 'The Exorcist' in the 70s, when folks were experiencing it for the first time. Friedkin's film has held up pretty well, thanks to his painstaking production values.  But true impact of 'The Exorcist' is forever part of filmgoers' past history. A hard-working cast was apparently pushed to the breaking point to finish this production, which ran way overtime.  Like many tortuous film shoots, the extra effort has paid off, making 'The Exorcist' one of the top films in the horror genre.",Null,2,3,28 October 2003
Gone with the Wind," Less Sting, but Still Windy
","The facts speak for themselves: a (to date) 62-year-old film; one of the all-time best box office grossers; enjoyed five major theatrical releases, including wide-screen versions; VHS, laser disc, and now DVD transfers--and three major restorations.  Folks are still talking about it: debating its value-- agreeing, disagreeing, agreeing in part but taking exceptions... It's quite a work that David O. Selznick and his superb production company fashioned. 
On the purely technical achievement side, there's almost unanimous consent that the film is a historical milestone. After that, opinions are beginning to vary.There's evidence that some folks today aren't quite as smitten by it as in the 40's through, say, the 60's.  They're beginning to take note of some of the sociological implications, as the narrative is told from the perspective of the land-owner/slave-owner/ruling/upper  class.  The narrative begs the audience to identify and empathize with this aristocratic echelon, and to see the beauty and grace of this society through the land owner's eyes.Well, some folks aren't completely buying that perspective any more. They're starting to think about the sweat, tears, and broken lives upon which this aristocracy has built its so-called genteel world.  They're also beginning to embrace characters and situations untold here -- while applauding such efforts as Alice Randall's 2001 spinoff/parody ('The Wind Done Gone') to at least help set records straight.  Of course, there are many tales told from the perspective of the ruling class, whose power has come from the enslavement and domination of others. So it really depends upon how the viewer tends to see things.  One has a feeling, though, that GWTW will continue to be viewed with an increasingly suspicious eye, as years pass.  There's also a feeling that it will remain a 'classic,' being a genuine marking point in cinematic history as to how films were made.  It's technical influence is still felt today, and many audience members are still captivated by the total sweep and power of its superb production values.So, the Wind's still heartily blowing, and there's every indication it will continue to do so for some time to come.",1,44,103,3 August 2001
Man on the Moon," Fine Performance in Fair Film
","Andy Kaufman fell into the same 'trap' as did Harry Houdini--having to 'top one's self' with every performance. It just can't be done.
Like many excessive talents (Garland and Jolson come immediately to mind) such quests lead to career burnouts and fast trips to the morgue.
No matter how much the audience may scream and holler for more, the solo performer must hold back. It's a technique and lesson that, unfortunately, some performers are incapable of implementing.  Kaufman was one such performer.Not only did he give his all onstage, but his outrageous antics were carried over into his real life behavior, so that it became difficult to separate one from the other.  Jim Carrey does indeed 'become' Kaufman, so successfully that his work may be held up as a model of the 'Method' tehcnique.  Alas, the interminable timing and delivery of the late comedian's lines, the quirkiness of his style, and the outlandish behavior of his offstage persona, make for some mighty uneven going in this presentation.One is never quite sure just what makes this guy 'tick.'  We cut from a brief childhood scene to a fully grown man, with little idea of what's actually going on in that unique brain.  Just what's the driving force and need to make his entire lifestyle an avant guarde 'happening'?
There's some pieces missing from the scripters' creation here, and it has to do with filling in some of the blanks to the Kaufman legend. Milos Forman's direction is professional enough, yet it too seems to lack insights to help render a fully realized portrait. We end getting uneven highlights of the late comic's life and work, and an impressive and memorable job of characterization by the very talented Jim Carrey.",5,0,0,14 December 2000

Good Will Hunting," Two Pals Make Good in Hollywood
","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script.  The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way.  Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.What 'Hunting' essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity.  What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure.  This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing.  The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating.  Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck 'paid their dues' -- and success did not just fall into their laps.  These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality. 'Good Will Hunting' is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the  creativity of Damon and Affleck.",8,113,174,25 June 2000
Amadeus," Distorted History
","It is my understanding that, according to a many music historians and musicologists, Antonio Salieri did conspire against Mozart. And while this may be worhty of some interest as a footnote or even a few paragraphs in a Mozart biography, it is not a justification for the bloated treatment rendered in 'Amadeus.' Lacking a good enough slant for a powerful dramatic depiction, the writer latched on to this gimmick to propel the story to a wider audience. While we can be grateful for an opportunity to hear this great music and thrill to the recreation of some of the period settings, we cannot be happy about this distorted approach to biography. Nor can we feel elated over the decision to make the character of Mozart a cackling, show-off buffoon. There is a great deal missing from this composer biography, and it is saddening to think that this may be considered a definitive depiction of the life of this great composer. There comes a point when historical accuracy and integrity must override purely commercial motives.",3,9,25,16 March 1999
Mulholland Drive," For Lynch Lovers . . .
",". . . and for others with a courageous attitude.  No need to try and explain 'plot' here; there are only sequences . . . some disjointed, some convoluted--always unpredictable.  Here's a film that defies 'labels.'  Could be a dream, nightmare, hallucination, stream of consciousness, or even in-joke. 
Whatever the case, one gets the feeling that David Lynch is making the kind of statement his wants.  As both writer and director he's in full command, with no one else 'calling the shots.' It's a creative ideal, and Lynch expresses himself to the fullest; hopefully he's satisfied with the results.With some audience members it may be another matter.  Fortunately, Lynch has the ability to hold the attention. Even when one begins to realize there's no point in trying to figure the puzzle out, there's no great disappointment.It's not unlike going through those Halloween haunted houses, with each room and hallway having something different and intriguing to offer.  When one leaves it's been a stimulating experience without depth or meaning.
There will be both defenders and detractors for this one.  For Mr. Lynch, though, it looks like he's found his mecca and reached his promised land.",Null,0,0,25 January 2003
Life Is Beautiful," Theory of Relativity
","What an interesting exercise, reading the wildly varied comments and rections to 'La Vita e bella.' From all spectrums of the response scale, the film provokes some deep emotions, pro and con.  It reminds me that pretty much all things are relative, and that we do indeed create our own experience of the world. The work or subject remains the same; the human perceptions fluctuate. What may appear to be absolutes, when considered from different perspectives, may turn out to be relatives as well. It's all part of the wonderful, intriguing mystery, and we can revel in its uniqueness. We can also celebrate the gift of diversity, which makes life constantly stimulating.",Null,2,5,16 May 2000
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Stymied in Pasolini Land
","The incredibly gifted director/poet/writer Pier Paolo Pasolini certainly strained my sensibilites with his       'final' opus, 'Salo o le 120 glornate di Sodoma.'  Coming to it rather 'cold,' without much background, I found the work to be quite heavy on symbolism; unfortunately for me, I was unable to make the proper meaningful associations.What did emerge was a disturbing metaphor on contemporary society and politics--particularly fascism, neo-fascism and capitalism, as seen through the eyes of this filmmaker.  However, I was unable to fathom the degree to which he successfully embroidered either of his source inspriations--DeSade or Dante. Over the years, I've read commentaries and reviews of the work, which range from great to poor.  Frankly, I don't know where I fit in here--as the work seems like a prism which depends on what perspective or angle one views this artist's often stultifying creation. Thus, 'Salo' has me stymied . . . there's no doubt, though, that it also leaves an indelible impression.  Still, one viewing for me was quite enough, and I have no desire to return to this particular Pasolini land.",1,15,33,17 May 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Mask and Face
","Can an actor's character mask ever become his real-life face?  It would seem so, judging by Tom Cruise's 'Special Feature' interview on the DVD of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' As Cruise reflects upon his experiences in making the film and his relationship with Director Stanley Kubrick, one senses the actor hasn't fully shed his role.  The low tones of his voice, the deliberate and interminable pacing of his lines, and the introspective and diffident attitude and mannerisms of his delivery all seem to be those of Dr. William 'Bill' Harford carried over to real life.  Indeed, at one point in reflecting upon his first learning of Kubrick's death, Cruise appears to almost uncontrollably recapitulate the start of Dr. Bill's emotional 'release' scene from the film's climax.Perhaps it's only natural, after having spent eighteen intense months (longer including the preparatory period) with this character, being in every scene, and all the while under the powerful influence of Kubrick.Anyone who might think acting is a fairly easy can view this interview footage and observe the challenges demanded by the craft. When Laurence Olivier was once asked whether it was better to take the character home or leave it at the stage door, Olivier responded the latter.Perhaps techniques in de-programming might be as beneficial as actual character development to the actor's work.  At least one hopes Mr. Cruise will follow this up with some light comedies.",5,2,4,22 August 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Overlength Weakens Promising Production
","'The Shawshank Redemption' has so much skill which went into the production that it is regrettable that it's overlength undermines its attributes. Episodic, slack and slow formatting stretch the narrative far beyond what its material requires. The result is a fair film, with some worthy touches.",4,2,6,11 March 1999
Mr. Holland's Opus," An Annoying Film
","This was a particularly vexing film to watch. Here is a frustrated young composer who doesn't have the gumption to make a commitment to his craft, and sheepishly takes a job as a high school music teacher, just to 'have something to fall back on.'  It's certainly depressing to see his character waist his life engaging in a second-choice activity, for fear of taking the necessary professional plunge and pursuing his dream. So he toils away for years until he's ready to retire--then he's rewarded with a cheering assembly full of high schoolers and treated to a performance of a musical composition he wrote (though we've seldom seen him working at his craft). Not that the piece is remarkable, just percussive, brassy and rhythmic. Talk about a downer film experience!",3,7,17,30 March 1999
Ben-Hur," Sorrow and the Pity
","This film, like all other versions of Gen. Lew Wallace's novel, has a very negative vibration.  Literal treatments of scripture and similarly fictional adaptations of same result in crimes against humanity. 
Under the guise of self-righteous ('God-is-on-our-side') beliefs, fellow beings are forever becoming snarled in combative modes of behavior.Despite humongous cast, hoards of extras, and eye-popping production values, including 'inspirational' score replete with heavenly voices, contradictions prevail.   The screen unfolds with truths, partial truths and fallacies all mixed together as to confuse and distract.  As if this weren't enough, the narrative has very little to do with 'a tale of the Christ.'
Drama had better leave metaphysical and allegorical texts alone and concentrate more on pure fantasy.",2,16,55,9 May 2003
Signs," Eclectic Script
","They're everywhere!  Lurking in the cornfields, caught in the pantry, scaling the roof, stalking down alleyways, and up in the sky... You name it.
The script seems to borrow a little of this and that from at least a half dozen other works. These include 'The Birds,' 'The Thing,' 'Day the Earth Stood Still' and 'Night of the Living Dead.' So this plot (described as 'drama/horror/scifi/thriller') connects crop circle phenomena with UFOs and aliens --though I don't recall such tangible connections being made before -- anything to create some tension.It's H. G. Wells meeting Steven Spielberg (and those precocious kids are definitely Spielbergian) for a sincerely acted piece.  Its impact will depend on the degree to which one's willing to buy into all those divergent reference links. Mel Gibson certainly was, and delivered his role with the seriousness of enacting Hamlet (which he reportedly wants to play).  He rather passed his audition.",Null,0,1,8 July 2004
Amélie," Get a Life, Kid
","It takes lots of different folks swimming to different strokes to make the world go 'round.  Amelie is one rather oddball kid who's obviously searching for love, and trying to fill a missing emotional void in secretive, sly, yet harmless ways.If only her dad had taken her in his arms as a child and given her what she really needed and longed for--a good, old fashioned hug--things might have taken a different turn for Amelie.Instead, her only physical contact with pop was when he gave her a physical exam.  Mom wasn't much better, either; thus, this child, like all too many kids, never enjoyed the pleasures of what magic a loving hug can bring.So now as a young adult she must seek creative fulfillment as a do-good hobbyist, and what an elaborate series of projects she undertakes. Likewise, what a mind-boggling number of images and words flash across the screen in this lengthy, exceedingly elaborate production.Fortunately, our heroine finally finds love at the end, as this unabashed 'woman's picture' concludes with Amelie in the arms of her man.  It took long time to get there, baby, but you arrived, and more's the power to you.",Null,1,4,25 April 2003
The Matrix," A Mindless Mess
","'The Matrix' is utter nonsense and total stupidity.  An incredible hodgepodge of all the mindless Spielberg-Lucas epics, James Bond gadgetries, Kubrick effects, plus about 75 years of cheepie-to-high budgeted action/sci-fi/thriller flicks distilled into one vat. Throw in the latest computer-styled technological inventions for good measure.  And finally add a pinch of philosophical jargon, just to give it an illusion of substance, stir well and -- there it is: a product that can well be labeled, 'Warning: enter this movie at your own mental health risk.'",1,9,27,19 April 1999
The Wizard of Oz," Seek a fine print of this film
","One of the joys of seeing 'The Wizard of Oz' is viewing a pristine print. Over the years the extraordinary Technicolor original quality has been diminished due to old prints, which have long lost their bloom. Seeing a print as close to the original as possible is a unique film experience. Not a restored version, mind you, but one cast from the original negative.",10,2,3,5 March 1999
The Godfather," An Ugly Movie
","'The Godfather' was a sickening experience the first time I saw it in its initial release, and it hasn't changed.  I thoroughly disliked the film's spirit, finding it very ugly at its heart. I saw little justification for its existence, was sorry I saw it, and have tried to forget it.",1,23,81,8 March 1999
