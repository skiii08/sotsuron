The Blair Witch Project," Be afraid...
","Like most people now, I think I have become jaded to just about everything in movies.  Violence, sex, the monster popping up at an unexpected moment, it's all been done before.  The Blair Witch Project has none of that, and has only one scene that shows blood, but it is still the scariest film I have seen in over 10 years.  I don't know if I agree that it is the scariest movie of all time, as I can think of some notable exceptions that still get to me today, but it defintely ranks up there with films such as The Haunting, Night of the Living Dead, and The Exorcist.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has seen it, but I will say that at no time do you believe the people in the film are simply acting, and the power of suggestion, not the power of visuals, work to unsettle and frighten the watcher. Definitely go see this one in the theater, if you like to be scared, you will not be disappointed.",10,1,2,19 July 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Cinematic perfection?
","I want to say that The Fellowship of the Ring is the most perfect example of cinema to come along since the large-scale productions of the 50's and 60's. I want to say that everything in it works, from the acting, to the special effects, and all the things that fall in between.  I want to say these things, but I can't.  What I can say is that I have not seen a more affecting story or a more rousing adventure on screen since films like Raiders of the Lost Ark or the original Star Wars.  The film just works, in spite of the flaws, and gives me hope that maybe (I know I'm dreaming here) Hollywood will remember what made movies like the ones I mentioned before truly great, and give us more, and less of the soulless, heartless drek that fills the theaters now.",10,0,0,4 January 2002
