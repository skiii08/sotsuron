Marie Antoinette," An utterly misguided attempt at a period piece
","This was hands down, bar none one of the worst attempts at a period piece I've ever had the displeasure of suffering through. From the grating American accents and American style dialog to the jarring, incongruous modern pop music that littered the soundtrack to the quintessential American girl Kirstun Dunst (I normally enjoy whatever Dunst does, but really, only the most blindly loyal fan of hers could have enjoyed this miscast appearance) in the lead role, this movie irritated me like few others I've ever watched. Perhaps I just simply didn't 'get' what Coppula was shooting for (a parody of some kind?) but this failed for me on just about every conceivable level. Yes, the set designs and costumes were beautifully done, but those alone do not a period piece make.",3,1,2,7 October 2007
