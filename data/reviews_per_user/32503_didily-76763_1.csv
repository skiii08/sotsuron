Blade Runner 2049," Not an Action Hero Movie
","I think this movie was awesome in every way. Unfortunately, the mass movie viewing audience these days better appreciates action hero, comic book type movies that, IMO, are mostly junk, and that is why the user reviews are generally not so good. This movie was not only beautiful, great effects, great story, fantastically directed and produced, but also thought-provoking, great characters and good character-chemistry and dialogue. You could see and feel how the Replicants were so close to being human but had just enough quirks to show that they were not and were indeed artificial. And Joe's realization through his intelligence and humanity to understand more and more as the movie progressed his artificiality. Other movies I thought great that a lot of others did not were Oblivion and Shutter Island.",10,2,17,15 December 2018
