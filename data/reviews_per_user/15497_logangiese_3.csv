Angels & Demons," If you have to see this movie you should wait to rent it because it not worth going to see it in theaters.
","Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) finds himself yet again solving a mystery surrounding the Vatican and its hidden secrets. This time around it's all about the secret and evil anti-Vatican organization, the Illuminati, who was shun hundreds of years ago by the Church for saying science explains the world's mysteries and not God. Flash forward to present day and the Illuminati want their revenge on the Church and the Church needs Robert Langdon to help solve their problems. This movie is just like the first one but it is not as edgy and there is absolutely no character development that lets you connect with who they are and why they do this. I really didn't even realize Tom Hanks was even in the movie and couldn't care one way or the other what happens to him because the movie didn't give me a chance to connect with his character. This movie is about 45 minutes too long and all it shows is Tom Hanks running around Italy trying to solve clues. But what this movie lacks in originality it makes up for in is its effectiveness to keep you interested. This fact is due to the excellent directing by Ron Howard who is one of the best directors we have today. It's somewhat fast paced for the type of movie it is but you would like to think that there was somewhat more to the story then what they give you. The so-called twist at the end should have been more shocking and not so subtle and predictable. Ewan McGregor does a great job playing Father Patrick McKenna and is very believable as a priest. He is the only one that shines among the rest of the cast who seem to be there just to collect a paycheck. If you have to see this movie you should wait to rent it because it not worth going to see it in theaters.3 out of 5 stars.Cool Factor: Seeing the VaticanLame Factor: Not as edgy as it should have been.",6,0,0,23 March 2010
Star Trek," Best J.J. Abrams movie to date
","The new Star Trek movie is the second coming of what seemed to be a dead franchise. It brings back the classic characters of the mischievous yet responsible Captain Kirk and the always uptight but humorous in his own right First Officer Spock. The film begins with a great but one-sided battle between the Federation and a mysterious alien ship that seems to have a vendetta against anything that moves. Fast forward twenty some odd years later and you have a young rebellious Kirk joining the Federation out of pure frustration and Spock being disobedient to his elders by also joining the Federation. Spock's story alone makes for a good movie and his character really evolves from what viewers are used to. He seems to have a certain swagger that he didn't have before. Of course Spock and James T. Kirk meet up at Federation school and have several humorous moments before their fate collides them together into a fantastic voyage. What makes a good movie great are the side characters involved. All the characters from the original show are in this movie and every new actor playing that character is magnificent. Everybody from Dr. McCoy played by Karl Urban to Scotty played by the delightful Simon Pegg. Director J. J. Abrams hits another homerun that seems certain to be one of the highest grossing blockbusters this summer. The special effects are what you expect from this type of movie, which is top notch and the script writing allows you to dive right into the movie. The other summer blockbusters have a lot to live up to now.",10,4,9,23 March 2010
Valkyrie," Tom Cruise a Nazi?
","Tom Cruise a Nazi? In this film Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg as a member of the Nazi party who tries to kill Hitler and end World War II with his fellow conspirators. Obviously he fails because we all know Hitler didn't get assassinated but during the whole movie you are pondering how he fails and that is the only reason why this film is somewhat interesting. This is the only film that you may know nothing about but still know how it's going to end. Bryan Singer, who made the only good 'X-Men' films, does a good job by making a film seem like there is a lot of action in it but realistically it's just a bunch of close-ups of Tom Cruise looking constipated. Mr. Singer didn't cast Mr. Cruise for his acting ability but rather for his presence or quite simply his star power. This was supposed to be Tom Cruise's comeback movie after the commercial failure of 'Mission Impossible 3'. At best, this movie achieved lukewarm reviews from critics to audience alike. Watching this movie you realize why Tom Cruise is an action star and not known for his dramatic performances even though he had a few. Tom Cruise may look just like the person he is playing but you got to wonder if this film could have been better if anyone else played his role, for example Leo? The whole supporting cast effortlessly out acts Mr. Cruise and it's almost embarrassing for him because he seems to be trying so hard. All in all it' s a decent film if there is nothing else at the video store and I feel lucky that I didn't spend more than 3 dollars on it by going to the theater. 3 out of 5 starsCool factor: NazisLame Factor: Hardly any action in what appeared to be an action movie.",6,0,0,23 March 2010
