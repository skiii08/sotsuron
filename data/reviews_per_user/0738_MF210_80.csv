Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino really is a maserful filmmaker
","My Rating: **** out of ****. Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films can take their place as one of the best series in the history of film. Kill Bill Volume 1 and Volume 2 truly highlight(even more than his other films), how much he loves movies. These two films show his mastery of the medium. With these films, Tarantino is basically taking everything from the movies (or maybe the genres) he loves and mixing them together to form something fresh, which he has accomplished.However, Tarantino's two films are radically different in tone. Volume 1 was a masterful kung-fu homage with some spaghetti western thrown in. That film showed that Tarantino was skillful in crafting action sequences and creating his most visually stunning film yet. It was a masterpiece and an instant classic. Kill Bill Volume 2 is something different. Its mostly a spaghetti western with a little kung fu thrown in. While Tarantino shoots some great action sequences here, Volume 2 is not as concerned with action as its predecessor was. Instead, this film focuses on characters, dialogue and an emotional impact. Out of all Tarantino's previous films, Volume 2 has more in common with the underrated Jackie Brown than Volume 1. Both films slowed their pace in order to develop their characters and both were going for a more emotional impact than any other of Tarantino's films. Volume 1's main purpose was to be a great thrill ride and give us a glimpse of things to come later on in the story. Even though Volume 2 is more concerned with an emotional impact, it still has some thrilling scenes. There is a scene where The Bride is buried alive that is brilliantly filmed and as a result gives off a claustrophobic feel. We feel like were in the coffin with the bride. Also, the fight sequence between The Bride and Elle Driver is an exhilarating sequence. It may not quite be up to the final battle in Volume 1, but its damn close.Another individual who deserves a lot of credit in making these films is Cinematographer Robert Richardson. Richardson's work on Volume 1 was just gorgeous and while is work here isn't as impressive, he still shines. The style is more subdued here but Richardson's camera-work during the Bride/Elle fight scene is terrific. He is also able to recapture the look of old kung fu films in one brilliant sequence (The Bride's training sequence with the treacherous Pei Mei). Richardson's work on these films is brilliant and he should get more credit. Now we come to the emotional part of the film. The Brides quest is finally coming to the end. She is in Bills apartment about to shoot him when something unbelievably shocking is revealed to her: Her daughter that she believed was killed when she was shot is alive. the look on The Brides face is truly heartbreaking. The sequences with her and her daughter are touching. This is what she started killing for and now she has what she thought she lost four years ago. Then there is the Bill/Bride situation. Oh I forgot to mention, she has a name: Beatrix Kiddo. The fight sequence at the end between them is more words than action. It isn't extremely satisfying on a visceral level but it is satisfying on an emotional level. These two no matter what they did to each other still cared about each other and a huge, epic battle would have cheapened their feelings for each other. The acting is outstanding in all corners. Uma Thurman is just brilliant in this role. She shows the Bride was a more complex woman than we were lead to believe. Whether she does get an Oscar Nomination or not is in question, but she deserves it. Michael Madsen turns in truly spectacular work too. This man is not some fodder for her to kill, his Budd is also more complex than I expected. Daryl Hannah is marvelous here. She plays against type as a cold, ruthless killer. Hannah removes all image of her nice girl roles here. The standout is definitely David Carradine. Carradine is just sensational here. He opens Bill up, this is not some cartoonish figure with shallow motivations. He comes across as a real, deep person. Carradine deserves not only a nomination for his work, but the Oscar. Kill Bill Volume 2 shows Tarantino at his best. His direction is flawless and he is back to writing dialogue. His dialogue here, while not 'classic' Tarantino, is solidly written. Overall, Volume 2 is equally as accomplished as Volume 1 and these two together are a masterful saga.",10,0,1,15 November 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Very Difficult Film to Review
","My Review: ***1/2 out of ****.SpoilersWhen I wrote my review for Kill Bill Volume 1, I said I would raise the rating to a 3 1/2 if Volume 2 completed the story in a satisfying way. Well it did it in a much more than satisfying way. Volume 2 is a compelling film with many scenes of greatness. So many that in fact they almost erase the small sense of dissatisfaction(more on that later).Volume 2 is a different film from Volume 1. Volume 1 was a kinetic, stylish, kung fu gorefest homage. Volume 2 is a slower, talky film that has more in common with spaghetti westerns than kung fu. Its still a stylish film but the action and the violence are toned down.In terms of action, it was unlikely that anything in Volume 2 would top the Crazy 88 Gang Fight in Volume 1. However, the fight between The Bride (or her name is Beatrix Kiddo) and Elle Driver comes close to matching it. Its a brutal, exhilirating fight that is masterfully directed and ends with a hilarious moment. This is just one of many great scenes.
Stylistically, Tarantino does a lot with this film (arguably more than he did with Volume 1). He uses a split screen during the Elle Driver fight. He changes the theatrical ratio during one scene(Im not sure I have ever seen that done before). Tarantino also does a bunch of extreme close ups (ala Sergio Leone). Once again, he shoots some scenes in Black and White (Including the opening which is brilliant). However, there is one scene that really deserves mention. That is the scene in which the Bride is first placed in the coffin and buried alive. When shes being buried alive Tarantino uses black and white which makes the scene extremely uncomfortable (as it should be). Than he switches to just total darkness. The scene is brilliantly filmed and it is just another great scene in Volume 2.
Now we come to Volume 2's most obvious strength: The Performances. Uma Thurman was terrific in Volume 1 (she deserved but did not get an Oscar Nomination). But its her performance in Volume 2 that proves she is one of the best actresses working today. The character is developed much more in Volume 2 and Thurman proves she is more than up to the task. Its a more emotional performances and Thurman nails it. She better get an Oscar Nomination this year.Thurman isn't the only one to turn in a top notch performance. David Carradine matches her scene for scene (although he does have less screentime). Carradine also develops Bill into a more complex individual. Bill isn't an evil, over the top individual. Carradine shows us the human side of Bill. Tarantino originally had Warren Beatty in mind for the role, but I can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Carradine.
The supporting performances are also top notch. Remember Daryl Hannah? The sweet, shy actress who played innocent characters like the mermaid in Splash. Well theres none of that here. Hannah is frighteningly evil as Elle Driver. Michael Madsen also does an excellent job as Budd. Gordon Liu is a standout in an interesting segment of the film, he plays the person who trained Beatrix.I will not deny that Volume 2 strengthens Volume 1. It fills in the holes. However, Volume 2 has some weaknesses of its own. First of all, like I mentioned, this is a talky film. But no one in their right mind will confuse the dialogue in Volume 2 with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The dialogue in Volume 2 is occassionally bland which causes some scenes to drag. I wish Tarantino would have shortened the film just a little. I mean there are some memorable lines ('Roar and Rampage' monologue for example) but just don't expect Pulp Fiction-type dialogue.Put separately, I would say for right now, the two films are equal. They are both compelling films with many great scenes but there is still a small sense of dissatisfaction. If Tarantino puts the two films together and possibly cut a few scenes from both than he could have a masterpiece on his hands, just like he did with Pulp Fiction. For now, I stronlgy recommend Volume 1 and Volume 2 but I would just love to see them together.",10,0,1,23 April 2004
Alien 3," The Weakest Of The Four
","My Rating: ** out of ****. Alien 3 is a big disappointment. There are many flaws in the film plus one possible plot hole. Many will argue that Alien: Resurrection is worse, but I found many more aspects of that better than Alien 3. The first problem with this movie is the story is basically a rehash of the first Alien. The only difference is that Alien was much more effective. The story is in no way thrilling at all. Also, the tagline for the film 'On Earth everyone can hear you scream'. What the hell? This movie doesn't take place anywhere near earth. Another problem is the characters which are really poor. I know I did complain about some of Alien's characters, but they were ten times more interesting and likable compared to some of these characters. There are basically too many characters, its obvious there just here to get killed. One of the only characters to have a personality is Charles S. Dutton's characters, but when he talks he sounds more like a reverend. We do not need religious people in an Alien film. It doesnt fit at all.
The film does contain good visual effects, one of its strengths. The film also has a dark atmosphere thats suitable. It also has some style by director David Fincher, I liked his point of view shots of the Alien. I also liked the ending, it was the perfect way to end a disappointing film. Unfortunately, these are just about the only strengths Alien 3 has.
The action scenes werent that suspenseful. The scene where The Alien pins Ripley against the wall was the only part I felt that was suspenseful. The other scenes I just didnt feel anything. Something else I found disappointing was the killing of Newt and Hicks. I cared much about those characters and they just kill them off here. Overall, Alien 3 is worth watching just to see all of the films but other than that its really disappointing.",5,524,597,20 September 2003
Miracle," Worth Seeing If Only For Kurt Russell's Performance
","My Rating: *** out of ****. If anyone wants to watch something uplifting, Miracle will certainly do the trick. While watching the film, I found it impossible not to like it. This is a well-made film that is a definite crowd-pleaser. The first thing Miracle has going for it is Kurt Russell. Russell has had an uneven resume and from what i have seen, this is easily his best performance(although I have yet to see Dark Blue). Russell's performance as Herb Brooks is compelling and intense; it's one of the best performances I have seen this year. No one else in the cast comes close to Russell's performance. The actors who play the hockey players are effective because their not well-known (I heard they were hockey players but I'm not sure). However, Patricia Clarkson (who did nice work in Far From Heaven)is only adequate as Brook's wife.
The director, Gavin O'Connor, deserves a decent amount of credit. The climactic game is brilliantly filmed. The other scenes on the ice are also compelling. The only time the pacing actually seems off is in the beginning and the scenes between Brooks and his wife.Miracle is definitely a film worth seeing. Like I said, it's a film that is hard to dislike. Miracle is just an uplifting experience.",8,0,0,23 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not Quite Up To The Original Chapters but I liked it
","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. Yes, The Phantom Menace is a flawed film but in no way does that make it bad. Its quite entertaining and visually stunning. George Lucas finally made the movie after 16 years apart from Return Of The Jedi. I know why some people are disappointed but I didnt mind the film at all.
The acting is fine but I have a few complaints. Liam Neeson is quite good as Quigon, its in no way up to what the actor did in Schindlers List but its a good performance. Ewan McGregor is also good. Natalie Portman is fine, but she doesnt seem to have much to do here. Jake Lloyd is occasionally annoying but overall I think he does a credible job as young Anakin. Samuel L. Jackson has a brief but memorable role. Ahmed Best provides the voice for Jar-Jar Binks, and he makes the character so annoying, I think they should have reduced the character's screentime. The Best Performance comes from Ray Park who plays Darth Maul, he doesnt require as much acting as the others but he has one hell of a presence and has the right looks for the part. One of the disappointing things about this movie is they kill him off in the end.Star Wars was never known for having a grade A script, the script isn't weak here but occasionally has some bad dialogue. I like the way how Lucas planned everything out in this film, some scenes maybe be a bit familiar at times but are overall still satisfying. The ending is great, it does echo the ending of the original Star Wars a bit but the images are great looking and you see a connection between the characters. However, the script nor acting are not the most important things about this film, the special effects are. The Special Effects are quite brilliant, the pod-race is phenomenal and exhilirating. An underwater sequence is absoulutely beautiful. Lucas is known for applying great special effects to his films and he succeeds here. The Phantom Menace maybe flawed but it is certainly not a bad movie, it is enjoyable. It is in no way up to the first in the Original Trilogy but nevertheless provides a good start to the prequel trilogy.",8,1,3,17 September 2003
The Ring," I dont care what critics and people say, I Liked it
","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****.When The Ring came out I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. To my surprise, I did end up liking it. It also gave me some pretty good scares.
The acting is good in the Ring, surprisingly. Naomi Watts does a good job here. Brian Cox has a pretty good cameo. The kid was really my only complaint dealing with the acting, he just came off like a rip off of Haley Joel Osment's performance from The Sixth Sense. The Ring represents Gore Verbinski's best work as a director, though there was one shot that maybe a ripoff of Rear Window. The dialogue is fine, though the TV conversation was a little strange and not in a good way. The Ring has some chilling scenes and some pretty scaring, disturbing ones. The film is pretty atmospheric, theres pretty much a sense of atmosphere throughout the movie. There are questions unresolved in The Ring. I'm hoping they will be resolved in the upcoming sequel. You still wonder when The Ring is over, like Where did it come from? But nevertheless, The Ring is an entertaining and thrilling experience.",8,1,1,12 September 2003
Minority Report," Very Good but the ending is kind of a Copout
","When I first heard about Minority Report I thought its going to suck really bad. When I saw the preview it looked Decent. Its safe to say this movie was more than decent. It was actually Very Good. Minority Report is filled with memorable scenes, that include some fantastic looking Visual Effects. The movie has kind of an acid-type look to it. Makes the movie look kind of dark because it is a dark story. The Sets and Cinematography in Minority Report are excellent. The movie is well directed by Steven Spielberg, who has made 2 movies in 2002. The acting is pretty good. Samantha Morton gives the best performance of the bunch, playing a precog named Agatha, she does her best job to play a not so normal woman who can see murders happen before they even appear (sorry I cant elaborate more I just dont want too). Colin Farrell is also Great. Tom Cruise is alright but its one his performances thats kind of forgettable.
The one major flaw in Minority Report is the Ending. The movie moves so fast at a perfect pace, that when you see the ending you fell a bit cheated. Minority Report would have been a Great movie if it wasnt for that ending. Though, its still very good.",9,0,0,28 May 2003
Chinatown," Pretty Much A Masterpiece
","When I first saw Chinatown I was a little hesitant to call it a Masterpiece, but in fact it is one. It has Great Directing by Roman Polanski, Brilliant Acting, and a very well written Original Screenplay. Just A Masterpiece.Jack Nicholson is brilliant as J.J. Gittes, a very serious private Investigator. Faye Dunaway is very good as Evelyn Mulwray, the woman Gittes is on a case for. Dunaway as one scene in the end where shes truly great. John Huston gives a pretty good performance too. The movie is very well written there isnt a thing wrong in its screenplay. It has a hard ass ending that completely fits and could never be changed, like Robert Towne wanted it to(writer of the movie), or it wouldnt feel right or look right. It would have been a copout. 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,2 June 2003
The Big Lebowski," Its funny but also a mess
","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. I consider myself a fan of the Coen Brothers, I loved both Fargo and Raising Arizona. I found The Big Lebowski to be entertaining but it had a convoluted storyline. Does This make it a bad movie? Absolutely not, and this is because of the wonderful dialogue the Coen Brothers have provided for us.
The acting is one of the strengths. Jeff Bridges is absolutely perfect as The Dude. John Goodman is hilarious as Walter. Steve Buscemi really doesnt do much except get insulted by John Goodman. Julianne Moore takes a different kind of role and does well. To enjoy The Big Lebowski, you must do one thing: Forget the plot. You will hate the movie if you try to figure out the plot. It is a mess of a plot. At one point it gets incoherent, but that scene is one of the best in the film.
The Big Lebowski is not a masterpiece, in fact its even really far from a near-masterpiece stature. But it is highly entertraining and it will calm your nerves after seeing a movie called Requiem For A Dream.",8,1,3,7 September 2003
Monster," Charlize Theron totally elevates this film
","My Rating: *** out of ****. Give her the Oscar already. It is so obvious that Charlize Theron will win the Best Actress Oscar in 26 Days. Not only because she is a pretty girl that was able to look ugly. But it is because her performance is absolutely powerful. From beginning to end, she is Aileen Wurnos.
So what about the rest of the film? Well, Monster is an effective and compelling film. However, the reason it is effective and compelling is for Charlize Theron. Without Theron this movie would be ok at best. I found the script to be mediocre. I really felt that Charlize made the film into something worthwhile. One of the problems with the film is the Theron's voiceover. When used at the beginning it is fine. However, it seemed rather pointless and distracting the rest of the time. Her voiceover at the end came off a bit corny. I should praise the make-up crew. Charlize was unrecognizable, although I never found Aileen to be a hideous looking woman. She was no Charlize but still I found her to be an overweight but somewhat attractive woman.
The only other actor to have significant screentime is Christina Ricci. Ricci does gives a good performance but she is completely upstaged by Theron. However, they do exhibit some chemistry together. The rest of the cast was forgettable, well Bruce Dern was sort of memorable despite not much screentime.This is the debut film of Patty Jenkins. She was the writer and director of the film. Her screenplay is not remotely interesting and her direction is fine at best. Her job was to make sure that the film was never boring and to make sure Charlize completely WOWED us. She achieved those well(She may be able to do more on her next project). Monster is certainly not one of the years best films and without Charlize this film would be mediocre at best. However, Charlize elevates this film to a higher level and she has 26 days till she receives her Oscar.",8,0,0,1 February 2004
Dawn of the Dead," So completely different from the Original
","My Rating: *** out of ****. Last year, A classic horror film called the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was remade. Although it was not critically acclaimed, I thought it was a solid horror film and a damn good remake. The same could be said for this years Dawn of the Dead. However, the remake of TCM could at least be called similar to the original. In the 2004 Dawn of the Dead, its like a complete reimagination. There almost different movies. Yes, the plot is basically the same but there's a lot different here too. For example, the zombies move much faster, it takes place in Wisconsin (not Pennsylvania), and the film plays out in a much different way. The setting of a shopping mall is the same but here its only used as a place to hide where in the original it was used George Romero's brilliant(if not very subtle) satire on consumerism. So how does this Dawn fare against the older one? It holds up but it is inferior to the original. Romero's Dawn of the Dead was a horror film mixed with satire, this Dawn is more like action and horror. Thats not a bad thing because it works but Romero's Dawn was more challenging to a viewer. It was an intelligent horror film and while its not fair to call this film dumb, its nowhere near as intelligent as Romero's film was. That being said, this Dawn does a few things better than the original. First of all the look of the zombies is far more scary, the make-up is more realistic, and in some ways, this is a scarier film. Also, the zombies move much faster here which adds more tension to the film. First-time director Zach Snyder does an excellent job of raising tension throughout the film.However, you can tell this guy used to do music videos. Although this Dawn has a more polished, slicker look to it than the original did, there are times, especially in the beginning, when it looks a little too much like a music video. Is this a bad thing? Well it is a little distracting but it doesn't last too long (it looks much more like a movie in the mall).The acting does not disappoint though. Everyone in the cast does a solid job portraying their character. If there's a problem here, its that I liked the characters in the original Dawn better. They seemed more accessible and likable to me. In this film some characters come across as really selfish or just plain stupid. For instance, would you risk going to save a dog in a building that is not only surrounded by zombies but has one in it? And not even have a weapon with you? I mean even though that moment was very suspenseful it fell back to the horror movie standard that a character must do something totally idiotic. Also, what is the big deal with the ending of this film? All I heard was the ending is the most horrifying part of the film. Are you joking? I could see that coming so it wasn't shocking at all. The opening 10 minutes were far more effective. Another minor thing bothered me in this film and it was the use of the line 'When there is no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth'. As we all know this is from the original and once again delivered by Ken Foree. However, it didn't feel right here, it felt liked it was tacked on to make a reference to the original. It doesn't have the same impact either. Why? Because in the original Foree's character mentioned something about voodoo to go along with the line, here its just randomly said on television. How the hell is that creepy?For the most part, this Dawn of the Dead delivered. It has flaws but it is tightly-paced, graphic and yes, scary. In my opinion, its much better than the overrated 28 Days Later. While it isn't on the same level as the original, it works on its own.",8,0,1,8 November 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Its not the best entry in the Alien Series, but its better than Alien 3
","My Rating: *** out of ****.Alien: Resurrection may not hold a candle to Alien or Aliens, but hey its better than Alien 3. Its obvious that ideas in the Alien series are not too original anymore. It slightly borrows from Alien and really borrows from Aliens. However, Alien: Resurrection is entertaining.The acting is particulary mixed. Sigourney Weaver is quite good here, but I have no idea why she has nail polish on. Winona Ryder is very stiff here, but I think she is miscast. There are only a couple of supporting characters that are likable at all and some arent used at all, they just fade into the background and get eaten by the monsters. Ron Pearlman is actually good, he makes his character likable for being such an asshole.
Alien: Resurrection has some other problems, at times I thought it was kind of stupid and at other times I found it kind of thrilling. The special effects, particulary the ones with the Aliens, are kind of fake looking. The ones with the ship and the planet look quite real. The film also tended to be overvioelnt, but not as gratuitous as Alien 3. The script was also weak, but again not as weak as Alien 3.The one thing I did like about this movie was the idea of a humanlike Alien. I loved the design of the creature. Many people found it disgusting but I thought it was the most original idea of the film. It was kind of weird how he got on the ship at the end but I thought that creature was a brilliant idea.It may not be the best, especially compared to Alien and Aliens, but it is entertaining.",8,1,1,13 September 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Good, solid fun
","My rating: *** out of ****. When I saw the Pirates trailer, I thought it would end up being a decent movie. It was a solid fun for the summer where I have been underwhelmed and disappointed by some movies. Pirates is nothing revolutionary its just fun.
The acting is mostly good. Johnny Depp delivers one of his best performances as Jack Sparrow, he is funny and just entertaining to watch. Geoffrey Rush is also very good as the bad guy. Orlando Bloom is fine. Newcomer Keira Knightley, while very beautiful, is just plain bad here.
Director Gore Verbinski does a decent job directing here. This is not his best film nor his best directing. I think he was much more successful with The Ring. Pirates is visually well made. Great Costumes, Good Visual effects, and nice sets. It may not be a great action movie, but its solid fun.",8,0,1,6 September 2003
The English Patient," Good, but Shouldnt have won Best Picture of 1996
","I am not one of those people who hate this movie. I liked it, it was a good movie. But it doesnt achieve greatness, Fargo should've won Best Picture of 1996. The English Patient is visually stunning. The Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, and Make Up are all top notch. Its also is a well edited film. The Original Score was ok but not great.The acting is pretty good. Juliette Binoche was excellent and deserved her oscar. Ralph Fiennes had kind of an inconsistent performance, he was good for the most part but there were times when he was better in the movie. Kristin Scott Thomas was consistentley excellent throughout the movie. Willem Dafoe also gives a good performance. The movie was well directed by Anthony Minghella, Joel Cohen's direction was far superior in Fargo though. The English Patient was well written even though there were some lines I couldnt stand.There are flaws in the movie besides a couple of lines in the script. It moves very slow in areas. Sometimes the Fiennes-Thomas love story is kind of flat too. Overall, I liked the movie and its well worth watching even with its flaws.",8,0,4,24 May 2003
Finding Nemo," Its a good movie, but something was missing
","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****.Finding Nemo is without a doubt the best movie I have seen all year. Unfortunately, thats not saying much. This year has been incredibly great for movies. But Nevertheless, Finding Nemo is a good movie.The voicework is relatively good. Ellen Degeneres does some great work here. Albert Brooks does good work for his typical kind of character. The rest of the voicework is good. There are some brilliant moments in Finding Nemo that have some of the best animation I have ever seen in a Disney movie. There are somy funny and creative scenes, and sometimes the two are combined. It is a visually stunning film, and it is above some of the disney work. But something is missing that I cannot say it is the best Pixar film, which The Toy Story's still hold. But it is the best film of the year and worth a look.",8,0,2,18 September 2003
Dead Poets Society," Its interesting and entertaining but never brilliant
","My Rating: *** out of ****. Dead Poets Society is a good film but it was swept up by the academy. This is one of those times where the academy nominates something that is undeserving. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four academy awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Robin Williams), and Best Original Screenplay. Out of those four, one of them may have been deserving.
The acting is solid throughout the film. Robin Williams gives a solid, convincing performance as John Keating. Yet, even know he is good here he did not deserve a nomination for Best Actor. For one thing, the performance is nothing amazing and he actually does not have a whole lot of screentime.
The best acting comes from the supporting players, who are the kids in the school. The best performance comes from Ethan Hawke. He gives an excellent portrayal as a shy, unassured teenager. The rest of the acting from the teenagers is all solid. The Dead Poet Society is always interesting and entertaining but it never striked me as brilliant. Its a well written movie and it has its share of good moments but never really rises above. The movie does look great visually. The Cinematography is excellent. A Peter Weir movie (the director) always looks great. However, the Dead Poets Sociey has flaws. Was it ever really necessary to have a subplot about them going into the Dead Poets Society? That subplot seemed really pointless. Also, there was a scene when one of the kids commits suicide. The music seemed somewhat pretentious during this moment. As did some of the shots. Why did the camera focus on the Dads slippers then? Whats the significance? Peter Weir has been accused of being pretentious at times and that whole moment seemed pretentious. Peter Weir has done better (Witness, Master and Commander).Even with its flaws, I still liked Dead Poets Society. It was overrated by the academy but that does not make it a bad movie. Its a good film, its just not great.",8,1,2,2 December 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Forgettable Fun
","My Rating: **1/2 out of ****. Out of all the movies coming out this month, this one looked the most promising. Van Helsing looked simply awful, Troy looked visually fantastic but the reviews weren't very promising, Shrek 2 didn't look terrible but I am not really compelled to see it either(the first Shrek never needed a sequel), and the comedies (Breakin all the Rules, Raising Helen) looked like crap. The Day After Tomorrow looked like it would be the most entertaining of them all. If you've seen the preview, you know what to expect. Now see it on the big screen where it is an awesome sight. It's a huge big budget, disaster film that is typical for summer. For the most part, it entertains(at least when the cities are being destroyed). The special effects in the film are highly impressive. The scenes of L.A. being destroyed by twisters and the flooding of New York City are exciting and look believable. Could you ask for anything more? Well yeah you could.I am very surprised that director, Roland Emmerich (who brought us the very entertaining Independence Day) didn't do more. When this movie was being advertised I saw London frozen over and Sydney about to be flooded. Why weren't these in the film? I mean Emmerich showed the destruction of three cities in Independence Day. Why only two here? The reason more cities should have been destroyed is because outside of the disaster sequences and some of the other action sequences, The Day After Tomorrow gives us some really clichéd and uninteresting drama. The doctor staying behind with the cancer patient(that's really corny and should have been cut). The film also shows us one of the most irritating and moronic Vice President I have ever seen in a film(Why does Emmerich always have to have a politician in his disaster films?). There's also some really lame stuff here. The whole sequence with the wolves attacking on a Russian ship was just plain dumb and it wouldn't have hurt the film if it was cut. In fact, The Day After Tomorrow could have been shorter. Even at a reasonable length(124 minutes), it goes on for too long. Also, they need another closing shot because that last one of earth, though having a point, just comes off rather corny. The Day After Tomorrow accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain. Emmerich is a competent enough filmmaker to generate excitement, even though he can't create write worth a damn. There isn't much of a story here and the characters are mostly types(although some of the actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum make their characters likable). Good disaster films need characters for us to care about (to a certain extent, Independence Day accomplished this), The Day After Tomorrow comes up short. Nevertheless, I had a pretty good time while watching the film. It's not something that will remain in your memory long, but it's fun while it lasts.",6,0,0,31 May 2004
Spider-Man 3," Could've been spectacular but ended up being a bloated mess
","My Rating: ** out of ****.Maybe Spider-Man 3 is the product of huge expectations, maybe even unreasonably so, but it is a massive disappointment. Sam Raimi was crafting one of the better super hero franchises, the first one was solid and the second one was one was outstanding. The trailers for the third film showed promise and there was a ton of potential, hardly any of which was realized in the final product.The biggest problem with the film was Sam Raimi was just attempting way too much with the storyline. Not only is the film about Peter and MJ's relationship, which is in full blown soap opera mode, but it's also about Peter's conflicts with Harry, Peter/Spider-Man's 'dark side', which is introduced by some mysterious black goo from outer space, and two other villains are thrown in for good measure. Needless to say Spider-Man 3 is a bloated mess.One of the trademarks of the previous two film were the quality of the villains. Willem Defoe was very effective as the Green Goblin and Alred Molina was outstanding as Doc Ock, both were menacing and, even if they had there complexities, you had no problem rooting against them. That is a problem here. If you're counting all the vaillains in the film there is three: Harry, Sandman, and Venom. The fight scenes between Peter/Spidey and Harry are energetic and some of the most effective in the film, but James Franco is not intimidating enough to be a good villain, and by the end of the film he is no longer a villain.The other two villains are both failures for different reasons. Thomas Haden Church plays Sandman, who we learn was responsible for the death of Peter's Uncle Ben in the first films, and he ends up being the most sympathetic character in the film. Give credit to Church for making us feel for the character but that doesn't make him a very good villain. Sandman's name is Flint Marko and he shows to regret his past actions and wants to help his sick daughter. Not everything he does is right but it's hard to hate him.The biggest failure is how Raimi just decides to trash Venom. Not only is Topher Grace seriously miscast as Eddie Brock/Venom but the character is unforgivably shortchanged. The character has only 20-30 minutes of screen time and Brock doesn't become Venom till the very end. This is one of the most popular villains in the comics and cartoons and the filmmakers hardly use him? I'm baffled by their apporach. At least you can say he looks good but there's no doubt Venom deserved to be a stand alone villain in another film.The trailers showed that the film was going to focus on the dark side of Peter and Spider-Man. This potentially fascinating element is, with a few eceptions, executed poorly. The black goo that was previously mentioned attaches itself to Peter and changes his mood,appearance and creates a black Spidey suit. His appearance is ridiculously emo with black hair and an angsty facial expression. He also acts like a fool dancing on the streets, I know Raimi likes to add humor to these films but a lot of these scenes turn the film into a self-parody. This is supposed to be dark? More like ridiculous. The only time this works is when Peter fights Harry and the black Spidey encounters Sandman in the subway, but other than that, this element was a wasted opportunity.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are also disappointments. The chemistry isn't as strong here and both their performances are weaker. Dunst comes off as whiny and Maguire has several moments where is frighteningly awful. One scene that takes place on a bridge bewtween him and Dunst where he is expected to be emotional is painfully embarrassing. His performance doesn't ring true playing the darker side as well, though that's partly bad writing too.In short, the film is just an all-round disappointment. The climactic action scene at the end even lacks the energy of the previous films. If Spider-Man 4 is going to come out in 2011, Sam Raimi better have a solid storyline that's not biting off more then he can chew or I'll be officially done with this franchise.",5,0,1,18 October 2008
The Terminator," The film that introduced James Cameron
","My Rating: *** out of ****.The Terminator introduced James Cameron to critics and moviegoers, and was the start to a pretty decent career. The Terminator will mostly entertain you, even though its flawed. Cameron had enough talent to make it a watchable movie.The acting is pretty good. Arnold Schwarzenegger isnt bad as the Terminator, but i dont think he has enough of a bad presence to be a truly great bad guy, hes better as a hero. Linda Hamilton is solid as Sarah Connor. Michael Biehn is fine. They have enough chemistry to make their relationship seem believable. I feel The Terminator's pace is a bit off in a few areas, I dont know why. The Terminator effects still look decent, though nothing compared to the state of the art effects we have now. Cameron does a good job for one of his first times behind the camera. This is definitely not Cameron's best film, but it was a good start to his career.",8,0,1,7 September 2003
The Doors," A compelling but seriously flawed film
","My Rating: **1/2 out of ****.One thing you can say about Oliver Stones The Doors is that Stone has no intention of forcing the audience to like the main character. Stone spends almost the entire 138 minutes making Jim Morrison into the biggest asshole that he possibly can. Really, when I first rented this film I had no idea what to expect since Oliver Stone is sort of hit-or-miss with me. I can honestly say the film held my attention completely but at the end I was unsatisfied with what I had seen.The remaining members of The Doors have criticized this film saying that it only portrayed one side of Morrison and that some of the actions in the film were far worse than anything he ever did (throwing the TV in the studio for instance). To be honest, I felt exactly the same way. By the end I was like, 'There has to be more to this man than this!!!!'.' I know Morrison had drinking and drug problems, and thats on full display. Stone makes clear that we see the flaws of Morrison and pretty much nothing else. If Stone wanted to make a film that showed the dark side of a rock star than he accomplished his goal admirably.But the film is just too disappointingly shallow. Morrison was supposedly a very shy front-man at first which we actually do see in the beginning when he sings with his back turned toward the audience. It's a shame Stone didn't explore this 'shy, intelligent' man that the Doors always talk about instead of the sadistic asshole on display here. If Stone had made Morrison into a more well-rounded character than this could have been a great film.What cannot be criticized about the film is Val Kilmer's electrifying performance. Forget the small little flaws like Kilmer is six inches taller than Morrison was and that Kilmers face is a little fatter than Morrisons and just watch this magnificent piece of acting. I have never been that impressed with Val Kilmer's acting ability before I saw this film so seeing him in this was a mindblowing experience. He completely inhabits Morrison and its hard to believe he was actually the second choice for the role. This will undoubtedly be a career best for Kilmer and it is a damn shame he didn't at least get an Oscar Nomination.The supporting cast is also impressive, particularly Meg Ryan. Ryan excels much more in lighter roles but here she dos a very good job as Morrison's girlfriend, Pamela Courson. Kevin Dillon, Kyle MacLachlan, and Frank Whaley do the best they can with limited screen time as the remaining members of The Doors.Stone's films have always been uneven when it comes to visual styles. In such films as Natural Born Killers, Any Given Sunday, and to some extent, Nixon, they have been exercises of cinematic masturbation with hyper editing and completely unnecessary film stock switches. Fortunately, thats not the case here as the film has a more straightforward look that complements the film well instead of distracting us.Stone can make a compelling film and The Doors is never boring. It has a lot of good points: a tremendous lead performance, impressive supporting work, effective cinematography, and a great soundtrack. Its a shame that the film is hampered by a shallow script. If the script were better it is quite possible The Doors could have been a great film. As it stands, its a compelling, though definitely disappointing film.",7,16,22,13 January 2006
Full Metal Jacket," Very Good but a bit uneven
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Stanley Kubrick is a brilliant director who proves he can just do about anything. He proves he can do a war movie here. Full metal Jacket is split into two parts: Boot Camp and fighting in the war. This is a genius plan but it also makes the film a bit uneven. The first part is the boot camp scenes. These scenes are brilliantly written. They will make the viewer scared to go to boot camp. R. Lee Ermey is brilliant as a drill instructor, he also has some very funny lines. The rest of the acting is solid. These scenes are dark and disturbing.
The second part takes place during the vietnam war, when the fighting starts. The dialogue is still good and the acting still solid, but its not as successful as the Boot Camp scenes. These scenes are good and entertaining but they lack the brilliance of the boot camp scenes.
Nevertheless, Full Metal Jacket is a very good movie. Its definitely worth watching.",9,0,0,20 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Its No Empire but it is entertaining
","My Rating: *** out of ****. Attack Of The Clones is an entertaining movie, but out of all the Star Wars films it is the most flawed. Some people thought this was superior to Episode I, I am not one of them. Make no mistake I liked Episode II because I enjoyed it but it is plagued with problems. The acting is a definite weakness here, the Star Wars movies are not movies where you see first-rate performances, but the acting is quite bad at times. Natalie Portman is completely unconvincing. Hayden Christiansen performance is pretty wooden. I amit Jake Lloyd was occasionally annoying in Episode I but he overall did his job. Ewan McGregor is adequate here. Yoda is actually the main star in the film. The big problem I have with this movie is the romance. I know this was not going to be up to the likes of Casablanca. Any idiot could have figured that out. But the dialogue is cringingly awful and Portman and Christiansen have no chemistry. The romance scenes are unbearable. However, the rest of the movie is quite good and entertaining. There are some similarities to Empire but I was able to enjoy the movie anyway. Where AOTC reigns is the Special effects. The Special Effects are quite brilliant. The action scenes are spectacular. There are so many standouts its impossible to name them all. George Lucas is losing his talent as a filmmaker but I still will be looking forward to Episode III.",8,0,1,19 September 2003
Forrest Gump," Im not as crazy about it now
","When I was a kid I loved Forrest Gump. Now I dont love it. Dont get me wrong, its a good movie with an interesting idea but now I just dont love it anymore. The plot is interesting because it focus's on a man that doesnt matter and puts him into these big historical events. Tom Hanks brilliantly plays Forrest Gump and deserved his oscar. Gary Sinise was very good. Robin Wright Penn was average at best, she is just not a good actress. Sally Field is good as Forrest's Mom. The movie is well written and pretty well directed. But I just dont think it deserved Best Picture. Its Oscar material but definitely not oscar winning except for Hanks. It won because it was the most sentimental of the nominees, I suppose. Shawshank Redemption was a better movie and Pulp Fiction was better than both.",8,2,5,6 June 2003
The Godfather: Part II," Slightly below the Original but theres not much below.
","My favorite movie of all time is the Godfather. My second favorite is The Godfather II. It took me awhile to separate them but I did. Part II is the Best Sequel Ever Made, no doubt about that. Fantastic directing, Acting, Script, and just about everything. The Acting of course is top notch. Al Pacino is brilliant, and in my opinion even better as Don Michael Corleone. He can yell without overacting, every scene he yells at Kay, he makes me scared. The look on his face when Kay tells him she had an abortion is so memorable. Diane Keaton isn't bad as Kay but she is easily the weakest of everybody but she doesnt degrade the movie in anyway. John Cazale is good as Fredo (that never changes). Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strasberg were nominated for their roles and they were great.
The thing that makes Godfather II different from any other sequel is the fact that its a half sequel half prequel. Its what I admire most about Godfather II. And what makes it the best is that we get the standout supporting performance from none other than my favorite actor Robert De Niro. He is excellent as the young Vito Corleone. Though Brando is better as Vito you have to remember that this was one of De Niro's first acting roles.
10 out of 10. #2 on my top list.",10,0,1,1 May 2003
The Italian Job," The beginning has style, but that does not help the rest of the film
","My Rating: ** out of ****. The Italian Job was one of those summer movies I did not see but I heard it was good. So tonight I decided to give it a try. The result was a mediocre movie. The Italian Job opens with very stylish opening credits. It features nice cinmatography of Venice and has a clever constructed heist scene. Then it moves into snowy mountains which are also beautiful. Unfortunately, from then on it was mostly down hill. After the sylish beginning, the characters come on and we have to accept them. This is something that never happens. Why? Because the characters are not likable in the slightest. You do not care if they die. As a caper movie, Oceans Eleven was much better because the characters were all likable and had some very clever dialogue. The Italian Job occasionally has some clever dialogue but it is much less successful than Ocean's Eleven.
The performances do not help either. Mark Wahlberg is stiff throughout the movie.  Charlize Theron is looking beautiful and is convincing but again her character is not likable. Jason Stratham is fine, but his character is so arrogant that you can not stand him. Seth Green has his moments but hes not entirely likable either. Mos Def is good and he is pretty much the only likable character in the gang. Edward Norton is no better than ok as the villain. Donald Sutherland is good but really wasted. He is only around for a few scenes. The Italian Job is too long. It really is too long when you dont like these characters. The chase scene with the minis was overlong and not exciting. Even though I was not interested in the characters I felt the movie was hard to follow. The DVD I rented did skip(only for two minutes) but I feel it was more than that. If I was a little more interested maybe I would not have noticed. Overall, The Italian Job was not quite a failure. It is a good example of style over substance. It has some good moments but not enough for an hour and forty-five minute movie. If fifteen minutes were cut it could have been better.",5,0,1,22 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Now I am Convinced Its A Masterpiece
","My Rating: **** out of ****. The first time I saw this film in the theater, I really did not see what the big deal was. I mean I liked it but I was a bit bored while watching. The second time I saw it, I liked it much better but I still did not find it to be the masterpiece everyone said it was. Well, the third times the charm. The movie shined like it never had on the previous viewings. Its a masterful piece of filmmaking. I will be honest, I have not read the Lord of the Rings books. Also, Fantasy has rarely interested me. I mean I read the Harry Potter books but by the end of the third book, I was tired of them. I may read the Lord of the Rings books sometime in the future but it won't be something I will be terribly excited by. If I read the books, it will be because the movies have improved so much on repeated viewings (except for Return of the King which I was only able to see once). The Fellowship was extremely successful when it came out. 13 Oscar Nominations (won 4 of them), Grossing 860 Million Dollars Worldwide, and I don't know how much its made on DVD. Thats pretty damn good and the amazing thing is that its the first part of a hugely successful trilogy.Its hard to say what works best here. Everything is blended to perfection(or close to it). Peter Jackson's direction is stellar. He paces the film perfectly by never rushing anything. When it wants to exhilirate us, it does. When it needs to take its time, it does. The action sequences are also masterfully executed. Jackson said his dream was to do Lord of the Rings for the screen. Well, it shows in every frame. Although Jackson is not the best director around, it would have been a huge mistake for any other director to do Lord of the Rings. His achievement here is masterful to say the least.
Technically, Lord of the Rings is flawless. Sets, Costumes, and Make Up(which won the Oscar) are perfect. The Oscar Winning Cinematography is stunning (I need to go to New Zealand soon). The Visual Effects are some of the most impressive of the 21st Century and were damn well worth the Oscar. The Sound and Score(which also won an Oscar) are also top notch.
The cast was well chosen. Elijah Wood is effective as Frodo. As is Sean Astin as Sam. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd do nice jobs as Merry and Pippin. Most of the actors do effective jobs but there are three standouts. Ian Mckellan turns in an excellent performance as Gandalf. Ian Holm(who has always been a top-notch actor) is completely credible as Bilbo. Finally, Christopher Lee makes a perfect villain as Sauruman. The Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing accomplishment for everyone involved. Jackson has crafted a masterpiece that is already being considered a modern classic. Jackson has every right to be proud of this film.",10,0,1,21 April 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," If you werent crazy about Reloaded, than stay away from Revolutions
","My Rating: *1/2 out of ****.In 1999, The Matrix debut and was an unexpected success, theatrically and on home video. It was such a success that the Wachowski Brothers, who are the creators of the Matrix, said that it was the first part of a trilogy. Now after seeing #2 and #3, I think it would have been better if they had not done these.The worse thing about Matrix Reloaded was its pretentious dialogue, that became unbearable near the end of the movie. During its first hour, this is pretty much what Revolutions has to offer and its not good. The conversations the characters have are overlong and tedious.The second hour is a little better but still some scenes run overlong. The big battle of Zion is no better than ok. There is one visually impressive moment where the Sentinels swarm in together but that doesnt save it from being overlong. The battle at the end with Neo and Agent Smith starts out good but also becomes overlong. The most interesting scenes in the film take place in the machine city, they are visually stunning and are occasionally exciting (except for the emotional moment).In terms of acting, theres not much to say. Keanu Reeves was paid $15 million dollars and he is not in the movie for long, nor does he say much. Carrie Anne Moss has lost her presence as Trinity, although she still looks great. Laurence Fishburne also doesnt do anything. I never saw the point of Monica Bellucci in this film, except to look good. She was also wasted in Reloaded. Jada Pinkett is fine for what she has to do. There is no surprise to me that Hugo Weaving gives the best performance as Agent Smith. Yet even as good as he is here, this is definitely his weakest turn.The Wachowski Brothers have dug their own grave here. If Revolutions had been made a year or two after Reloaded, these problems might have been able to be fixed. But 6 months later there still evident and they damage it. I did not like Reloaded, but it could boast a few impressive action sequences. Revolutions had a problem doing that. Yet Matrix fans should still see Revolutions to see it how it ends. Its actually pretty underwhelming but at least its over. No more Matrix, for pure action this fall, I will take Kill Bill anyday over this crap.",4,0,0,6 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," One of the better summer movies
","My Rating: *** out of ****.Ok, Terminator 3 is unnecessary but its so enjoyable it makes up for it. It is the weakest of the trilogy and I think a fourh Terminator would not be a good idea. But nevertheless Terminator 3 is one entertaining ride.
The story is pretty much the same as Terminator 2. Most critics and fans saw this as a huge flaw. But I did not mind it at all, Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi/action films and I wouldn't mind if the sequel did it again. The acting is mixed. Arnold Schwarzenneger is excellent here, he has this role down. Kristiana Loken is playing the TX, her performance is showing a lack of emotion and having an evil stare, which she does quite well. Claire Danes is fine, but I have never been a big fan of her. However, Nick Stahl terrible, he comes off like a wuss instead of a future hero.
The action is quite impressive here. Theres a fight scene between the TX and The Terminator thats fantastic. The only part of the action I didnt like was the chase scene, I found it kind of overblown. Terminator 3 is well-paced and will keep you interested throughout. Some people complain the humor was too much. Some of the humor may be a little much, but I thought some was quite funny. Terminator 3 ranks as one of the better films of the summer.",8,0,0,18 September 2003
The Shining," I dont care what anyone thinks I Love This Movie
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.First off, I will admit that I dont think The Shining is Stanley Kubrick's best movie, its one of his best but just not quite up to some others. It is the best movie he made during the 80s though. The Shining is psychological Horror. This is Horror that gets under your skin. The film achieves this admirably, you watch it at 2 A.M. and see if you feel the same. The acting is mostly good in The Shining. The kid, cant remember his name, is very good. Scatman Carrothers is also quite good. Jack Nicholson got alot of bad reviews saying he overracted, but I do not feel he overracted. You know this guy really isnt that sane when you see him. My only criticism in the acting is Shelley Duvall, I kind of think she Overracted in areas.
The Shining may seem very different from some of Kubrick's other movies. This is mostly because of the material. You still get a claustrophobic feel like in many other Kubrick movies. A viewer might think some questions are unanswered. Mostly asked would be the reason for the elevator of blood. The blood is more symbolizing something. That should be a pretty good hint.",9,0,1,5 September 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of James Cameron's best and One of the best sequels ever made
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. James Cameron is a good director, though like many other directors he has made a piece of sh*t, that is Titanic. But if we turn back to the early 90s we will see great action films like T2 and True Lies. Both of these films were memorable and well-paced, unlike Titanic. T2 and True Lies are two of the few reasons to watch action movies. If I had to choose, T2 was better and also better than its predecessor, The Terminator. I will admit The Terminator was more original, but there were a number of things T2 did better. T2 makes a few adjustments to the original story and they work very well. In one case, its an advantage to a member of the cast. Arnold Schwarzenegger is much better here as a good guy, I had problems believing him as bad guy in the first one. Linda Hamilton is still solid here and reminded me of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (another Cameron movie). Edward Furlong does a solid here that will make John into a great leader. Robert Patrick does an excellent job at an evil stare and not showing any emotion whatsoever. Some may call Terminator 2 alot flashier than the first. Its true it is an upgrade from the first film but I think thats an advantage. The Special effects are great. Theres many brilliantly shot action scenes. The movie is extremely well-paced and also well-written. This does not quite get the title of Cameron's best film but it is close.",9,0,0,18 September 2003
Being John Malkovich," Its good but I was also disappointed
","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****.Being John Malkovich was a movie I watched this summer. I had heard good things about it so I was excited. When I was done my thoughts were It was good but disappointing. The reason I think Malkovich is disappointing is in its script. Charlie Kaufman has come up with a brilliant, original idea. But I didnt find the dialogue anything special, it was only a tiny cut above average. The idea was great and the film has some brilliant scenes, for example, the restaurant full of Malkovich's was the best scene of the movie. Its just that I felt not enough effort was put into the dialogue. Being John Malkovich was actually more entertaining than funny.But Spike Jonze seemed to have an idea of what hes doing. He gets good performances from the cast. John Cusack is quite good here, and im not a huge fan of him. However, I am a huge fan of Cameron Diaz and she does very good work here. Catherine Keener was good, but definitely not worth an oscar nomination. However, the standout is John Malkovich. Its really difficult for an actor to play himselves, and Malkovich does a great job.
I liked Being John Malkovich, also worth mentioning was the ending which I thought was really sad, but the movie becomes a bit uneven from the dialogue. If the dialogue was improved, Malkovich would have gotten at least a *** 1/2.",8,0,1,6 September 2003
Dark City," Unfairly Overlooked
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.When Dark City came out in 1998 it was not a box office success. In fact, it was a failure. It did receive some good reviews, especially from critics James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert. But it did not stay in theaters for more than a few weeks.I am one of the few people I know that saw this film in the theater. I just recently got the DVD for Christmas and watched it. I got alot more out of the film than I did five years ago. It provides some really thought-provoking about our memories. Dark City is an intelligent film thats more rewarding if you think about the film while watching. There are no easy answers here though, director/screenwriter Alex Proyas wants you to think about the film, instead of him just overexplaining it.When talking about the film, it is impossible not to mention how much style is in this film. The vision of this city is absolutely stunning. I immediately recalled images of Tim Burton's oh so memorable vision of Gotham City in Batman. Both of those visions are gothic and absolutely stunning. The film is also drenched in atmosphere. Dark City has one of the most stylish visions I have ever seen in a film.The acting is solid. Rufus Sewell is solid as John Murdoch. Some complain about Kiefer Sutherlands performance but I think it works well here. Jennifer Connelly puts her heart and soul into her perfomance as Emma Murdoch. William Hurt is very effective as the detective. Richard O'Brien is excellent and at times chilling as Mr. Hand.There have been many comparisons with Dark City and the very popular Matrix. Its true they both have similar ideas but Dark City maybe a little more thought-provoking. Also, Dark City did not need two money driven sequels(although its questionable if The Matrix really did need them). I love both films equally, but if someone said Dark City was better than The Matrix I would understand.Dark City does have one small(and weird)flaw. At times I feel the pacing is a little fast, especially the first 30-40 minutes. However, thats a small flaw that does not hurt the film horribly.",9,1,4,19 January 2004
Aliens," James Cameron at his best
","My Rating: **** out of ****. If I was asked to say which is the better director: James Cameron or Ridley Scott, I would have to think about that. If I had to say which was the better movies: Scott's Alien or Cameron's Aliens, the answer would be Aliens. This film represents the ultimate high point in Cameron's career. It ranks as one of the best, if not the best sci/fi-action film. As good as Camerons other films are: Terminator, Terminator 2, and True Lies, Aliens is better. Alien was mainly a horror film set in space, a very good and effetive one at that. Aliens has some scenes that are horror-like but it mostly uses suspenseful action in its place. There are so many suspenseful action sequences that its almost impossible to name them all. The film is set at a very effective pace so the viewer may never become bored.
The cast is very well chosen. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley and I believe she is better here than in Alien. Shes much more tougher and is one of the best action heroes in a film. The supporting cast gives solid support. Bill Paxton is excellent as Hudson, he has some excellent one-liners. Michael Biehn (who was in The Terminator) gives a solid performance as Hicks. Jeanette Goldstein is also solid as Vasquez. Paul Reiser is very detestable as Burke. The rest of the cast is also noteworthy too. One of Alien's weakness's was our ability, or atleast mine, to care for some of the characters. This weakness is not present in Aliens. The characters are not complex but they are very likable here (except for one). The dialogue is very well written and the story is well constructed.
Aliens mostly still looks great in the technical categories. The visual effects hold up well. The sets are excellent. The creatures are absolutely terrifying, especially the Queen Alien. Like Alien, Aliens also has atmosphere throughout. Cameron has created a sequel that is better than the original but this is not the first time he has done this. Terminator 2 was significantly better than the first. As memorable as Alien was, Aliens is better and ranks higher on my personal favorites list. Cameron may still have other good films in him, but I dont think he will beat this.",10,0,1,28 September 2003
The Fast and the Furious," A Good Popcorn Movie
","My Rating: *** out of ****. Its safe to say the Fast and the Furious is not an intelligent movie. However, that does not mean it is not entertaining. This is definitely escapist entertainment, or a popcorn movie like many people like to call them. Vin Diesel is impressive, he has a presence when on screen and he doesnt screw up when delivering his lines. This performance elevated him into stardom and I can definitely see why. Paul Walker is only adequate though, he pales when hes next to Diesel. Jordana Brewster makes Mia into a very appealing character. Michelle Rodriguez is once again playing a tough girl. Rick Yune is effective as the bad guy. Fast and the Furious does have a few bad lines but that is expected in some summer movies. Mostly the dialogue is fine. The car races and chases are well shot. The film has a few scenes that are a bit overlong but the movie will mostly hold your attention.",8,2,2,29 September 2003
The Exorcist," It disturbs you
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. The first time I saw The Exorcist I thought it was good but severely overrated. It just didnt seem that scary to me. A few years later, I decided to watch it again, I was shocked by how powerfully disturbing the film was. The movie has some scenes that will disturb the mind. It is a movie that will get under your skin. The acting is a major strength in The Exorcist. Ellen Burstyn is excellent as Mrs. Macneil. Linda Blair is fantastic as Reagan Macneil, the possessed girl. Burstyn and Blair have a strong bond that makes the mother-daughter relationship seem very real. Jason Miller is very good as the Priest who has inner demons of his own. Max Von Sydow has a brief but definitely good role.
The Exorcist is loaded with atmosphere, thanks to some excellent Cinematography. The Exorcist has a number of disturbing scenes. William Friedkin does a masterful job directing The Exorcist. The Script is also very well written and the music is a bit creepy, perfect for The Exorcist. The Exorcist is not flawless, but it is very good and bound to give you a few chills.",9,1,2,7 September 2003
Pearl Harbor," I admit it could have been better but i found it mostly enjoyable
","My Rating: *** out of ****.Pearl Harbor had the makings for a great movie, but it failed along those lines. The movie was mostly enjoyable, but I think it was meant to better than that. Pearl Harbor succeeds in a few areas but falls short in others. I found it better than Titanic, I will probably be in the minority on that one.The acting is a mixed bag. I think Josh Hartnett is actually good here. Kate Beckinsale is also good here, she and Hartnett have some chemistry that make them believable as a couple. Ben Affleck is downright horrible, he has no chemistry with either Beckinsale or Hartnett. Alec Baldwin is actually the best as Colonel Jimmy Dolittle. Cuba Gooding was just put in this story for star power, he doesnt have enough screentime. Jon Voight is decent as Roosevelt.Michael Bay was the wrong choice for directing this movie. Bay is not an accomplished enough director do something like this, hes made entertaining action movies and thats what Pearl Harbor is, but Bay would never be able to make this into a 'serious' movie. He uses a slow motion technique that is really unnecessary and kind of distracting.Pearl Harbor may have some problems in the acting and the director is totally wrong but its real problem lies in the script and editing. I feel that there are scenes between Beckinsale and Affleck that are unnecessary or too long, because these two have absolutely no chemistry together that it makes there scenes seem very uninteresting. Yes I will also admit the movie is about 20 minutes too long. Now we come to the script, which has some very bad dialogue. Some of this stuff is real sappy s***. Its obvious that the screenwriter has as much talent for writing a lovestory as George Lucas did 1 year later with Episode II. Pearl Harbor would have been more successful with a better script.The real strength of Pearl Harbor is in the technical categories. The Attack Scene is one of the most impressive battle scenes I have seen in my life. For 35 minutes you will take a journey back to Hawaii 1941. The movie also has beautiful sets, cinematography and costumes. The movie contains excellent sound too.Pearl Harbor is a bit of a disappointment but I still found enjoyable.",8,0,1,10 September 2003
The Conjuring 2," Contains a few missteps that its predecessor avoided, but still a genuinely terrifying film
","Contains Spoilers James Wan's 2013 film, The Conjuring, was one of the best horror films I have ever seen. To this day, there are still scenes that I struggle to watch because they are so terrifying. The film was one of those rare modern horror films that generated scares without excessive gore and cheap 'boo' moments. When I heard Wan was creating a sequel I was skeptical because The Conjuring simply did not need one. When I saw the trailer I was underwhelmed and not looking forward to the film, but because I loved the first film so much and respect Wan's skill as filmmaker I would give it a chance. The Conjuring 2 is one of those films where you absolutely cannot judge it by its trailer.When it comes to genuine terror, The Conjuring 2 is a slight step below its predecessor but it is ever so slight. I've watched this film twice since I saw it in the theater and, like its predecessor, I still struggle to watch certain scenes. The opening scene where the Demon is first revealed, countless scenes in the Hodgson household, and the absolutely terrifying scene with Lorraine and the Demon in the Warren's house. Wan knows how to generate atmosphere and chills, that skill is on full display in the Conjuring 2.One of the most interesting aspects of this sequel is there is an added element of skepticism. I never knew anything about this haunting before but it seems like there was a great deal of skepticism surrounding it. That skepticism is addressed in the film. Unlike its predecessor, where the Warrens believed the Perron family from the outset, the Warrens have their doubts about the events occurring in the Hodgson household. The evidence they are presented with isn't convincing to them and Lorraine never can sense an evil presence until the very end. The fact that there is another character who is skeptical of the claims and remains unconvinced only makes this element more intriguing.The Conjuring 2 does fall short in a couple areas compared to its predecessor. For instance, regardless of whether or not the events that happened with the Perron family were true or not, The Conjuring presented them to the audience in a way where they seemed believable. Aside from the using paranormal activities (the daughter being thrown across the room), there was nothing so outrageous that I wouldn't believe that what I saw couldn't have happened. The Conjuring 2 does not capture that as well when it introduces 'The Crooked Man.' Not only is the CGI cheesy here, there's nothing remotely creepy about this 'ghost.' It is lame and bordering on mildly humorous, and just doesn't fit in with the tone of the film.Also, there is the issue of how the demon is defeated at the end. The demon is disposed of in exactly the same way as Bathsheeba was at the end of The Conjuring. However, there is a big difference between the two films; Bathsheeba never told the Warrens her name! If a demon can be sent back to hell simply by saying its name then why did it tell Lorraine its name! It doesn't make any sense and it does somewhat diminish the ending.Nevertheless, The Conjuring 2 is still an excellent horror film and if it weren't for those two flaws, this would be a flawless horror film. As it stands, Wan has created a worthy sequel and an incredible one-two punch in modern horror. I don't know if there will be a Conjuring 3, but with Wan at the helm, I'd certainly be excited for I!",9,0,0,12 December 2016
Liar Liar," Carrey is the main reason this movie works
","My Rating: *** out of ****. If you are not a fan of Jim Carrey, then watch Liar Liar. I almost promise you that you will become a fan. In terms of his comedic performances, Carrey is at his absolute best here. I have this feeling that without Carrey here the film would not be much. The script is uneven. The writing for the comedy part is good and made atleast ten times as better because of Carrey's performance. However, the dramatic part is average writing at best and Carrey is no better than ok in those scenes. So if Carrey is not as good in the dramatic scenes is his performance uneven? A little but the dramatic scenes mean nothing when he is beating himself in the bathroom which is just one of several hilarious scenes. Its a shame to see how Carrey's comedic talents have gone down recently. If you want to see what I am talking about check out Bruce Almighty.
In terms of supporting performances, everyone does an adequate job. There are no standouts though. Jennifer Tilly looks great but does not make her character memorable. Actually, maybe the woman who plays Carrey's secretary (I forget her name) is a standout because she is actually quite good for limited screentime. I recommend Liar Liar for anyone who just wants to watch an entertaining movie. Its not a great film but you certainly won't be bored. But really, if you take away Carrey, this would be a rather mediocre film.",8,0,0,16 January 2004
The Pianist," Great Film, Ok it is better than Chicago
","I will say it The Pianist should have won Best Picture. But I am not putting down Chicago, I think both movies are great films. The Pianist is a holocaust movie, which is different from the 1993 masterpiece about the Holocaust, noneother than Schindlers List. The Pianist differs from Schindlers List because it spends all of its time in the Warsaw Ghetto, while Schindlers List spent time in the Ghetto and Labor Camps. We get a different point of view what it was like for the Jews. The Jews that stayed behind were forced to do some labor work for Nazis but their were Jews who were hiding in the Ghetto that fought back against them, though they didnt succeed. You dont see any fighting back in Schindlers List at all.
Adrien Brody delivers a great performance as a jewish pianist named Szpillman (not sure about spelling). Not Sure if its an award winning prformance but still a great performance. It maybe but I wanna watch the movie again. One thing I am sure about was that Roman Polanski (Director of the brilliant Chinatown) deserved his Oscar for Best Director, it was brilliant direction by a man who is close to 70 years old. The Pianist is a very well written movie but the screenplay is not award winning, I thought Adaptation should have won.This is my overall paragraph and I have alot of overalls to say. Overall, As much as i loved Chicago, The Pianist should have won for its powerful message and portrayal of what one man went through in the Ghetto during World War II. Overall, I prefer Schindlers List but The Pianist is a great film and will be remembered for years to come. Its a great achievement for Polanski. 10 out of 10.",10,2,5,24 May 2003
28 Days Later...," I do not understand the praise for this film
","My Rating: *1/2 out of ****. Almost every critic praised this movies this summer, especially Rolling Stone. The film also did fairly well at the box office (45 million is pretty good for this kind of film). Yet, when I was done watching it, I wondered if I had seen the same film. 28 Days Later is a stylish, occasionally suspenseful, and a somewhat inventive film. However, it is also boring, has unlikable characters, flat performances, an unintelligent script, a dumb ending,  and to top it off a moment of pretension. For a while, 28 Days Later appears to be something different from the normal zombie film. The scenes where Jim was walking through London are cool. It is shown as an empty city with absolutely no noise, this makes for a scary place to be. The film has a distinct look to it that reminded me of the look of The French Connection. Like that film, this look gives 28 Days Later a more gritty feel to it. 28 Days Later has atmosphere from the beginning to the end. Like I mentioned the film does have its suspenseful moments. The scenes where London is presented an an empty city. We do not know what is going to happen but were on the edge of our seats to find out what does happen. There is also a scene where the characters rush to change a tire before the zombies get them. The film also does a few inventive things. The look of the zombies are simple(Red Eyes) but it is effective. Also, I liked the way how the people became zombies (blood in the eye and the barfing was cool).
However, even though there are good things about 28 Days Later it has alot of bad points. The scenes in London are interesting because of the suspense and style. You briefly get to know the characters too. However, once the characters go on a road trip this film goes down hill. The film becomes boring and you do not like the characters. I mean not every film you have to necessarily like the characters but I really did not care if the characters died here. There is also a pretentious moment during the road trip. How out of place is classical music here?  The film also suffers from flat performances. As mediocre as the road trip moments are they are not the worst part of the film. Why in the hell did they get the military involved? This part of the film has such a tacked on feel to it. Its also really dumb and not suspenseful in the slightest. The ending is terribly bad too. I really did not want to see the characters survive at all. The film also feels incomplete because of the unintelligent script. Why are some of the people dead and some of them are zombies? If the virus was released into London why isn't everyone affected? I am not saying a film can not be open ended but the holes here are ridiculous. I was anticipating alot from 28 Days Later, maybe too much. Danny Boyle proved The Beach was no fluke. He really is losing steam. Yet, while The Beach was mediocre, 28 Days Later is just bad. It could have been good with a better script but from what I see here it is a mess.",4,1,2,11 December 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Underrated
","My Rating: *** out of ****. I dont understand all the horrible reviews for this film. Sure not a great film, but definitely a good, entertaining movie. I enjoyed it just as much as the first Jurassic Park. The Lost World still contains impressive, eye popping effects. These are just as flawless as the CGI as the first Jurassic Parks. There are more dinosaurs and they all look great. The film contains more action than the first and its all exciting. One scene that stands out is the scene with the Raptors in the fields. I love the way Spielberg shot it.
This is not a big acting movie, but its not that bad. Jeff Goldblum is good as Ian Malcolm, but had a little more energy in the first one. Julianne Moore is adequate but looks a bit uncomfortable at times. Vanessa Lee Chester is better than the other kids in the last film. The rest of the acting is adequate. Many people thought this film was redundant of the first. I wouldnt call it redundant but it is a little bit too familiar in areas.  The Lost World takes place in a different area but it is not much different from the first one. However, it is an entertaining movie. The action overshadows the story.
The big problem I have with The Lost World is the ending. It doesnt make sense how The T-Rex got loose. Its also a King Kong Rip-Off. Its visually stunning looking, the TREX doesnt look out of place at all. But it was showing CGI instead of doing something with the story. Nevertheless, even with its flaws The Lost World is entertaining and not worthy of its horrible reviews.",8,239,348,19 October 2003
The Incredibles," Good but not Incredible
","My Rating: *** out of ****. Don't get me wrong The Incredibles represents good entertainment but when I compare it to the Toy Story films and Finding Nemo(which gets better on subsequent viewings), it pales. I found the film entertaining but it just didn't pull me in like the previously mentioned Pixar films did. Nevertheless, The Incredibles has many good points. Like every other Pixar film, the animation is stunning. Pixar has not done any backsliding here yet. The Incredibles looks just as great if not even more so than the other films. The locations vary from streets of a city, underwater, and on a tropical island. They all look equally impressive.Two other strengths of The Incredibles are the action sequences and the humor. There is much more action here than any other Pixar film but the action scenes are thrilling and expertly done. The humor can be hilarious. The best jokes involve Mr. Incredible and his ultra-small car(at least for his size). The vocal work is a little mixed. Craig T. Nelson does a solid job as Mr. Incredible. He makes him a larger-than-life character with enough human qualities to capture our sympathy. However, it takes too long for Holly Hunter to lose herself in the character. For a while, all I saw was an animated character with Hunter's voice, not Elastigirl. Samuel L. Jackson fares better but Jason Lee is no better than adequate as the villain. The actors who did the kids voice did a sub-par job. The kids were interminably annoying(especially Violet).The Incredibles is also at least 15 minutes too long. It really starts to drag near the end and some trimming would have really helped out. Nevertheless, I do recommend the film. Those expecting a great film like the critics say it is, maybe disappointed but if you are expecting solid entertainment, then you won't be.",8,0,1,29 November 2004
The Elephant Man," Good but also disappointing
","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. David Lynch is a director that I am not a fan of, but he can make a good movie. The Elephant Man represents one of his better films. Theres no doubt The Elephant Man is a good movie, but I found the pacing to be quite slow. There were scenes that were quite interesting and sad but I couldnt help how slow the movie moved.However, I could look over the slow pace and see the strength of the acting. Anthony Hopkins is very good here, as a conflicted doctor. John Hurt is excellent as The Elephant, he was able to show emotion with all that make-up on too. Anne Bancroft gives a credible performance. The rest of the acting is good. The Elephant is well-written and technically stunning. The Sets, Cinematography, and Costumes are all great. David Lynch's direction is also great. This is probably his most important film. Although, it has flaws The Elephant Man is definitely worth watching.",8,1,2,18 September 2003
School of Rock," The School of Rock is not one of the years best, but it is entertaining
","My Rating:**3/4 out of ****. Jack Black is an actor that has many fans but some find him very irritating. If you like Black, you will like School of Rock. I happen to like Black and I like the School of Rock. Black has starred in two other highly entertaining comedies, Saving Silverman and Orange County. While, the School of Rock represents a good diversion movie, it is less successful than those two. The film is not hilarious but it has its funny moments. Jack Black seems to be having a blast in this role. He carries the movie, and while this is no performance that will gain any awards, Black is fun to watch. Joan Cusack is less impressive, she is constantly irritating as the School's principal. The kids are all ok in their roles. The movie is not without flaws. The 'Man' joke that starts is funny on occasion but becomes tiresome after awhile. There was also a bit of a drag when Black's character first appears at the school. Like I also said, Joan Cusack was irritating and kind of distracted me. Richard Linklater's direction was nothing noteworthy, the camera could have been given to Black and it would have been just as good if not better. Overall, the movie is fun to watch despite its flaws.",7,1,2,31 October 2003
Moulin Rouge!," A Beautiful and Imaginative film
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Musicals have been undergoing a comeback since the release of two new musicals: Moulin Rouge and Chicago. Both these films were impressive musicals that I love. Musicals have never been my favorite genre but when they are well done, the time passes by very quickly. Both of those films qualify. Moulin Rouge could have something to do with Chicago's success. Yes, Moulin Rouge only gained around 50-60 million and Chicago gained over 100 million. But Moulin Rouge was nominated for a fair share of Oscars. It started the comeback and Chicago only made it more successful. Both films are quite different. Moulin Rouge is much more of a visual feast than Chicago, and what a feast this is. The sets are beautiful and imaginative. The costumes are flashy and stunning. In fact, this film is such a visual feast, that many could call it overkill. Did they over do it? Yes and at times some things seem a bit excessive. But Baz Luhrmann is known for this and he does not care. With the exception of one, the musical numbers all have magic to them. I did not much care for the 'so exciting' number. Other than that the numbers are all great. The acting is mostly good. Nicole Kidman stunned me with this performance. Her voice was perfect and she did not stumble at all. She definitely deserved the oscar nomination. Ewan McGregor is the perfect match for her. They have great chemistry together and McGregor does a good job singing. Jim Broadbent also does an excellent job and was robbed of a nomination. Really, the only casting complaint I have is John Leguiziamo. He was terrible and irritating. Moulin Rouge is a very good film and definitelyy worth a look. It is a beautiful and magical experience. Unless you are put off by really fancy sets, which I do not think many are then watch this film.",9,1,2,7 December 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," My Second Review of Kill Bill Volume 1
","My Rating: **** out of ****. As I said in my first review of Kill Bill Volume 1, I would write a second review after I saw Kill Bill Volume 2. When I reviewed it I said that I really enjoyed it, yet I had a few complaints about how Tarantino wanted to rip me off and that this was an incomplete film. I said that Volume 2 would have to fill in the holes for me to change my rating. Well Volume 2 filled in the holes and it did brilliantly. However, after seeing Volume 2 in the theater, I had the urge to buy Volume 1 on DVD. So I did and I finally watched it tonight. I must say after seeing Volume 2, it strengthens Volume 1 in an astonishing way. Nevertheless, I would still like to see the films edited into a whole. Volume 1 is an exhilarating masterpiece on its own and Volume 2 brilliantly fills in the backstory, while adding an emotional resonance to the story. But together they might make a masterpiece to challenge Tarantino's top two films: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. There is an advantage to cutting Kill Bill into two films, which has to do with the different tones of the films. However, I think Kill Bill could really shine as one film. We shall see when Tarantino decides to release the DVD. Some people complain that Kill Bill doesn't have the great dialogue that was in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and to some extent, Jackie Brown. Well it is true that this is not the brilliant, snappy dialogue that Tarantino penned in his other films but the dialogue here works. It's not the dialogue I delight in hearing in Dogs and Pulp but it fits here. I do not feel it is a flaw like some other reviewers have thought, I think it's an asset. On the DVD, it is said that Tarantino and Uma Thurman came up with the idea for Kill Bill on the set of Pulp Fiction. Well you can definitely see that here. Volume 1 is their movie (maybe another reason for the split), more people get involved in Volume 2 (David Carradine, Daryl Hannah for example) but this is Tarantino's and Thurman's movie here. You clearly see that in the movie. Uma Thurman dominates the screen like never before. She carries as much screen presence as any action star and shes got more than enough acting talent required for the role. Other actors in the film, such as Lucy Liu, Sonny Chiba, have supporting roles. From an acting standpoint, this is Thurman's movie and she makes that perfectly clear. Her performance in Volume 2 was the more accomplished one but she is terrific here. Thurman developed the Bride into more of a person in Volume 2; here she is more of an icon. However, that being said, I thought Thurman added some humanity to the role in Volume 1. She is a woman bent on revenge, but I did sense the Bride was a real person. The rest of the cast offers their support. Lucy Liu is effective as O-Ren. Sonny Chiba should be given credit, he makes Hattori Hanzo into a memorable character for not much screentime. Vivica Fox does a good job in her limited screentime. Daryl Hannah makes a brief appearance and makes an impression. Michael Madsen and David Carradine show up in Volume 2.This is also clearly Tarantino's film. Volume 1 is packed with style. Tarantino's stylistic techniques here are all creative and don't seem excessive. The slo-mo scene of O-Ren and her crew walking toward us is memorable. The split screen technique is used perfectly in one scene (a homage to Brian De Palma). The most unique technique Tarantino uses is an anime sequence to tell the backstory of O-Ren. The sequence is incredibly violent and beautiful in a deadly way. From a stylistic point of view, Volume 1 maybe Tarantino's most memorable film (although Volume 2 is certainly a contender). However, it's the action scenes that prove that as a director Tarantino is in peak form. The smaller battle between The Bride and Vernita is handled well. But the showdown at the The House of Leaves is a tour de force. It's just an exhilarating fight scene that bests any fight scene I have seen in years. In fact, the only fight sequence I have seen recently that comes close was the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver in Volume 2.The fight sequence between The Bride and O-Ren really deserves mention. It was a beautifully photographed and expertly handled scene. It was the most beautiful moment in any Tarantino film. I read a review of Tarantino's Jackie Brown that said Tarantino was not a great visuals director, well I bet they would change their mind after watching that scene. I also credit cinematographer Robert Richardson for making that scene look as great as it did (How he did not receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography, I will never know). In the end, Kill Bill Volume 1 is just an exhilarating film that is technically brilliant in every area. It does not have much depth (more of that comes in Volume 2), but it's the kind of film that does not need to be incredibly deep. It's the director's work that is masterful here and the leading actress deserves a tremendous amount of credit too. With Kill Bill Volume 1, 'Q and U' have given us a masterpiece and it is sure to be come a classic.",10,1,3,8 June 2004
From Dusk Till Dawn," Solid Entertainment
","My Rating: *** out of ****. Not every film that has Quentin Tarantino's name on it is a masterpiece but each film he's been somehow involved in is at least of good quality(I'm not counting Natural Born Killers since he disowned the film). From Dusk Till Dawn is not an exception. For this film, Tarantino wrote the script but instead his good friend, Robert Rodriguez is in the directors chair. While this collaboration is not without weaknesses, these two talented filmmakers turn out solid entertainment. From Dusk Till Dawn is actually not a story of Tarantino's. On the set of Reservoir Dogs, the make up artist for the film, Robert Kurtzman, told Tarantino that he would work for free if he turned a story(about vampires) he wrote into a film. So four years after Reservoir Dogs, From Dusk Till Dawn arrived in theaters. Even though this is not Tarantino's story he puts his stamp on it (even if that means having a sizeable role in the film). The first half of the film is more dialogue than action. The dialogue that Tarantino penned for this film is not quite up to what he wrote for Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown but there's still some snap to it. The second half although more concentrated on action, still has some good lines ('Psychos do not explode when sun hits them. I don't care how crazy they are.').
The second half of the film is when director Robert Rodriguez gets to shine. Rodriguez has always had a talent for shooting action and that shows here. The over the top action is shot with flair and flawlessly edited (Rodriguez also handled the editing). Rodriguez never allows a dull moment in the entire movie. If theres a major flaw in the film its that I found the film too gross. I know it is supposed to be that gross by intention but it was just a little too much for me. There's nothing wrong with the make-up work though, which is excellent. This is not an actors film, but the performances work here. George Clooney is excellent here. He's given the best lines from Tarantino's script and deliver's them flawlessly. Tarantino himself is acceptable in his role. Effective work is provided by the rest of the cast.From Dusk Till Dawn will probably not appeal to everybody. If you dislike gory films than you should probably avoid From Dusk Till Dawn. I enjoyed it as a bloody, stylish and not too serious piece of entertainment.",8,0,1,22 August 2004
The Last Samurai," I was a little disappointed but I still enjoyed it
","Minor SpoilersMy Rating: *** out of ****. The first trailer I saw of the Last Samurai was easily one of the best trailers I saw last year. By the look of that trailer I had high hopes for the Last Samurai. When I saw the Last Samurai I was a little disappointed but I still enjoyed it. Let me mention the most obvious strength of the film: This is an absolutely stunning looking film. The sets and costumes are completely believable. The cinematography is amazing with many beautiful shots. The battle scene that takes place near the end of the film is spectacularly filmed.
Some people are saying that Tom Cruise's portrayal of Nathan Algren deserves an Oscar Nomination for his work here. I do not agree. Cruise is solid in the role but I do not think it is Oscar Material. However, Ken Watanabe's portrayal of Katsumoto is certainly worthy of an Oscar Nomination. This is a commanding and powerful performance that overshadows Cruise's performance. The rest of the supporting cast is solid. The problem with the Last Samurai is that its a little too long. There was one useless scene that did not go on that long but was really out of place ('Are you a Ladies Man, Bob'). The conversation with the emperor at the end of the film felt like it went on forever. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the Last Samurai. However, it was not a masterpiece and not Oscar Material, except for Watanabe's performance and some technical nods. I do recommend the film though.",8,0,1,19 January 2004

Eyes Wide Shut," One of those films that improves on repeated viewings
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.Back in 1999, Eyes Wide Shut was one of the most anticipated films of the year, only the Phantom Menace was more anticipated. Being Stanley Kubrick's final film and starring then married couple Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman, there was good reason for it to be so anticipated. Critical reception was positive but underwhelming, critics mostly admired the film but few called it a masterpiece. Audience response was mixed to negative, Eyes Wide Shut was a modest box office success based solely on it's two stars. The opinion of some of Kubrick's films have changed drastically over the years. 2001 and The Shining received mixed to negative responses when they first debuted, now both are viewed as seminal masterpieces in their genre. It'll be interesting how Eyes Wide Shut is viewed in another ten years, I'm not so sure how it's overall legacy has changed much in the twelve years since it debuted. My opinion of Eyes Wide Shut on the first viewing was that it was an interesting failure. It had some memorable scenes and images but I just didn't see the point in the film. For the most part, it seemed like Kubrick was going through the motions and it was an underwhelming way to end a brilliant career. To say my opinion has changed is an understatement. While I would not call Eyes Wide Shut a masterpiece, I will say it is a very worthy addition to Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre and a fitting conclusion to his career. When I watch it now I see a film with some very memorable scenes and rich images, but also a fascinating look at jealousy and sexual temptation. What wasn't apparent to me on the first viewing has become so on repeated ones. The gratuitous sex doesn't seem pointless anymore, it's there for a reason. Give Kubrick credit for making sex seem so unappealing and mechanical, he's making a statement about the human condition. Sex isn't about love in EWS, very little of the sex is an act of love here, it's about filling urges and temptations. EWS has the same striking visual style as previous Kubrick films. The film has a dream-like atmosphere, which has lead some people to believe that much of what is transpiring on the screen is a dream through Tom Cruise's character. The most memorable scene is the sexual orgy, it's very Gothic with the black cloaks and the masks worn by the characters. This scene ranks up there with the most memorable imagery in Kubrick's films. Another memorable scene is Tom Cruise's character being stalked through the streets of New York. On the first viewing, I was not crazy about Tom Cruise's performance, I would've described it as 'wooden.' While I don't view it as great work and there are few instances where the performance falls flat, I think it is a generally solid performance. Nicole Kidman, though she has lesser screen time, is consistently excellent, taking attention away from Cruise every time they're on screen together. EWS is a complex film that's difficult to describe and hard to take in on a single viewing. This film needs to be watched more than once to be appreciated. Perhaps it's not for everyone, which describes most of Kubrick's films, but for the adventurous film watcher, EWS is a worthy film.",9,1,1,11 September 2011
Titanic," Succeeds as Eye Candy but not much else
","My Rating:* out of ****.Titanic is such a sensational looking film that it could be called the most expensive piece of eye candy. Like all films by James Cameron, Titanic is visually stunning from the sets to the special effects. Yet while Cameron's films are great to look at they usually have more going for them than this one. Titanic was unworthy of many of its oscars and is one of the most overrated films of all time.The first problem with this film is its script. James Cameron is not a professional at writing love stories and this clearly illustrates that point. The dialogue is corny and stupid. It makes me wonder why he didnt have Aliens invade Titanic. Yes the idea sounds horrible but I will take 'Get Away From Her You Bitch' over 'Your gonna live on and your gonna have lots of babies' I mean how corny and dumb is that.Strong Acting is a requirement for a film to succeed over a flat scrip. However, this is where Titanic fails again. I had no clue what Dicaprio was trying to do with this character. I am glad Spielberg taught him how to act in Catch Me If You Can. Kate Winslett is also horrible but her character is treated badly by the script. However, Billy Zane is actually quite good. Kathy Bates also holds her own, though her screentime is limited. Gloria Stewart is horribly irritating as the older Kate Winslett character.James Cameron is a filmmaker who has great skills. Yet those skills are not on display here. His direction comes across as inept and uninspired. His skills here are better than his skills as a screenwriter for the film but thats not saying much.Like I said, Titanic succeeds as eye candy but not much else. The Sets are glorious looking. The cinematography is beautiful. The Costumes are breathtaking to behold. The Sound is top notch. The Visual Effects rank as some of the most impressive to come out of the 90s. Titanic is nice looking in pretty much everyway. If only everything else came into play Titanic would have been a good film. The visuals of the film were something not wasted in the making of this film.Titanic suffers from two other flaws: Unconvincing Chemistry and an OVERLONG running time. The chemistry between Leo and Kate was hailed as some of the best of the 90's but I found it flatter than a pancake. Titanic is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy tooo long. It has a very uninteresting and sluggish two hours. The only excitement I got was seeing Kate Winslett's boobs, which are more impressive than the film. During its final hour, the pace does pick up. The Sinking is a glorious sight yet Leo and Kate's characters are still there. The last shot of the film is stupid, that has deleted scene written all over it.James Cameron has a solid resume of films. He created Terminator I and II, Aliens, and True Lies. All these films showed the work of a skilled director, even though The Terminator gets the lowest rating it was a good film and showed a director with skill. Titanic shows a cocky asshole who should give his oscar to Curtis Hanson(director of the superior LA Confidential). This is easily the worst I have seen from Cameron.",4,2,7,8 November 2003
The Godfather: Part III," Good but nothing compared to the other two
","Godfather III had a bunch to live up too and it didnt really deliver that much. Its a good movie but pretty flawed, when the first two were pretty flawless. Godfather III has some good things about it that if the bad hadnt been so noticable I could outweigh the bad with the good.
The acting is good with ONE exception. Al Pacino is solid as Don Corleone, but this is his weakest performance in the trilogy. Diane Keaton is passable as Kay. Andy Garcia is excellent. Talia Shire is good. But Soffia Coppola was absolutely awful. Coppola must have been desparate to put her in.
Godfather III's strengths are in some of its scenes, which it has two excellent scenes. The Atlantic City Massacre and the Opera Scene, both flawlessly shot. The movie is pretty well shot, though the other two were superiorly directed. Its well written, though the dialogue isnt as memorable in this one. The Sets and Cinematography were fantastic.

The Matrix Reloaded," Reloaded and Revolutions combined are the years most disappointig films
","My Rating: ** out of ****. I have decided to update a few reviews that I do not think are good. This is one of those reviews I felt was bad. Matrix Reloaded was the first big disappointment of the year and Revolutions only disappointed more. When The first Matrix came out it was cool. Only hints of that coolness are still in Reloaded. I will admit The Matrix was not 100% original. But The Wachowski's did the best they could and gave us cool and likable characters, a memorable villain, fantastic action and special effects, and to top it off they gave the movie an energy that alot of sci-fi films in the 90s(with the exception of one or two) lacked. When The Matrix debuted in 1999 it was a huge success and became instantly popular. If the film had any pretentions they were kept to a minimum. The same cannot be said about its sequels. The Matrix Reloaded consistently looks good. The Special Effects are great. Reloaded has the atmosphere that the first Matrix had. Although it looks a notch below what the first film looked. It is kind of odd because the first Matrix budget was 63 million and this one's is 127 million. The acting is not as good here. Keanu Reeves really does not appear much in the film. A lot of people would say thats good but you dont identify with him much here. When he occassionally says dialogue, he is very stiff. Laurence Fishburnes character has become boring but its not all his fault. Carrie Anne Moss still has her presence as Trinity. Hugo Weaving is excellent (again) as Agent Smith. There are some new annoying characters, such as the one who plays Link (irritating). The twins seemed like interesting villains but there not in here much. Monica Bellucci is wasted here, there really seems to be no point for her here. Reloaded offers some impressive action sequences. The fight scenes are all good. The fight scene with Neo versus 100 Agent Smith's was outstanding. The car scene that everyone loves is not bad but I found it overlong. If it was cut down a bit, it would have been excellent. Reloaded's main problem is that it is pretentious. The dialogue that is spoken here is pretentious and near the end of the movie it is unbearable. There are also some pointless scenes. The Zion dancing shirt scene was dumb and pointless. The talking was awful as mentioned. Overall, Reloaded does have good points but the bad significantly outweighs them.",5,0,0,24 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," A Big Disappointment
","I was hoping Matrix Reloaded would not be a shi**y sequel. Well it wasnt exactly shi**y but it wasnt that good either. It has alot of problems.First off, it does have an awesome fight scene between Neo and the 20 something agent smith. That was really awesome. The fight scene where Neo is fighting those guys on those fancy stairs isnt bad either. But the Car Chase is way too long and becomes boring. The Special effects are good but not as good as the first one. There are alot of scenes in Reloaded that just go on way too long.The dialogue was combined with east and west philosophy. Some think this is a good idea, but I dont. It makes the movie really boring and all you hear is talking. Pointless talking. Its just boring.All 3 of the main characters, are not as good as they were in the first Matrix. Carrie Anne Moss was fine and was better than Fishburne and Reeves. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith was really good but was bnetter in the first Matrix. The character Link in the Matrix, who replaces Tank from the first one was annoying. 4 out of 10.",5,0,0,1 June 2003
Mystic River," It has alot of strengths but it is not quite a masterpiece
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Mystic River is without a doubt one of the best movies of the year. In fact, it maybe the best I have seen so far. It has alot of strengths but it is not quite a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, Mystic River is a great film but it has one significant flaw in it. Mystic River is a powerful, dark, and depressing film. Anyone who does not like dark films should best stay away. It features a powerful performance by Sean Penn. He shows such real emotion in this film. This will no doubt lead to his fourth Oscar nomination. Penn gives a brilliant, flawless interpretation of his character. Following Penn closely behind is Tim Robbins. Robbins performance is much more low-key than Penn's. However, its nearly as effective. His character has alot of pain inside. Because of Robbins we feel the pain he is going through. If he does not get an Oscar Nomination, it will be a damn tragedy because he deserves it. The third most effective performance belongs to Marcia Gay Harden. I am not as familar with her work but she was perfectly cast here. Her character is the wife of Tim Robbins character. She plays a scared housewife who is not sure if she believes her husband perfectly. The rest of the cast gives solid performances, although maybe not Oscar worthy. Laura Linney is solid, shes not in the movie for more than 10 minutes, but her speech at the end definitely is her high point. As much as I like Kevin Bacon as an actor, he will not get an Oscar nomination. He is solid but not great. Laurence Fishburne is also solid.
One thing that I definitely noticed in the film was the mood. The cinematography has a real gloomy look to it, which fits the film perfectly. The score of the film is also excellent. The script was written by Brian Helgeland, who was the man who wrote the brilliant script for LA Confidential. Theres no doubt he used alot of his talents to adapt the book but there is one significant flaw in the script. The conflicts that Penn and Robbins characters have our so well presented. But Bacon's is so undeveloped. I am not sure if thats a problem with the book or Helgeland's fault. But with this flaw, I could not give it a four-star rating. Some complain about the ending. However, I think its the perfect conclusion. A theme in Mystic River is loyalty and this is so well presented at the end of the movie. It also shows a sign of rejection. Clint Eastwood has crafted one of the years best. I dont know where Mystic River will end up this year on my top ten list because I still have alot to see. Although, I am pretty sure it will be there somewhere.",9,0,1,17 November 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A Very Good Movie
","I am sick of people saying this is a bad movie because its not. Its very good, though it may have a couple of flaws. It has top notch acting, a well written screenplay, and pretty well directed.Russell Crowe was screwed out of an oscar. Jennifer Connelly rightfully won an oscar. The rest of the cast was pretty good too.Minor SpoilerThe only flaws in this movie deal with John Nash when he doesnt realize he has schizphrenia and hes in that car. How can he be riding in a car when the person driving it isnt real. There was also one other occasion where something like this happened but I keep forgetting what it was.
Alot of people are p***ed off this won Best Picture. I have seen 3 out of the 5 best picture nominees and I can say this is the best so far. Moulin Rouge was Very Good but not quite as good as A Beautiful Mind. LOTR: FOTR was good, visually stunning and mostly entertaining, but its overrated. It moved slow in areas where it should've moved alot faster. I didnt see Gosford Park or In The Bedroom so I cant judge those.9 out of 10.",9,0,2,2 June 2003
Die Hard," This movie has alot of energy
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****One word I would use to describe Die Hard is energetic. Once this movie gets started it doesnt slow down. The action scenes arent overblown like some in the movies today. The movie is set at a perfect pace. Although the movie is expertly paced, it is well made in other areas. The movie is well written, both storywise and dialogue. It has some very good one-liners. Another area that is worth mentioning in Die Hard is the acting. Bruce Willis may not be the Best Actor, but he is very good as John McClane. Alan Rickman is fantastic as the villain, possibly the best or at least one of the best villains in an action movie. The rest of the cast gives solid performances. Die Hard may just be some action movie, but it is one of the best.

When Harry Met Sally...," One of the best Romantic Comedies out there
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. If you have read my reviews that I have posted(I do not blame you if you have not, they are awful), you will know that I am not a huge fan of Romantic Comedies. I mostly avoid them at all costs. The only time I will watch one is if someone forces me or I am bored (or possibly near death). However, I had heard nothing but good things about When Harry Met Sally so not only decide to watch the film, I decided to buy the DVD. Buying the DVD was clearly not a mistake. Its hard to say why When Harry Met Sally works so well. It maybe because of the director. However, it may have more to do with the actors. Another possibility would be the script. It is all three of them put together. Today, the scripts in Romantic Comedies range from average to sub-par. It is usually the actors that make the difference in today's Romantic Comedies.
Rob Reiner was the perfect choice for directing the film. I cannot honestly say Rob Reiner was typecast as a director(he did do Misery and A Few Good Men)but this was the kind of film he did well. He was known for his more upbeat films. I am unable to say When Harry met Sally was hist best Film (I have not seen all his film and I slightly preferred The Princess Bride) but Reiner's work here is a reason the film works. Put this film in the hands of an unexperienced and untalented director, it is possible this film would not have been as successful. The acting is pretty damn close to perfect. This is without a doubt the best performance given by Billy Crystal. The same goes for Meg Ryan, who's last couple of performances(mainly Kate and Leopold and Proof of Life) have been quite dull. These two also exhibit a great deal of chemistry.
The supporting actors to get the most screentime are Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher(who are also a couple). Bruno Kirby does a solid job as Harry's best friend. Likewise for Carrie Fisher as Sally's Best Friend. These two do not have as much screentime but they work well together. The screenplay is written by Nora Ephron. She has a lot of experience with Romantic Comedies(she also wrote Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail). Her script is a huge reason the film works. Today, the characters in Romantic Comedies usually say some cliched dialogue, not so here. Ephron's dialogue is fresh and smart. There are a bunch of quotable lines. For the most part, her script does follow the formula but the characters and dialogue are so well-written that When Harry Met Sally seems different.
When Harry Met Sally represented a pinnacle for nearly everyone involved. Most of the cast had never been better(at least from what I have seen from them). Nora Ephron's You've Got Mail was enjoyable but paled to When Harry Met Sally(I did not see Sleepless in Seattle). Like I said, I do not feel this was Rob Reiner's best film but it does come close. I strongly recommend the film.",9,1,3,9 February 2004
Jaws," Spielberg at the top of his game
","My Rating: **** out of ****. Steven Spielberg is one of the best American directors working today. He has made many films that have been hailed as classics. Yet before the Dinosaurs, Holocaust, Peter Pan, UFO's, and Indy there was the Shark. Jaws represents one of the masterpieces on Spielbergs resume. It is also probably the 'Quintessential Spielberg Film.' Jaws was very popular when released, it was the gighest grossing film of 1975. It spawned three sequels, which were all inferior. In fact, no film about Sharks or any killer fish has been able to come close to the level of Jaws. The genius in Jaws is its ability to build suspense. The Shark is never really shown till near the end of the film. When ever the Shark is approaching its victims, we get the Sharks point of view, instead of seeing the Shark. These POV shots combined with John Williams very effective score, make the scenes when the Shark is about to devour his victims much more effective. Evry actor does a nice job with their performances. Roy Scheider brings Martin to life. Martin is not a showy character but Scheider is able to make us like him. Richard Dreyfuss exhibits energy in his performance as Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw is very effective as Quint, that Indiannapolis speech is still very chilling to me. Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton also give solid support. People always talk about how fake the Shark looks. I think its passable but today it would definitely be done by CGI. However, the Shark is not seen that much in the film so its not that big of a deal. I would like to say Jaws is Spielbergs best film, Schindlers List closely follows. But I would like to see Close Encouners and the Indiana Jones films again. I did not like Close Encounters the first time, and I like the Indiana Jones films but they never stood out to me. If these films dont surpass Jaws, then it is definitely Spielberg's best film.",10,72,132,11 November 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," A Compelling Film
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. SpoilersIn many ways, I am more than a little shocked at the overwhelming popularity of The Shawshank Redemption. I am not in anyway saying that it is a bad film, in fact its a great film. However, I never thought Shawshank would appeal to so many people. It just seems odd that it has received over 112,000 votes (More than the Godfather) and it is #2 on the Imdb top 250 list. I do not think it deserves this high position but it is nice to see the film get alot of notice.Shawshank deserves high marks in these categories: Directing, Acting, Cinematography, and Writing. This was the debut feature for Frank Darabont and he chooses to let Shawshank unravel at a slow pace. This is the perfect choice for the film. It moves slow but it is nevertheless compelling. There is only one time when the slow pace actually interferes with the film.
Darabont also gets some highly impressive from his cast. Tim Robbins gives a strong, subdued performance. Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, does an equally strong job here. The chemistry between them is effective too. As strong as the two leads are, they do not outshine the supporting cast. All of them are excellent but two of them deserve to be singled out. James Whitmore gives a brilliantly moving performance. Bob Gunton also deserves mention as the warden in charge of Shawshank. Cinematographer Roger Deakins should be given a lot of credit. He finds the perfect mood for the film. Shawshank is not a colorful place at all. He creates a dreary atmosphere that fits the film perfectly. There alot of uses of the color, gray that is used to create this atmosphere.
I have heard a couple of complaints that the film gets a little preachy at times. I cannot find where it does. In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is a well-written film. There are numerous memorable quotes.Shawshank does have one flaw. I think it begins to drag near the end. This happens after Morgan Freeman is released from prison. These moments are the only times when the slow pace interferes with the film.
While I do not think the film deserves its high spot on the 250 list, it is a compelling and moving film. Shawshank does enough things right to overlook its sluggish ending. I recommend the film to everyone.",9,0,1,15 March 2004
Platoon," A Masterpiece
","My Rating: **** out of ****. Out of the Vietnam War films I have seen, Platoon is definitely the best. It is also the best film I have seen yet from Oliver Stone. If I had to describe Platoon I would say it is a gut-wrenching experience. The film realistically shows a platoon of men with their deadly battles against the enemy and themselves during the War. Acting is a big strength in a film. Charlie Sheen is quite believable here as Chris Taylor. Tom Berenger is perfect as the tough-ass Sergeant Barnes. Willem Defoe is also great as Colonel Elias (I think he is a colonel), who is much more understanding than Barnes. Everyone else is quite memorable too. The Cinematography is quite stunning in Platoon, probably the best cinematography I have seen in a war film. Stone's direction is perfect. A rarity in war films is a really well-written script, Platoon is extremely well-written. If you watch you will notice some disturbing scenes that were quite effective to me (The Village Scene). These scenes represent the absolute horror of what we do to the innocent in war. Although, Platoon's score is not original (It was in The Elephant Man, 6 years earlier) it is effective, it illustrates the tragedy of war effectively. Platoon is a masterpiece that will stay with you for awhile.",10,1,2,16 September 2003
Halloween," A Horror Classic
","Halloween is to Jamie Lee Curtis as Alien is to most of its cast.Both of these movies were career starters, and they came out in consecutive years. Both movies also started careers for their directors. In my opinion, Halloween is the better film though.John Carpenter is usually regarded as a hit or miss director. He wasnt that successful in the 90s. Village of the Damned and Vampires were eaten alive by critics. His recent movie, Ghost Of Mars got absolutely horrible reviews. Besides the other three movies I have mentioned, I saw his version of Stephen King's Christine which I believe to be kind of underrated. But whatever he has done or will do in the near future will never beat this Horror Classic.The acting is actually pretty good. Jamie Lee Curtis is very believable as Laurie Strode. Donald Pleasence does a solid job. Lauries friends(forgot the actresses names) do solid jobs too.One element of Halloween that may be a bit underappreciated is the dialogue. Some may find the dialogue a little lame. But I think the dialogue fits the characters perfectly. Laurie's dialogue is more intelligent than her friends because basically she is more intelligent than her two friends. They both have kind of airheadish dialogue (especially Linda).Other features notable of Halloween are its music. Its actually quite memorable music. It gets more climatic and eventually ends when Michael has killed his victims.Some critics and moviegoers may compare Halloween to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and actually may say that it is better. While I dont happen to think it is better, it is a very good movie.The one flaw in Halloween is that in someway its a little too similar to Psycho. Im not sure how, its just afeeling. For that I cannot give it a 10.Overall, Halloween is definitely worth a 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,18 August 2003
Blade Runner," Good but Flawed
","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. Blade Runner is one of three films that was adapted from a Phillip K. Dick sci-fi story. The other two films were Minority Report and Total Recall. Out of those three Minority Report is the best. Blade Runner ranks as second but it has some flaws that cannot be ignored. I have a complaint about the casting. Harrison Ford is miscast here, I know they wanted to put Ford here after his two excellent performances as Han Solo in the Star Wars films, but I found him flat here. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah dont have much acting to do here, but they do an adequate job nonetheless. The standout is undeniably Rutger Hauer, who is excellent as the bad guy, he is intimidating and he steals scenes from Ford and anyother actor in the film. Nothing is more impressive here than the visuals. The Visual Effects still look fantastic, even 20 years later. The sets and the cinematography are excellent. The film has a dark film-noirish atmosphere to it. Its impossible not to be impressed by the visuals. Blade Runner is an example of style over substance. The movie has loads of style but it also has a thin plot and some uninteresting characters. Visuals reign supreme over the entire movie. However, Blade Runner is still worth watching, even though I do not feel it is the best sci-fi film.",8,1,2,28 September 2003
Bruce Almighty," Has some funny moments but is overall a mediocre film
","My Rating: ** out of ****. Jim Carrey is one of the most consistently funny actor/comedian working today. He was hilarious in films like The Mask, Liar Liar, and Me Myself and Irene (to name a few). Such a hilarious performer would be welcomed in Bruce Almighty, but the Carrey that was in the films I named is not here.
Bruce Almighty has an interesting premise. What would you do if you were God? The film explores this and has one hilarious moment from exploring it. That scene deals with a news broadcaster. However, thats one of the few laughs you get from this movie. The movie is 100 minutes long and that is waaaaayyyyyyy too long. Jim Carrey is obviously not in top form here. His character is a brat and not very likable. Carrey does not seem to be enjoying what he is doing either. Jennifer Aniston has no chemistry with Carrey and does virtually nothing. No other actor really makes a difference either. Phillip Baker Hall is underused. Like Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty has an uneven script. The Comedy was strong in Liar but weak in the dramatic areas. Carrey took advantage of the comedy parts and was consistently hilarious. However, the comedy is not really strong here, its mostly stupid and not in a good way. The drama is horrible too, much worse than Liar. At the end, the screenwriters intended for us to feel sorry for Bruce. Bruce is a jerk and the ending was very corny.
The film also came off a bit selfish. Carrey's character was selfish but it was more than that. An interesting premise and one or two good laughs followed by a very weak script, uninspired performances, and an overlong running time do not mesh well.",5,0,0,30 November 2003
Ben-Hur," A little Overrated but still a good movie
","Ben Hur is a grandiose epic, grandiose perfectly describes this movie. Alot of s**t happens in this movie. More than any other Epic before. Its a visually stunning movie. The Sets, The Costumes, everything about it technical wise is great. But in my opinion this movie is not a masterpiece like everyone else says. It has some flaws that are not ignorable.
The cast is a mixed bag. Some are good and some arent so good. Charlton Heston is not one of the ones that arent good, he is fantastic he was belivable all the way through. The script is poorly written in areas in the beginning.The Sea battle is good but not as good as the most famous scene in the movie. The Chariot Scene is as great as I have heard, its so well shot you feel like your actually there.Overall, I dont think its a masterpiece but its a good movie, nonetheless.",8,1,3,10 May 2003
Signs," An Improvement Over Unbreakable
","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. In 1999, M. Night Shyamalan made a movie called the Sixth Sense, In My Opinion it was a near-masterpiece. The Next Year, he made his follow up film Unbreakable, while the film was good it was also a bit of a disappointment. In 2002, Shyamalan has made Signs, it is a good movie, one of the best movies of the summer of 2002, but not quite as good as The Sixth Sense.The acting is pretty good. Mel Gibson is quite good here. Joaquin Phoenix delievers a great and funny performance. The two kids also deliver good performances. Shyamalan has a role in his movie, but he is actually the weak point in the acting. Signs is a well-written and well planned thriller. The movie jumped me a few times and gave me the creeps. The film also has a very good and effective Music Score. The only problem with this movie is the ending, I didnt figure it out but the thrills werent up as high as the endings of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. But Signs remains entertaing and is a well-made film.",8,0,2,14 September 2003
Identity," A Good, Interesting Film
","My Rating: *** out of ****. Possible SpoilersIdentity is a good film in a rather unimpressive year of films. It represents good entertainment in what could have been just another cliched horror film. Identity is interesting, atmospheric, and entertaining.
Even if it was cliched, Identity would still be suspenseful. Director James Mangold seems to really know what hes doing here. I dont know much about the rest of his work but I have heard he has done some solid films.
The acting definitely elevates Identity. While not award-winning performances, they are solid. John Cusack does a solid job in his role. Ray Liotta will forever be typecast as a tough guy, but hes so damn good you wont care. Amanda Peet does a nice job with her performance. John Hawkes is frequently scene stealing. Everyone else gives solid support.
Identity has a surprise around every corner. They deal with exactly why the characters are at the hotel and there is a surprise ending. Unfortunately, the surprise ending is a bit of a letdown. Its not that the thing with multiple personalities is not clever, its just that I did not totally get it. I dont want to say it had no logic in it but I just dont know. It may require another viewing. Overall, I was satisfied by Identity. It was a breath of fresh air for this year. I recommend Identity to pretty much everyone.",8,0,0,20 November 2003
The Sixth Sense," Very Good Thriller
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. The Sixth Sense was undeniably one of the best films of 1999. Director-Writer M. Night Shyamalan claims he is a fan of Hitchcock and it definitely shows. I am not saying The Sixth Sense is a rip off of a Hitchcock film but its definitely Hitchcock-like. If Hitchcock saw this movie I am sure he would be very impressed. The genius of The Sixth Sense is definitely in its script. The dialogue is well-written, but most importantly its very well structured. The Structure is relatively simple but it hides the twist at the end while revealing some clues along the way. None of the clues gave away the ending for me. The twist is simple yet very effective. I was blown away at the end of the film. Shyamalan has written a very, very good screenplay. The Script is probably the main strength of the film, but the acting is also quite good. Bruce Willis is surprisingly good in a restrained performance as a psychiatrist. Haley Joel Osment is excellent as the disturbed boy, Cole. Toni Collette is very good as Cole's mother. Shyamalan is fine in a small cameo. The movie is also atmospheric and chilling. So many memorable scenes, but one scene looked very awkward to me. Its a scene between Bruce Willis Character (Malcolm Crowe) and Cole that seemed a bit too sentimental to me. Other than that, Sixth Sense is a very good thriller.",9,1,2,29 September 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Tremendously Crafted Horror Film
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. If Nightmare on Elm Street only proves one thing it proves that Wes Craven is one of the best horror directors. I admit I haven't seen all of Craven's films but I have obviously seen Nightmare and I have seen the Scream films. While I think the Scream films are good in their own right (well Scream 3 was a bit of a letdown), Nightmare clearly shows his talent as a horror director. Good Horror films are a rarity nowadays, Great ones are almost non-existent. Today, we get stuff like the overrated, pretentious 28 Days Later and the amateurish Blair Witch Project. Oh sure there have been good entries like the previously mentioned Scream films, the recent remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the Ring but horror films are usually the most ineffectively made films  today. Nightmare on Elm Street is proof that a great horror film can still be made. It belongs in the company of Alien, The Exorcist, Halloween, and The Shining. If I had to be real critical, I think it's a small step below the second, third  and a bigger step below the first and last one (since I consider Alien and The Shining to be the best horror films ever made, although Alien also belongs in Sci-Fi) but it clearly belongs in that exceptional group of films. Nightmare is not a conventional horror film. This is not about a killer going around killing stupid people with an ax, knife, or machete. No, this film is about a killer that gets you in your dreams-or nightmares. Craven, who wrote the script, creates two worlds: one where your awake and a dream world. His script is intelligently constructed so that at times, we don't if one of the characters is awake or dreaming and that makes the film all the more thrilling. Nightmare also has a unique style. Nightmare is a highly atmospheric film but contains some unusual sequences. When Nancy (the main character of the film) is trying to outrun Freddy (You ought to know who he is by now) her foot sinks into the steps like they are quicksand. There is also a chilling sequence where Nancy is pulled under bath water into a black pool.
The acting, while not extraordinary, is effective. Heather Langenkamp is solid as Nancy. She makes her into a more intelligent person than most protagonists in horror films and she definitely gets us on her side. Johnny Depp, in his first starring role, is also solid. Ronee Blakely is very effective in her somewhat limited role as Nancy's mother.
Robert Englund became famous after his first role as Freddy in Nightmare. Freddy is a pretty gross sight, he burns and bleeds green (the make-up job on englund is excellent). This really isn't much of an acting performance for Englund, but when Freddy speaks you can tell he has a vicious personality. This is no Michael or Jason, who don't say a damn thing. Freddy has more of a personality. He also has a backstory that is revealed enough to make us more afraid of him without spoiling anything.
Nightmare on Elm Street is Wes Craven at the top of his game. He generates a high amount of tension and delivers the thrill required for horror film. It's tough to say whether he'll top this effort but if he doesn't he can be proud of this brilliant horror film. Nightmare may not quite be perfect but its faults are minor and do not harmfully damage the film.",9,0,0,23 August 2004
The Matrix," A Really Good Movie and I now appreciate it even more
","When I saw The Matrix I thought it was Really good. But now since Ive seen Reloaded I appreciate even more. The Matrix has very good visual effects and has some decent acting. Keanu Reeves is not a great actor, he can be good and can be bad. This is where he is good. Laurence Fishburne also turns in a pretty good performance as Morpheus. Carrie Moss is also good as Trinity. But the standout I think is Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, he is excellent. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,25 May 2003
Jackie Brown," Entertaining but not a Masterpiece
","My Rating: *** out of ****. When it came out there was no doubt that people would be disappointed by Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's follow up to his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. People thought by some miracle that Jackie Brown would be the masterpiece that Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction was. Sadly, it was not the case and Jackie Brown did not receive half the critical praise or the box office that Pulp did. Unfortunately, while Jackie Brown is entertaining in its own right, has a brilliant performance by Samuel L. Jackson, and has some great lines of dialogue, it is not a masterpiece. The good news is that it is a good film and definitely worth watching. It was just unfortunate enough that it would be compared to Pulp Fiction. The difference between this and Tarantino's other films is that this is an adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel, Rum Punch. Admittedly, I have not read the book so I can't compare the two. Leonard is supposedly famous for the snappy dialogue he writes. Tarantino admits that he is somewhat influenced by Leonard. So its kind of hard to tell if the dialogue here is Tarantino's or if its Leonards but there are some great lines here. Theres actually a conversation that really stands out. Its a conversation about hiding in a trunk, whether this is Leonards or Tarantino's, its got classic written all over it. Unfortunately, while there are some great lines here, theres not nearly as much as there was in Pulp Fiction.
Samuel L. Jackson has always been one of my favorite actors. I have yet to see him turn in a bad performance. His work as Ordell Robbie ranks with the best I have seen from him. Its a compelling, mesmerizing performance that rivals his performance in Pulp Fiction as his best work.
No one in the cast matches Jackson's performance but they give solid support. Many people have said that the best performances given in the film were done by Pam Grier and Robert Forster. While I thought that both did solid jobs, I didn't find anything remarkable about their performances. Despite being somewhat underused, Robert De Niro gives an entertaining performance. Bridget Fonda is also well cast as a pothead.
Stylistically, this is a toned down Tarantino film. The film moves at a slower, deliberate pace. Tarantino does use a split-screen but only once and briefly. The most intriguing thing Tarantino does is show a crucial sequence in the film from three different perspectives. I am not exactly sure of the reason behind this but it was interesting. Overall, Jackie Brown is an entertaing film that even though its not a masterpiece I would still like to see it again. I did think it could have used a little trimming towards the end but perhaps its because I saw it on TV and it was with all those damn commercials. I may review this film again after I watch it on DVD. So if I do feel different in anyway expect a changed review.",8,1,3,3 May 2004
Gangs of New York," A huge disappointment
","My Rating: ** out of ****. Gangs Of New York was a big disappointment. I am a huge Scorsese fan, but this has to be the worst of his films so far. It has some redeeming qualites but not enough to save it. The acting is a disappointment, especially for such a good cast. Leonardo Dicaprio is notably miscast, his Irish accent also varies. Daniel Day Lewis is mostly good, but got way too much attention. He occasionally overacts, so im not sure his performance was worth a nomination. Cameron Diaz is also miscast, but I think her character is pretty unneccessary, and I really didnt find much chemistry between her and Dicaprio. Technical Categories are where Gangs Of New York shines. The Sets are magnificent, the Cinematography is good, and the Costumes are also nice. The Original Song is also great. Gangs Of New York also has some memorabl scenes and is visually stunning, but the script is also weak, the movie is 45 minutes too long, and the acting is a huge disappointment.",5,2,4,15 September 2003
Gladiator," Ridley Scott's Best Film To Date
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Although Gladiator is not my favorite Ridley scott film (that title belongs to Alien), I do believe it to be his best achievement. Gladiator features things Scott has improved upon from his past movies. Gladiator features some great acting, impressive direction, and very satisfying visuals.
The acting is a major strength. Russell Crowe applys himself in this role and does a very good job, he is a perfect gladiator. Connie Nielsen does an admirable job. The standout is Joaquin Phoenix, who is brilliant as Commodus, he makes the villain so deliciously evil that hes impossible to like. The supporting cast all do strong jobs too.There is a dark tone in Gladiator. Its especially evident with the scenes between Commodus and his father. Also, between him and his sister.
The film also has stunning visuals. Great Sets, Good Cinematography, and Stunning Costumes. The Visual Effects are also top notch. The fight scenes are also expertly filmed. A Film with all these stunning visuals may lack a good script, but this film does not. Its script may not be its biggest strength, but it is well written. The film also features a rousing score. Gladiator pretty much remains entertaining throughout, it is a violent film but I wouldnt say its gratuitous. Gladiator is definitely worth your while to see.",9,1,2,14 September 2003
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An improvement over 'Fallen' but well short of the first film
","My Rating: **1/2 out of ****Spoilers As far as summer blockbusters go, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is adequate but underwhelming. While a big improvement over it's predecessor, Revenge of the Fallen, which was stupid even by director Michael Bay's standards, Dark of the Moon is no better than mediocre. There's a lot of flash here but for a film that's over two and a half hours you need more than that and Dark of the Moon is pretty hollow. When the first Transformers came out it provided eye-popping special effects with spectacular, though at times a little hectic, actions scenes and it did present characters you could at least identify with and care about. It wasn't a deep film by any means but it didn't pretend to be. Unfortunately, spectacular visuals and action scenes with a dumb plot only worked for one film. The two sequels are ridiculously too long and the cuts are so fast during the action that you have no idea what's going on, and by the end you don't even care. To be fair, Dark of the Moon is not a terrible film, it even has some merits. I really liked how Bay took a real historical event like the moon landing and injected the Transformers into it. I had reservations about this when I saw the first trailer but really it's done quite well and we even get a compelling reason why another man has not set foot on the moon in over forty years. This was also done in this Summer's far superior X-Men: First Class, which used the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also, it's interesting that Sentimel Prime, an Autobot, is the villain of the film. This makes the Decepticons no more than a foot note but it is at least an interesting approach. For about 90 minutes, Dark of the Moon is entertaining enough. The visuals are still spectacular (never a problem with this franchise) and things move fairly quickly. I can honestly say I did not expect to see Sentinel Prime join with the Decepticons so that was a nice unexpected turn. However, there is still another hour to go and those 60 minutes feel like an eternity! The action isn't compelling and it's so drawn out that you're just aching to leave, but you spent $15 and want to stick it out to the bitter end.One final complaint; I don't like 3-D. Michael Bay decided he would to do Dark of the Moon in 3-D and it was a mistake. It's hard on the eyes and does nothing to enhance the cinematic experience. Unfortunately, moviegoers are going to have to put up with this nuisance more and more in action films so we're stuck with it.If all you're interested in is great visuals and some mindless action, give Transformers: Dark of the Moon a shot. It wasn't worth the $15 ticket, could've been an hour shorter, and better off without the 3-D, but while it maybe underwhelming it's not a terrible film. Still, if you're anybody but a die-hard Transformers fan I'd wait for DVD.",Null,0,2,13 July 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I enjoyed the film but I would definitely not call it the best of the three
","My Rating: *** out of ****. It is rare when a third film in a trilogy ends up being the best. In fact, they are mostly the weakest in the trilogy. Look what happened this year with Matrix Revolutions. It made 150 million dollars at the US Box Office when it was expected to do a lot better. It was not well received either (I gave it a *1/2, although I am not a 'real' critic). Unfortunately, while The Last Crusade is very entertaining, it also proves that the third film ends up being the weakest. It is a satisfying, worthwhile conclusion to the trilogy but it disappoints in a few areas. Raiders of the Lost Ark is rightfully hailed as one of the best action/adventure films ever made. When it came out in 1981, it was a huge Box Office Hit and received many Oscar Nominations(including Best Picture and Best Director). Three Years Later came its sequel/prequel: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. It was not as well received. A lot of people complained that it was too dark and violent(some say that film is the reason we have the PG-13 Rating, it certainly deserved it). The film did well but it left some fans cold. It would be five years for the third and hopefully final Indiana Jones film. The Last Crusade was better received and did better at the Box Office. Fans were happy and some consider it to be the best.  Yet but if you think about it the plot of The Last Crusade is just the Raiders formula with a few minor changes. Even if you hated The Temple of Doom, it at least did something different. Spielberg and Lucas took a chance with Temple of Doom and when they were criticized they backed away. They went with the easy money formula for the next film. Recently, I just watched The Last Crusade and I actually found the beginning to be kind of sluggish. The early action scenes are especially low on tension. The train sequence and the boat ride in Venice are competently done by Spielberg but they are not that exciting. The Rat Scene has a lot more tension than those two action scenes(I hate Rats), although it is not as suspenseful as the snake scene in Raiders. Its when Indy arrives at a castle in Austria(I think its Austria) that the tension goes up. The action scenes from then on are exciting. We get to see Indy's Dad(a Delightfully Entertaining Sean Connery) and the sluggish feel is pretty much gone.One other complaint I have with the film is that the tone is too jokey. Some of the attempts at humor are not funny. I was amused when Indy's Dad accidentally shot their plane with the machine gun. However, I was not amused by many of the other attempts at humor.  Harrison Ford is in top form here. He has been perfect as Indy from the beginning of Raiders all the way to the end of this film. I will through a fit if he does Indy 4 though(He is waaay too old). However, Ford is nearly matched by Sean Connery as Indy's Father. His performance here may not be his greatest, but he is wonderfully entertaining. However, the villain is a disappointment. Julian Glover just cannot play a good villain. He was passable in For Your Eyes Only but will never be remembered as one of the best Bond villains. Julian Glover is adequate but easily the worst of the Indy villain. Michael Byrne is effective as Colonel Vogel(the villains side kick type) but even he will not be remembered.
The girl is another disappointment. Alison Doody is completely forgettable as Dr. Schneider. Kate Capshaw may have been a little annoying but she was certainly better than her replacement(although this maybe considered to be Karen Allen's replacement, its kind of confusing). I kind of wonder why Karen Allen was not brought back. I would have welcomed her with open arms.
Nevertheless, despite the flaws I mentioned this is still worth checking out. It brings the trilogy to a satisfying end (It better be the end!!!!!!!!!). Really, The Last Crusade is just the Raiders formula put to effective use.",8,1,2,4 March 2004
The Birds," Not Hitchcock's best but still Very Good and a personal favorite of mine
","Hitchcock has made many memorable and suspenseful movies. The Birds is among them. It has chilling and very memorable scenes. The acting in The Birds is good but definitely not as good as in say Notorious or some other of Hitchcock's movies. Tippi Hedren is good in one of her first roles but she is a little bit stiff in areas. Rod Taylor is good in his role. Veronica Cartwright is much more impressive here than she would be in Alien, she plays Cathy quite well. Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette give good, credible performances.The premise of the Birds is interesting. Its Man vs. Nature, though its not the first time its been done. Its a conflict that ends in a surprising way, that during the time the movie was made, only Hitchcock would have ended it like this. It has a powerful ending. The Birds is not a flawless film. The dialogue was not award material then and certainly not now, but for the movie the dialogue works well. However, the scenes are whats important in The Birds. The scenes are well put together and well shot by Hitchcock. One scene that is unforgettable in The Birds is when Melanie(Tippi Hedren) sees The Birds perched on the Playground equipment and the power wires and she slowly walks into the school. This is an absolutely chilling scene, the way its crafted. Some may think The Birds has dated because of its special effects. I will admit The Birds special effects have not aged as well as say 2001's have but I think The Birds special effects are still exceptional. But maybe one may have to really like the movie to see that.One thing that recently jumped out to me about The Birds is the main character, Melanie. Is she bad luck? The script shows us that the attacks didnt start happening until Melanie came to the little Calfornia town. But also her mother left her when she was young and in the end out of her and Mitch's (Rod Taylor) family, she is the only one that gets hurt. Also Annie dies when Melanie had been staying with her. Overall, The Birds is definitely not Hitchcock's best film but it is very good and a personal favorite of mine. 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,25 August 2003
Jurassic Park," An Exercise in Special Effects
","My Rating: *** out of ****.Jurassic Park represents good entertainment and a brilliant exercise in Special Effects. The Special Effects rank as some of the most impressive of the 90s. The action scenes are brilliantly executed. The acting is probably the weakest point in the movie. You would probably expect this in this kind of movie. Sam Neil is believable as a scientist that isnt particularly fond of children. Laura Dern is equally believable as his partner, there was a sign of chemistry between them. Jeff Goldblum is the standout, all the good lines come from him. The kids are consistently annoying with their screaming and well mostly there just annoying. Samuel L. Jackson is in here briefly but he is memorable.The story is mostly there for the special effects to be there. It is mostly unimportant, all you really need to see is the dinosaurs. They are so real you wont believe it. Jurassic Park is pretty well-paced, though some scenes maybe a bit overlong. The main reason to see Jurassic Park is for the special effects and to be entertained. Its not the best Spielberg film, but for two-hours you will be able to enjoy. Besides the special effects, nothing is really special about Jurassic Park. It represents something to entertain the audience and it succeeds.",8,1,2,25 September 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A Dull Movie
","My Rating: ** out of ****. I consider myself a Cohen Brothers fan. I loved both Fargo and Raising Arizona. But I was disappointed with this movie. I found it to be quite dull. The acting was ok. George Clooney was miscast though, in my opinion. The other two fugitives were good though. Holly Hunter was fine. John Goodman was good, as he is in most of the Cohen Brothers movies.
The writing is fine, it has some good lines but its flat compared to the likes of Fargo. The direction is fine. What really shines is the beautiful Cinematography. Thats one nomination the movie did deserve.",5,0,2,6 September 2003
The Godfather," My Favorite Movie
","I have actually already posted a review of The Godfather but my ID was erased for some reason (emfern13). So on with the review. The Godfather is the best Mafia film ever made and also the best film ever made period. The acting is fantastic. Marlon Brando is brillianty as Vito Corleone aka The Godfather. Al Pacino is great as Michael but why is he a Supporting Role? James Caan is excellent, a standout performance as the hot tempered Santino.The acting is also helped by a fantastic script and masterful direction. 10 out of 10.",10,1,4,22 April 2003
