The Ring," Confusing
","This film was entertaining, but was extremely implausible and confusing. Naomi Watts was very good as were the rest of the cast.  The director borrowed from many other horror films (the titles from The Shining, the boy from The Omen, the flies from the Amityville Horror).  It had some great scary moments, but is not a great film.  The cinematography was excellent and the music was very good.",5,1,2,30 May 2004
Public Enemies," Awful Film
","This is a story not worth telling. Although well acted, it was incredibly boring from the beginning and went nowhere. The love story developed in about 2 seconds and never evolved. Mann failed to show why this couple even liked each other.So, with a poorly developed love story, there was nothing left but the main predictable and aimless story. What do we learn from this film? Nothing. A guy has an addiction to robbing banks? This is a D- version of 'Heat' but with one storyline and a shadow of a love story.Mann thinks he's being original by having Dillinger casually walk around a section of the police department that is dedicated to tracking him down. We've seen the kind of character bravado in WAY too many films. It is no longer original. It's boring.This was incredibly painful to watch because it dulls the mind so much. It is by far, Mann's WORST film ever.D-",1,4,10,6 July 2009
American Hustle," Awful
","This movie was terrible. It was too long, confusing, boring, poorly directed and poorly written. The pace was all over the place. It was a poor man's Scorsese. Christian Bale did a Robert Deniro ripoff. The actors should have been reigned in by the director, but were given too much freedom. I'm surprised that the film has made so much money, but that doesn't mean it's a good film. It's a film that COULD have been great, but it failed in almost every way. David O. Russell was trying to be Martin Scorsese: (1) Christian Bale was doing a Deniro imitation (2) Same narration style as many of Scorsese's films (3) Mob/Casino theme (4) Out of control wife and mistress (5) Similar music supervision style (such a Scorsese ripoff, it's embarrassing)The cinematography was unfocused! Sometime the camera would pan slightly for no reason. Most of the actors' East Coast accents were borderline cartoonish. I suspect (and hope) that a lot of the dialog was improvised because it was distracting, slowed down the film and didn't help propel the storyline. Where were the producers? They should have demanded rewrites and a better edit. I can't believe this film was released this way. If this foreshadows the future quality of films, I'm going to stop watching films. In the hands of a different director, this could have been good.This is a contender for the Oscars? It's all vapid hype! This film deserves no awards.Deniro and Lous C.K's performances were very good, but not good enough to make me think the film was worth watching. I'd heard from others that the film was bad, but I didn't expect it to be TERRIBLE.",4,14,27,31 December 2013
The Revenant," Ridiculous, Too Simple
","This was a huge disappointment. An event happens in this film that is completely unbelievable. It is a key component of the plot and it is absolutely unrealistic. I became disengaged after this huge mistake. Aside from that, this is a very basic boring film with a plot that has been seen over and over again in film history. The cinematography was excellent as was all of the acting, but that's not enough to make a great film. If the plot is hackneyed, then great acting and camera work can't save it. I was stunned by the music - in a bad way. Is challenging music dead? The producers took a risk of having the audience barely understand most of the dialogue, but they don't trust viewers with challenging music? What will people remember about this film? They will remember all of the hype about how the crew filmed in freezing locations. Suffering does not make a film good.",4,14,27,2 January 2016
Tropic Thunder," Awful Film
","This film is terrible. Maybe if you're 11 years old, it's entertaining, but it was so boring and insulting to my intelligence I couldn't stand it. I tried to watch it again because it was on cable and I thought maybe I was too harsh the first time I saw it, but upon the second viewing, I was reminded of how awful it was and couldn't continue watching it.It is impossible to believe that the Ben Stiller character is so stupid that he'd believe he and his fellow actors were being filmed by hidden cameras in the jungle. Jack Black's character had one dimension and was annoying and boring. Nick Nolte was underutilized as was Danny McBride. This is a story not worth telling. Everything is predictable and boring.Ben Stiller is an excellent actor and should stick to acting, not directing.",4,2,4,20 June 2009
Meet the Fockers," Disappointing film
","I really enjoyed 'Meet the Parents' and was afraid to see the sequel because I was afraid i would be disappointed. After seeing it, I was shocked at how disappointed I was with this film. Apparently, Barbra Streisand turned down the film several times before agreeing to do it. She should have gone with her gut instinct. 'Meet the Fockers' is mediocre, cheap and embarrassing. It is full of bathroom humor and sex jokes. The actors did the best they could with the uninteresting script. Ben Stiller played the same uptight character who was in 'Along Came Polly.'I regret seeing this film.",4,4,8,29 December 2004
Drive," Entertaining but flawed
","First of all, Ryan Gosling is no Steve Mcqueen, although he is trying to be. There are great actors who can reveal their characters without a large amount of dialogue, but Gosling is not one of these actors. I didn't buy him as the scorpion jacket wearing loner Travis Bickle type. We learned nothing about what made him become this person.The music was completely wrong. A brooding score would have been more appropriate to underscore Gosling's character. This would have helped tell us who he really was. Instead, Cliff Martinez delivered a 'Traffic' knockoff that was focused on the implausible romance between Mulligan and him. As for the 80's songs in the film, I found them offensive. I believe these filmmakers were using 80's sounding songs and 80's titles to be quirky. They probably thought it was a great idea because it's unexpected and retro, but it was inappropriate and embarrassing. Why did they do that? Albert Brooks was excellent as were many of the supporting actors. This could have been a great film, but it is not.",5,0,1,5 October 2011
Million Dollar Baby," Unbelievably good!
","Before I saw this film, I assumed it was going to be nothing but a feel good movie about a female boxer who ended up winning an important fight. I had no idea it would have such an effect on me. It was much more complex than I expected it to be with unpredictable twists and turns. All of the actors were great. Morgan Freeman deserves a best supporting actor win. I think Clint Eastwood should be nominated for best actor.The film is comedic. The film is dramatic and tragic. Clint Eastwood's simple original musical score is very very good, too. This should be the best film of the year. It's almost perfect.",9,2,3,22 January 2005
Mystic River," Very good film...
","This was a very good film with great acting.  I would like to comment on themusic.  Although it was effective, the score was too repetitive and simple. There were many opportunities to have a sub-theme instead of incessant variations of the main theme.  It's admirable that Eastwood attempted to write the score, but hiring a professional composer would have been a wise decision.  This was not a predictable film and was never dull.  Tim Robbins did a wonderful job ofplaying a damaged personality.",7,0,0,25 February 2004
Whiplash," Flawed and Flashy SPOILERS
","What a wooden film. As a viewer, you cannot really get to know any of these characters. Nothing great comes from an abusive teacher. Hitting student in the face, really? No. It was unclear what JK Simmons' character really was after. Was it perfection? Is the only way to achieve perfection by humiliating students with verbal and physical abuse? The drumming was excellent. I'm a musician and I've never heard of students bleeding all over their drums. It's ridiculous. The only thing JK Simmons' character cared about was tempo. Talk about unidimensional. He crucified students only if they couldn't determine his tempo after a few beats. What about dynamics? What about interacting with the band? The script was superficial and lacking. People probably like this film because Simmons was an interesting character and the drumming was interesting. You'd think such a brilliant teacher would be a more impressive jazz pianist - another boring scene.",4,9,16,5 February 2015
Ray," Well done
","Jamie Fox was excellent at portraying Ray Charles. It was great to see Curtis Armstrong finally get a solid role. This certainly was overdue. The music supervision on this film was excellent. For the most part, it really felt like all of the musical numbers were played live. Fox really seemed to be playing the piano. As far as being best picture of the year...I wouldn't vote for it. I think that Sideways and Million Dollar Baby are far more unique and interesting films.Taylor Hackford continues to prove that he is a very versatile director. It's nice to see that he works in all genres.",7,0,1,6 February 2005
Scream," All hype - bad movie
","It's amazing how the 'insane' killers can act so normal for most of the movie.  This film is no better than all of the other stupid slasher movies. Oh, it's so cool to kill people.  Don't waste your time.  If you want to watch an intelligent horror movie, see 'Rosemary's Baby.'",Null,0,0,1 November 1999
Vanilla Sky," Excellent excellent film...
","Mr .Crowe pulled off a very difficult feat.  What an unpredictable,extremely entertaining film this was...It was exciting, romantic,horrifying, sad and inspiring.  The chemistry between Cruise andCruz is amazing.  And like Crowe's other films, it was succint.",9,0,0,23 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," All hype - no substance * warning spoilers
","I believe that people think this film is good because they have convinced themselves that it must be. Hardcore 'Star Wars' fans are so in love with these characters that just seeing them interact with each other is enough to say the film is amazing. This film is far from amazing.The story is very basic, boring and far from challenging. The Lord Of The Rings films were far more challenging and interesting. It's hard to believe that 'Finn' would have the motivation and courage to do what he did. There was barely a subplot. It doesn't make sense that Hans Solo's son would have any need to put on an act and cry in order to trick his father and kill him. It doesn't make any sense. There was no chemistry between Princess Leia and Hans Solo. I felt sorry for both actors because their performances were so wooden. The comedy was mostly expected and dumb. I cringed when Hans Solo called Finn, 'Big Deal.' Visually, it was incredible because of the use of miniatures instead of relying solely on CGI. Unfortunately, this is not a painting. It is a film. It needed a better story and performances.",4,74,135,20 December 2015
The Social Network," An amazing piece of work!
","Fincher is a true original and must have a lot of power in all areas of the film process because as usual, he avoided making a 'Hollywood Movie.' And since it wasn't a hackneyed movie that we've seen so many times before, he made it very interesting with the help of music, sound design, manic conversations, wonderful photography. The acting is all superb. I am still amazed how multi talented Justin Timberlake is.Jesse Eisenberg stole the show. He played a cold nerdy brilliant workaholic with nothing else on his mind. He created a character who was easily annoyed by improper questions and anything mundane.Thank God there was no happy ending with all sides doing a group hug. This is a fascinating film with tons of facts and evidence that of which I had been grossly unaware.Highly recommend!",9,5,9,3 October 2010
