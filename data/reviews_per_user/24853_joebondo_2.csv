Skyfall," The Bond film that made me leave the franchise
","I've been watching the James Bond franchise my entire life. Always anxiously awaiting the next Bond film about every couple years or so. I began to lose some interest beginning with the 3rd Pierce Brosnan film, 'The world is not enough'. I didn't even finish watching that Bond film because I was so bored and because of that, for the first time ever I didn't even see a Bond film, Brosnan's last, 'Die another day'. Daniel Craig got hired and I was more than willing to come back to the franchise. Boy oh boy was I glad I did as 'Casino Royale' is one of my favorite Bond films of all time. Contemporary Bond? Yes. But they blended in everything about today's world perfectly, especially the fact that Texas Holdem was probably at its height in popularity at that time. Craig's 2nd film, 'Quantum of Solace' can be described as nothing short of a yawner. Now comes the 3rd Craig film, 'Skyfall'. About a month or two before it's release, all I kept hearing was this great hype, 'this is going to be the best Bond film of all time'! Well not only could this statement be further from the truth, it is the polar opposite as I am of the opinion this is the worst Bond film of all time! My main issue with this film (aside from the weak plot) is the word credibility. I know whenever we sit down to watch any film but especially a Bond film, you have to have an open mind and let yourself be entertained. Bond films are going to have crazy stunts, gadgets, getaways, etc. throughout the film, but there is always a redeeming quality of credibility, to a certain degree anyway. What Sam Mendes did as the director of 'Skyfall' completely insulted my intelligence as a moviegoer and as a human being! The average Bond film will have a handful of scenes that are not credible. In 'Skyfall', EVERY scene is not credible! I guess Sam Mendes said to himself, 'it doesn't matter how incredulous any scene I include in the movie is, people will watch it, they'll buy it, because it's James Bond'. This movie is a complete and utter embarrassment to the franchise. I won't get into all the details of the movie but the 3 that 'stick in my crawl' I'll share. 1. Bond should have been dead after the opening scene so the film should have been about 5 minutes long. 2. The way they have Silva escape MI6 HQ is a complete and utter farce as he just literally walks out unscathed amongst 100's of agents as well as the most sophisticated security on the planet. 3. The ending is an utter joke, Bond, M and an old man gamekeeper decide to holdup in a broken down shack of an estate as sitting targets, barely armed, with no backup close by! Please!Thank you Sam Mendes for doing 3 things: 1. Making me leave the Bond franchise for good, 2. Making the worst Bond film in the franchise, 3. Aside from being a James Bond film, you also made one of the worst films of all time, period!",1,5,11,28 May 2016
A Walk to Remember," A movie to remember
","Growing up in the 80's, I realized that many romance movies (especially the tearjerkers) spawned from the 1970 movie that started it all, 'Love story.' Whenever I watched a 'love story' on the big screen, I always compared it to the original Love story movie. Looking back at Ryan O'Neal & Ali Mcgraws 'love story', I always thought their story was the pinnacle for all movies to follow. Last summer I viewed 'Me, Earl & the dying girl' (not that great) another take on the original Love story but this one about friends. I have yet to see 'The fault in our stars' but from what I read, just another take. I have seen many romance films throughout my years. A few months ago for the very first time I watched 'A walk to remember' and it is a true masterpiece of the 'Love story' genre for ages to come. This film leaves an imprint on its viewers, almost mesmerizing! Unlike Ali Mcgraw's character, who is an atheist, in the original 'Love story' film, Mandy Moore's character,Jamie Sullivan, is the polar opposite, a young woman who was brought up by her father with virtues, ethics, morals, a sense of responsibility and most importantly, a deep love and belief in GOD. Even though Jamie is deeply religious and strong in her beliefs, she isn't portrayed as a 'Jesus freak.' The positive effect (putting it lightly) that she has on Shane West's character of Landon Carter, is truly remarkable and something to behold, to cherish and remember. It goes to show just how important the people we associate with can have a profound effect on our lives. Landon wasn't necessarily hanging with a 'bad' crowd but rather some typical teens who try and look and act cool, maybe make fun of others who don't 'fit in' but they're definitely not bad people. No drugs, no gangs, etc. So when Landon gets a good dose of Jamie Sullivan, it rubs off on him, opens his eyes and makes him want to be the best person he can possibly be for not only himself but especially for Jaime. For the record, all the performances in the film were terrific, but I truly don't think anybody else could have nailed Mandy Moore's portrayal of Jaime Sullivan's character. As far as I'm concerned, Mandy Moore is the academy award winner for best actress in 2002!The song Jaime sings during the school play, entitled 'Only hope', was not only inspiring but indelible. Ironically there's a line in the song, 'I know now you're my only hope', turns out to be exactly what Jaime was for Landon and Landon for Jaime. Being a father myself, I found the expression on Peter Coyote's (Jaime's father) face at the end of the porch swing scene (where Jaime receives a gift from Landon), absolutely priceless!What a great film to display how the good of one person can affect the life of another forever. That's what this film is all about, and of course let's not forget the great love these 2 share. What made me love this film even more is the simple purity of the film. I haven't read the book, A walk to remember,(I'm looking forward to getting my hands on a copy) by Nicholas Sparks but from what I've read about the book, the movie is more contemporary to appeal to this generation but at the same time, the movie does something very unique for this day and age. It pretty much keeps the 2 main characters at arms lengths most of the film, a throwback to the books' time. And when we do see the 2 main characters engaged in a kiss, holding hands or hugging, or in one another's arms, it's all the more special. No sex, no drugs, no profanity, no Landon seeing someone on the side or vice versa. Such a warm, gentle and once again, most of all pure film, and it's truly amazing. I remember seeing the movie 'The Notebook' and thinking to myself what a great love story. But after seeing A walk to remember, I will be hard pressed for the rest of my days to find a love story that truly captures pure magic the way it did between Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter.",10,1,2,5 May 2016
