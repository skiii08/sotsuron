The Expendables 2," Brainless action at its best
","I have and always will love action films. I felt like this film was made just for me. Everything I wanted from an action movie was here on display. Extreme violence, dodgy dialogue, paper thin plot, cartoon villain and it never gives up. Great to see the big names having fun with t and having little pops at themselves too. Chuck's scenes were brilliant and the there's Van Damme! I'm a huge fan of his and he is excellent in this. Brilliant final fight scene too. Role on No.4",10,1,1,16 May 2018
