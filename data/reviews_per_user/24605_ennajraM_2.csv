Antz," Deeper than I thought
","This movie was wonderful. Yes, it looks great, has a great voice cast and great characters and a sweet love story, but next to all that this movie actually has something to say. When I sat down tonight to watch this on TV I expected to watch a funny, not so deep, easy movie, so I was surprised by the deeper meaning of it.The story is about the ant Z, who is a worker in a colony. He is very depressed and has the feeling that there has to be more to life than his boring job. When he meets princess Bala in a bar he immediately falls head over heals in love with her. Because of this love he is switching with his friend Weaver a soldier, so he can meet the princess again. But things start to go wrong when he ends up in a heavy battle and returns from it as the only survivor and hero. The story goes on as Z 'accidently' kidnaps Bala and together they have several adventures, before the spectacular end scene.This movie is about choices, about equality, about standing up for what you believe in. The plan of the main villain, the general, has very obvious references to WW2 and Hitler. Also the references to 1984, the famous George Orwell novel, are very present. This movie has it all.But Antz is also still a movie for kids. This is what makes this movie so great for everyone to watch. Small kids (but not to small I think) could enjoy this for the visuals, it's adventure and it's humor, while the parents could enjoy this movie on a deeper level.All in all, I would highly recommend this movie for everybody above the age of eight.",8,0,1,17 September 2005
12 Angry Men," A Masterpiece ( spoilers)
","I never expected '12 Angry men' to be so great. A movie that takes place in one room and has no action what so ever doesn't normally spark my attention. I can't really pinpoint what it is about 12 Angry men that makes it so great, because all that this movie is is conversation between 12 men. I really got pulled into the conversation and just like the jurors the more time went by the more I went along with juror nr. 8. At the end of the movie I was even convinced that Henry's Fonda's character was right all along.However the main strength of the movie wasn't the subject of the conversation (guilty or not guilty)but the real underlying (daddy/ son)issues. Although the movie took place in one room I really got a good impression of most of the jurors. Some were more fleshed out than others, but there were a few instances that I was really impressed by the dialog and also the acting. A scene that comes to mind is the whole racist rampage that is uttered by jury nr 10 (from a very good Ed Begley)and the reaction of the other 11 men. I also really liked juror nr. 12, a man that wants to be liked so badly but hardly dares to give his two cents and changes his verdict from guilty, to not guilty, to guilty and then Not guilty again. Also the part where Juror nr 9 talks about the old man that 'witnessed' the murder. He talked about the witness as this was an old man that wanted attention, because he was lonely and no-one ever listened to him. You could tell by the acting of Sweeny that the witness was exactly like him. Also Lee J. Cobb (Juror nr 3) has a few very impressive scenes. Especially the last one in which he breaks down comes to mind.I know that everybody talks about Fonda and although I think that he is a really good actor, I thought that the ones that really shown in this movie were Cobb and Begley. However everybody was good and at the end of this movie I was really glad I watched this masterpiece. There I said it. Not a word that I use easily when talking about movies. But according to me 12 Angry men is one of the best movie's of all time, a brilliant character study.",9,1,2,21 February 2009
