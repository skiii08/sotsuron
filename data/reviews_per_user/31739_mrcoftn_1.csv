Blade Runner 2049," Easily in my top 5 favorite movies
","My expectations for this movie were not all that high. I went to see a late showing in and empty, cheap, and rundown theater but instantly regretted it. Blade Runner 2049 deserves the best and I have already planned a second viewing in IMAX.The most outstanding work came from on the art direction. I fully expect this team of artists to earn Blade Runner 2049 a sizable collection of awards. The use of color is extraordinary and the sets are extremely well done. Much like how Mad Max: Fury Road gave the new generations a schema for the post apocalyptic landscape, Blade Runner 2049 defined what is Cyber punk. 2049 has all the advantages of 30 years of tech that gave the movie the ability to do things Ridley Scott could have only imagined in the 80s.The costume design was also spectacular. It's a tall order to try and portray the fashions of a retro-future, now-noir, and dystopian sci-fi film. Ren√©e April stepped up to the challenge and delivered perfectly. Unlike most of the film the costumes had a muted palette but that didn't stop them from standing out in a film packed with exceptional aspects.Finally, the acting. There were no weak links in 2049. Everyone came out and delivered solid performances. The full cast did a great job of portraying the awkward and unsociable personalities of this dystopian world. While to me none of the performances stood above the rest I will note that Ryan Gosling was a perfect fit for the main character.In conclusion I would give this film a 9.8/10. Just to nitpick the sound effects at times felt a little overbearing and there was a single line I think didn't fit. Despite that it well earned the round up to 10/10. I can not recommend enough.",10,4,12,24 October 2017
