Walk the Line," Great Film!!
","This film is extremely well acted, scripted and done. Joaquin was very adept at duplicating Johnny's mannerisms and Reese was equally good at doing June's. Performances by the actors who played Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison are also to be noted. The story line follows Johnny's and June's love story tenderly and accurately. My favorite scene is Johnny's marriage proposal to June on stage. Considering both Joaquin and Reese both learned how to play musical instruments and performed their own songs, they should receive, at the very least, Oscar nominations. Both their musical performances (singing and playing) are excellent!!! Very enjoyable film in all respects.",9,1,3,27 November 2005
