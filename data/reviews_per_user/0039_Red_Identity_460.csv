The Blair Witch Project," Possibly the scariest film ever made!
","The Blair Witch Project is possibly the most cleverly-crafted, gripping, suspenseful film ever made. I mean that with passion. This is truly a landmark of a film. The documentary feel of it all, the amazing camera-work. It captures every single little aspect of the dark, woods, of anything that has ever happened to be scary at all. It creates a perfect chilling atmosphere to the film. I mean, it is just so great how in horror films, we don't need to see senseless gore or the villains or evil. This film relies on truly just the situations and surroundings and characters. This is certainly an approach that I truly respect. Not many simply-shot films work, this could not have worked, but it did. It also happened to work because of all it's realism. Just three untrained actors working. I found all of them perfect. They did not seem to act, they just seemed as normal, and very realistic, which after all did help this film. I also always wondered how people in horror films should truly act in real life. Well, this is possibly the only film that really feels like it is a real-life experience. I also think that the writing, the dialogue, really was very strong. It was not just because of the camera, but it also added to the complete realism. The Blair Witch Project is definitely a film that stands out in every aspect.",Null,5,11,18 January 2009
The King's Speech," Well-done and acted
","The King's Speech is the last film I have seen that is a big contender in the Oscars, and it is a well-made film with solid story-telling and a great performance by Colin Firth. He commands the screen with his presence and just like a year ago in his film A Single Man he carries the film. Working with him are the talented Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, and Guy Pearce. The first two are getting awards recognition and will likely be nominated for an Oscar, the latter has no chance. Carter has very limited screen time and it's sort of a surprise she is getting notice. However, no other actress would have been able to make more of an impression than her. She really does have only a few lines here and there, but her face says everything. I don't know if I would put her in my personal line-up but I am proud of her. Rush has a bigger character and more screen time and he is completely charming. Pearce I thought came out of nowhere in an even more limited performance but was completely impressive. Pearce is one of the most criminally-underrated actors working today and he completely dismersed into character. I cannot believe he is still not an Oscar-nominee. What a shame.Overall, I really liked it. However, it was never completely intriguing enough for me to call it one of the year's best films, and after seeing it now I don't think it will win the Oscar for Best Picture especially with The Social Network looming around. However, it's a very well-made film with enough ambition to be respected.",Null,1,3,16 January 2011
The Lobster," A dazzling piece of cinema
","One of the most idiosyncratic, ambitious films I've seen this decade. A lot may not take to it and that's fine, but it worked so well for me. It took a bit to really get lost in its world and in its aims, but once I did it worked so beautifully. Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, and Lea Seydoux are fantastic, with Farrell especially having a great year between this and his performance in True Detective (easily the best thing about it). I really wish it was technically a 2015 release so I could include it in my line-ups, but alas it will so far be the king of 2016. Overall, definitely such a strong and original, distinctive piece in filmmaking, but surely not one everyone will take to. But it's worth giving it a shot.",Null,2,10,18 December 2015
Moneyball," Intriguing, investing, with a great screenplay and a fantastic performance at its core
","Sports films... Not a huge fan of them, and don't see them much because of the predictability of them. However, one cannot deny the impact that some have, like for example in recent years The Fighter and Aronofsky's The Wrestler. Moneyball can now join them and is among the best films of the year.The film is always intriguing, and Aaron Sorkin (whose screenplay for The Social Network was last year's best) is to be congratulated for this. It's his wonderful script that gives the film the energy. What also helps is the lack of predictability. Sure, one can't seem to hope for an 'experimental' sports film, since this is based on a true story. However, Sorkin, as well as the director, always keeps things refreshing and interesting without becoming repetitive and stale. The dialogue is brilliant of course, and the lack of 'field' action makes it even more involving so when the important ball scene comes along it makes an impact. The other big driving factor is Brad Pitt, who has had an incredible year. His performance in The Tree of Life is already among his finest work, and now this joins it as well. He portrays all of the character traits with such versatility and charisma. A great and satisfying protagonist. Overall, I was incredibly pleased with this. It is to this day the best adapted screenplay of the year, and not surprisingly Pitt is my win in both categories for both of his films.",Null,59,73,15 November 2011
The Avengers," Entertainment to the highest degree!
","I had never been heavily anticipating The Avengers. I'm not a huge fan of any of these superheroes, and haven't been up to date on most of these. I only saw the first Iron Man and the two Hulk films, but honestly nothing Marvel released since then. The Avengers surprised me. It turned out to be a fairly slow-paced film with subtle character dynamics and nuanced performances. Okay, really, it's just a BLAST! Nothing more has to be said. It has a tone that giddily encourages you to get on board. It's pretty much everything you expect, but it doesn't insult your intelligence. In fact, the characters and dialogue are all pretty well-written. A film like this could have had just as amazing action sequences, but with lesser writing and development, wouldn't be nearly as satisfying. Truly, there's something to enjoy in all of these characters, particularly Banner (perfectly portrayed by Ruffalo) and the always charming Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Having not seen Thor, I enjoyed him a lot too and thought Hemsworth was pretty excellent. Technially, it's excellent. The editing is fantastic, and there is not a single flaw within the editing achievement. Editing action films, especially in their big moments, can be very hard to accomplish, but these filmmakers did an impeccable job. The action sequences are amazing, and big, huge. Overall, there's so much excitement to be had here. I don't have a problem calling The Avengers THE 'perfect summer blockbuster'. It truly is, and boy what a ride it is. Strongly recommended to everyone.",Null,4,10,11 June 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Moody, mysterious, and brilliantly directed
","I didn't know what to expect out of Blade Runner 2049. I'm a big fan of the original but to create a sequel that would be faithful to the world created in that film as well as add something new and crucial is a difficult feat for anyone. Luckily, I think this is easily one of the best big-budget genre thriller films this decade. It's rare for me to watch a mainstream film like this and not have so many criticisms as it's playing. I think the film is very well paced, amazingly shot, very well written, and brilliantly directed. It maintains the same atmosphere that the original did while delivering big set pieces. At its core it remains a mystery and it's all the better for it. I think the most impressive thing about it was its commitment to building on the mythology set forth by the original. It managed to expand on the original and give us answers to what happened to characters after it in ways that felt clever, fresh, and still faithful to it. It manages to be about the continuation of certain events in the first film while creating a new fascinating character at its core and manages to tell the new character's arc brilliantly. To reiterate, it's very well written, managing to avoid the clich√©s that usually transpire in films like this. Villeneuve has quickly become one of the best filmmakers currently working and this is only another example of his talent. In terms of acting, Gosling does wonders with the role. He doesn't do anything we haven't seen him do before, but he's great at what he does and he nails it here. In terms of MVP, it's Ana de Armas and Sylvia Hoeks who stand out the most from the supporting cast, especially the latter. She's icy and delicious in her role.",Null,2,7,10 October 2017
First Man," Fantastic
","Ryan Gosling is good, but it's Claire Foy who steals this film. Technically fantastic.",Null,1,3,20 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Good, but problematic.
","The film was good. Nothing actively bad about it, but at the end of it all, it does seem like while things happened, nothing much of importance really happened. Saying that, it's still well-made and pretty entertainingWhat I did have a problem with was Katniss' characterization. I don't think the first two films and this one really connect in terms of her characterization. I get that she's traumatized, but putting only one person ahead of the whole nation? That selfish? She just never showed this side in the first two films. I'm not okay with her being in love with Peeta, I thought it would've been so much better if it had just remained a strong friendship. But alas, the problem really lies with just how annoying she was. I get that people behave differently in different circumstances, but it just felt like such a wildly different character several times.But really, it's a good film, aside from Katniss' problems. Although gurl, if you don't want Liam Hemsworth, I'll take him. Considering how hot he is and how completely selfless he is, how anyone could NOT want him over any other guy is itself a flaw (kidding)",Null,6,17,7 December 2014
Vertigo," Hitchcock at his most unpredictable...
","Vertigo is the 6th film I have seen from Hitchcock, and it is among his best. Where Psycho's first half completely turned the tables in the second half, Vertigo goes to have a resolution midway through the film. Since I had no idea of what the plot would be, it made it a bigger treat to see the film unravel the way it did. At first, I was skeptical whether the film could reach the amount of fame it has, but once the film was over I got it. It is a fabulous written film with amazing set locations, great performances at it's core, and unpredictable story lines. At the end of it all it remains probably one of Hitchcock's most simple films, but It has an aura and tone that is distinctive to the rest of his films that I have seen. I look forward to rewatching this film and as of now it ranks up in the top half of his filmography, but I don't think it has quite achieved the same level as Psycho (so far).",Null,4,5,6 September 2010
Black Swan," Nightmarish, horrifying, and ultimately Spectacular!
","I had recently gathered interest in seeing Black Swan because the reviews made it out to be very original and bizarre, and that combination is something I always look for. Turns out the reviews were right.I have only seen two other films by Darren Aronofsky- The Fountain and The Wrestler. While The Fountain was a good film, it was heavily flawed but it did try something unique and was a visual experience. The Wrestler was the complete opposite. It turned out to be a better film than The Fountain but it had a much more conventional storyline with great characters and his direction was very simple and realistic. Here, we have a film that combines elements of both those films. Black Swan is very much as much of a horror film as the genre tends to look for. Actually, it is much more horrifying than I would expect all of the award groups to be noticing, which is why I am surprised by the awards it has garnered. It is a film of mystifying beauty. If you are looking for subtle direction and writing, look elsewhere. Aronofsky thrives on the over-the-top theatrical style with loud, classical music. He gives the film a nightmarish feeling of mystery and dread while still focusing on Nina. Natalie Portman goes all out in this one, creating a character who seems like much of what we have seen before but whose dedication to the project might be her flaw. I do not want to give much away, so I will stop there. I am surprised by how far Mila Kunis has come, the girl from That 70s Show. Her role is small, but I cannot imagine anyone else in the role and am glad Aronofsky took a risk with her. Black Swan is certainly not a film for everyone, and let's appreciate it even more for that. It is certainly Aronofsky's only near-masterpiece thus far (and by near I mean that it is a hard film to truly grasp on first viewing, so more viewings are in store). Also that ending is masterful and compares with The Wrestler in that respect.",Null,10,21,19 December 2010
Changeling," Clint Eastwood's best Motion Picture of the decade
","Changeling is a painful, realistic, emotionally grabbing and gripping film. This film is so perfectly captured on screen and directed by Eastwood. The story itself is strong, and it is brought into the screen in such a way that the audience really holds on to it. I expected a dull, sappy melodrama, but instead I found it to be very entertaining. I found all the turns that the film takes to suit it well, and instead of all the different challenges it had to overcome, it could have easily failed, but it succeeded brilliantly. The pacing is never slow, it is always on focus, and it does not linger so much as other mystery films. Since this film starts off as a mystery, then turns into sort of a crime and court film, it has a lot to offer in performances. Angelina Jolie is really an underrated actress. I think all her fame sometimes overshadow how good she is, and in this, she gives the best performance I have seen from her. Her pain, her unbearable suffering, her eagerness for the truth and justice, it is all played perfectly. Angelina Jolie deserves at the least an Oscar nomination. John Malkovich and the entire cast are great, even the kid actors. The film is also very beautiful to look at. The atmosphere of Los Angeles in the 1920's and 1930's is perfectly captured. The cinematography is beautiful, and I was also glad it was not too showy, it would not fit the tone too much. The costumes and set designs are also perfect. Expect a lot of technical Oscar nominations, as well as Original Score. It was so soothing and enhanced the story even more.Overall, amazing and brilliant film! It is not flawless, but it certainly is a great film, if not for the gripping story and writing, then for the performances. I really enjoyed it a lot more than the overrated Million Dollar Baby, and the dull letters from Iwa Jima. This is Eastwood's best film of the decade, and one of his best works",Null,6,10,1 December 2008
The New World," With moments of greatness...
","The new World is the 4th Malick film I have seen, and just like always, it is visually-great, but yet not as much as The Thin Red Line and Days of Heaven especially. Malick does know how to show romance, as the romance between Pocahontas and both of her guys is very well constructed and edited. Scenes like this give the film a real power. Also, it is not as incoherent or as overwhelming as The Thin Red Line (but then again I saw the shortest version, the 135 minute version). Like always, there is some ambition beneath the surface, but at this point nothing here feels that original. Yes, the romance is well-made, perhaps the most affecting romance in a Malick film. Also, Q'orianka Kilcher manages to be the stand-out among big stars like Christian Bale and Colin Farrell. She barely speaks a word, but her effect is there. The film is highly flawed though, and in a way it is not better than The Thin Red Line. It is more consistent, but none of it hit me as hard as the big war scenes in The Thin Red Line or the flashbacks to the wife. Ultimately, I do recommend it, but it stands together with The Thin Red Line (whose rating dropped to a 7 by now) as good films, ambitious and visually great, but neither have a real lasting power that his earlier films Days of Heaven and Badlands have.",Null,1,1,31 May 2011
Scarface," Entertaining and violent!
","Scarface is a very popular gangster film, yet it has never been regarded in the same ranks of The Godfather. I had been wanting to see it for a long time, and I finally did. It is a very good film. It has some great scenes, but the thing is that is follows all of the basic rules of gangster films. It also follows the formula of the main protagonist going through his own self-destruction. It is mostly entertaining, and VERY violent, so props. What I also love in away about it is it's tone. It never really takes itself too seriously, and for that reason is how it differs from the Godfather films. I also think that Al Pacino is great. I think it is a great performance. Yes, he is over-the-top, but he has created an iconic character. Overall, it's very good, but not a masterpiece as expected.",Null,2,5,9 March 2011
Walk the Line," Solid
","Walk the Line is one of those easily watchable biopics where it's not hard to get invested into its characters and storyline. It's particularly light. I don't know if that's really a problem or that it needed to be anything more than this, but as it is, it's never too incredibly effective. Even in its more emotional scenes, it rings as a soapy sort of drama. You're never bored, but there's nothing all that special. Still, it's entertaining and definitely worth it for Phoenix and Witherspoon. To my surprise, I thought both were about equal and worthy of notices. Both were really good, but again, I don't think either are anything too special or amazing. That's the way the film is. Watchable, but nothing too memorable by the time you finish it.",Null,0,0,3 February 2013
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A crude and offensive film!
","Borat is one of the most outrageous films I have ever seen. No question about it. It has so much offensive things about it, and that is why it caused so much controversy back in 2006. Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the bravest actors in Hollywood, for him to set himself in these situations and for him to be willing to do all of this. his character of Borat is so well done, and certainly one of the most memorable characters in recent film history. I did not always enjoy Borat. When I first saw it I did not like it. But it grew on me, since it obviously is very funny, and very entertaining and you cannot stop starring at the screen! Kudos to Borat, even though his recent film Bruno I found to be even better!",Null,0,0,24 July 2009
Alien 3," Just boring...
","That's the main problem with this film. Oh sure, it comes across really half-baked, really stupid at times, really over-the-top and an emphasis on action in a way that doesn't suit the character development at all. But because the action comes with no importance, no bearing, no significance, there's just no added effect there, nothing else to latch unto as far as introspection and analyzing the film goes. Sigourney Weaver is particularly strong, but again, there's so much she can do. It's not an awful film though, and I'm sure it's enjoyable enough to some people but coming off a great and a very good film, a huge downer. So not exactly recommended.",Null,1,5,14 December 2014
The Incredible Hulk," Enjoyable
","The Incredible Hulk is definitely different in tone to the 2003 version of Ang Lee. I still cannot decide which is better. Neither are great films, but both are worth watching. The 2003 version is definitely the more ambitious, slower-paced, more character-centric film, but it has its flaws. The Incredible Hulk (2008 version) is more mindless (not a bad thing), more entertaining, and fits the tone of a comic book movie better, BUT it also has its flaws. I say that its easier to just pop in this version and watch, BUT I cannot help but feel that I do have more respect for what the filmmakers tried to do in the 2003 version. Anyways, this is worth watching as well, and it has a better Bruce Banner.",Null,1,2,25 July 2011
Requiem for a Dream," A powerful and daring vision
","I see a lot of films these days. I am a big fan of films so I feel an obligation to see what films have made an impact out there. Most of the films I see I end up liking simply because I knew there was something to like. But only maybe a few times throughout a year do I see a film that I stop and say WOW to. Requiem for a Dream is another one of these rare great achievements that makes me savor and appreciate this art form and how powerful it can be.A film does not have to have themes or messages that it tries to convince the viewers of. Sometimes a lot of great films do, and in their own ways it works, but even when seeing a film like this it is not hard for it to truly sink into your conscious. I have seen many films where they have a certain visual power that really hits deep, most notably films like 2001 A Space Odyssey or Mulholland Dr., or even Aronofsky's own recent Black Swan, yet when looking at all of these films by their own each one stands out. I love films like this, and I know it is not everyone's type of aspect that they like, but I do, so it is to be expected that I was mesmerized by this film. The storyline itself is not important, it is the experience as I have always said. Seeing as it has been 10 years since this film came out, i can only imagine what type of reaction it took. Whatever opinion someone has of it, it is unforgettable. Someone might read that statement and say how self-indulgent it sounds, but ambition is certainly not missing here. Aronofsky is a true artist and now has two ground-breaking films under his belt- Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan (I am cautious not to let out the little word called 'masterpiece' on just one viewing). For a visionary films like this it is important for the director to make it worthwhile, but Aronofsky is also able to pull off great performances from his actors (Rourke in The Wrestler, Portman in Black Swan, and Burstyn here). Burstyn is not just great, she achieves everything needed and more. The ending in itself is brilliant, and when the film ends one should not speak anything because it is so hard to. The film is in it's own way disturbing, mesmerizing, captivating, and extremely powerful, and should be seen by anybody who loves movies in general.",Null,1,2,5 January 2011
Your Name.," Beautiful story
","I really didn't know anything about this film's plot or premise. All I knew about it was how popular it had become and the praise bestowed upon it by many people I know. It's an incredibly ambitious film, merging stories to tell a great tale of love and time. I admit, it was definitely not always easy to follow in what it was doing. However, in the hands of a lesser director this could have been really messy and jumbled. Instead, the themes of the film were always clear and its heart was always shining through. The screenplay effectively develops its main characters and you become incredibly emotionally invested in them, in a surprisingly large way that I myself didn't expect. It's a great film and it's only another example of how 2016 has proved to be a great year for animation.",Null,2,5,21 December 2016
Captain Phillips," Effective
","I didn't really have much of any expectations for this. I never really looked forward to it, the only reason now being that it's going to be a huge Oscar contender. But you know what, this was really excellent. The editing and directing are totally in-tune to the kind of tone it wants the film to have. The technical aspects of it are not that original, we've seen this super-hyper style editing before, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. The acting is really great, with Tom Hanks giving the best performance I've seen from him. I haven't seen his first Oscar win, but Forrest Gump I've always thought is really overrated. Overall, this is really powerful stuff.",Null,0,1,8 November 2013
Sucker Punch," Very odd, but thrilling
","The way most people talk about Sucker Punch sort of had me thinking it wasn't just a regular action film. The film has a few supporters, but they REALLY support it. So I finally saw it. I thought I would probably think it was mediocre, but I didn't, and here are my thoughts...It started off rather annoying. Slow-motion action didn't stop, but after about 5 minutes, I got into it. I knew this would be a film to just enjoy. The slow-motion visual images really interested me. As did the film, as it kept going it was sort of odd, even for Snyder. I don't know how to judge the script or the story, but it was working a lot. The musical number in the beginning is what I really loved. Swirl of images to stay in my head. The film finally came to a regular plot, and yet it wasn't what I had expected. Not only are we aware that this is actually a dream or fantasy, but inside this fantasy where she is prisoner as well, whens he 'dances' she enters a video game (not literally). That's all it was, a video game, and heck, I enjoyed it! Some of the 'dance' action scenes got a little repetitive by the 2nd dance, but the 3rd 'dance' with the robots I really enjoyed. That's all that matters, that scene by scene I was still invested. Overall, the film wasn't anything original, but its execution and style somehow were. It definitely stands apart from other action films, but it doesn't feel too serious. I hope Snyder doesn't take it so seriously either, but in its own way this is a very ambitious film. I liked it, a lot. It's the sort of film that is not hurt by negative criticism. It's the rare film where it feels like it doesn't care what others think of it, and that's actually pretty rare. It isn't the incredible film that the Ultimate Cut of Watchmen is, but it's very good, if not great in its ability to transcend feelings and images in a certain unique way, even when the characters themselves are 2-D.",Null,2,3,2 December 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A little masterpiece, incredibly touching
","I never read the book this film is based on. It was never on my radar to watch. It wasn't a film I was even planning to see. And guess what? It turned out to be a gem of high proportions.Now, the cast here is all wonderful, and the three leads all work perfectly. Miller and Watson are great, and the former has some really great scenes that would definitely put him in my Supporting Actor line- up. But the real star here is Logan Lerman. I don't have any say on how he portrayed the character in the novel, but what he did here amazed me to no end. His ability to reflect so many of his characters' past with such simple glances is incredible. It would have been so easy to make the silent-type lead teenage boy feel lazy or uninspired, and even in a lessor actor's hands it could have felt that way. But Lerman is mesmerizing from start to finish, never once hitting a false note or detaching himself from the emotional weight his character is living under. This is one of the best teenage performances I've ever seen, and as of right now easily the best performance of the year. Granted, I haven't seen most of the awards contenders, but this is truly incredible stuff and Lerman has enormous talent that I really hope carries him through a long and successful career. These kinds of films are always hard to navigate exactly. It's kind of hard to not fall into clich√©s or stereotypes. At first glance it seems like there's nothing that makes this stand apart from other films of this kind. Granted, I don't watch many that are under this specific genre simply because they never seem like anything out of the ordinary. So to be as moved by the film as I was, for it to have emotionally touched me the way it did is a huge surprise. Technically this isn't some high achievement, but there is no other film as emotionally rich this year. The characters and story lines all work in marvelous ways. I can't even say that some of it wasn't familiar territory because most of it verges on what we have seen before. And it's not perfect, some of the dialogue at times is a bit clunky, some of the plot mechanics. But it all comes together to create what is to me, a deeply, deeply personal film. I connected with the characters in ways I forgot were possible. There have been many great films in recent years, but I don't think there's been one that has reminded me of who I am as a person or who I was, what my life has been like, what life in general is like, this much. I always dread sentimentality, and if anything I am easily put off by any kind of emotional manipulation. But this is the only film in a long time that really was trying to be as emotionally investing as it could be, and one that never hit any real false notes when it came to the emotions it stirred in me. I've always said that as great as any story lines or characters are in observing a film you've seen, the art of film is ultimately a medium of feeling, just like any other art form. And this is why I haven't mentioned, really, any of the plot. Being able to talk about how it made me feel is enough, and this is a film where the emphasis on the word 'feel' is all but deserved. This is a small gem of a film, but as rich of an experience as one could hope for. The best film of 2012.",Null,13,23,11 December 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," Vastly intriguing, very well-written, very well-acted... but that ending
","This film takes so much pleasure in being exactly what it wants to be, a 'genre film'. From the loud score in many scenes (which works wonders), to the clever way that it follows certain formulas while still managing to be distinct in its own way, there's something so instantly likable about it. It helps that it's very well-written, structurally effective, and the trio of performances and characters are very strong. John Goodman should seriously be in consideration for some end-of-the-year mentions or critic awards. I think the whole thing is just a wonder. It's briskly paced and it's magnificently directed.Then those last 15 minutes happened. I wonder, had it not been expected to have a connection to Cloverfield, would the writers have gone there? Was that always their intention? Did they name the film what they did because they were pressured? If so, what would the ending have been like? I think it would have been very frustrating had Winstead gone outside, realized that there was no radiation-type thing and that everything was absolutely normal. Many stories and films have done that sort of thing, and it would have been so easy to do that here. I don't have a problem with aliens existing in the film. I just think it's ironic that it's this film, which is spent almost all inside a bunker, that doesn't follow the 'less is more' approach, something which its sibling film, which was a lot more action-paced, followed. They overdo it with the chase sequences, and they show the aliens way too much. It just felt like a different film. They should have seriously shortened that last sequence. I don't think it ruins the film at all, but does it bring it down a level or two? Possibly, yeah.I still love the film. I think it turns and twists in ways that are exciting, clever, and just fun, without turning into stupidity. Those last 10 minutes aside, there's not much that I have a problem with. I'm hoping I warm up to its ending with time.",Null,2,6,13 March 2016
Source Code," Duncan Jones with a 2nd Home-Run!
","Two years ago a small independent sci-fi film called Moon was released. It was one of the three best films of that year. So I knew Duncan Jones was a director to look out for. A few months ago when I heard about the plot for Source Code I thought it would be an experiment gone wrong. The trailer reinforced those ideas even more, to the point that I never bothered to anticipate it or even know when it was about to come out. Then it was released to some strong reviews. The film deserved them, because this is Duncan Jones at another strong outing.Source Code handles some sci-fi ideas with it's plot in a very well thought-out manner. The screenplay is pretty great, especially when we have seen films 'play out dejavus' before. But Source Coce represents a new idea. It is true that the actual mechanics of the film's 'Source Code' would probably not be able to work in the real world, but this film succeeds in the same way that Moon succeeded. It deals with some very interesting ideas that are center in the plot of one male lead. Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty great in the main role. He hasn't had a performance or film this good since... well, a LONG time. Michelle Monaghan is also pretty good, and it's very easy to know why this character would be going out with a woman who's this likable. I also loved the ending.Duncan Jones is 2 for 2 with this and Moon. Both are great thought-out films, although they do have different looks, since Moon was low-budget and this one definitely does feel a lot more mainstream. Jones kind of reminds me of how Christopher Nolan started out, with indies like Memento on to big films like The Dark Knight and Inception. Hopefully Jones becomes just as big (although better luck to Jones than Nolan at the Oscars, hehe).",Null,1,2,16 April 2011
Skyfall," Fantastic
","Believe it or not, the only other James Bond film I have ever seen is Casino Royale. Yes people, feel bad for me if you must. But what's obvious about this series is that one doesn't have to be familiar with most of them, or even perhaps any at all. I saw Royale around 5 years ago and haven't since, but was still to fully enjoy Skyfall. Who knew Sam Mendes could direct a franchise action film like this, but he does so masterfully. On a technical level it's pretty brilliant, with a wonderful score from Newman and unsurprisingly fantastic and crisp cinematography from the God Roger Deakins. Bardem is the stand-out here. He clearly has a lot of fun with the role and it shows, and in a very strong year for Supporting Actor contenders, he might even be in the Top 5 for me.",Null,2,7,5 January 2013
The Young Victoria," Great acting
","I don't think the film really sets itself apart from other period-bio films from its ilk. It has the usual sort of sentimentality. But, that doesn't mean it's not a good film. Rupert Friend is his usual pretty self, very hot, but he does bring a lot to his role. He can usually be very stoic and emotionless while being just decorated as pretty, but can often not bring much to the table. Here, he absolutely does. He's able to paint the shades of his character well, even if another more talented actor could've brought even more to it. But really, the film belongs to Emily Blunt, a severely underrated actress who brings so much to her roles, and in a leading role, she can knock it out of the park like she does here. She's incredible, definitely snubbed of an Oscar nomination.",Null,2,2,19 January 2015
The Hangover," The biggest laugh-out-loud experience in years!
","The Hangover is a riot! I did not think it would be this funny, but it was. It is outrageous, entertaining, crude, vulgar, and even offensive, but man, the best comedy in years. The cast is brilliant, especially Zach Galifianakis, who has given the best performance of the year so far. Rachael Harris was fantastic as such a b-word. The writing and direction are perfect. It really seemed it came from Judd Apatow, and I am glad that Todd Phillips still has some of the humor that he did in Old School. Thank you Todd Phillips for making the best R-Rated comedy of the year, and the funniest film in quite some time (along with the horror-comedy Drag Me To Hell!)The Hangover is quite a ride!",Null,3,4,5 July 2009
The Ring," Beautiful and frightening!
","The Ring is a very well-made mystery thriller. First off, the writing is very good for a film of this genre. Sure, there are some flaws in the screenplay, but ultimately, very well written with touches of drama, suspense, and mystery. Namoi Watts is a strong leading lady, and she gives a great performance here, touching on all the emotions her character should go through. A small cameo from Amber Tamblyn is great, she is truly a strong young actress. Martin Hendeson is good, but nothing special. The true standouts in this film were Brian Cox, David Dorfman, and Daveigh Chase. Brian Coz is one of the strongest older actors working today, and he does the best with his small screen time. Both David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase give two of the best child performances I have seen in recent years. Both are genuinely very creepy and mysterious.The Ring is technically perfect. Gore Verbinski is a really talented director, and he makes the film be as creepy as it is. Another aspect of the film I found to be masterful was the photography and cinematography. There are so many beautiful shots in this film. Some are scary, some are mysterious, some are just well-crafted. I think this might be the best shot 'horror' film in the last 10 years. There is so much depth and color to each shot. The film is also very high on atmosphere. It might also be the most atmospheric film of the decade, even more-so than The Others from 2001.Overall, The Ring is a beautifully shot suspense/horror film, with some really scary scenes. It is flawed, but it achieves so much. It has all the elements to become a future horror classic, among films like The Exorcist and Poltergesit.",Null,1,1,23 July 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Pretty fun
","Now, I'm not a huge Spielberg fan. I like most of his films, but not to a really high degree (the exception is Jaws, really). This is another in the long line of his films. I like it enough, but not love it. I do think it gets a little tiresome as it goes on, a little too exhausting, but it still remains fun and the first half is aces. The opening 15 minutes, in fact, are truly fantastic. Probably one of the most casually thrilling openings in a film I've ever seen. Harrison Ford remains as captivating and charismatic as he was in the Star Wars films. He's just so charming and so, so handsome and adorable. Overall, this is some good stuff, recommended.",Null,0,0,12 July 2014
United 93," Powerful, masterful filmmaking.
","United 93 is rarely mentioned when great cinema of the last few years is talked about. It isn't hard to see why. Films of this nature that are based on incredibly large disasters can always be criticized for different aspects. This is a very vulnerable subject, and a film like this can very easily step into melodramatic or overwrought fare. Which is why United 93 works so well. It doesn't.Technically, the film's cinematography captures the tension and sadness of such a day perfectly because it allows for a more realistic connection. There is where trouble could brew. If a film like this was shot in a very stylized manner, or even in a way that people would say resembles a regular film, well of course it will get complaints. It is very difficult for the audience to separate a film from the event it is based on, especially the event that is he single worst day the United States ever had. United 93 never wants to make it a regular film though. It isn't emotionally-manipulative either. It carefully captures the events and reactions to that day. Not only are the sections inside the plane gripping, but the ones outside as well. Not once did I question any shot or scene. But then again, we have to remember the tragic event it is based on, and memories come flooding by. I am giving the only perfect score of 2006 to United 93. It definitely is hard to watch and to grasp, but it isn't a completely melodramatic affair (uhm, Titanic... although to be fair that one is merely fiction in its central plot) and it definitely is engaging and completely gripping. Also to note the music score, which is only used softly at times and for the most part the lack of it allows us to be absorbed into the reality better. As a stand-alone film it is fantastic as well, even with perhaps imagined events.",Null,2,3,27 October 2011
It," Wickedly entertaining, funny, and insane
","These thoughts are coming from someone who has never read or seen the original TV miniseries- I liked it a lot. The fact that it manages to work is quite impressive. It has the usual mainstream Hollywood jump scares, the usual set up and structure, and it's in your face. Yet it manages to work for many reasons. One reason is that the horror set pieces, despite being kind of obvious, are incredibly fun. The film has the benefit of having a villain that can manifest in different ways and the film definitely takes that opportunity to run away with really throwing horror scenes out there like not many recent horror films have. Its biggest strength is in its characters though. The character work isn't flawless, but the cast delivers and you grow to really care for them. Even if the horror failed, the characters might have been enough, and the humor they bring is infectious. Great horror + great characters = A definite success. However, it's not without its share of flawsI mentioned that the horror in the film works. It does, but I'm also not quite sure why. Like I said, it has the usual jump scares along with loud, over-the-top music that, while startling when the scenes happen, don't build enough atmosphere. The insanity of the horror seems to work, despite the horror being exactly what people criticize when they think of mainstream horror films and their lack of nuance. Horror scenes are fun when they're happening, but they don't really have any lasting impact after they end. It's a type of horror that very much works in the moment, and while scenes work in startling you, it's not exactly scary. The film is also sometimes awkward and rushed. It takes some time for it to start flowing smoothly, as in the first thirty minutes it feels like it's showing a bunch of random scenes with characters we don't know very much. I'm sure all of that worked better in the book, but the film definitely feels like an adaptation that needs to hurry up and get where it needs to be. The pacing isn't terrible, but it definitely feels rushed in moments (some more than others) and all of that contributes to what I said about there being a lack of atmosphere. The pacing and first act could have needed some polishing to feel crisper and cleaner. Still, those problems weren't significant enough to damage the film too much or to take away from the enjoyment.As someone who has never read or seen the source material. I did walk away with quite a few questions. I don't require all films to explain the events that transpire. I mean, I finished Twin Peaks: The Return just a few days ago and I don't feel like the series owes me any answers. However, once you open the door midway, you need to reveal everything inside it. I feel like the film gave promise of explanation and there was none, and I walked away with a few questions that I am really interested in seeing explain and that I have included below (I have probably already gone online to get them, but I'm still mentioning this here). The following contains spoilers¬ÖWhat exactly was It? Who was Pennywise? I had a theory throughout that perhaps it was an innocent man of some sort who was killed in some accident. I also strongly believed that the townspeople were in on it. The way all of them acted was so bizarre, but this was never touched on. It just seemed like the film opened up the possibility of explanation (outside of the 27-year recurrence) but nothing. I was also annoyed that of course the girl ends up with the male lead of the film, despite the film trying to give Ben moments. What was all of that for? It would have been amazing had Ben and Bev ended up together. I also expected the film to jump forward in time to 27 years later, but I guess the 'Chapter One' thing revealed why they didn't show that just yet.",Null,2,10,10 September 2017
Hereditary," The David Lynch of horror films
","So Hereditary is many things, but a quiet and subtle horror film it is not. I don't mean that as a criticism, I just simply think it's quite a bonkers film, very in your face and unapologetic about its intentions. Immediately after it was over I declared this this was the David Lynch of horror films. I struggle to think of another film in this genre that was as puzzling and mystifying as this. On a surface level, it works because the atmosphere, directing, and acting are all fantastic, but it works on deeper levels as well.",Null,21,42,12 June 2018
Casablanca," Pretty great
","There are advantages to taking a film class after all. Today I finally watched Casablanca, and it was a matter of sooner or later. Being the film buff that I am, I would probably have ended up seeing this no matter what. We went a little bit into the further historical context of the film, and all of the different historical backgrounds that would make us appreciate the film, and see it the way people back in the day saw it. That helps I guess, but it isn't necessary to know if a film is good or not. I liked it, a lot. It started off pretty unspectacular, but it does sort of give you a spin and it does let you accommodate to the characters after a while. I thought the standout was Ingrid Bergman, and I am surprised to see she wasn't even nominated. Humphrey Bogart is also pretty great, and his less-than-usual looks for a leading romance man made it more fascinating.",Null,2,3,7 March 2012
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Extremely fun and clever
","So I am now 18 years old and I was able to catch this film on Cartoon Network. I had definitely heard of it, but this was my first time seeing it. It was pretty much what I expected. A very fun, clever animated noir film that reminds you of everything Hollywood and the entertainment business is about. It's an extremely wonderful and entertaining film with clever sequences all around. It reminds me of my childhood filled with 2- D animated characters. I love how its also a mystery crime film, and in that aspect it got the period quite well. I feel as if here I am decades after it became an iconic film talking about it and that I was late, but it really is just a joy to watch. Story-telling at its best and most ambitious.",Null,0,0,25 September 2011
Training Day," Average
","Training Day starts off great, but by the end, it's ultimately just a very average film. The last act in particular drags down the film even more. Washington commands the screen and blurts out his dialogue in the best possible way, but as good as he is he cannot elevate what is simply a weak script. This material doesn't deserve him. Hawke is also pretty good, but here's the thing. No, I don't really smile at knowing he got a nomination for the Oscar because he was in no way a supporting actor. I'm sure everyone in the Academy knew this, but because Washington is so good and in fear of vote splitting, they carelessly voted for Hawke in supporting actor, robbing a true supporting actor that year a slot. I'm sure they knew it, but once again it shows just how political the Academy can be. This film is ultimately only worth a look for the two leads, but even then I can't recommend it much.",Null,1,3,2 November 2012
Detroit," Gripping, powerful, and hard to watch.
","I can definitely see why the critical reception wasn't higher than it was (not that it wasn't favorable). I think the beginning and bookend portions of the film are flawed. I appreciate that Boal/Bigelow wanted an epilogue, I just wish it had been executed a lot better. Other than the section of the film that is the main event, it's a little clunky and messy. Still, the majority of the film is gripping, powerful, and heartbreaking. It's definitely not going to make for a super fun and light Saturday night, but I do think the film has gotten a bit lost in the shuffle among all the other Oscar contenders, unfortunately. This is definitely one of the best ensemble casts of the year, with everyone delivering really strong work. It's great to again see Jason Mitchell as a stand-out.",Null,0,2,17 December 2017
In Bruges," One of the most brilliant and originally made films of the decade!
","I decided to see it because of all the good buzz it got from here. A surprisingly original and brilliant film! In Bruges has a very strong screenplay, full of great dialogue, unpredictable turns, and very original characters! The performances from the whole cast is great, but Colin Farrell is the central performance here! I never knew Farrell had the acting ability he demonstrated here. His performance, at times he is funny, at times, his performance centralizes over all the drama, all the twists. His accent, his expressions, a perfect performance, and he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination, I happen to think it is one of the best male performances of the decade. The film plays out soft and quiet, it certainly is a life-learning experience in a way. The film takes us on this man's journey, his journey with his partner, and his journey into the world of hit men, and the film makes something new. It makes this world a sort of livelier place to be, a sort of warm place, but only at the right times. The film is beautifully shot, and it makes it's points about the city Bruges. The cinematography is just gorgeous, as well as the haunting music score, that is manages to make every scene filled with more passion and emotion.In Bruges is very memorable, because it does things differently, it is not just a crime film, it is not just a comedy, it stands in the middle. It really absorbs you, because of the developed characters, because of their situations, because of what they go through, because of the lessons they each learn, and the lessons we learn with them. In Bruges is very human at it's core, and that is what it makes it stand out. One of the best films of the year, and one of the best examples of dark humor mix.",Null,9,16,5 December 2008
John Wick," Visually slick, a lot of fun
","Ultimately, doesn't really amount to much in terms of substance. But the film clearly knows that, the filmmakers are very aware and they play it up to its maximum potential. Reeves actually makes for a solid action lead here, and the film does good with its incredible style by allowing a lot of quiet intensity to play out before the big action scenes. The film is incredibly stylized, so I could see that being a problem for many, but to me, completely reminiscent of Drive and everything that art-house action can do. I don't know how the film will hold up in the future, but as of now, I'm in sort of love. I highly recommend this, aesthetically very pleasing and also a lot of fun.",Null,6,15,13 January 2015
Chinatown," Very impressive
","So I finally watched one of the most iconic films ever made. The mystery and suspense in Chinatown is fully-blown as a neo-noir film. It perfectly captures the time period in which it takes place, and its central story is very well-written. The performances are fantastic, the highlight being Faye Dunaway, whose only other performance I have seen is Network and she plays both characters with such precise distinction and force. The cinematography, art direction, and music give it the right mood as well, and the ending is quite brilliant, in fact, perfect. Overall, I don't know if I would say I loved it, but this is a film I can see revisiting in the future no doubt about it.",Null,2,3,31 October 2011

I don't think this is a perfect film, and it's not entirely original, but man does it work. The cinematography is outstanding, as are the sound and visual effects. The two leads are also pretty strong, Bullock in particular giving a performance I'm sure most people weren't aware she could give. This is a truly movie-star performance, one that will be associated with Bullock as a pea for the rest of her career.

Wind River," A solid film indeed, even if it could have gone further.
","I have to say, I was kind of disappointed. A solid film indeed, but it's not as well written as Sicario or Hell or High Water. It does show Taylor Sheridan to have some genuine talent and skill as a director, however, which is great. But it's surprising that this is his screenplay when he's proved himself to be such a crisp, natural writer. The overall plot and narrative is fine, but some of the dialogue comes across as a bit clunky and awkward, and there seem to be more than a few crime procedural clich√É¬©s used. Still, it's an enjoyable film with some strong work from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, even if the latter seems to get the short end of the stick. I feel like the film could have taken the opportunity to not be exactly what you expect when you hear a man and woman are going to team up, but sadly it stays on the wrong side of the line when it comes to giving the female character some truly juicy development.",Null,0,4,25 August 2017

","So I seem to not have written a review for this film back when I saw it two years ago. What can I say? It's a great film. All of the classic elements of a crime thriller. Of course, that powerful ending... it still worked very well on a rewatch. Morgan Freeman steals this film though. He is the much more interesting character, and gives a quiet, understated performance. Paltrow does as well in her limited screen time, as does Kevin Spacey. This feels like a Fincher film... it's impeccably, almost perfectly made, with the usual colors and cold tones that Fincher films have. Overall, from the 5 Finchers I have seen (this, Fight club, Zodiac, Benjamin Button, and The Social Network) this still ranks at the bottom, though all he has is great films, and I have rewatched all of his films at least once.",Null,1,2,23 December 2011
I'm Not There," An Artistic Triumph!
","I'm Not There is a bold and artistic triumph, one which will be difficult for the mainstream audience to accept. The film is not the typical biographical drama. It's editing and multiple characters and story lines are meant to embody Bob Dylan and his life. The ensemble cast is magnificent. Cate Blanchett gives a tour-de-force performance that really gives all the characteristics and mannerisms of Bob Dylan. She deserved that Oscar. Heath ledger's storyline, along with Blanchett's, is the most fascinating of the film. Ledger also does some great work in one of his last films. Charlotte Gainsbourg, who plays his wife, does some terrific work, and you can see she is a very talented actress. Having seen her in Antichrist, where she delivers one of the most realistic and raw performances in some time, she is an actress to look out for. Christian Bale and Ben Wishaw also capture some of Bob Dylan's energy, and while they have the most limited screen time of the six actors, they are also fascinating to watch. The cameos by Julianne Moore and others are really brilliant and give the film a documentary feel. Marcus Carl Franklin and Richard Gere have the least involving scenes, but they are not enough to lessen the film's imagination. Todd Haynes is a risk-taker to create such a bold and imaginative film. I'm Not There is not a film where it's plot matters much, just because what is important is the way it makes the audience feel Bob Dylan's presence, which is something that most autobiography films do not do. I'm Not There is an artistic cinematic experience that should be the kind of film people should celebrate.",Null,1,2,24 January 2010
The Big Lebowski," Very entertaining

I was sort of afraid that the Coens has made a very raunchy film that didn't fit in with the rest of their filmography. I had a blast! This is definitely one of their more light-hearted films, and it's a straight-up comedy. It had me laughing my ass off in many scenes. It is known as a 'stoner' film, and it is raunchy in a way without being too aggressive or without leaving a bad taste in your mouth. I was glad about that, because the Coens always seem to find a good-hearted approach to all their films, and I'm glad did this too. The star of the film was John Goodman, who had me laughing around 80% of the time he was on screen. Very enjoyable to watch. The film's isn't 'incredible', but it only adds strength to their resume that I have seen.",Null,1,2,28 November 2011

The action scenes are stunning! They are so well edited, the effects are amazing. The action in this film is some of the best in a very long time, and Michael Bay should take hint at how to do a real action film. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are the stars here, both delivering fantastic performances. Having no history whatsoever on Star Trek stories, I can honestly say this was the perfect sci-fi action film, and a perfect way to introduce Star Trek to new audiences!

","It's too easy to hate on this guy, simply because of the sh*t he says or does. What makes it harder is that he's incredibly talented. He was unbelievably good here. The whole cast was strong, but he just did so much to a higher extent. He has a scene near the end that basically encapsulates how powerful acting can be when it's delivered in such affecting, lived-in realism. Not a single ounce of superficiality. Definitely in my Supporting Actor line-up, possibly my win, and I so wish the film was a bigger awards player just so he could be in the conversation As for the film, way better than I expected. Like I said, great ensemble. The screenplay is pretty formulaic, not saying anything we haven't heard before, but still effective. Lerman is easily 2nd best in show and further cements me as a fan. Probably in my Top 5 for Lead Actor.",Null,2,7,29 November 2014
Fight Club," One of the best films of the 90's
","I did not know what to expect from Fight Club, but I gave it a try since I am a fan of Fincher's films Se7en, Zodiac, and the more recent The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film surprised me in it's style and tone. It has a very inventive narration and surreal images that only help make us go deeper into Edward Norton's character and his mind. I can safely say there are not too many films like this. The main premise seems simple, two men create a combat group that soon turn into a large cult or society. Although it is simple, the film's choices and execution are not simple. I was confused by a lot on this film, and I am sure this is a film I will have to watch more than once, but I was deeply invested in these characters. I felt the reason for the main characters' choices and the struggle with their lives that they felt they needed to overcome, and the only way to do that was by fighting, not for winning or losing, but to feel important and feel more absorbed in the practice of it all. Very original idea. I thought the writing was sensational, a lot of very thought-provoking ideas and dialogue in the film. I did not know what to expect, but the twist actually shocked me. I have seen a lot of films with twists similar to this, but the film executed it in a unique way and thought it fitted well. David Fincher's direction seemed more confident and mature here than in any other of his films. I cannot believe the screenplay writer from this also wrote Jumper(WOW). The performances here were brilliant. Norton was great, but the ones who truly shined were Pitt and Carter. I always feel both these actors, especially Helena, create some truly fantastic characters, and this is no exception. I did not always think Pitt was a capable actor, but with films like The Assassination of Jesse James, Benjamin Button and Burn After Reading from 2008, he has proved he is great. I am surprised neither Carter or Pitt got many awards or nominations.I thought Fight Club was fantastic, and in a truly weird sublime way, it was entertaining. Like I said, there were some tricky parts, but I thought it was a film that could be a disaster but had so many elements to it. Probably Fincher's best, along with Benjamin Button (I'll see which stands stronger as time goes by). Along with his other film, Se7en, one of the best of the 90's.",Null,2,6,6 August 2009

I don't see it being one of the most memorable films of 2017, but the performances (particularly Gary Oldman) definitely make it worth it.

Memento," One of the best films of the decade!
","I just watched this film, and having seen another film done by Christopher Nolan, the Prestige, this film is just as bizarre, if not more...I will start off with the writing. It is a very complicated, thought-out screenplay. Us having to wonder throughout the whole film why the character of Leonard kills a certain man, 'John G' gives us a reason to watch the film. This film is just like a puzzle. It gives you bits and bits, and it gives you real life memories that Leonard cannot himself remember. It starts off, and it had me worried, since these types of films can only do so much to solve the puzzles. The writing is consistently strong, as the film goes along, we are able to finally see how Leonard meets all these characters, and how he interacts with them. Well, the film is not only helped by its puzzling screenplay, but also by stand-out performances. Guy Pearce, this is the second film in which I have seen he stars in, and I know enough to say that he is a very underrated actor. His character has to carry the whole film, and his performance is consistently strong. His plays his character with grace, with confusion, and with emotion and force to do what he is willing to do to get revenge. The supporting performances are also all stand-out. Carrie-Ann Moss plays her mixed character amazingly. In one scene particularly, when she and Leonard have their only 'fight', well, her acting I thought was Oscar-worthy. It was also nice to see Joe Pantoliano be in this film. I have seen some of his work in The Sopranos, and in this film he really gives his character or Teddy a realistic touch, he gives him personality. I also thought some brief performances, like Stephen Tobolowsky, another TV star, I thought he did very well. Another great thing was the film editing. i can truly say it is amazing, and it makes the film feel fast-paced, yet complicated and never boring. The musical score was also settling, and was a very nice tone to the whole film.Now, this is a sort of a film you have to figure out, and about the ending, I am still a bit confused, and I can tell before I visit more fan topics about this film, that some people will absolutely HATE the ending. I don't hate it, but i think it works in both positive and negative ways. The negative is that it was not the final 'revelation' that films like these usually have. It wasn't really similar to The Prestige, with a big twist, and I thought needed to have one. BUT at the same time, it was a huge twist. The ending I do appreciate, because Nolan was not just trying to just tell a 'amnesia' thriller type film he was trying to say something more, and he succeeded. Now I can view as the main character, Leonard, as being both sort of crazy and alive. I think what the ending meant was that Leonard really needed a reason to live, because of his wife's death. That is why he will continue to create puzzles for himself. In a way, I appreciate film-making like this, but I do have my usual complaints.Overall, this is a film not to be missed. I had never heard of it, and I think after seeing a couple of Nolan films, it proves he is at the top of being the most original, complexing, 'alive' director(Note- i have yet to see The Dark Knight) I will try to purchase this film, I think it deserves a repeat viewing, especially since the ending didn't reveal 'too' much... Anyways, a thought-out independent film, one that I think should be remembered in years to come. Definitely among the best of the decade",Null,0,2,25 July 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino's Blast!
","I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino. I completely loved Pulp Fiction, and has some of the best dialogue ever written. I was a fan of his Kill Bill films, and I loved Death Proof almost as much as Pulp Fiction, and had a great time with it. Inglorious Basterds is another remarkable achievement from Tarantino. It is a clever, funny, audacious and entertaining spin on World War II. I loved it. I did not know what to expect, if more of a comedy or a drama, but ultimately it had the classic Tarantino features. The film is superbly written, and I enjoyed all of the dialogue, which of course is what Tarantino does best. This is no exception. I was completely emerged into this other world, one we have never seen before. The performances were all very strong. Brad Pitt shines here, but then again, I have always found him to be a very charismatic actor, and I enjoy almost all of his work. Christoph Waltz did not disappoint after hearing all of the praise. His performance is not overly-flashy, but it works perfectly. He is without a doubt the best in the film, and that is saying a lot. Classic performance I am sure. But a lot of others impressed me a lot also. M√©lanie Laurent and Diane Kruger were very good, Til Schweiger and Daniel Br√ºhl almost equally as great as Waltz. Pitt, Waltz, and these four made the film. Eli Roth was quite good, and I enjoyed seeing him perform in this. The cameo by Mike Myers was very funny, and Martin Wuttke created a very memorable Hitler. Similar to Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, the film had a lot of blending music, and I loved it for that. The costumes and set designs were all exquisite, and I loved all of it.Although I am a quite a big Tarantino fan, sometimes his films do overload in my viewings, sometimes I have some sort of resentment towards them. Pulp Fiction, sometimes I feel it is very disturbing and very violence-oriented, and Kill Bill the same, and I feel like it is stuffed with style, but sometimes I wonder about the substance. Also, I find Kill Bill sort of overrated, whereas I find Death Proof very underrated. I still love them, yeah, but I feel that way sometimes. I am not sure whether I will feel the same way from time to time with Inglorious Basterds, but I do think it is equally as great as Pulp Fiction, and I think it will fare very well with time!",Null,3,9,2 September 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Pretty good
","I thought The Force Awakens was a highly entertaining film, but it also suffered from being way too derivative and formulaic. As a result, it hasn't stood to be as memorable as one could hope. Rogue One does well in limiting the amount of humor (there was too much in Force Awakens), but it also sometimes comes off as too serious. It also has some trouble in developing this new story and the new characters, it becomes a little too jumbled. Once it settles in, it becomes more enjoyable. The one thing is has over Force Awakens is that the visual and special effects are absolutely fantastic, and the action set-pieces really impressive. The story here is a bit lacking, but more than enough positives make up for the negatives.",Null,2,7,18 December 2016
Coraline," A fantastic and visually-stunning film!
","Coraline is visually stunning and very entertaining. The screenplay adds a lot of layers to the film, especially the idea of ignored children and unresponsive parents. The animation is beautiful to look at, and very impressive. The film has a dark tone to it, but in a fantasy way, sort of like Alice in Wonderland. The voice-overs are very impressive as well. It all seems very natural, and the film has a Tim Burton feel to it. Just like The Nightmare Before Christmas, it might be a little too dark for young children at times, but props to this amazing film. It is the best animated film of the year so far, yes, better than Up. Hopefully it is in contention for the Animated Feature Oscar next year.",Null,0,2,15 November 2009
This Is the End," Hilarious and inventively entertaining!
","This Is The End is completely bonkers, and that's what makes it work. This sort of R-rated comedy is usually hit or miss with me overall, and while not all of the jokes in this one hit right (the rape jokes in particular, get to be way too much as it goes on) it's overall, whole satisfying and hilarious. Not only is it hilarious though, but it has an inventive and truly unique concept here for a comedy, one that I can only wonder how giddy these people were when they came up with it. The whole cast does some fine, fine work and they all work as truly unique individuals and characters here, and the climax is truly magnificent. There isn't many other ways to describe how much I loved this film, but it's truly so well done and it's destined to be a cult classic of some sort. Oh, and the final scene with the appearance by a certain artist was, well, shocking!",Null,2,9,19 June 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Entertaining and fast-paced
","I have not seen the original this was based off of, but the beginning alone of Dawn of the Dead makes the film worthwhile. I also really liked that there was a concept of the reason that there are people like this is because there is no more room in hell. I thought that is a pretty different idea than other zombie flicks (of course, it is probably owed to the 1978 version). The performances are solid, and honestly the whole film is pretty entertaining, even if nothing remarkable. It is in between a serious horror and a horror/comedy, more serious than Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead, but more campy than 28 Days Later. Still, it makes for a good time.",Null,0,0,31 October 2010
The Hunger Games," Pretty excellent
","I have never read any of the novels that the film is based on. I was never really highly anticipating this film. I saw this weeks after it came out, with the hype already having died down. So after saying all of that, what do I get? A pretty excellent and viscerally exciting blockbuster.I think that the film does a very good job of being able to stand on its own two feet. It moves pretty quickly, but it never drags in any places. It also really does hold a lot of emotional impact. As the film goes on, we see more and more of the 'usual' blockbuster trademarks, like music appearing especially louder in a 'sad' scene. But it all works well. The film editing and cinematography are brilliant in the way they give the film it's tone and it's visceral excitement. A lot of people have complained about the cinematography especially, but I honestly loved it, and it's a big part of why the film worked so well.How about the performances? All pretty good. But this is Jennifer Lawrence's film. She was great in Winter's Bone, but here she develops her character in a much more fascinating fashion. I loved Winter's Bone, it's one of the best films of 2010, but I was one of the few who thought that Lawrence's performance had some weak points definitely. Here? Not at all, she manages to show her traits and her subtle emotional ticks much better. As it is, she's an actress to watch out for, and this is her best performance yet.Overall, I can't say everything in the film worked perfectly. I thought that the relationship between Peeta and Katniss was a bit forced, a bit awkward. I didn't completely buy it, then again I'm not so sure I was supposed to because I have heard book fans say they are 'faking' it... could someone clarify on that? But as it is, this is great blockbuster entertainment, and a great film.",Null,3,11,19 April 2012
Zootopia," Really fascinating political themes
","I don't remember the last time an animated film's themes were so political and so prominent in everything the film was trying to do. Huge props to this, a family animated film focusing so heavily on race, prejudice, and equality? Incredibly fresh, exciting, and a very, very significant theme to introduce to children. For that reason alone it should be praised. The themes aren't subtle, but they can't be, not for the target audience here. Of course, the film is also incredibly well-written. it follows a specific formula, but boy does it do it well. Funny and witty, emotionally-heartfelt, incredibly entertaining. I'm not surprised it turned out to be such the crowd-pleaser with both audiences and critics. The voice work is also fantastic (I just love Bateman voicing animated characters). Jenny Slate was also a hoot. This will definitely be in the running for the Oscar for Animated Feature.",Null,7,13,21 May 2016
12 Monkeys," Brad Pitt is fantastic
","I can't say I totally got on board with this. It starts off promisingly enough, but it just gets more confusing, and I usually like that but it also got more dull as it went on. It's not totally bad though, as some of the performances are pretty good, except Willis, who once again fails to impress me at all. Brad Pitt is like the biggest reason to see this, and I just wish he had more screen time but as it is he infuses his scenes with a sort of wacky thrill and energy that the rest of the film is missing. This is definitely one of his best performances, and it's nice to see some greatness from him even this early on. This is not really recommended.",Null,0,1,14 July 2014
The Impossible," Effective
","The Impossible is definitely an emotionally-manipulative film, as manipulative a film as one can get (hmm, perhaps not as much... just imagine Spielberg directing this!). But it was still very effective, the first act being among some of the best scenes of the year. The whole cast is great as well. Watts is fine here definitely, but I'm not sure she's much any better than McGregor, who has a phone call scene that is heartbreaking in its own right. The kids all hold their own as well and are overall pretty impressive. So this is definitely recommended, and while I'm sure many won't like just how shamelessly emotional it is, it's still worth it.",Null,4,8,5 January 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Very funny
","So I had seen Shaun of the Dead before...but it was always scattered scenes of it. Today I finally saw it in its entirety and it is a very funny film. The satire in it is great, and the way the 'Dead' is not just referring to the obvious zombies but also to the world Shaun himself lived in is great. I do feel that it becomes a little tired in its last act, and I do think Zombieland is the better comedy zombie film. However this has the better performances and the character of Ed is always pretty damn entertaining. I just wish the film hadn't lost the same spark it had in the beginning. Overall, it's very funny and definitely recommended for horror fans (and anyone at that).",Null,0,2,21 October 2011
Argo," Incredibly tense
","Argo is easily one of the most entertaining films of the year. It's definitely not hard to be swept up by its incredible tension or its technical mastery, the editing and the fierce pace of it all. There are a few scenes that don't fit in with the tone as well, but it doesn't really do damage. Affleck has yet again proved he's an incredibly capable director, and he's a large reason as to why this works so well. It's also a film where you feel very emotionally invested in. By the end I realized just how effective it all was.Now, the problem with such a perfect mainstream film like this (and it's definitely a film that all audiences can enjoy) is that, when looking at the structure of it all, it's not a particularly meaningful film. It's one of those films where the more you will think about it, the more you will see all of the strings and the successful formula that, although incredibly well done, is still rather one-note. But that's how films like this can be, and while this is a film where I don't see much afterthought, it still manages to be one of the best of 2012 and Affleck's best directed one.",Null,0,1,8 December 2012
Last Flag Flying," Worthwhile, Cranston is marvelous
","I had pretty low expectations for this going into it. The premise just did not sound very interesting. To my surprise, the film turned out to be much better. I think what makes it work is that, at its core, it is a dialogue-driven Richard Linklater film. The intimate and one-on-one conversations throughout the film make it pop and are incredibly entertaining. The problem is that the premise and the plot structure around which those conversations are built are incredibly flawed, sometimes seeming inconsequential and incredibly contrived. If Linklater had found a better way to structure the main conversations and main trio around a better plot, it would have been an undeniably great film. As it is, it's a good, sometimes very good, one. Both Laurence Fishburne and Bryan Cranston give some strong work here, especially the latter. After several films where he has given broad, over-the-top, cartoonish performances that lack any real authenticity (e.g., Trumbo, All The Way) I was beginning to think Cranston had forgotten the art of nuance. Here, he's able to bring nuance and real, heartfelt authenticity to the role while still bringing the showiness as it calls for it. Finally my faith in him as an actor has been restored, after having disappointed again and again since Breaking Bad. This is the performance he should be in awards consideration for. On the flipside, this is yet again another dramatic performance from Steve Carell that feels forced and unnatural. Even with great roles like the one in Foxcatcher he fails to be entirely convincing. Here he's not entirely bad, but he sticks out like a sore thumb when compared to Fishburne and Cranston.",Null,1,7,28 December 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Pretty fantastic! Spectacular ride
","Even though the film just came out, the notion among many critic reviews seems to be that while it's definitely a success, it's a definite step down from the 2009 version. The 2009 version is the only Star Trek- related thing I've ever seen, and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was pretty much the perfect blockbuster, and probably the best blockbuster of the last several years. It was definitely fun, but in a way that blockbusters rarely are these days. There was a gleeful attitude that the film carried, one where it wasn't just the action pieces that had you giggling with delight but the writing of the characters. I'm happy to say that Into Darkness carries that same level of excitement and absolute delight. It's definitely more action-packed, but it never feels like excess for the sake of it and instead it's a great experience. The cast here is at the top of their game, with Pine coming across even more charismatic, watchable and completely likable and Cumberbatch being the film's MVP and delivering a true performance worthy of much hype. Karl Urban was the one main cast member from the original that I didn't really like, but he's greatly improved here. Overall, I think this was fantastic and I'm so ready for more of these. It's truly the only big franchise right now I truly care about and the only one that doesn't feel half-baked. I do think I prefer the 2009 film, but both are on the same level and it's not out of anything this one did wrong.",Null,5,14,17 May 2013
12 Angry Men," A tense and absorbing classic!
","12 Angry Men is a very entertaining film. It is full of great writing, directing, cinematography, and acting! Henry Fonda proves to be a very strong leading man. His performance here is flawless as a man trying to convince 11 other jurors about the possibility of a man's innocence. Lee J. Cobb is phenomenal, as well as E.G. Marshall. The twists and turns the film goes though are very absorbing, and when the film is done, you feel like you know every one of these characters very well. Sidney Lumet is a very talented director, he captures some very nice shots, and some very long shots that are powerful. 12 Angry Men is one of those rare black-and-white films that are actually very entertaining.",Null,0,0,22 July 2009
Hostel," A throwback to comedic and gory classic Horror!
","I have to say, the only reason I wanted to see Hostel was because it, along with Saw, is what started the trend of 'torture porn'. I was anticipating something along the lines of Saw, but got something way different. Whereas Saw was very much a drama/crime thriller with clever plot twists all around, and had more disturbing scenes, Hostel is the opposite. From the get-go, it knows it is a horror film, it bombards the audience with all the sex and nudity it can, it acts stupid and moral-less, but the film actually starts off slow. It introduces these characters, that although we know they are unlikeable, Eli Roth knows how to make us care for them. I do not think that would matter if they had not been very well developed, but it is a plus side. Hostel is more gory than Saw, Saw actually never had much gore (which is a very under-hidden fact). Hostel has a lot of gore, but not very realistic, which I thought made it even better. It reminded me of classic horror films that had loud dramatic music, cheesy actions and dialogue, but still managed to not be a joke. Saw was way more intense, but that is because it took itself a lot more seriously. Hostel actually does not have a lot of horror parts, but when it does, it does not disappoint in gore. I was a big fan of Roth's earlier horror film, Cabin Fever. I thought it was fun and funny, and Hostel is too, but is also more likable in a way. The performances, while in a way look cheesy, are still very good, and in acting, Hostel beats Saw.I very much started to like the film, and by the end, I loved it. There are not this many gory, fun, and cleverly comedic horror films these days. They try to be, but not in this way. Thumbs up for Hostel,a nd it holds it's own.",Null,0,4,26 May 2009
Green Room," Lean, tight, and well-paced
","I guess I expected something different than what I got (expected more of a horror film), but after coming to terms with what it was and what it was not, I thought this was really good. Saulnier had a really fantastic handle on the film's pace and tone, and I think the screenplay is really lean and tight and, surprisingly, very smart. I think the film's dialogue was a strength whereas with other films of this type its their weakest. The acting was also uniformly very good. It's mostly kind of a simple, run-of-the-mill thriller, but it also has a lot of interesting touches that I found very inspired. The uneasiness and uncertainty of the entire climax and the ending felt really earned, and showing the other side of things (Patrick Stewart and Macon Blair). I don't think the villains came off stereotypically, and I think the whole film was handled nicely.",Null,3,12,19 May 2016
Public Enemies," Interesting, but flawed
","The film starts off very promisingly, and I was really invested with it in the first 40 minutes. I thought they were really great, but it was not long that I started feeling the film was not as compelling as it needed to be. The film does have some really great scenes, most notably the action sequences. They were impeccably shot, perfectly directed. The film overall does have very good directing by Michael Mann, but the screenplay needed more intriguing drama. A film like this needs to be keeping you at the edge of your seat throughout, and this film did not. I did admire the impressive set designs, the flawless costumes, and the gritty cinematography (which I thought was actually very impressive). The cast was also great. Johnny Depp was very impressive, giving one of his best performances to date. Christian Bale was good, but nothing remarkable. Marion Cotillard also shined through. Just like in her other film of the year, Nine, she proves she is one of the best rising talents and proves she is a worthy Oscar winner. Here, she is strong and I felt for her character the most. She does the most with her screen time, and Depp and her really were great together. She was particularly great in the scene where she is held captive to give information on John Dillinger's whereabouts. Overall, I did like the film, I do admire it, but it could have been better.",Null,0,0,8 February 2010
The Babadook," Atmospheric and creepy
","Another really good horror entry this year. Not particularly original, like at all, but some effective atmosphere, some great suspense, and some strong acting make this certainly worthwhile. Sadly, I wasn't a big fan of the last 20 minutes or so. It just got silly and deflated a lot of the suspense, although it wasn't like a train wreck though. Still, very much recommended, and I got a new scary (or funny, depending on how you look at it) catchphrase. I'm sure many will be discouraged by the fact that this really isn't anything new (Sinister and The Conjuring come to mind, more so the former) but still, supremely effective at times, worth it.",Null,6,15,31 October 2014

"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The funniest and most clever animated film ever made
","South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a very feverished and troubled satirical look at our society today, from politics to morals. For those fans of the show, this is practically a very longer, more epic, more exciting episode of the show, not that there is anything wrong with that. These days, most films based on shows lose the steam of what makes them so good on TV. This film is not that. Instead, we get the rude, disturbing, and bold jokes, together with some really twisted characters along the way. I found myself laughing at every bit. This is certainly a film that people must have thought 'We should do this, NAH' simply because no one ever thought a film, especially an animated film like this could ever be done. Yet here it is, and it does not disappoint. This is a risk taking film, and I admire it for that, but also, a guilty pleasure at everything wrong with the world today, yet we cannot help but laugh. And that is a good sign",Null,1,1,21 March 2009
The Danish Girl," Not bad, not great
","I don't think this film was great. Tom Hooper being behind the camera kind of prevents that from happening, although surprisingly enough, I didn't think he interfered here as much as he did with The King's Speech or Les Miserables. I think some of the proceedings and dilemmas are a bit problematic in how they are presented, but overall it was a story I bought. I thought Redmayne was pretty good in the role, he did all it required him to do. The problem is that I don't think the screenplay really went any deeper into a psychologically complex character. I know it's easy to hate him, but he's a very good actor and while I don't think he deserved an Oscar, he still is rather underrated around here. Alicia Vikander also gives so much to her role. In many ways she's the true heart of the film. The fact that she was campaigned as supporting is ridiculous (although not nearly as ridiculous as Jacob Tremblay and Rooney Mara's frauds). I have no idea where she came from before this year, but she's an incredibly talented actress whose career I only hope gets better from here on out.",Null,4,10,23 December 2015
Elizabeth," Truly fantastic performance
","This type of subject matter never really interests me in film, but to my surprise, the film works so well as a thriller. It has a palpable energy and tone, one where you feel the heightened tension consuming everyone and can feel all of the dangers and everything at stake. This is primarily about Elizabeth's transformation, and at that it succeeds quite well. However, it never becomes anything more than solid. There's nothing extraordinary here, aside from maybe Blanchett's performance (although her best is I'm Not There). Still, definitely better than it had any right to, and definitely solid work boosted by some great performances from the cast.",Null,0,1,11 May 2013

Spider-Man 2," The best Superhero movie ever made!!!!
","Actually, today I repeated seeing Spider-Man 2, after making a Top 55 film list, to see if I made the right choice in including it, and I have to say, I did...First off, Sider-Man 2 is the best superhero film ever made, I think. There are a lot, but none come to the development that this film had. It is an achievement, not only in creating another good Spider-Man film after the original, but in succeeding in making it even better than the first. First off, it is so well made. It starts off strong, and it keeps going and going. It moves at a very well pace. It is not too fast, but it gives time to scenes that make the audience emotionally react to the characters. That is what makes it so strong. The characters are given depth and time in creating, and they do not come off as cheesy or unrealistic Marvel characters. Peter Parker is treated as a real human being, and that is the main lesson this film gives. Throughout the film, Peter Parker is trying to learn who he really is. It is a film about self discovery, and I think it gives off very strong points. There are very well-written speeches, yes, they seem a bit clich√©d, but that is because this film is reinforcing themes that usual superheroes need to give, and in that way it succeeds. Actually, I had never seen this film and thought 'wow, that was great writing' but this time I did. I don't just mean in the dialogue, but in the writing itself. The film gives a lot of very memorable little comedic moments. For instance, when Peter Parker falls down trying to use his powers, and then he touches a car and it starts beeping. This scene is so well put, so well done, that we can't help but laughing even though it seems 'cheesy'. Never before had I seen a movie and thought that the cheesiness of it made it so good. But this film, the cheesy parts are so well-intended, I couldn't help but laugh. This film succeeds in making the humor side work. The other side of it that is really strong is the acting. This time in my viewing, I found the acting to stand-out. First off, James Franco gives a very memorable supporting performance of a young man in search of a little revenge, and lost inside. The scene when he slaps Peter in the party is so well acted, by Tobey Maguire too. Another scene that I thought I found myself thinking 'This looks like an Oscar-worthy acting moment' was when Peter Parker confesses to Aunt May what happened the night Uncle Ben died. The acting from both Tobey Maguire, and the horror in Rosemary Harris' face was so strong, just wow. Kirsten Dunst did not annoy me in this film like she did in the first and third. It seems like in this film, she really conveys the emotions her character is going though very well. Of course, this is a blockbuster, and in the action scenes it does not disappoint. There are not many, but each one is very well done. The special effects are also top-notch. It's Oscar Win for the effects was very well deserved. I view this film as an action Blockbuster with brains. It is not for the people who want non-stop action, and that is a VERY good thing. It is a very solid and strong film, and it is top-notch in every aspect. That is why this is Marvel's best film to date, and why it is the best superhero film I have ever seen. Not just that, but it is one of the best action Blockbuster films ever, if not the best... 9/10",Null,1,2,20 June 2008

127 Hours," Boyle's best yet. Mesmerizing, Unforgettable, and ultimately Excellent
","Danny Boyle already has an Oscar under his belt for his incredible direction in Slumdog Millionaire. While I thought Boyle himself did amazing in Slumdog, I never truly fell in love with the film itself. In 28 Days Later Boyle also proved that he is able to command films with a true power and beauty, and to this day it remains one of the most influential horrors of the last 10 years. Here in 127 Hours, Boyle is again working full force and makes what is his best film yet.I have seen many films of this type before but that doesn't mean a film like this is unoriginal or trite. It is based on a book that is based on a true story about a young man who is trapped beneath a canyon in a boulder. The story is simple, so it goes without saying that the screenplay has to come to life with a director willing to put a visual and realistic stamp on it. Here comes Boyle, who is able to visually command his films in a certain unique way. The film is never once dull because we are here watching Boyle and Franco do a career-best performance behind the camera and in front. Franco is powerful and I am very glad that he was able to star in a film like this where he is the only true cast and has to actually perform under imaginary difficult circumstances.Like I said before, Boyle puts a visual stamp on his film so it makes it stand out from other films of this type. The cinematography is incredible, as is the music score. In the end this is not a depressing film but it certainly does have some very disturbing scenes, and it is one of the best films of the year.",Null,1,5,6 January 2011

It's emotionally engaging, visually amazing, and the characters stay with you. The highlight is Dory, the fish whose voice is done by none other than Ellen Degeneres. Hopefully she never makes another animated voice again so this one is even more special because of that. The ending is pretty emotional, and the film tackles some important family themes that will hit hard. This is one of Pixar's best. Go see it for sure!",Null,0,2,21 April 2011

","Superbad must be my favorite of all of the raunchy sex comedy films. It is undeniably funnier than 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, and surprisingly, it hit a bigger note with me as far as heart. I mean, the first half of the film the film portrays some very gross and sex related comedy, and I have to say, it had me laughing uncontrollably. The second half of the film is not as funny as the first, but as the film ends, it portrays the heart it had from the beginning. The film did have flaws of course, while some of the cop scenes were hilarious, their gags got old as the film started to end, but thankfully we always had the Seth-Evan relationship to keep the film going. All in all, this film is funnier than Mottola's Adventureland, since it is more raunchy, but both films to me are very successful accomplishments. Superbad is Superhilarious!",Null,0,2,14 May 2010
Creed," Nothing inherently interesting at all
","I'd rather not spend 120 minutes watching a film that is seriously step-by-step a copy of so many others before it. There's absolutely nothing interesting about it with any of the characters aside from Rocky, and that's because we already have that connection with him (I only watched the original before seeing this, and thought that was mostly an entertaining, engaging, heartfelt film). Nothing in the story is original, nothing in any of the supporting characters is original or interesting (I can't tell you how much I hate the 'let's make the opponent boxer a real jerk' clich√©). Nothing in any of the shots is interesting or original, nothing in the story is surprising. It's exactly the kind of film audiences will continue to eat up until the end of time and there will be thousands more like it. No, it's not offensive or bad, but I don't think that's enough. It's exactly the kind of boxing/sports film I always think of in my head when I say I'm not huge on boxing/sports films because they don't add anything new. Michael B. Jordan, god bless him, but he just can't elevate such an inherently uninteresting character. There's nothing there to do. Sylvester Stallone is by far the best thing about it, he has such a nice warmth and presence .

The deaths are quite crazy and hilarious, and the film always outlandish. Not an incredible film by any means, but the last half is definitely better and kinda lives up to what I thought it would be like. This is one to be watched with a bunch of friends. Overall, it is equal to Shaun of the Dead. None of it lives up to the first half of Shaun, but its last half is stronger than Shaun's so overall, they balance each other out. Still, I had wish maybe it was a bit better and more unpredictable (although the 'killers' certainly were awesome and their reveal was the best scene in the film).",Null,0,0,25 November 2011
The Others," A Masterpiece that could sit with Horror classics like The Exorcist and Halloween
","The Others is without a doubt one of the few epic classic-feel Ghost Stories of the decade, and perhaps the only great ghost story in recent years. Alejandro Amen√°bar's direction is superb. He directs with great confidence, majestically structures every scene, and thanks to the cinematographer, creates a truly suspenseful thriller. His screenplay is also brilliant, captivating in all of those classic mansion stories, and giving a lot to play with. But he also does what none of the new thrillers do- give his characters passion and feel. Nicole Kidman gives a brilliant performance here, her best work of the new century. She gives her character sophistication, but her character is also flawed and sometimes not too likable, and she plays it brilliantly. The two child performances are also captivating, especially James Bentley. The whole cast is superb, making this film grander and more epic than I would have thought. The music is amazing. Kind of like the classic music from old horror films. The ending actually surprised me, which is rare, and because I was not sure how many ways it could have ended. The Others could easily have been done in the 70's, and I actually preferred it to the classic The Exorcist (which I really do not like all that much). Bravo to The Others, for that rare thriller, but again, it was made in 2001, which was actually quite some time ago.",Null,0,2,3 July 2009
Brokeback Mountain," A true American Love Masterpiece. One of the best of the decade
","I saw Brokeback Mountain yesterday, and it left me very emotional...First off, this is a Masterpiece. It really is. There is no other words to describe it. The screenplay is very well written. If anyone wants to write a very well-done love story, this should be their guide. The screenplay allows us to connect with both Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar. Ang Lee's direction with this film is amazing. I think him as the director made it what it was also. He was not afraid to do a homosexual film like this, and I approve of him for that. He was able to control both Ledger and Gyllenhaal's actions, and actually make them have a lot of chemistry on-screen. This film would not have worked if they didn't have that 'connection'.The acting in this film is totally ensemble, and they are all great. Heath Ledger as Enis gave the best performance. Probably because every scene he was totally in-character. He has a sort of 'look', a western cowboy accent also. He showed compassion, but confusion at everything happening. He showed sadness, and despair, and anger at his situations. His nomination was very well deserved, and in any other year, he would have won. Jake Gyllenhaal was just as equally great. His character, Jack Twist, had less screen time, and less things to work with, but in great scenes, he really shows his acting abilities. Even though Ledger was also amazing, he sometimes gets overshadowed by him. He showed his eagerness, and in some ways, he was more desperate to be with a man, and his acting helped in that. His later scenes, when he was older, scenes when he was living his life, and when he burst out in the mountain to Enis, surprised me. Michelle Williams gave a very subtle and very in-depth performance. Her pain she had to live with was too much to handle for her, and her acting really surprised me. I never knew she could act that way. Anne Hathaway, gave another effective supporting performance. Her accent I found was very well done, if not a little too showy, but it was her acting was fit her situation better. Just like Gyllenhaal, she also gets overshadowed by Williams. This was definitely her best performance.The film is also a wonder to look at. The cinematography was simply beautiful. Ang Lee really knew how to direct to capture great scenery. The original music score I found to be very fitting to the tone, and I found it simple yet very effective.Overall, this is definitely one of the most effective, best-done films of the decade. i find it sort of sad that the Academy would actually give Crash the Best Picture win. I think that, knowing this film now, that has been their biggest mistake of the last 10 years, if not longer. Seeing as what the material is, some people will not want to see it, but there really is no harm to it, and I think this film shows a true love that two unexpected people had. A true beautiful film, a very sad ending, yet fitting ending. A true American Love Classic.",Null,13,14,20 July 2008
Ed Wood," Fantastic!
","Tim Burton films are always enjoyable, but the only one that I would call 'great' is his 2007 adaptation of Sweeney Todd. Now, I can add another one to that short list of great films.Ed Wood is fascinating from start to finish! The atmosphere of the period is takes place in is authentic. But the direction and screenplay really shine! The film is very much sort of a character-study. Johnny Depp is fantastic in here, and it's probably one of his best performances. Not knowing much about Wood, the film sparked an immediate interest. Not just in him, but in the sheer ambition and love for film- making that one can have, even him. The film portrays him with an immediate optimism that really gives the film a wonder, a sense of happiness. That really stood out to me among the rest of his films. I have no clue whether the era Wood was like this, but the films succeeds in that department. In fact, it succeeds in almost everything.By the film's end, I was fascinated and was left in awe over this person and this era, regardless of it's actual reality. That to me, makes a great film. It also makes me wonder whether I should see Wood's films, since the only time I did was when I watched a couple of scenes from 'Plan 9' in a Halloween party and remember the guests saying something like 'this is the worst film ever and we love it'.",Null,0,0,23 November 2011
Orphan," A clever, twisted, campy and fun Horror film!
","Orphan could have played it one of two ways. Either a subtle, psychological suspense thriller or a campy, funny and very entertaining horror-revenge film. While it has elements of both, it mostly chooses the latter, and for that I am glad. While I do like some slow, creepy films, I always feel that when it comes to horror plots like these, we need to have fun. The screenplay does have it's amount of clich√©s, but it plays them out in such enjoyable and devilish ways that I did not mind. The film does have it's touching moments, and when it does, it is very effective, mostly because of Vera Farmiga. She gives a great performance here, adding a lot of heart and depth into this film, and adding a tone of seriousness. Isabelle Fuhrman is also very impressive, and her performance is wickedly enjoyable. Both of these actresses deserve some award buzz at least. Peter Sarsgaard is good, but his character really annoyed me to no end. I went off the rails when he did not believe Kate, but of course, it was all done for the purpose of the story. The film contains some decent amount of humor, which I loved. Some genuinely funny scenes in this film. The director Jaume Collet-Serra really knew how to play with this film, and how to give audiences what they wanted. The twist was WICKED! Of course, I knew it beforehand, since this twist is bound to be let out, but very clever twist. Orphan is a very entertaining, very fun thriller/horror that is more action and less suspense.",Null,3,6,3 November 2009
Home Alone," Pretty great
","This is a pretty great film. I think that its a Holiday classic.Joe Pesci is hilarious in the film, and macualay Culkin brings a real sensibility to the role. He should have done more films after this, too bad. There are a lot of great scenes in this, and very funny too. The 'Keep the change you dirty animal' line is a classic. I remember watching this years ago and was one of my favorite childhood films.Ultimately, everyone should see this film. Its really entertaining and very funny. You really cant do much better than this! Please, give it a go and just be prepared because you will be laughing VERY hard without being able to stop.",Null,1,2,22 April 2011
Spotlight," Riveting, taut, and incredibly well written and acted.
","Pretty much everything I expected it to be. Taut, riveting, very refined in its writing and filmmaking. The film chooses not tell its story in an overly dramatic, broad, sentimental way and it works wonders. It's also able to develop its ensemble cast of characters without having to dive deeply into their lives to force more sentimentality, which I think is always a strength with a film like this. Like many others have said, there isn't one performance that screams 'award winning!', but it's a great ensemble cast. I had heard some complaints about Ruffalo acting with a capital A like he did in The Normal Heart, but thankfully he was fantastic and very much in line with the rest of the film. It's very much a journalism film, it's clinical without being overly so, which I do think will be a reason the Academy goes for it. Best Picture winner though? Hard to say. It may certainly be a consensus choice, but I do feel like it's a film that doesn't garner such a rabid, intense passion. It's a great film, but one that will stand to be very memorable in the eyes of most? I don't really think so, certainly not like Birdman. Still, it's a fine, fine film no doubt.",Null,1,4,29 November 2015
Insomnia," Good enough?
","Insomnia is definitely overshadowed by all of Nolan's recent outings since Batman Begins (as well as the far superior Memento). It has a great atmosphere, and technically it is great, but the screenplay lacks and feels incredibly contrived at times, as well as having some pretty cringe-worthy dialogue at times. Still, despite that, it mostly succeeds and is pretty entertaining, even if it really does seem incredibly forgettable. I have no curious wonders or question why it's not more popular, but as it is, I recommend it. I wouldn't even know if it's Nolan worst film, since I'm not a huge fan of him. But for fans, seek it out.",Null,1,3,26 October 2014
500 Days of Summer," A unique and experimental film. One of the year's finest!
","500 Days of Summer experiments with the pain and the happiness that romances bring. It deals with the expectations of a hard-in-love young man, and how his whole reasoning behind his feelings is about to be tested with who he believes is his soul-mate. Her name is Summer, and she is beautiful, charming, and honest. She does not believe in finding love for the first time, and does not see love in the point of view Toms sees it in. That is why when both Tom and Summer start being closer with each other, Tom is confused about what kind of relationship they are in. It turns out, Summer leads him down a path that will inevitably make him learn about how real life works. He believed that Summer was his one true love, and is even abstruck when it turns out Summer is the one that found someone she can call her 'soul-mate'. This reinforces his ideas that love is unexpected, and like the final scene says, there are just 'coincidences' that lead to it. The film is directed by first-time film director Mark Webb, and he did a fantastic job. Thanks to the great screenplay, music, and editing he creates a sort of fairy-tale tone to it, but as the film goes along, we realize that that is not the case. There are many inventive scenes in the film, most notably a dance and music sequence, and a split-screen scene where Tom's expectations are met with the reality of the scene, and they are quite simply brilliant. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Tom, and Zooey Deschanel really nails her character. Deschanel embraces all of the reasons why Tom falls in love with her, making the audience as awestruck by her as he is. Overall, this is quite simply the opposite of most romantic comedies these days, and for that I am very pleased. The film deserves high praise and honors!",Null,1,2,29 November 2009
Juno," A touching and heartwarming comedy with fantastic writing and performances!
","I admit it, I used to be one of those Juno haters back in 2007 and 2008 when Juno was getting so much praise and awards. It certainly was a good film, but I always thought that it was so overrated. Watching it for the second time now, I can see that is is a really great film. Diablo Cody gets a lot of hate from some people, and while I was used to be one of those, I have to say this- Diablo Cody really knows how to write dialogue. Seeing Juno again, her dialogue reminded me of great dialogue from films like Pulp Fiction. Yes, it is very different, but just as catchy. The dialogue is full of quirks here and there, memorable lines, and while I do see why many people say it is 'too much, I love the film for that now. The character of Juno, while being all of this, is a greatly developed character, played brilliantly by Ellen Page. She is perfect for a role like this, and she was worthy of that Oscar nomination. But the whole cast brings Cody's screenplay to make a film that is truly great. Michael Cera, Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, Jason Bateman, and especially Jennifer Ganrer (who in a truly amazing scene between her and Juno's belly, she proves how great of an actress she is, and how subtle she can be) are all amazing and fun to watch. The music of this film is brilliant as well. So I am now a big fan of Juno, and I now think it gets way too much hate. One of the best comedies of this decade!",Null,2,6,23 September 2009
L.A. Confidential," Well acted
","L.A. Confidential is that sort of crime/corruption film that I've grown accustomed to, and the one I tend to like enough but not quite love as so many other people do. Still, it's pretty good, and it delivers enough thrills and turns to entertain for its entire running time. It's pulpy and campy in its own sort of way, but never so much that it doesn't take itself seriously. It's sort of fun knowing that both Pierce and Crowe were unknown at this time. The latter is just so perfect in his 'sensitive bad boy' portrayal, and so gosh darn dreamy (yes, I'm guilty). Overall, this isn't anything too deep, but it gets the job done, and I still wish it had beaten Titanic.",Null,0,1,13 June 2014
Don Jon," Pretty good
","I have to start off by saying that I'm not a Gordon-Levitt fan at all. He was decent in 500 Days of Summer, but in everything else I've seen him in since then I've just been so bored and unmoved by him. With that out of he way... this is easily his best performance, from what I've seen. He nails the accent, the character completely, shedding any previous notion I had that he didn't have much range. He's just fantastic in this, and I wish he was in more talks for an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is also really great, hilarious. Johansson I've also had problems with in the past, although with her it's more mixed. Here, she's fantastic, probably the best acting I've seen her do (and yes, I've seen Lost in Translation... I will never get the love for her and the film). I give props to Levitt for coming up with a pretty bold subject to base his film across, and although it gets formulaic in terms of narrative and structure, it still works very well.",Null,0,0,18 December 2013
Deadpool 2," Very pleasantly surprised
","I was actually very pleasantly surprised by this. I thought the original Deadpool, while amusing at times, was also super forced. It seemed to think that because it was R-rated and had gore and 'bad words' it was something completely unique, but it still followed all of the conventions of the genre. While it wasn't a bad film, it wasn't one I liked very much because it was just so annoying. To my complete surprise, I found the sequel so much better. Although the first act was a little rough, it finds its groove in a way the original didn't- it actually has a strong main storyline, strong antagonist, and it actually does break away from the conventions of the genre in a way the first didn't. Not to mention I also found it a lot funnier (the 'landing' of the new superheroes Deadpool recruits was an amazingly done scene). It's not perfect, but this is the super entertaining, funny and outrageous film the first wanted to be but wasn't.",Null,2,6,28 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," Undeserving of the hate
","'Great' as in very entertaining, fun, but flawed definitely. I only saw this back when it came out, but now I see that Raimi certainly tried to do a lot more with this film. Part of its flaws comes from the way it all comes together, maybe in part due to it feeling way too rushed. Also, some of the dialogue is pretty bad. But overall, it definitely doesn't deserve all of hate it got when it came out, like at all. Yes, it's more messy, but damn it tries so many things that one can't blame it too much. Not to mention, there are a lot of great individual moments that are probably some of the best in the trilogy. It's incredibly funny as well, and Raimi infuses it with even more camp than before. Maguire and Franco are easily weaker here than in the first two though, and maybe it's because of the more dramatic material but they drag down some of the scenes. Dunst, on the other hand, stands out more than before. Here, because she also has more to work with, she manages to be the MVP of the cast, and it's not until this film that one can truly see how much she was needed in this franchise. Overall, a very good film, if not a great but flawed one/",Null,1,1,23 March 2012
Thor: Ragnarok," A lot of fun!
","I really had no high expectations for this. I had never seen the first two Thor films and, according to the general consensus, I had not actually missed much. What was great about this is that I absolutely did not have to watch the first two films to get where the characters were at. It almost seemed like the filmmaker wants to erase what had been in the past and start from scratch, and luckily they did a mighty fine job of it. This is funny and wickedly entertaining, and most importantly, Thor is a great character to watch. Chris Hemsworth infuses him with so much natural charisma that the entire thing works. He has always seemed like he would make a great character, and here he finally becomes one.",Null,0,9,11 November 2017
Match Point," The work of a genius!
","Woody Allen is a true genius for creating a film this brave. It is a revelation, a film that becomes more unpredictable than you bare to think as it goes along. I certainly did not know how it would end, and I certainly did not think it's genre would change like it did. Never have I seen a film that does that. Woody Allen's screenplay was rich and filled with great dialogue and fascinating characters. Jonathan Rhys Meyers really great, and I do not want to say anything more than I have to, but his character really is something unique. Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance, and she proves she is the best actress out there under 30. I am waiting for her to finally get an Oscar nomination (she deserved one for this). Matthew Goode is becoming an actor I notice more and more. In Watchmen he was great, and in this he plays a completely different characters, he is very smooth and subtle. On a side note, Brian Cox seems to be the actor that is the most low-key, appearing in many films I have seen (but he is always playing a very small role). The film never has a very serious tone, and even when it's subject matter turns dark it stays with the same sort of subtle and light tone, which makes it even more intriguing. The only other film I have seem from Woody Allen was Vicky Cristina Barcelona, so it's second half surprised me. The themes Allen present are insightful, and he has created a true work of genius, which deserved the Oscar for Original Screenplay over Crash.",Null,1,2,30 January 2010
Midnight in Paris," Very charming
","The only Allen films I have seen are actually only from this decade... crazy I know. But I'm a fan of him. Midnight in Paris is a very charming film. Sure, it's a little obvious at times, and its message is as well. But it's sort of a 'fairy tale' in a way. The cast is all superb, although Owen Wilson hits the wrong notes at times, and maybe a better actor would have made the performance more special. Rachel McAdams is freakin hot in here! She's never looked better, and I find it refreshing just how easily she can make a character either likable or unlikable in different films. She slips into that mode so easily. Her character is, again, a bit too obvious and not incredibly written, but she is great. Marion Cotillard is yet again in another supporting role, and she shines. I am still waiting for the day that she gets another Oscar.Overall, I liked it enough, a very good film although it's never as intriguing as it could have been, or as his other films I have seen, Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (and while the former was a better film all around, the reason the latter is ahead of this one is only because of Cruz in her Oscar-winning performance)",Null,0,2,1 December 2011
Youth," Elegant, although again perhaps a bit detached
","The only other film I've seen from the director is The Great Beauty, and while I thought that was a very handsome, very visually striking film, it did nothing for me in terms of getting me emotionally invested in any way to the story. This film did, to an extent. It had me invested a bit, but then it would lose me, only to get me invested again and so on. I think as a meditation on life it works better in a way than The Great Beauty did. The performances here are nice and nuanced, with Michael Caine giving some great work late in his career. It's a refreshing film to see, simply because it is felt more than it's about anything happening with the plot. I do recommend it, although I do have reservations with it.",Null,2,6,25 October 2015
Zodiac," An instant Crime classic
","Zodiac is a departure from many other crime/mystery films. This film does not include the usual heavy violence or rampage killings. In that way, I think it is a better film.This film relies heavily on one character, Robert Graysmith, and his obsession in finding the true Zodiac killer. Jake Gylenhaal plays him brilliantly. The whole cast is perfect. Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. are also the other two characters who you truly identify with. I was surprised, I was expecting this film to be more like Se7en or something, which relied on a lot of twists and heavy crimes. What I found was it was a very realistic portrayal on what goes on in police work as to find actual killers. I was more invested with the characters and the great writing of the screenplay, than of how the crimes were completed. David Fincher also proves he is a director capable of anything. In Se7evn, he is able to manage the cold and suspenseful atmosphere of the story. In his recent film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, he was able to capture such a magical and touching life of a certain man. Here, he balances in the middle.This is a must-see film. I found it is one of the best of 2007. I am sure, just like Se7en, it will become a crime classic, but for different reasons.",Null,0,0,31 December 2008
Milk," One of the greatest biographical films ever made
","Great story, very engaging. It is lead by fantastic performances and amazing writing and direction.Sean Penn gives one of the best male performances of the decade for sure. He captures so realistically what many other actors in the past have done with real life people. He captures all of Harvey Milk's mannerisms and emotion so well. He will certainly get an Oscar nomination, possibly even a win. Now, to the strong supporting performances. Many of the attention has been given to Brolin and Franco, but I thought that Diego Luna gave a very disturbing and real portrayal as Milk's lover, Jack at one point in his life. Yes, it was hard to watch, but I feel that Luna really stood-out, and it is a shame that people have not really recognized him as well. James Franco also gave a very strong performance, as did Emile Hirsch. But, here is a surprise, I did not think Josh Brolin was anything special. He has been the supporting actor who has been getting most Oscar attention, and most nominations and even awards. He was good, no doubt, but he lacked a lot in scenes I thought. I was expecting him to do more, and I am sorry, but I do not think he deserves an Oscar nomination, let alone some awards he has taken home(they should all go to Ledger for his amazing performance as The Joker). But it is not a big deal, like I said, he was good, but just not nearly as good as he is being praised. The screenplay is fabulous. It slides, and it does not linger, and never plays out very easily. The direction is superb, as is the rest of the film.Here is one amazing film, by any means. It grabs you, whether you like biographical films or not. It is a film, and all of the characters you deeply connect with. Certainly one of the year's best films.",Null,8,14,14 December 2008
The Prestige," The Ultimate Trick!
","I had seen this film when it first came out and remembered liking it very much. Now, years later I decided to give it a rewatch, I can definitely say this- what an amazing film. The screenplay is strong, very mysterious and always keeps the audience second-guessing everything. The film is like a never ending maze. It has so many twists and turns, so many layers to it. Christopher Nolan really is a genius. I have considered his finest works Memento and The Dark Knight, but I can say this holds up to those films pretty much in every way. His direction is masterful and elegant. The performances are great, and the tragic rivalry between Angier and Borden and it's outcomes certainly are a great character study for each men. For me, I started with my own view of each character, and thought Angier was in the right from the start. However, as the film goes along, the film itself forces you to change sides and change your whole perspective on the characters. I thought this was really amazing and rarely does a film make you do that. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are very good, especially the former. Having seen her here and in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, she seems to be a great actress, and in each film she has outshined the still-talented Johansson. Having seen The Illusionist, I can say this is on a whole other level. The Illusionist was good, but entirely different besides the magician perspective. The Prestige is a perfect example of why we see films. We want to be entertained, we want to be mesmerized, and we want to be tricked and enchanted by the whole world a film brings you into. The Prestige is the ultimate trick!",Null,2,3,15 January 2010
Cloverfield," The most intense Monster film I have ever seen!
","I just saw Cloverfield, and I will start off by saying that it is the most intense thrill ride you will ever have. It is not just a thrill ride, the screenplay is well written. The screenplay allows the film to work, but of course, the real beauty is the amazing direction and camera work. Yes, the shaky camera has been used before, but never this intense, and never in this way. The film begins with certain people filming, and then a guy filming in his best friend's going-away party. Of course, the camera work at the party is also amazing and well done. It allows us to reflect on the characters, characters that we will have to follow through this hard day. The main deal is that Rob, who is the one going away, had a relationship with his friend Beth, and in the middle of the party, the lights in Manhattan and New York City go out. Well, basically a huge creature is in the city, and is causing destruction. The shaky camera allows us to experience everything as crazy and chaotic as the characters themselves. The camera makes us feel just as nervous, and that is why this film works so well.The acting in this movie, is actually, very good and realistic. Every single actor you would totally concentrate on. I thoughts that Michael Stahl-David as Rob was great. Lizzy Caplan(who i love from mean Girls) also did a nice job. The sound effects, and the film editing, when there is some, based on the camera work is freaking amazing. I actually think that The Academy should try to recognize and honor this film's achievements. I mean, it is about time these kind of films are honored, for its effects in whole. The special effects are fantastic and flawless. The film was under a budget of $30 million, and even like that, it had as great visual effects as Iron Man. I think the Academy SHOULD honor this.Overall, this, for what it is, is a pure golden action film. yes, some people will hate the shaky camera, but it is just amazing. Some people will also hate the ending, but dang, I was glad it did not follow other types of action films(where the man characters ALWAYS survive, or that the evil is ALWAYS killed). This is a science-fiction film, about the unknown, and I think films like this tell us what other things could be out there, and when we can be attacked... This is the best film of 2008, it beats Iron Man, and it is probably the best Monster film of the decade, or even in history...",Null,1,2,8 June 2008
Once," Never have I felt such emotion with any other film

The chemistry between Guy and Girl is amazing, heartfelt. Everything about this film feels real, the music is touching and sad. Words cannot describe how Once makes me feel, with it's music and characters. It is ultimately a film about two people who meet each other, fall into a different kind of love, and then are forced to leave each other, even though the impacts they had on each other will never leave them. The ending is also absolutely heartwrenching, because I felt sadness and hopefulness for the love two people can bring each other. Everyone needs to see Once",Null,3,5,8 December 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Interesting and atmospheric
","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is one of the most cautiously filmed films of 2011. It is tightly woven together, with some incredible editing, cinematography, and set design. It plunges you into the atmosphere of the Cold War days, and has a screenplay worth discussing and really digging into. It's also one of the most interesting films of the year, if only because it has such a carefully-plotted story that requires multiple viewings. I was never once bored by the film, but I didn't really get lost into everything that was happening. I was sort of watching it from a distance, and feel that a rewatch is in order, for very soon as well. But this also makes it stand apart from many other films I have seen this year. The entire cast is great, and Oldman is a strong lead with his carefully-moving eyes and meaningful face expressions. I honestly don't feel as if I can say any more. This is definitely worth watching, but for those wanting to have an easy viewing for once will be disappointed. It's one of those films you respect more than you love, but I think there's plenty worth digging here.",Null,1,2,7 January 2012
The Hateful Eight," Brutal, disturbing, tackles the real issues about violence.
","I loved Inglorious Basterds, and while I liked Dgango, so much of it I found to be just really messy, overlong and overall it just hasn't fared so well with me over time. When I heard of The Hateful Eight's runtime, I was concerned. I was afraid that like Django, it would run for far too long. What's interesting about it is that unlike with most Tarantino films, it started off kind of unengaging. I spent the first hour really developing an investment in these characters, so it isn't until after its first hour that I was completely on board with it, and from then on it sailed pretty smoothly. I don't think its runtime is a problem at all because it takes a while for it to totally connect, but when it does it only gets more enthralling. It's an oddly paced film, even for Tarantino, but it all seems to work. It's as if he wanted a film that was basically the extended version of the tavern scene from Inglorious Basterds. Moreso than with Django and similarly to Inglorious Basterds, I feel like there's a lot of thoughtful weight to the dialogue and what it means for the overarching thematic issues that Tarantino has been interested in exploring recently. I think Django, while kind of fun, is sort of meaningless. Here, I think he tackles the real issues of what violence is and what it can do. It's not a pretty film, and as a result the violence doesn't seem as cartoonish as the violence from Basterds or Django. It really, really hits here, so I'm not entirely surprised it isn't as well-reviewed as those two. It doesn't feel big or long just for the sake of it, there's a density here that will need to be further explored. It's a hard film to like. if seen on the surface I think many may have problems with all the violence, in particular towards Jennifer Jason Leigh.But that character didn't have to be female. It really didn't, and in the usual films of this type, it's usually a male. The fact that it is a female gives the proceedings so much more relevance and, as someone who was fearing having to witness that considering I'm always very critical of violence towards women and how it is portrayed, I was surprised at the levels the film was working at. In particular the final scene with Jennifer Jason Leigh is particularly brutal and disturbing, but it cemented the kind of issues I was sure Tarantino is wanting to hit at. Jennifer Jason Leigh strangled and choking to death as two men are hysterically laughing? On a visceral level, it's powerful, but kind of encompasses everything the film is trying to do and say about violence against certain groups. In terms of its ensemble, really fantastic and one of the best casts he's ever assembled. The standout is definitely Jennifer Jason Leigh (and whether she is supporting or leading is another question). Overall I think this joins Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds as one of Tarantino's best films, and I do wish it wasn't getting as much criticism but at the same time I get it. In that respect, it's a little like The Wolf of Wall Street and (considering that I know it will get a lot of vitriol thrown towards it, I hope like Wolf it's a little re-evaluated with time.",Null,2,16,24 December 2015
"I, Tonya"," Fantastic acting
","I guess because I had no real expectations about this being great, I was actually surprised by how great it was. I admit the writing/directing stylistic choices become obnoxious at times, but they also work to make the film stand out from the usual biopic at other times. This is one of those biopics that has the quick, showy type of editing that award bodies go for so I fully expect the editing to get some notices, but it would definitely be deserved. The film moves like a machine while still keeping the character dynamics and development in tact. Overall, the biggest standout aspect of the film is its acting, and in that department it in no way disappoints. Allison Janney was the predicted frontrunner for Supporting Actress before Laurie Metcalf started beating her for Lady Bird. Since this film has come out all I have heard from those who have seen it is how this is not an Oscar-winning type performance, and I completely disagree. I am actually now surprised by how baity and typical the performance is, compared to previous winners. Now I'm back to predicting Janney to take home the big awards. She is definitely really great in the role, although I myself prefer Metcalf. But the biggest stars of the film are Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan. The former has deservingly been in the conversation for awards, and I would say she is in the same level that McDormand, Ronan, and Hawkins (the other three frontrunners) are. She would make a fine winner. Sebastian Stan is almost equally as great, and it's a real shame he's not getting much notices at all. It's a fantastic performance through and through.",Null,3,8,27 December 2017
Molly's Game," Entertaining
","I would say that this is definitely an entertaining film. It's a bit too fast-paced in its storytelling and editing, but it is Aaron Sorkin so that's to be expected. What keeps it strong throughout are the strong performances, particularly Jessica Chastain in the title character. Chastain is a great talent, and she makes this character work in such thrilling ways. I'm not sure if I personally think she gave one of the five best leading actress performances of the year, but that kind of attention is not unwarranted. Overall, this film is recommended, although it's not a masterpiece by any means.",Null,0,2,20 January 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Outstanding action
","I saw Tintin with no expectations, having never read a single one of the comics. Suffice to say I had a pretty good time with it.The plot itself is the usual formula for a film like this. While the opening credits were brilliant, I was losing more and more interest with it in it's first act. The reason is because the characters are never developed enough for us to care greatly. I was interested in the least, but I wasn't incredibly intrigued by them. The way the plot was unfolding was becoming way too dull, but then the film did a 180. When? When the action started of course.I don't mean to sound like action was what I come to expect to any film like this, but it greatly improved this film. It's one of the most action-packed films of the year, moreso than I would have thought. There are a countless number of outstanding action sequences, and I mean outstanding! The sweeping cinematography during these action pieces, along with the roaring and impressive sound effects and the perfectly balanced score really bring magic to it in ways you wouldn't expect. Like I said, there are a lot of fantastic action scenes here, not just a few. I really liked this film, but it's only because of what I mentioned. As a whole, the storyline is pretty thin, and the dialogue often dull, if at times funny. This needed a stronger management of the plot and more fully-developed characters. Still, it's hard to really look a the negative side here. Since the film rarely slows down, it's always moving, always very entertaining and always roaring with energy. Did I mention the incredible action sequences? Oh, and forget Uggie from The Artist! Snowy is all around perfect and the best dog of 2011!",Null,1,3,21 February 2012
Moana," Charming and delightful
","There are various things I could say about this film that make it sound like I didn't like it. For example, I could say that it's very formulaic in its narrative and character arcs. The themes are also very derivative of themes that other films have also examined. Nothing about the film is entirely surprising. However, it says something about the quality of the execution that despite how predictable it is, it's still able to work wonders. The animation is dazzling and beautiful and the characters are really written with a lot of care. Although the story itself is very derivative, having these types of characters (of Polynesian roots) in the forefront is definitely something original and I do hope that Disney, even when creating films that hit the same beats and follow the same formula, can still create characters that are different in that way.",Null,6,22,26 November 2016
Crash," A powerful look into the world of racism
","I saw Crash around two years ago, and I liked it, but never got the hype. I rewatched it, and got this film into a deeper level. It is a film that manipulates the audience with music and over-dramatic scenes, but isn't that the way this world is? I have dealt with a lot of issues regarding racism, since I do live in Los Angeles. The mixture of all these different races does cause tension, and the way the film portrayed it was incredibly realistic. At first glance, it really seems like a melodramatic, overblown film, but it was ultimately very powerful, especially in particular scenes. The film does have flaws, but it also makes a lot of points about race stereotypes and it has some very complicated and flawed characters. The cast is great, although there are a few weak spots. The standouts had to be Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton. The two had the best scenes in the film, and both acted in such passion and force, I can see why Dillon was nominated for the Oscar, but why wasn't Newton? Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Terrence Howard, and Ryan Phillippe were all great, but Sandra Bullock also impressed me a lot. Her bad reputation is not deserved. Yes, she does pick a lot of bad roles, but when given the right material, she can really shine. Here, she proves she can really act (also notably, she is being considered a frontrunner for the 2010 Oscar for Leading Actress against Meryl Streep). If Bullock picked more challenging roles like this, she would have a better reputation. Overall, Crash does have flaws, but it also has some incredibly powerful scenes that make it memorable, and a film that has a lot of ambition. While I do think Brokeback Mountain should have won that Oscar for Best Picture, Crash's bad reputation is really not deserved to the extent that it is.",Null,1,5,3 February 2010

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Does pretty much everything right
","I'm not a big fan of Marvel films. I've liked a few of them, and none of them have been outright terrible, but they're mostly just average and nothing to write home about. I think Spiderman: Homecoming feels so fresh because it isn't concerned with the usual 'save the world' plot that many of these films are. It's incredibly grounded and what it has going for it is a lot of relatable, actually funny humor centered around Peter Parker's life as a teenager. More than anything that is what the film gets right: the tone of high school. The action sequences in this are well done but none of them bog down the film's true heart. This is pretty much everything the film needed to be.",Null,0,2,15 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Pretty ambitious, entertaining, and weirdly comical...
","Dr. Strangelove is definitely an 'oddball' film. When looking at the plot, it all seems pretty simple, but once it is over it can be digested more thoughtfully. That is not to say that it wasn't entertaining, because it certainly was. In fact, it stands out from the other Kubrick films because I find that one can easily come in at anytime and start watching it and still be amused, even if they don't understand everything that is happening. The screenplay is fantastic, and the ensemble cast as well. There is some brilliant dialogue in here as well.Overall, very satisfied with this film and it only strengthens Kubrick's filmography.",Null,1,4,25 May 2011
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A fantastic conclusion
","Yes, in many ways this wouldn't be the end (although from a chronological order, it is). It's a fantastic conclusion to the franchise, probably equal to Empire Strikes Back, if not better. I enjoyed the heightened sense of comedy as well as a more of a fee for adventure, something that was sort of lacking in the second. We learn a lot of new secrets, one of them in involving Leia. For the most part, it's done well. It's kind of shocking to see just how negatively this and the second in the series were received when they came out, and how much their reputations have improved. Overall, I wouldn't say this is anything amazing, but certainly recommended.",Null,0,0,7 July 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," A Brutal, Realistic, and Beautiful Masterpiece.
","When i saw this film i was blown away. There are no words to describe it. The Visuals are AMAZING. they take you to another world. The Writing is very realistic and tells something about a child: they DO know the cruel of this world. This film has some very realistic moments of violence and gore(not childish gore like in horror films). It is just pure imagination. This continues to be my favorite film, just because it really WAS the only film that blew me away. Exhilarating. PLEASE DO NOT SHOW IT TO CHILDREN This is not Narnia, it shows the brutal and cruel parts of life, and they are very disturbing indeed. That is exactly what it needs to be though.",Null,2,5,12 October 2007
Final Destination 2," Pretty much equal to the first...
","This sequel to the mega-hit Final Destination isn't much worse (or better) than the original, but trust me, that is a rare thing to find in any sequel to any popular horror film and it's a great thing here. The atmosphere isn't the same for one, since this film doesn't have the same 'night' scenes that the first has, but it works well in contrast. I love how everything tied up together, and Ali Larter has definitely been changed by what she experienced in the first. I am gla dthat the same people aren't having premonitions over and over again as it adds up to the weirdness of it. Some of the deaths here are really shocking and tense, although the ending isn't as climactic as one hopes, although that final scene shows just where the franchise will go. All in all, I hope this trend continues.",Null,0,0,11 August 2011
Knocked Up," An instant classic!
","Knocked Up won me over by it's sheer brilliance. The screenplay is really funny. The dialogue is hilarious, and the characters believable and three-dimensional. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are fantastic. They play their characters with comedic timing, and with flawed, but ultimately likable tone. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are also brilliant, their characters you totally invest with and play a real-life issue in their marriage. The rest of the cast, from Jonah Hill to Jason Segal to the rest, are also brilliant and hilarious. It has crude humor, and the film really made me laugh out loud to plain smile at it's brilliance. Ultimately, what I think grabbed me more was it's heart. This is not one of those R-rated comedies where it is just about the humor. You care for these characters and their problems, and you relate to them. It also provoked some discussion about both unwanted pregnancy and marriage status. I think that is the reason why this might just be my favorite comedy of the last ten years. It is perfect film-making, and Judd Apatow's finest film of course. An instant comedy classic for sure",Null,0,1,9 July 2009
Begin Again," Pretty solid
","This is a pretty solid film all around. The performances are solid, the music is solid, the writing is solid. But none of its aspects are truly outstanding though, and when compared to the beautifully moving Once, it pales in comparison. Once was just more heartfelt, more realistic, and the music is in a league of its own. Still, it's not right to just compare it to Once, even if it is similar in superficial ways. This one blends in more elements into the story, including their personal problems and it also ventures into more mainstream-levels. I wouldn't say that this is a must-see by ay means, but it gets the job done. Recommended.",Null,0,3,30 August 2014

Even if the film turns out to suck (which I really doubt) it would still have been worth it to watch the original Alien.What can I say? Fantastic. The music, the slow-paced nature of the first half, together with increasing tension as the film goes along is incredible. Once stuff hits the fan, it never lets you go. The film is also quite scary, an it made me jump various times. Why? It knows how to build tension incredibly, and the final 20 minutes are truly perfection. Both the sound and visual effects work to make the film a very effective experience, as does the wonderful cinematography. Bring on the Aliens, bitch!",Null,6,9,19 March 2012
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," An excellent Masterpiece by the genius Tim Burton
","Sweeney Todd is perhaps the best musical in the last 20 years. The direction of the film by Tim Burton is perfect. Burton commands the screen with every aspect possible, with beautiful music and excellent production designs. Johnny Depp gives his best performance to date in my opinion. He excels at showing true anger and lust for revenge perfectly, with only showing few expressions. But I think the most memorable performance is given by the lovely and talented Helena Bonham Carter. She is not a very trained singer, but I thought the way she commands her voice, even though it is not great, her emotions and feelings come through very obviously. Her tones of expressions, her comedic timing, her dark presence, I thought she gives one very amazing performance, one that was greatly ignored at the time of the film's release date. It gets better with each viewing. Alan Rickman does a great job as always, but the more professional singers, who play Johanna and Anthony, are the weakest in the film, but that is not saying much.Overall, a truly great film. It is filled with amazing designs, great music, perfect acting, and shocking plots and twists. This is a film that has to be seen. Tim Burton's best film in my opinion. A true masterclass",Null,2,3,21 December 2008
Horrible Bosses," Extremely funny and well-made
","So I finally saw Horrible Bosses... and it was a DELIGHT. As expected, the cast was extremely funny. This is definitely an ensemble film. All three of the bosses were hilarious, and the trio reminded me of the guys from The Hangover (although this is a better film than that). I wouldn't say the film took its crime aspect in a dark way. That is not a criticisms because it didn't have to. Many parts the film were shocking in its turn of events and for that I am grateful. My one complaint would have to be the final 'climax' for Spacey's last scene. It felt the film geered away for a while there. However, it still remains a very good film that I thought was extremely entertaining and very funny.",Null,1,3,10 October 2011
Black Mass," Depp is fantastic
","This is such a weird case. I don't really think the film does anything wrong per se. In fact, I guess I kind of enjoyed it. I just have no real opinion towards it one way or another. I do think Johnny Depp is really fantastic though. The trailers for this film made it seem a lot different than it was, and I remember thinking Depp looked to be trying too hard there. He was mighty impressive, totally inhabiting that character and proving that yes, he still has it and he needs to stop making bad films. The film around him, even if with an impressive cast, was just sort of there. I'm not huge on the gangster flick but most at least make me feel something. At the end of the day, this film will only be memorable in my eyes for Depp. But it wasn't bad.",Null,0,2,3 October 2015
The Town," Tense and Brilliant!
","After Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck comes again with another film, and with only two films under his belt, he proves he has great talent behind (and in front) of the camera.I have never really had respect for Affleck as an actor, but I realize that the reason is probably because of the films he comes out in, not because of his actual acting ability. I knew he made a very good film in 2007, but here he made a great one. He is able to direct this story magnificently well, and also direct himself and the entire ensemble cast, which is full of great performances, most notably Renner and Affleck himself. The film has great writing, directing, acting, and is very tense and entertaining, and also has characters you are able to invest in. It reminds me of 2006's The Departed.Overall, this was a great film, and I do not really have any criticisms. I am very much looking forward to more of Affleck's directorial works, and The Town is as of now one of the best films of the year.",Null,0,1,14 December 2010
Closer," Intriguing
","Closer is a mostly intriguing film, although really unpredictable. I didn't know what to expect of the film, and now that it has ended, I do't really know what it was made for, in terms of themes. I however do know that it was a very good film. It is never dull, and while the script and direction are flawed, there is still some really great dialogue in bits and pieces in this film. This is an actors' film, and in that department it does not disappoint. All four are incredible, and all have distinctive personality traits. However, the best scenes lie with both Clive Owen and Natalie Portman in their first meeting, and in the infamous strip club scene. Portman is actually the one who one is still not really sure of what type of person she is. She is uncompromising and very effective. Overall, really good film with some great scenes mixed in between, but it is also not as emotionally-challenging as it maybe wished it was.",Null,1,2,15 March 2011
Suicide Squad," Definitely better than reviews suggest
","I never saw Man of Steel, but I thought B v S was honestly enjoyable enough to be decent, even if it was messy. However, I really liked Suicide Squad. I thought the main villain/antagonist was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if it was the writing or the actress (both honestly) but she was beyond cheesy and lame. I also liked The Joker as a character, but Leto was just trying too hard. I didn't particularly like his portrayal. I also think the squad members were humanized way too much, but overall I found it to be super enjoyable, not nearly as exploitative, and also a lot less try-hard than expected (and less try-hard than Deadpool, which I don't really like). There were moments when it was a bit disjointed, but most characters worked, some great character moments, the balance in comedy/drama worked well, some very good acting (Mostly Margot Robbie and Viola Davis), and it definitely felt more relaxed and fun than B v S. More than anything, I think it worked so well because it never lost sight of its characters, even amidst all of the action. I think that's why it worked despite the awful main antagonist, because it was so deeply rooted in its characters and they were never ignored. It was just so much fun, mostly coherent, and well-paced.",Null,1,3,7 August 2016
Taxi Driver," Scorese and De Niro at the top of their game
","I am a big fan of Scorsese (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Shutter Island, The Departed) and De Niro (Godfather Part 2), but the brilliance of Taxi Driver still stunned me. I have seen two of the finest male performances given by De Niro in both the Godfather Part II and in Raging Bull, yet somehow he turned in his finest in this film. His portrayal and character are completely fascinating from start to finish. He creates a character that somehow transcends out of the screen and glues the audience into believing, sympathizing, and experiencing with his character. The same can be said for Scorsese. Up until this point I always had Raging Bull as his finest, but something about his work here is completely mesmerizing. Taxi Driver comes together as an incredible piece of filmmaking, with completely intriguing dialogue, and story-wise it is flawless (although technically wise I would say Scorsese was still getting the hang of it). BRAVO to Taxi Driver, and I cannot believe I waited this long to see it.",Null,3,4,20 February 2011
Shutter Island," A film which never allows you to wrap your mind around it....
","Martin Scorsese. What Can I say about him. He has created so many great films, including Raging Bull, and the recent The Departed. Here, he covers some new territory, and like I wanted, it is not a film to really wrap your minds around it. The film plays out in ways that are what you would expect from a regular thriller, yet at the same time, you cannot help but wonder what it will all come to be. What can be said is that the performances are outstanding. Leonardo Dicaprio gives another powerhouse of a performance, showing that when he is committed he gives it his all. With performances from The Departed, Revolutionary Road, and now Shutter Island, he has proved he is one of the best actors working today. Jackie Earle Haley is really great in a small scene he is in, and Michelle Williams really affecting in her role. The whole film cannot be described, but experienced. Throughout the film, I was thinking it has some obvious flaws, and that while I really liked it, I could not love it... and then we get to the twist.When the twist came, about who Teddy Daniels really was, I was overwhelmed by it. I thought the film should have been given a much better twist. While I can admit in the novel it must have felt shocking, while I watched this twist unfold I must say I was very unpleasantly surprised. Not because it was executed badly, since a lot of the film's earlier mysteries made sense now, but because these sort of twists have been done to death that I would think anyone would stay away from it. But then as the scene with Teddy and Dolores' past tragedy unfolded, I began to have a sense of excitement because, I thought, could it be that the film would do a backflip and this not be the twist at all? Could it be that the final twist would actually be that this given twist was simply not real, and that the island's conspiracy be true? While the scene when Teddy is confessing who he really is and that he had murdered his wife was happening, I was lost. I did not know if this was real or if the real twist would happen. I was really hoping another twist and the real ending happen, because this would be a very tired and overwhelming ending. Then, when the film switched to black, I was like WOW. No answers given. The film played with me, made me first angry, then secretly happy and hoping for the real thing, and then leaves me no answers and to finally guess whether the truth is that Shuuter Island is a conspiracy or if Teddy really is insane. I figured it out! It was all about the execution of it all, and looking back on it now, whichever was the real truth did not matter, because Scorsese had messed with my mind. By this time, I simply fell in love with the film, flaws and all. It did it for me, and looking back on the film, I can say that it may join the ranks of The Departed, and even films like Mulholland Dr. or other lynch films in the future, with rewatches. This is film-making at it's most brilliant, but do not be fooled. While watching the film, you may not think this at all. Trust me.",Null,2,9,20 February 2010
Capote," Really great
","I didn't expect much from this, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's easy to dismiss Hoffman's performance as a gimmick or simple mimicry, but the fact remains that he still acts underneath the vocal transformation. And, like always, he does a great job. Catherine Keener's nomination is a bit baffling though. Clifton Collin Jr. is the real supporting stand-out. He gives is an understated, expressive, and mesmerizing performance. The fact that he really got no real notices or traction is completely baffling to me. Overall, this is a very well-directed, carefully written biopic that really digs deep into a lot of questions of morality. Very much recommended.",Null,1,1,3 February 2013
Life of Pi," Marvelous
","Let's get this out of the way. I did not see this in 3-D, so I will not talk about how amazing the 3-D was. In that respect, perhaps I am able to judge the film in its own right. The story here isn't anything too different. We've had survival stories of this kind before. The film is also told as one man's recollection, and I always have a problem with this technique. It always sort of drags the film down, because instead of you being immersed in the actual story being told, films always do some back-and-forths with the story and the character recollecting the story. This film is no exception, and it kinda falls into that same trap of cheese and over-sentimentality at times. This isn't a subtle film in any way, and it's more obvious in the present scenes.Getting that out of the way, this is a truly beautiful film in every respect. The message is clear, but powerful, and on a visual level this is masterful. The cinematography isn't just brilliant because the visual imagery is brilliant (and many times that's all people think of cinematography as being) but because the sweeping scope of the photography and the many different shots create a fantastically vivid and dreamy world. Even in it's most languid scenes there's a technical mastery here not present in most films. The strongest section of the film is Pi at sea no doubt, and it's virtually perfect. However, the last 10 or 15 minutes once again cross the line where some of it just comes across corny. But I liked the purpose of where the film headed, and what the ending was for, I just wish Lee and the script hadn't hit it with so much on-the-point sentimentality.But overall, flaws and all, this is a truly fantastic film, and strongly recommended.",Null,6,11,30 November 2012
Lost in Translation," Atmospheric and very intimate
","I finally got a chance to see my first Sofia Coppola film, as well as the film that made Scarlett Johansson's career.The film has a real authenticity and atmosphere to it. It has an atmosphere and mood that is somber and very quiet and intimate. This is in part thanks to the great cinematography, which made incredible use of camera angles and lighting. It created an atmosphere and feeling that only those really capable to allowing to enter this mood would appreciate it the most. This isn't a plot-driven film, and this was what made it even more personal and unique. Bill Murray is fantastic, and perfectly portrays his character's loneliness and alienation from the rest of his world. I have never seen Johansson play this type of character but she does brilliantly, and definitely has the aura of sophistication that was needed. I wouldn't say that the storyline itself is anything original, but the way Coppola directed it and the execution of it all makes an already good film become great. This is definitely a film that is only to be seen without rush but instead let it ride you in it's incredibly satisfying mood and feeling.",Null,1,2,12 August 2011
Doctor Strange," Pretty average
","I think this film hugely benefits from being something at least a little different from most Marvel films. It's different in the focus that is on magic and sorcery and all of that. However, it's still quite familiar in its arc and predictable beats. The cast is fine, although nothing ever really great. Swinton manages to rise above her material, as predicted that she would. Rachel McAdams also adds a lot of heart to her character, who has a lot of screen time but who is really likable. The action sequences here are really impressive and they make a lot of the film worth it. As it is, it's not bad at all and it's enjoyable, just nothing too memorable.",Null,89,165,6 November 2016
Barry Lyndon," Only half so engaging
","A period/costume drama directed by Stanley Kubrick? Those were my initial thoughts. It certainly has some of Kubrick's touches of perfection, the nice, crisp cinematography and control of everything on screen. His style oozes through. I still don't think this is all that great or anything. The first half all works as set up, but it's just not as engaging as it should have been. The second half is definitely where I was constantly engaged, and so I definitely recommend this. It's basically a 'rise and fall' picture, although much less likely as one would have thought. The technical aspects of this are pretty amazing, but as it is, it stands in Kubrick's lower half of films.",Null,1,6,5 June 2014
Interstellar," Flawed, but magnificently ambitious and awe-inspiring
","I have a very weird relationship with Christopher Nolan's films. On first viewing, I've been in love with mostly all of them, in particular The Dark Knight and Inception. He's the only filmmaker that I can say whose films just suffer so much in retrospect, and so trying to gather up my thoughts on any future film of his would always be tricky. What I can say is that his films have always been visually superb. Wally Pfister's absence is sorely missed here. The visual effects may be amazing, but the film doesn't have the same fantastic camera-work his other films have.Nolan gets complaints about being 'emotionally cold'. I've never really seen him in that way, I just think that much of the fluidity in all of his films after Memento are really hectic. His films' editing and pacing are sometimes just way too rushed, going from scene to scene without really lingering on each individual scene's effects, and diminishing a lot of their power. In that way, they feel methodical, not exactly cold. But that systematic pacing is probably a big reason as to why it's harder to really gain more from his films on rewatches, certainly because they feel too jam-packed with action. What I can say about Interstellar is that the film certainly feels different in that respect. It may not be particularly slow-paced, but that hectic and kinetic style isn't present for most of the film, certainly not in the way that I've come to expect from him. I think it shows an improvement on his part, but I also think it stems from the film not feeling as technically-refined as his others, not feeling as mechanical and thus, individual scenes work in a way none of his other films have. The reason for this is that this is definitely his most emotional film ever. The scenes right after they escape Miller's planet, where 23 years have gone by and Cooper sees the videos from Affleck and Chastain... Boy, I was in the theater and I forced myself to not shed any tears because those few minutes are among the best Nolan has ever done. They felt earned, and totally satisfying. Of course, for scenes like this and the wormhole entrance, we have scenes like the cross cutting between the silly Matt Damon fight and the even more ridiculous Earth scenes, with Casey Affleck all of a sudden turning into this violent, crazed maniac unwilling to save his family. Okay, we get it, you were hurt by your dad... but the writing for him before this, for their whole family dynamic, doesn't shine through very realistically, not nearly well enough for this to not feel like anything other than forced conflict. Those several minutes are down there with some of the worst things Nolan has ever done. Those last 15 minutes are also super conflicting. I love the emotionality of it all, but I really don't understand too much of it. The real problem is the fact that, once again, some of the scenes on Earth come off incredibly cheesy. Chastain running around, throwing papers to the air out of happiness, kissing that-one-dude-from-That 70s Show? And that's basically how the whole film is structured. It feels more like a series of episodic events and scenes that sometimes work very well, sometimes not as well, sometimes not at all. I certainly never found Inception (a film I think is borderline mediocre now) to be very flawed on my first viewing, so what does that say about how this film will fare with me? Even worse? I'm actually optimistic, just because even on first viewing this seems like a different sort of film for Nolan. It's sort of messier, sort of problematic, but its themes and its ambitions are at a level I had never seen Nolan work in. It feels like it was done with more, pardon me, love. Like it was something Nolan had wanted to make for a while, something deeply personal to him, a piece of artistic vision that we should feel privileged to have been a part of. Before today, I always rolled my eyes at all of the comparisons to 2001: A Space Odyssey (my favorite film ever). But... now I get it. It has the same aura. At its best, it has the same majestic, magical feeling that 2001 had, the same feeling of awe. And while I certainly think it's very flawed, I do think Nolan was able to hit intellectual grasps I don't think he ever really aimed for before, certainly not in this way. For that, I'm actually surprised, and so while I can't predict my future overall feelings on the quality of the film (certainly not with how my opinions change with Nolan's films), I do think this film represents a turning point in his mainstream career as far as his ambitions go. I'll take it.And, contrary to what I expected, I didn't find the dialogue very distracting. I actually prefer the 'cornier', more sentimental dialogue here than just the empty corniness and exposition of many of his other films. And yeah, the sound mixing needed work. The score is played way too loud in some scenes at Earth. However, the score as it is, it absolutely phenomenal, Zimmer's best work with Nolan to this point. As for the acting, Hathaway has her off moments here and there, but is mostly effective. So is Chastain, who makes even more impact in her fewer scenes. However, the film absolutely belongs to Matthew McConaughey. If he hadn't just won the Oscar, maybe he'd be in the conversation for an Oscar nomination. He'd deserve it, carries the film tremendously and this is right up there with his True Detective/Dallas Buyers Club work. Incredibly effecting in his emotional scenes.",Null,1,2,12 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Great film...
","Full Metal Jacket is the 5th film from Kubrick that I have seen. It probably ranks in the middle. It is definitely a great film, never once boring, and each of it's halves contrast each other well. The first half is more comedic, but as it goes on it ends in a disturbing and shocking scene. The second half is more combat, but while it has a different tone it is to be noted how amazingly Kubrick is still able to give his trademark signature in different types of films. There is something hypnotizing about this film, just like every other Kubrick film. What I really love though is that this film sort of stands apart because as style goes it probably is more distinctive than 2001, The Shining, or even Clockwork Orange. Still, great film.",Null,0,2,4 June 2011
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Hilarious and affecting
","So I watched Three Billboards earlier today. I really may start buying this film's chances as a true contender for Best Picture after all. Considering the incredibly enthusiastic response it got from the audience, it could very well be a consensus pic. For some reason I assumed it would be a 'harder' film to love, but not at all. In terms of performances, these actors have really rarely been better. Frances McDormand could probably do this role in her sleep, but that's a testament to her abilities and less about it not being great work. Far from it. This role is a culmination of the many types of roles she's played in the past, and she of course delivers it perfectly. There is absolutely no other actress that I think would be able to give the work that she does. The same goes for Sam Rockwell. None of what he does here is too shocking or 'stand out' because, just like McDormand, he's an actor who has shown traits of this role in some of his works in the past. Again, this is not a criticism but simply proof of what an accomplished and capable actor he's proved himself to be in the past. If the Oscar should come down to him or Willem Dafoe, I think it absolutely should be Rockwell's. Woody Harrelson and Caleb Landry Jones also deliver some strong, affecting work in their roles.",Null,2,7,12 November 2017

That's basically it in a nutshell, and the actual story stands-out from all of these seemingly formulaic and predictable blockbusters. I was hesitant about Charlie Hunman (although I remember him from Undeclared, much skinnier back then though) but he was a pretty great leading man and I have high hopes for his future. Del Toro nailed it with this, and hope he continues to give us more mainstream-fare.",Null,7,11,3 October 2013
American Sniper," Great acting
","Not a showy performance, but a great one nonetheless, and I think it helps to see Cooper doing a different kind of character. I don't think I nominate him, the category is strong this year, but he's somewhere in #6-#8 range 9and I have yet to see Cumberbatch or Oyelowo) and I won't begrude his nod if he's nominated (and he probably will, he's been on a roll with the AMPAS). The film, as a whole though, is another story, but I'm sure many will disagree with me on that. However, the film being nominated by the PGA... It's a solid film, pretty good even, but it really doesn't deserve any other of the big 8 nominations other than maybe Cooper. Overall, recommended, even if nothing amazing.",Null,2,30,7 January 2015
Corpse Bride," Well made
","I had seen Corpse Bride as a kid back when it came out. I rewatched it after around six years, and it's still as fun and entertaining as when I first watched it. It isn't better than the more recent Coraline or 2005's Wallace and Gromit film, but it's still enjoyable with great colors and designs. How odd that Bonham Carter was in the two best animated films of 2005. Most songs are a bit forgettable, but there is one that really stuck with me, and that's the one sung when explaining what happened to the 'corpse bride'. Overall, this is definitely recommended. It's just what one would expect from Tim Burton, for better or worse for each kind of person.",Null,1,1,24 November 2011
Lion," Very straightforward, but heartwarming
","It's not a surprise at all that a story like this was made into a novel and then a film. It's the kind of thing audiences eat up. For that reason, the film follows a very predictable path that ends exactly where you expect. On one hand, it's hard to deviate too much because it is based on a true story. However, I still believe that the screenplay and director could have added so much more to make this a truly great film. As it is, it's still a very good one. A flawed one, but one that manages to effectively convey what it wants to. The acting is really good and I am really happy that Dev Patel got so many award nominations for this.",Null,1,2,28 January 2017
Forrest Gump," A Masterpiece that should be recognized for years to come....
","I will start off, this film is truly captivating. The character of Forrest Gump is so well thought of. It is a symbol for hope. The performance done by Tom Hanks is one of the best I have seen. First off, it gets a lot of hate around here, but the truth is, only a great actor could pull it off.Tom Hanks did amazing as the mentally challenged man. The way the film starts off, it is sort of a 'fairy tale'. Yes, it seems a bit theatrical at times, but this is the whole tone of the film. the film is trying to teach us more. the film is trying to pull the audience in an emotional way, and let me tell you, it does. We can really feel for every single character. The mom tries to do what every other mom tries to do these days. She is trying to raise her child the best way possible, in all means trying to keep him away from the cruelty of the world. This film represents life in a sort of light and innocent way, mainly because it is told from Forrest's point of view. The other characters, Forrest's friends that interwine in his life, Bubba and Lt. Dave, are all very well-rounded. They represent other symbols. The performance given by Gary Sinise is perfect. he perfectly captures his character's struggles. He is a very confused and 'bad' character in a way, but the way Forrest changes him and gives him hope is truly inspiring. The other character who I also think is sort of dark in a way, is Jenny. Jenny represents a lot of people these days. No, she is not 'evil', but like a lot of people these days, she is lost and doesn't know who she really is or what she really wants to do. her journey throughout the film is also very developed, and the actress playing her, Robin Writh Penn did a great job. Sally Field, of course, is great and wimsy and perfect in her performance.What is amazing in this film is not only the unforgettable characters and the amazing screenplay, but also the amazing cinematography and sets. The setting designs are so well put together, yes, they look very realistic, they are. It fits well with the tone of the film. The direction is also amazing. It really gives us thought to the characters, as does the pace of the wonderful film editing. The music scores used are simply fantastic, as they also represent the whole feeling of the film.At the end of the film, I found myself overly emotional at all the scenes. Not only because of the well put ending, but because I just remembered the whole journey Forrest Gump had. You simply cannot be in anything but simple 'awe' over the film. You realize how much you care about all these situations and characters. At the end of the day, this film is what every film should be. Give us a little bit of unfamiliar realistic life lessons, give us the truth in a not so disturbing way, but also simply gives us hope and uplift the audience(Forrest Gump's run across American is one of the best single moments in cinema history). This film is simple perfect, and it really surprised me. Perfect film-making.",Null,1,3,22 June 2008
Gone Baby Gone," A powerful crime thriller
","Ben Affleck's film directorial debut is nothing short of amazing. I have never been so fond of him as an actor, but I do think he has a future in writing and directing films. He along with Aaron Stockard have created a great script and have made a film that is powerful, riveting, and very entertaining.The performances here are great. Morgan Freeman does his usual self of creating a very emphasized character, and the whole other supporting cast was great, including Ed Harris. I thought that they could have picked a better actress for the character of Angie Gennaro, but Michelle Monaghan eventually grew on me. But the film is also this great because of two performances. One of them comes from the award-nominated performance of Amy Ryan. She creates a character that is very true to the life of many people in neighborhoods like this. She gave an outstanding performance, and creates ultimate likability in her character because you feel for her, even though she is also quite unlikeable in her actions. She deserved that Oscar nomination, and one of the best supporting performances of the year. However, as strong as Ryan was, the real star here is Casey Affleck. I am a huge fan of his performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and I thought he gave one of the best male performances of the decade, whether it was supporting or leading. I thought he deserved that Oscar for Supporting Actor(even though I ultimately think he is leading, although it is not a huge issue). But with this he proves he is an actor capable of anything. Whereas his character of Bob in the film Jesse James was very quiet, sort of weak and manipulated, here he proves his character is a strong, mannered leading man in whatever he does. I very much enjoy watching him perform, and he deserved to get an Oscar nomination for Leading Actor, because while his role was not as showy as Ryan's, it was just as strong or even better and he holds the film together. Much better than the nominated actors of the year George Clooney and Johnny Depp.The film was brilliantly shot, and while I did think it had problems with the editing, it was not a big glitch. I thought the twist at the end was very surprising, and I thought the ending scene was so powerful and heart-breaking. The film was very entertaining, and it also raises a lot of questions about neighborhoods like this and what is better for a child that lives in these ways. I thought this was a better crime film than Fincher's, Se7en and Zodiac, and I hope it does not become forgotten over time.",Null,1,2,14 August 2009
The Lost City of Z," Deliberately paced and some complex character work
","it would be easy for this type of film to simply be a type of action adventure epic in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, but James Gray knows that the strength in the source material of such a story as the one here lies in the persons going through this journey. Charlie Hunnam has always been a reliable actor, but he's never been better than here. He gives an extraordinary performance that would be easy to dismiss as an 'easy' one but there are may layers to his character that stand even outside of the page. The rest of the ensemble is solid, but it's his work that resonates. The film makes sure to linger on the moments that count and it's able to tell the life of this man without feeling overwhelming or overstuffed.",Null,1,2,7 May 2017
Southpaw," Fantastic work by Gyllenhaal and McAdams
","Well... I mean, boxing films... they will never go away. And neither will their formula. It's a question of how well their formula is executed (Raging Bull remains the only boxing film I've ever seen that transcends to actual greatness). I thought this was good, if a little unfocused and dull in its second act. I remember seeing the 'and Rachel McAdams' in the opening credits and found it weird that she wasn't second billed to Jake, but thought 'whatever' (take note, I had read absolutely nOTHING about the plot summary for this so all i had to go by was the poster. Granted, I was unbelievably shocked that they killed her off, but as it is, only those first 30 minutes were great. Jake Gyllenhaal is definitely great here, but as unbelievable as many pointed him out to be? Naaah, and certainly not close to his searing, monumental performance in last year's Nightcrawler, but it's yet another great performance in a career that seems to be getting stronger and stronger every year. He's one of the best actors currently working and his dedication shows. He's definitely the best reason to see it. I'm not a huuuge McAdams fan, but I thought she made such a strong impact and presence that when she left I felt like i had also lost her. Amazing acting by both her and Jake during her death scene, certainly some of the best work she's ever done.",Null,0,2,30 August 2015
21 Jump Street," A hoot
","This is just a hoot of a good time I'll admit, I have somewhat of a resentment towards Hollywood comedies. Well, not exactly resentment, I just think most are incredibly stupid and so many times, they have a pretty mean streak, one that's sort of hard to swallow. This film, though, doesn't, and it's a pretty great time all around. Jonah Hill is definitely the MVP, and he's proving yet again to be such a comedic talent. Tatum is hilarious too, although not sure if his dead-pan style is intentional or just Tatum lacking energy. Regardless, it works. I don't think this is all too original or amazing, but definitely a helluva time.",Null,0,3,27 September 2014
American Hustle," Exhilarating, spectacular fun!
","I want to start off with this... I love this movie. Why? It's true what so many are saying, it's just incredibly entertaining and just so, so much fun! That's really what it comes down to. The only other O Russell films I've seen are The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. The former I thought was decent if totally formulaic, and the latter I thought was fantastic although still somewhat formulaic. Russell shows a different kind of energy here that I hadn't seen from him in those two films, and he shows that he has a more distinct vision than I would have imagined. The plot here really is messy and sometimes hard to follow, but what keeps it endlessly intriguing is the cast and many single individual scenes that manage to work completely on their own. This shouldn't be how a film functions, and it's a surprise the film is as great as it is because it really is all over the place sometimes. But it all works.There are many great performances here, but the single best is Bradley Cooper. Who would have thought two years ago that the Hangover jerk- looking guy could actually act, but wait, that he could actually have an incredibly likable screen presence and steal a film from so many of his co-stars! That's what he does. He releases a kind of energy here that he didn't reach in Playbook and steals away most of his scenes. The other comparable to Cooper is Lawrence, who's also having a blast with all of this. It's like someone let these two come up with their own things and weren't given rules to go by. There's a spontaneity to them and the whole film really, and it pays off tremendously. They both benefit from having some of the funniest material. Bale is great, as expected, but for me, Amy Adams resonated more. In the past, she'd always been hit-or- miss for me, but after last year's wonderful work in The Master and now this, she's becoming someone I'm actually liking a lot. Jeremy Renner has much less screen time than the other four, but he nails the role in his limited screen time. In short, these five make up the strongest ensemble of 2013, unlikely to be challenged by any other cast. That's pretty much what the film's success comes down to. Its cast (and I didn't even mention all of the other great supporting turns) makes this a roaring great time. It may not have the emotion or gravitas that films like 12 Years A Slave or Gravity have, but it might just be better as a more accessible movie-going experience.",Null,5,14,22 December 2013
Incendies," Effective if contrived
","An odd one. Very intriguing, very well-acted and very well-paced all around. It isn't until it's over, though, that you start to pick it apart in some of the contrivances. It's a good film, but ultimately a too melodramatic for my taste. That doesn't mean it's not enjoyable on a scene-to- scene basis, though. The tone in this is probably its biggest accomplishment, as it really does have an affect on the sombering mood it has us in, particularly in the context and setting of the world these characters are living in. It's enough to remind us of the atrocities performed on humans all throughout time. I'm not sure I'd call it one of the best films of the year or even the best alongside the foreign language nominees, but definitely effective.",Null,0,1,14 March 2015
The Godfather: Part II," Extremely well done and intriguing...
","Part II continues the epic crime saga of the Corleone family. This time, we have an amazing performance by Robert De Niro, who shows he can do so much with such limited dialogue. Vito Corleone is a true icon as far as characters go. Pacino is once again great, but I did find his performance in Part 1 more of an achievement. The highlights are the flashbacks of the past life of Don Vito, probably the best scenes in the saga so far. However, I found Part II more inconsistent and ultimately at times less intriguing than Part I. However, it still makes up for a great story. Amazing cinematography, direction, score, and performances.Should I bother with Part III?",Null,0,2,13 February 2011
Fargo," A true landmark for Film-making! Perfect Materpiece!
","I re watched Fargo, and I have to say, without giving too much, it is impossible to not LOVE this film! Fargo is such a brilliant piece of film-making! The script was written with such intelligence. It's mixture of black comedy with crime and drama is so original, it is a pity why films like this cannot be done these days. To just explain the greatness of Fargo is not enough. Unlike other 'so called' masterpieces out there, Fargo's genuine emotional appeal cannot be described. It is enough to just watch the film. Yes, it is disturbing, sometimes a little too much, but that mixed in with amazingly memorable characters, makes for a truly amazing ride. It is a simple kidnapping movie, but the way events fold out, and unfold themselves are so bizarre, that it is even original(something that is hard to grasp these days).A strong part of this film is the acting. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a character that is sometimes mixed with fright and worry, and Macy gives such a well done performance. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormware are great as the two kidnappers, Buscemi actually giving a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. But the greatest performance has to come from Frances McDormand, who plays her character of Police Chief Marge Gunderson so well, mixed with quirkiness so well, this is a true landmark for acting. Usually dramatic performances capture scenes, but McDormand captures every scene with her charm. One of the best performances of the 90's. Mixed with the acting are the strong sides to the film. The cinematography is so real and gorgeous, the film editing flawless, the music score so originally made, they all enhance the experience more.All in all, Fargo is a perfect film. It has a lot of themes inside of it, and they all come out sooner or later. But unlike theme-filled movies, this is a joy to watch. This is what films should be. They should entertain, but also react strongly to the audience and enhance us in different ways. This is Joel and Ethan Coen's best films. There is no way they could beat this. It is just difficult to describe how truly great it is. And unlike most 1990's famous films, Fargo is not overrated in such a way that people call it to be so 'important'. Fargo is, after second thoughts, the best film of the 90's. It is also one of the best films ever made, in the aspect that it is, after all, one little joy of a film! 10/10",Null,0,0,19 September 2008
Rush," Fantastic stuff!
","I didn't really have much expectations for this, but I ended up absolutely loving it! I think the script does a pretty great job of outlining certain incidences and outcomes in the two leads' journey. Hemsworth is good enough, very charismatic like always, but I think this is Daniel Bruhl's film through and through. He's pretty amazing in the role and despite the contrary, he makes his character way more likable. He's undeniably leading, arguably more of a lead than Hemsworth, but I don't care... I want him to get that Oscar nomination. The film editing and cinematography are also pretty impressive, and Howard does a great job behind the camera. Highly recommended!",Null,2,4,17 December 2013
Nightcrawler," Relentless and mesmerizing, with a feverish and ferocious Gyllenhaal
","Maybe not totally what i expected. I expected something more abstract, less accessible. Not saying this in a bad way at all, but it definitely surprised me. I think it's one of the most purely entertaining films of the year, mostly because it does such a great job at setting up the main character. For those who've seen it, what did you think of them showing us that Lou is a murderer from the opening scene? I'm still not sure. It sets him up well, but maybe the lengths he goes to to get what he wants throughout the film would've made more impact had we never seen what he was capable of from the start? It would've made the fact that he's a psycho more unique to the situation he finds himself in as the film goes on? Either way, Gyllenhaal is absolutely amazing. He's sort of shown he was capable of this sort of thing in Donnie Darko, although obviously not to this extent. Here, he's mesmerizing, simultaneously terrifying and funny, that sort of feverish can't-look-away work only achieved very rarely in an actor's career. I've been a big fan of Jake for a while now even if I had never thought he was absolutely flat-out brilliant, he had just always been really great and dependable. Here, he gets a role that gives him more to work with and does wonders with it. The film is really great, completely relentless in its pacing with a really manic style, even if it's not afraid to linger in the moments that count. I had never seen Riz Ahmed before this, and he's a natural. He provides the film with so many awkward laughs along with Jake that really do highlight its satirical quality more, and both make such a great pair. If there's one complaint, it's that the film doesn't seem to know where to end. The final scene is great, but the few minutes before that sort of seem to wander aimlessly, only working as ways to show us how loose ends were tied up.I'd seen many comparisons to Drive, but outside of some beautiful LA shots, I think that this is more accessible and it relies a lot more on the script, as well as making its themes more obvious, whereas Drive was a film entirely dependent on its aesthetic and direction.",Null,1,2,30 November 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Very entertaining
","For a satire like this to work, it needs to have its heart in the right place. I was hesitant when watching the trailers, but fortunately the film doesn't lose track of the bigger humanization with these characters and it wears its heart on its sleeve. But perhaps that's also why it didn't go as far as it could have gone, and when all is said and done, perhaps plays things a little too safely. Still, it's vastly entertaining and the performances are aces. Andy Samberg excels at the comedy but also on making the lead a very likable protagonist, no mater his flaws. It's very easy to root for him. As a whole, definitely go seek this out and recommend it to your friends. Very underrated film that deserved to be bigger.",Null,23,32,3 July 2016
The Aviator," Mostly successful
","The Aviator is a grand epic piece of filmmaking. It has vivid costumes, elegant art direction, and great cinematography as its to be expected.

Leonardo Dicaprio gives the best performance here, and whenever I see him in a film I have to remind myself that he has not yet won an Oscar, and what shame that is. Cate Blanchett as well adds another impressive performance, although as far as a performance goes I liked her as the film went along more. At first she just seemed like a cartoon character, but if the real Hepburn acted that way then who am I to judge. Although this is an impressive picture it is not as great as The Departed or even the recent Shutter Island but it does build impressively in Scorsese's filmography.",Null,1,1,9 January 2011
Bohemian Rhapsody," Not terrible, but problematic
","This film is similar to Green Book. It's actually not a 'terrible' film in terms of filmmaking- there are some good scenes, especially the music ones, and I do think the acting is worth it. But it's not a particularly good film either, as the script is lacking in any real substance. It tries to chronicle an entire journey but doesn't hit many of its targets with any real meaning. It's shallow and all surface-based, although it's not boring.But that would have been enough to critique if it wasn't for how problematic and offensive it is. The film really does try to portray anything related with his sexuality in a negative light. In one of its most offensive scenes, during the section where Freddie is acting out, there's a montage of him circling dark corridors for men and sex. The film paints everyone straight as positive and everything related to his sexuality as negative. I don't think it was intentional, but it is telling and it doesn't matter. Rami Malek really does deliver some great work, but it's a miracle he's able to with so much mediocrity and problems around him. Freddie Mercury (and Rami Malek) deserved so much better.",Null,4,9,16 January 2019

Burn After Reading," The Coens have created another Original Masterpiece
","The Coens have done it again! A year after their instant classic No Country For Old Men, they create another original and ambitious film! Burn After Reading is not for the faint-hearted. It has a lot of dark humor, it has a tone unlike anything I have seen in years. Comparable to their classic Fargo, this film has great writing and an amazing ensemble to back it up. Frances McDormand gives another great performance, one that is similar and different to her Oscar-nominated performance as Marge Gunderson more than 10 years ago. She deserves her second Oscar nomination! Brad Pitt continues to amaze me. After having his best performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, which is also his finest work and one of the best films of the decade, here he comes again, in a totally opposite performance. He will sure get the most buzz out of this movie, and as of now, he delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance. John Malkovich, never having really seen a lot of his work, gives such a great, cold performance. George Clooney, after also having a good year at the Oscars in 2007, delivers his best performance. I usually do not like him much, but in this movie, he proved he is a very versatile actor. Tilda Swinton is also very good, but has less amount of work to play with.The script is just so well thought out and written. This is truly a film for idiocy and stupidity, and the script explores all of that. The ending is in a way as provocative as No Country For Old Men.The film has beautiful music and cinematography, in a different way to the Coens' other films.Burn After Reading is just as great as the Coens' best films.

Watchmen," A stunning and powerful adaptation of the best graphic novel ever made!
","Let me start off by saying that I saw the Director's Cut of Watchmen, so this review is based solely on the DC. Watchmen is a film that might enrage a lot of people who were expecting to see an action film. The novel is a very provocative and very complex look at the superhero life. A lot of the superheroes are very flawed, and unlikeable as well. The film explores the basin of the world they live in, and the problems facing them and everyone else at that time. The novel is filmed almost entirely scene-by-scene into the film, and I am glad it was so faithful. I thought the film was brilliantly written and executed, almost to perfection. Yes, it is true that a lot of things said in a comic book can sound and look totally ridiculous on film, but I thought Watchmen did not have those problems. Of course, the context of the film is not as subtle as the novel, no film ever could, but it reaches pretty damn close, and for that, I am grateful. Many scenes work very well,and those that do not work in the same way as the novel work in their own right. A large part of why the film is as brilliant as it is is because of Zack Snyder. While I enjoyed Snyder's 300, it was pretty much always style over substance, with no real character development or plot. However, he was perfect for Watchmen. He gave it his 'flair', and you can see the similarities to 300, the slow-motion action, the shots, but I thought it all worked very well. While the graphic novel is very dense and not mainstream at all, it does hit upon some moments of action and thrills, and Snyder directed those moments in his own way. I thought it all worked, especially the new ending.The performances in the film are simply great. I have heard many complaints about how the acting is not what people envisioned for Watchmen, but I have to say, from all the actors that could have taken these great characters, I am glad these did. Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are the ones getting the raves they deserve. All three was spot-on from the novel, and I do think they all deserve serious awards recognition, especially Haley who has given the single best performance of 2009 so far. His mannerisms and expressions are exactly what I imagined for Rorschach. The same for Morgan and Crudup, both incredibly great. I also want to recognize three other great performances- Matthew Goode, Patrick Wilson, and Carla Gugino. Personally, I loved Ozymandias in the novel, and I was afraid how Goode would portray him. I thought he was brilliant. I actually think he gave justice to the character in a whole different way that i envisioned him. I think he was just as great as Haley, Crudup, and Morgan. Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II, which was actually my least favorite superhero of the novel. I thought Wilson gave it his all best, and made him even better in the film. I thought he played him with doubt, fear, and confusion, and was great at it. Also making him the most likable of the bunch, since his character, also Silk Spectre II are the most likable and least flawed of them. Carla Gugino was brilliant in her character. Like with Goode, she portrayed the first Silk Spectre in a different way than I would have thought, and I loved it. Now to Malin Akerman, who is being picked as the weakest in the cast. She was not as great as the other five, but seeing her character, no actress would ever be. But I thought she was very good. She did have some flaws, although I think it was some flaws in her dialogue at times. But overall, I thought she pulled it off. I was expecting something much worse than I got, because she really was not bad at all. The rest of the supporting cast are all great, but the stand-outs are all pretty much said already.Now to the technical aspects. Watchmen has amazing visual and sound effects. I thought the scenes in Mars with Jon and Laurie was very true to the novel, and I loved it. Dr. Mahnattan's body glow, and his whole appearance was pretty much perfect. I loved the music in this film completely. While I did think the score towards the end was a bit too high and mainstream, I get why Snyder is doing it. But I do not really hold it against him, since the studio at least let him do this film. The opening credits, showing us a lot of the superhero world and from 1930-1985, with Bob Dylan's 'The Times They Are A 'Changin' was absolutely my favorite opening credits in years! The music put throughout the film was also great. And from all of the controversy, I seriously thought that the 'Blue Penis' was barely shown. I seriously did not notice it, and I cannot believe all the fuss it created. It was nothing! I thought the ending credits' song, from My Chemical Romance, was unfit in the story. Overall, here it is! Watchmen the film, and I am so pleased with the way it turned out. For those who said it was unfilmable, well, they were wrong. I also think some of the criticism pointed towards the film is unjust, and cannot believe some critics did not like it. But again, I saw the Director's Cut, so I cannot really know how the theatrical version turned out. Bravo to Zack Snyder for giving us fans, and the rest of the world, the film about the Watchmen!",Null,7,15,27 July 2009
Baby Driver," Fantastic and very entertaining
","No doubt this may end up being the studio surprise of the year. It's not difficult to think of Drive when watching this. Just like Drive, its opening car chase scene and the subsequent credits opening are simply fantastic and set the mood for the entire thing. The real star of this film is Edgar Wright, who I haven't seen show this much directing flair and skill in quite a while, if not his entire career. This may truly be his best film yet. The screenplay is quite good and does a nice job with these characters, but it's everything else that seems to really bang. Elgort is so fantastic that you forget how unlikable his real life persona is. This is a fantastic film that should no doubt be recommended.",Null,2,7,7 July 2017
28 Weeks Later," An instant Horror Classic!
","28 Weeks Later is the very promising and very terrific sequel to 28 Days Later. It starts off strong, and the film never lets go. It has great production values. The direction by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is really amazing. He directs with a fast-paced tone. The cinematography is spectacular, and the film has a sort of futuristic look to it. It has the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The writing is very strong. The characters are very well developed, so we care about them. The performances by everyone in the cast are top notch. The action is riveting, since this film is more of an action film than 28 Days Later. I also thought this was a very thought-provoking film. The way people have to kill each other because there is no other way is a truly deadly thought. It reminded me of the theme of The Mist, another great 2007 horror film. Overall, everything that made 28 Days Later work is present here as well. 28 Weeks Later might even be better than the original. I very much appreciate horror films like this, and am very glad they can still be made. Terrific film-making!",Null,3,5,8 April 2009
The Village," Not what I expected at all
","I can't remember, from recent memory, the last time I saw a film and it soooo wasn't what I expected. Similar to The Sixth Sense in that I thought they were going to be twisty, plot-heavy horror films. They're barely horror at all, this in particular. I had heard about the twist, and I assumed that As it is, both twists worked very well, and didn't feel like hammers to the head, even when they were over-explained. definitely seemed a bit like overload. I didn't think this was anything too amazing, but definitely more original than I thought it'd be, and honestly the best Shyamalan film I've seen. Definitely recommended, and underrated",Null,1,3,19 September 2014
The Revenant," Beautiful, poetic, and immersive
","Much will be said about this film. Whether it is a disappointment or not. I've never been huge on Inarritu. I've always felt his films take the melodrama and contrivance way too far, even if I don't hate any of his films. The first of his that I loved was Birdman, and now I can add The Revenant as his second and his most accomplished film to date. I feel like many will not take to its pacing. It's pretty much the most plot-driven Malick film that the director himself never made. Technically it's breath-taking, with really beautiful and powerful cinematography that will surely blow you away. But then again we all knew that. If there's one aspect of the film that perhaps is flawed, it is the editing. I do feel like the transitioning of scenes at times felt a little off, and because of it the film as a whole can sometimes feel disjointed. I think this, in particular, makes the film feel like it is dragging in its second act. The biggest surprise here is how strong the actual narrative and screenplay is. I didn't know much about these people, the novel, or the plot summary of the film, but I think that the screenplay does a really wonderful job of letting us into many of these characters' heads and really permeating the entire film's atmosphere with intense psychological dilemmas that really haunt the screen. For such a physical film, it's also very much an internal one, and that essentially applies to Dicaprio as well. I've always been hit or miss with him, but this is the best I've ever seen him, and I think that's because it's a role that is totally unlike so much of what he usually does. He has to physically inhabit this character completely. He surely gives it his all, and it's visible all across his face. It's a role very much not driven by dialogue, and instead it's a completely soulful performance. If he was to win an Oscar for this, then congratulations to him because he would be completely deserving. The other standout is Tom Hardy, another actor who is usually hit or miss with me but who also delivers some stunningly good work here. He's chilling, and he should definitely be in contention for an Oscar nomination.Ultimately, this film is one that needs to be pondered more to see how it fares with time. The great thing is that, so far, I cannot recommend it enough. It's very much a humorless, miserable film, with only bad things happening to characters we care about. In that respect, similar to Inarritu's previous films, and yet none of it rang false here. It's far from perfect, it remains a daunting, exhausting, overwhelming, yet beautiful, poetic, immersive experience, and those adjectives alone make it one of the best, if not the best, films of the year.",Null,10,22,27 December 2015
Bridge of Spies," It's all about Mark Rylance
","I really do hope the only awards this film wins are for Mark Rylance. He is incredibly mesmerizing in the role. It's a very subtle one, but he commands your gaze and attention any time he is on screen. I don't think many actors could have given the role so much effect, especially such a quiet one, but he managed to do that and more. The problem is that he's stuck in a film that is completely and thoroughly just fine. The good thing is that, except for the sentimental ending, Steven Spielberg doesn't interfere too much with the story around him. He is mostly restrained. Overall, this isn't something I will be aching to rewatch any time soon, and not something I will remember. Although it's quicker in pacing, definitely not nearly the film that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is, but it's not bad at all.",Null,0,1,24 December 2015
Split," Could have been better, but solid
","I've been going back and forth on whether I want to give this film a 6 or a 7. On one hand, it's way too long. It's 110 minutes and yet it feels even longer than that. It's also simply not as 'fun' as I wanted it to be. Instead of not taking it self seriously at all, the film is way too solemn and serious for its own good. At the same time, however, I admire its willingness to be something more than a cheesy horror/thriller, as it is also highlighting the types of mental processes that can occur with this type of medical condition. It's also very well shot, with some nice, fluid camera-work. The acting is also solid, but it's James McAvoy who impresses the most. He is easily the biggest reason to see this. He gives it his all.",Null,2,8,10 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A Superb and Stunning Chapter
","The Harry Potter series is one of the most faithful I have ever seen, and each film brings something new. Whenever a new film comes out, there is always a certain criticism that a book fan will mention because of certain information or details left out of the film adaptation. Being the final book in the famous wizard series, this would always be the hardest book to adapt, so I was very relieved when it was announced that it would be split into two parts. Some might see this as an attempt to cash in money, but I honestly do not believe it was for that reason. The filmmakers care about this story, and being the finale, they care about adding in character development before the big action-packed finale. So after seeing Part 1, I have the obligation not just to judge it as a film adaptation but also as a film.The opening of the film is perfect for the type of tone it is trying to set. Showing us each of the home lives of the three leads and just how difficult the future will be is a hard fact to behold. The action scenes in the film are pretty impressive, but not overly done and they do not take you out of the real story. David Yates and Steve Kloves have set Part 1 as a character film with action in it, not the other way around. And so it is with the rest of the film. Last Year's Half-Blood Prince proved to me that Yates was the best director that this series ever had. He understands mood and the challenges that the three leads are going through. Part 1 is able to capitalize on that.Each new Harry Potter film is deemed as 'darker' than the previous, and that may be true, but it is not just about how sinister things on screen appear to be. The magical world is at a time where danger lurks around everywhere. We certainly are able to see this on screen, but the real power and the real confrontation as to just how dangerous the world is right now is brought by the quiet moments in the film. Many have said that the middle section of the film, when the three leads begin their camp out, is what weakens the pace. I was surprised by how much this was not true when I watched it. If anything, this section is much needed. It is also powerful because the three leads are able to hold their own very well. Over the years, they have matured and grown as actors, and at this point no one else could do what they are doing. There are certain scenes in the film that, while definitely subtle, are completely powerful and strengthen the characters and express the way they are feeling in a sense of loss. An example is the dance scene between Harry and Hermione, which I thought was perfectly acted by both, especially Watson. Emma Watson has been the most inconsistent throughout the series. She was good as a little kid in the first two, good as a growing teen in the 3rd film, over-dramatic in Goblet of Fire, OK in Order of the Phoenix, and it wasn't until Half-Blood Prince when you could see she was really starting to shine. Well, here she does. While Radcliffe and Grint are very good, there is something electrifying about Watson. People have raved a lot about her performance, and while at times one is cautious not to overpraise a performance, she deserves it. She does not have scenes where in script it would seem as if she has to do something incredible. This is what makes her stand-out in this film. Starting from her first scene in the film, in a very sad and tragic scene in her home, we see her pain and her sadness over to what she has to do. She only has two words that she speaks in this scene, but her facial expressions say it all. She conveys the same powerful subtle expressions throughout the film. There is also another scene involving her and Helena Bonham Carter that she has been praised about, and this was a disappointment. Not that Watson wasn't great, because she certainly was, much more than what was probably required from her, but the scene only lingered on her for short seconds and then it cut away. We could hear Watson's incredible suffering, but I just wish it could have lingered more on her, to feel even more of what she and others like her really have to go through. Watson is incredibly effective and subtle in this film, and for the first time, she gave the best performance in a Harry Potter film, a feat that none of the three leads have ever achieved. A real stand-out of the last HP film, Half Blood Prince, was the cinematography, and while I am not sure whether Part 1 was better shot than that one, it was still pretty impressive. Of course, that is no surprise. The music score also stood-out for me. While it is true that it is not as loud, or even as recurring, as the scores of the last Harry Potter films as in it is not present in a lot of the film, it was still effective. I really hope it gets some nominations. Ultimately, the film was everything I could hope for, and not any major flaws really appeared. The ending I also thought was a good way to end Part 1, contrary to the opinions of most. This was a very effective, carefully paced, and superb beginning to the end.",Null,2,4,4 December 2010
American Psycho," Interesting and a fantastic performance by Bale
","American Psycho is surely an interesting picture. It has handsome cinematography and a slick tone, and Bale totally commits himself to the role. He remains a very interesting character, and the film has some really great scenes. It surely has ideas behind it, but for all of the film's ambitions, it feels sometimes self-indulgent. Even with it's flaws though it is always entertaining, right until the end, which is very difficult to predict. The biggest accomplishment is probably Bale, who proves himself here and respect should be given where it's due. This film will only benefit from rewatches, and I surely do strongly recommend it only because even if it doesn't amount to much at the end (for me at least) it is still quite ambitious in it's own right, and I am pretty sure it will make many people talk about it. There's a truly hidden brilliance here, or at least it looks like it.",Null,0,0,26 February 2011
North by Northwest," Hitchcock at the top of his game!
","I cannot believe it has taken me so long to watch this famous film by one of my favorite directors. It was never at the top of my 'to see' list, but I can say that this is another incredible film by Hitchcock.The story of North by Northwest starts off pretty simple, but make no mistake, this is probably Hitchcock's most unpredictable film (apart from everyone knowing Psycho's big twist). There are so many twists and turns in the screenplay that I could barely keep up, and it's because Hitchcock doesn't let us breathe for one second. We think we know who the bad guy is, then we are wrong. Fantastic screenplay by Ernest Lehman, with fantastic performances from Cary Grant and James Mason. Every time I saw Eva Marie Saint on screen I thought it was Betty Draper (January Jones from Mad Men) running around with another man. I'm telling you, January Jones looks just like her. Now if they make a remake (hopefully not, but we never know) they know who to cast.Overall, fantastic film. Probably a masterpiece in it's great story- telling, and possibly Hitchcock's 2nd best after Psycho.",Null,2,3,15 July 2011
Coriolanus," Don't know what to think....
","I'm not familiar at all with Shakespeare's Coriolanus. I really don't know what to say besides it definitely is very difficult to be able to judge this film as a whole if you aren't familiar with the kind of language spoken. I still was able to understand it many times, but I found myself thinking about other things throughout. hat I can say is that Fiennes really show promise as a director. The film never feels too 'stagey', and in fact the cinematography really expands and lets it feel way more interesting than it should be, well to me anyways. I really don't know how to judge this film, but besides some interesting things Fiennes did behind the camera, the cast also kept things interesting for me at least. Fiennes stumbles a bit in the last act, and one can see his Voldemort coming out. Redgrave is pretty good, although nothing from this film left a very big impression on me. As it is, it's hard to judge a performance when you lose track of more than half of what they are saying. Because of that, I guess I only recommend this to people who really have a knack for Shakespeare's language and who are familiar with this story.Also, it's not hard to see why Redgrave was ignored throughout the awards season. I mean, she is full of emotions and a face that captivates, but at the end of the day, if the film lacks a real connection with you of understanding, you won't be able to have a look out for how great a performance involved is, although I honestly don't think this is anything out of the ordinary for her by just studying her physical acting. I guess... don't believe the hype?",Null,3,9,26 February 2012
Hugo," The Magic of Cinema!
","When I first saw the trailer for Hugo I was a bit skeptical. Scorsese (the incredible director behind some of my favorite films ever, including the masterful Taxi Driver) had never done film like this before, not to mention the trailer itself sort of seemed like a formulaic, run-of-the-mill family film. Boy, was I wrong.Hugo is a real film lover's film. Many have mentioned this before, but its true. Scorsese's brilliant direction, along with the great script, produce real magic here. Film magic, not often seen even in the greatest of films. The film isn't executed in the usual family-film way. In fact, I can imagine a lot of kids and their parents sort of leaving this film with a 'meh' reaction. It's not a soaring, thrilling adventure that we usually get. It is an adventure, but quite an intimate and personal one. That is where the film succeeds.I can't really say much more except that the performances are splendid, as are all of the visual and technical aspects of course. This stands out among Scorsese's filmography, and in many ways, that's a very special thing.",Null,9,14,13 December 2011
The Orphanage," A beautiful and moving horror film
","I was really not intending to watch The Orphanage, just because it looked so similar to other films of it's kind, most notably The Others. However, I am glad I did watch it, because although it does have similar aspects, it remains a beautiful and very moving film. As a horror film it succeeds, and as a drama it succeeds as well. It is genuinely creepy, with one of the scariest scenes of the last decade (guess which it is, but I am sure everyone will know I am talking about the 'medium' scene). The screenplay is very, very strong, not one major flaw. The performances are brilliant, and first-time director Juan Antonio Bayona might really have a bright future ahead of him. The suspense is at times dreadfully mysterious, and the cinematography is surreal and beautiful. The music score gives the film a classical feel to it, and is very effective. Overall, I think it is a great film, and ultimately has better execution and more suspense than The Others. This will not disappoint you!",Null,1,2,29 March 2010
The Shining," A flawed but very interesting and suspenseful horror from the Master!
","So I finally saw The Shining, Stanley Kubrick's horror film. Is it a good film? Yes, definitely. Very good actually. While it is a slow film, it certainly has some creepy suspense and mystery, and Kubrick gets beneath our skin most of the times. Jack Nicholson is brilliant here, and his performance here is worthy of it's popularity. I also thought Shelley Duvall was pretty good, but I am sure her performance is one to get a lot of hate, and seeing her Razzie nomination wasn't surprising. Now back to the film, like I said, it is a very good film, and it even achieves greatness because of certain scenes. I appreciate what Kubrick was trying to achieve, but his direction while sometimes brilliant feels a bit misguided as well. This is a psychological horror for sure, but the screenplay is pretty strong, even though there are some flaws within the writing. The last 40 minutes are brilliant, and the visuals will haunt you, and as far as horrors go, this ranks in the top class. I am not sure if this is the masterpiece Kubrick hoped for or just a film that is near-brilliant, but one thing is for sure... it remains always unsettling and interesting",Null,0,2,27 July 2010

American Beauty," An American Masterpiece
","American Beauty really surprised me in every way. This was not the slow, bleak, Oscar-baity film I thought it would be. Boy, was it a lot more. I love the writing and story the film brought. It was a very enjoyable look at suburban life in a way. All the different stories each character has is so amazingly brought to life, with such real passion. The characters are all such memorable and fascinating . Kevin Spacey is just brilliant. His comedic act is so realistic and so well done, this is one of the best performances of the 90's. Anette Bening is just as spectacular. Her performance is so 3-dimensional. Both are well rounded performances, and all bring something original that we have never seen before. Thora Birch is great, Wes Bentley and his character are so brilliant and unique.What I loved about this film is that it is such an enjoyable, heartbreaking, comedic, and satirical look at suburban life. It is also one of those rare gems that can be called entertaining. The cinematography is first-rate, the music is so well pitched for every scene. Overall, a very unforgettable motion picture.

Wanted," The most energetic, mind-blowing, and action-packed film of the century!
","Wanted is like the new type of action-film. It knows it's silly, it knows it's over the top, and because of that it is an extremely fun and entertaining film. I had so much fun with this movie! The main characters are very fleshed out so we can relate to them and care for them. The performances are all very good, notably James McAvoy proves he is an amazing actor capable of a lot of things. His performance here is really different than the rest of his films, but his performance is pitch-perfect I have to say and went along with the film greatly. Angelina Jolie is great in this role, as is Morgan Freeman. The acting and writing are done purposely comedic and silly, but by no means in a bad way. Both the script and acting are very, very good for an action film. Now to the amazing action sequences. This if the most fun I have had watching a film in like the last few years, and I mean that with a big smile. The action pieces are amazing. The curving bullets, the over-the-top car scenes, the gore and the violence! Just WOW. I have not seen a film this over-the-top and unrealistic in a very, very long time. I mean that as a big compliment. Why have an action film that wants to be realistic even though they almost never are? Here, you can play so many tricks with what is happening on screen, so much fun! Director Timur Bekmambetov is very talented, his direction was superb and very stylish and in control. The visual and sound effects are amazing, as proved since it got two Oscar nominations for the sound. The slow motion is cleverly used, not like it was done so often in 300, but here it works a lot better.At the end of the day, yes, Wanted is just an action film. But boy, I had not seen an action film be able to captivate me the way this one did. It has mind-blowing action sequences, awesome energy, and so stylishly done effects. Not to mention the characters are very leveled out and it is a film that really hits us on an emotional level with all of it's twists and turns. Movie-going at it's best. I am sure a lot of people do hate it, but honestly, I could not care less. To me, Wanted is the most action-packed film of the decade, and perhaps the best as well.",Null,2,7,18 April 2009
Warrior," Pretty good
","Sure, this is in no way original really. But the amount of heart it has is definitely surprising. It helps that the film is revolved around a pair of brothers, although The Fighter was too and for some reason that one just comes off across as way more superficial. This one has the right heart in mind. The three central performances are pretty fantastic, especially Edgerton who continues to be a very under-the- radar actor but is always pretty strong in what he appears in. Notle is also very strong in a meatier supporting role. Overall, this isn't anything too amazing, but it gets the job done and many people might need some tissues.",Null,1,3,30 August 2014

I don't think it's bad, and indeed there's quite a lot to admire in it. The pacing is sort of beautiful and problematic at the same time, the same goes for its overall atmosphere. I think its aces in terms of that. But in terms of the narrative and storyline? I don't think it makes its point across all that well, and this ends up really hurting the more impactful and eerily dreamy scenes because, while they work on a surface level, there's nothing underneath. I don't get the love for this at all, but it's not half bad.",Null,0,1,8 July 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Truly fantastic
","I had been anticipating Silver Linings Playbook very much for a good while now, although I wasn't entirely sure I should be. It does look like some sort of romantic dramedy, and while the genre can work well many times, it's also not a genre that does anything particularly amazing for me. And while I liked Russell's The Fighter a good amount (his only other film I've seen) it's also the sort of film that quickly fades from memory. So I can't say how well I'll like a film like this as time goes by, but for now, I'm in love.I never saw a trailer for this. I only saw a clip between Pat and Tiffany at the dinner table with another couple (who I now know is Pat's friend and Tiffany's sister), and the clip hugely impressed me. I loved Lawrence in Winter's Bone, but this just seemed like such a huge step for her. And then there was Bradley Cooper, making a large impression in the short two-minute clip that I was completely shocked. Who knew the guy from The Hangover could do so much in such a small clip? So for them I definitely had high expectations, just based on two minutes. And they certainly didn't disappoint in any way, shape or form. There have been some great duos in 2012, but no two actors electrify the screen together as much as Cooper and Lawrence. They bounce off each other magically, making me long for more recent films with a central relationship as dynamic and as charismatic as this. Lawrence nails every single second of her character. There's a real energy to her, you just can't look away. People have wondered whether this is just a really large supporting role. Here's the thing. When you look at cinema's history you see a lot of roles considered 'leading' that are sometimes really large secondary characters to a more prominent lead. A great example is Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. But the reason he is ultimately seen as lead alongside Leigh is because of the amount of power he brings to the screen and for the fact that he brings to the film the type of spark that not everyone can achieve, and as a result the relationship between Blanche Dubois and Stanley is the central power to the film. The same goes for Lawrence here. Whatever she is in terms of category, she gives the best female performance of 2012. I say that without hesitation, and I truly hope she wins the Oscar over the also-great Chastain or Riva.I wanted to talk about Lawrence before Cooper because, as it is, it's the performance with the most notices. But Cooper is just as equally magnificent and radiant, demonstrating a true talent for handling something as dramatic and comedic as this. He drives the film in ways no other actor of the year besides Jackman in Les Miserables did. But despite being the main lead of the film, his role is perhaps not as showy as Lawrence's. The role requires for a true navigation between many different emotional arcs that should drive the film in a clear and empathetic way. Cooper finds the perfect balance and as a result it's one of the easiest characters to sympathize and connect with in recent years. The rest of the cast is strong, and De Niro and Weaver both do great in their roles. As is the case, I'm not sure why people are too upset about Weaver, especially when De Niro was seen as a strong, strong possibility for an Oscar nom for several weeks now and yet doesn't have all that much more to do than her. Based on reactions to the Oscar nods, I expected Weaver to be in it for very few scenes. She's more prominent than that for sure. The ending also worked brilliantly for me, but this is the type of ending that I could see perhaps weakening or making the film stronger when I reflect back on it later on. Ultimately, this is a very strong film and among the best of 2012.",Null,2,6,11 January 2013
The White Ribbon," An engaging and meaningful film
","On my first viewing of The White Ribbon I appreciated the film very much, but it did not always connect with me or engage me. However, like I predicted, this is one of those films that demands a rewatch and if you know what sort of film it is, you will not be disappointed. This was a problem I had the first time I was watching it, I expected a more physically thrilling film I guess, and since it is a very slow film, I did not like it as much as I thought I would. But this is a film that demands your full attention throughout, and this time I certainly was engaged throughout with no dull moments. I have to start off by saying that the writing and directing by Haneke is certainly amazing. He is certainly a director of patience when he thinks his film needs it. What I think is most interesting of his film is the fact that there is so many characters (which I thought was the problem the first viewing but have come to realize that it's it's strongest aspect) and he gives so many of them importance that this is probably one of the best examples of an ensemble piece. Haneke is showing us the way the people in this village live and how their flawed actions are the cause of so much brutality and cruelty. Honestly, I am not comfortable saying that that is what Haneke is trying to show us. Most already know that Haneke intends to show how these type of children in this village are examples of their future Nazi roles, so say in a simpler way, but I feel that the film does not actually need to be explained in any way, which I think is why I love the ending so much- it gives no closure. We are always as clueless as the townspeople and we are never given any further insight as to who is committing the cruel acts. We are forced to experience what all of these villagers are experiencing, yet without any leads on anything. We see how the Pastor has a powerful sway over his children's' acts and what makes up their morality according to his own flawed beliefs, holding them up to higher standards only because they are his children. We glare at the way the Doctor so ruthlessly commits perverse sins, and how the Baron is dominated by anger and selfishness. Technically, the film is outstanding. The cinematography is brilliant and is the main factor that gives Haneke's film it's engaging but subtle atmosphere. The lack of music just creates more dread in ever scene and forces you not to look away. The acting is brilliant. The children's' performances are all great and are probably some of the finest child actors I have seen in any film. Ultimately, this film demands a 2nd viewing, and just like Antichrist and A Serious Man from 2009 as well, does improve significantly just because you dwelve into it's brilliant film-making more than you ever did in first viewing.",Null,0,5,21 May 2010

However, when I learned he was doing another version of the Swedish original based on a novel, I wasn't exactly thrilled. Having never read the novel, I could only base it on the Swedish original, and that one never rose above just good. The story sounds great, it just never left me really hooked. Fincher's version accomplished more with the same source material.The opening sequence of the film is excellent, as everyone has already said. It's the best opening of the year. Then we follow Michael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. Very similar to the Swedish version, but also executed differently. Basically, pretty much what one would expect from Fincher, although there is a big difference. I expected a very cold atmosphere, and that same atmosphere although works can also be off- putting. Yet, while the film does have that, it also plays a lot with different colors. It's atmosphere stands out from the Swedish version's, and overall it's much more involving and thrilling. The different settings changed in the film, as well as some of the interactions and such. This version is more thrilling.Then we have Rooney Mara. I had expected good from her, and then I heard raves for her performance. Yet, I didn't really see her expanding on what Rapace did. Somehow, she's given more material to work with, and she expands on the complexities and the hidden feelings that her character has. This is an excellent performance, and she managed to surprise me with how much she does with just a still face. It's even in the small moments as well. Daniel Craig is a more investing protagonist than the one from the Swedish version, and he did more than I had expected him to. He shows many vulnerabilities that I didn't expect.One of the major differences is the ending of this and the ending of the other version. The way this version revealed the truth about the prime antagonist and about Harriet was handled much better here, but it has some problems in the final 20 minutes. After the big climax is over, it takes too long to wrap things up. Fincher's version doesn't add any ambiguities. One of my favorite aspects of the Swedish original was the way that lisbeth ends the attacker, and a conflict between how she handled it and how Michael wanted it to end. Here, all of that is removed. I was disappointed in this. Also, this version adds more to the ending of what Lisbeth is doing undercover. I thought this worked well. I have not seen the other two films based on the trilogy, but I felt that this version handled it in a good, but different way. And the final scene, surprisingly, worked. I wouldn't have thought it could if reading it on paper, but it did. Overall, this is an excellent film. It doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary, and when looked at is pretty simple and straight-forward, but in that respect it works. Many will find this structure solid, if unexciting, but it adds to the richness of the characters. I loved it for even more reasons I can't explain, and I do think it's better than the Swedish film.",Null,7,15,29 December 2011
Dreamgirls," And introducing Jennifer Hudson!
","I've known about this film since it came out and caused a big uproar in 2006. I knew all about Eddie Murphy losing the Oscar to everyone's surprise, and Jennifer Hudson being the 'break-out' and winning the Oscar. But I never actually had that much desire to see it. After 6 years I did, and it's truly a fantastic film.There's nothing incredibly surprising about it, and by now I knew a lot of the plot, but I still found it incredibly entertaining with some really great music to boot. It's very satisfying and never once drags. The real stars of the film are Murphy and Hudson. The fact that Murphy was beat by Alan Arkin in Little Miss Sunshine, of all performances, is criminal. Jennifer Hudson has faced some backlash since she won the Oscar, but she dominates the screen. Her performance of the musical numbers, in particular her solo, are captivating and powerful, and contrary to what a lot of people think, she was the most effective in the non-singing parts of the film as well. It helps that her character is the one with the 'meatiest' arc to it, and she fully sinks her teeth into Effie, commanding the screen. It's a truly fantastic break-through performance. Noni Rose is also quite fantastic, and it's a shame she doesn't have more to do. I think she would have been a much more interesting Deena than Beyonce, who's probably the weakest link in the cast. Her 'Listen' seems way overacted in contrast to the way Hudson does her own solo. Overall, a truly successful film. It's a blast to watch and emotionally satisfying with some truly fantastic performances.",Null,0,0,24 January 2013
In the Name of the Father," Pretty horrifying
","In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.",Null,0,0,17 January 2013
Being John Malkovich," Another Kaufman gem!
","Being John Malkovich is yet another Kaufman gem. Initially, the premise sounded a bit like a one-note joke, and I was reluctant. Little did I know that the film has various different story lines interwoven from one simple premise. In fact, not many screenwriters could be able to successfully blend in all of these different plots, but Kaufman does so brilliantly.I'm still amazed by the turns the film makes. Last night I watched Adaptation, and it was also a great film with equally creative and ambitious ideas. This one though feels much different. It's comedy is blended in sort of funnier and also sadder moments. The fate of one of the leads in the end is also pretty sad in itself. All of the different ideas of identity from Kaufman have never been better explored.Overall, another great film from Jonze and Kaufman. Based on the four films I have seen Kaufman write (Eternal Sunshine, Synecdoche, New York, Adaptation, and this) it's true that no one writes outrageous and creative, yet also investing, comedy-dramas like him.",Null,2,3,6 March 2012
Spider-Man," Fantastic
","Overall consensus on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise?by you I only saw the third once, when it came out, so I don't remember it enough to actually judge it. But, rewatching the first two today I was reminded of how great they are. Raimi perfectly blends in cheese, camp, humor, drama, and action in one fantastic package. The comic book style is still in tact, and I noticed that unlike Nolan's Batman franchise, the heart is apparent here. These films give off a good-natured, mainstream vibe. The characters are all excellently written, and so it makes it so easy to relate to them. Raimi does so much with the source material in the way it's all edited together. The first two are honestly great and perhaps as great as something like this could ever be, so why why WHY reboot (remake) this after 10 years? There's simply no reason. It's not like the trailers for the new one suggested it to be darker, because these aren't dark and yet their dramatic moments hit hard. I hate to say it, but I do think that Raimi did more to this franchise than Nolan ever did to the Batman one. People like to criticize Nolan's writing, but I think the reason why his films' flaws are more apparent on rewatches is because of his direction style. Technically amazing, both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but as much as he tries he can't make the smaller moments count. Maybe it is his screenplays, or I simply don't know. My point is, after The Dark Knight people forgot all about these films (and because the 3rd left a bad taste). People like giving TDK credit for being dark and complex, and while it's true that it's tone is different than others of the sort, I think Raimi's films have a lot more to them. I simply just don't know why a reboot happened.",Null,3,5,23 March 2012
Jarhead," Pretty good
","In terms of entertainment, I can't give this anything less than an 8. It gets the job done well. It also has very good acting. Saarsgard is very effective as the main supporting character, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives another very good turn in a career already full of them, although he would prove to be able to give even better turns in meatier material later on in his career (like in 2014's Nightcrawler). The film's technical aspects are very good. When it comes to the themes and what it's trying to say, that's when it gets to be a little too murky, and whereas it's pretty much flawed. But considering the reviews, I had low expectations and so maybe that's why I was as pleasantly surprised as I was.",Null,1,3,11 January 2015
Dunkirk," One of Nolan's best
","I've always had problems with Nolan. He uses too much exposition, it feels like he makes things overly complicated for pretense, and he just seems to overstuff his films with more and more (the last film that didn't suffer from this was Memento). Here, he finally makes a film that seems to go out of its way to not touch on any of those things. The premise is simple and we are out in the middle of various characters at wartime. Many scenes go on without dialogue. Further, this is one of his shortest films, definitely in quite a long time. I don't think it's a perfect film (sometimes the mostly effective score seems a bit much and at times the film would benefit from not jumping back and forth between story lines). However, the more simple approach taken here actually elevates his characters to become actual human beings rather than thematic symbols, which is also something that he has suffered from in the past. It's not an overly emotional film at all, but I found myself more emotionally invested in these characters than I have in previous films. The ending montage seems like it was a bit overdirected, but other than that I left the theater feeling quite satisfied. only time will tell how my feelings change (and with Nolan films, many times they do).",Null,7,15,26 July 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Powerful and exhilarating! One of the best fantasy films ever made
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is without a doubt one of the best fantasy films ever made. Yes, it is a Harry Potter film, but the first two look like TV films compared to this. The special effects are amazing, much better, the cinematography is beautiful, the direction much more confident and focused. Alfonso Cuaron was the best thing that ever happened to this series, and I miss him. Technically, it is one of the best achievements of the decade. The acting, for the most part, is brilliant. Wonderful performances from the adult cast, and most of the child actors. Daniel Radcliffe is weak at times, but he gets better as the series goes along. The writing is superb as well. Nothing but praise for this film, and I think it is a shame that some people think of Harry Potter as some fanboy film series, where it really is something magical (well, besides the first two). I really need to rewatch Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix to see where they stand, but one thing is certain. Alfonso Cuaron's direction was the best this series ever had, and this film is the most beautiful and visually stunning of the Potter films.",Null,0,1,5 July 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man," Better than I expected
","It's not that I thought the film would be bad that I had never seen it until now. I just didn't think it would be anything more than merely OK. As it is, it's in the same level as the first Raimi one. Andrew Garfield makes a fantastic Spider-Man, for me this is the most obvious improvement. I also liked this film's origins and backstory, since it also takes longer for Parker to develop himself as Spider-Man and because of this the action takes longer to develop. But I think its the main villain that is the most obvious flaw here, and has nothing on Raimi's Green Goblin. Everything else though is on par and in many ways I prefer this version.",Null,2,4,15 June 2013
The Lego Movie," What glorious fun
","When I first saw the trailer for The Lego Movie, I thought that it would be one of the greatest ideas for a film. Sure, it sounds like a cash grab, but I definitely was hoping it would be something special, although I never really thought it would be. Then the reviews came, and my expectations were high. All in all, this is a wildly glorious ride. The thrill are non-stop, the dialogue is endlessly funny and witty, the animation wonderful. The voice performances are also really, each of these actors providing something different to their voices and making such a great ensemble of characters. I hope the sequel can bring as much fun as this.",Null,2,8,10 May 2014
Aliens," Outstanding action!
","After having seen Alien, I wanted to know in what way Aliens would follow up. Not surprisingly, it goes by what sequels go for- it's bigger and louder. This isn't to say it's a negative thing at all. The film started with the standard formula for action films. As it is, I wasn't feeling it in its first half very much. It definitely sounded like a James Cameron film. We have some uninteresting characters, one specifically who is the clich√©d 'masculine' female. Cameron is a much better director than writer, which is the reason why he makes up for its flaws in its second half. The action pieces here are outstanding! I don't remember such a film with as beautifully set-up set designs and visual effects as here in a long time. The action here is, excuse me for it, but out-of-this-world. You can definitely see all of the amazing work put into building this world and then having that final climax take place. Overall, I was ready to say that this film is easily inferior to the first, but by the end I can only say it's a little inferior. Sure, it has a lot of the usual mediocre dialogue and characterization and a lot of the 'formulaic' plot turns, but hey, it's so hard to really hold that against it because as it is, this is a great film. Now, is Alien 3 worth it?",Null,1,4,20 March 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Amazing acting
","I liked this film quite a bit, but it really belongs to Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Both are absolutely amazing in their roles, but Matthew impressed me more simply because I haven't thought he's been great in any of his other recent performances. In fact, I'd thought people were overrating him, but he completely disappears in this. He owns the role, through and through, and instantly makes Ron likable in spite of how he starts off. I really have nothing else to say, the script and directing are pretty good but the film wouldn't be anything without these two central performances. Garner was decent, although I would have liked a more capable actress in the role.",Null,2,3,4 January 2014
The Exorcist," One of the greatest achievements in Cinema history
","The Exorcist is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. It reinforced so many ideas, and it shocked millions. But even though the film is mostly known for the 'demon girl', the film itself is a great character study. The characters are so well fleshed out, especially Father Karras. Jason Miller really gives a very subtle performance. The performances by Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair are also phenomenal. The acting as a whole is very strong. The screenplay is so fully layered out, and I was surprised. The direction and cinematography is just brilliant. The film has some incredible shots and scenes. But for those horror fans expecting full entertainment might look someplace else. This is a really moral and deep emotionally haunting film. The first half is sort of slow, but I loved all the development and progress that was done in order to get where the film was going. Overall, The Exorcist is simply one of the best horror films ever made, and perhaps the most haunting of them all. Deserves all of it's praise very much",Null,2,3,6 April 2009
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Time in a Bottle!
","I think this is decent, pretty good even. I like it a little less than First Class, which was somehow funner and more entertaining despite having more flaws in its script. It's good fun, mostly, and it's pretty entertaining for the most part. The cast is fine, but James McAvoy is the one that really stands out in a better way than the rest, infusing something into his role that he didn't in the first. Lawrence continues to also elevate the role, despite not really looking like what the role requires. The stand out scene is easily Time in a Bottle, and Evan Peters the best of the supporting players. So yes, this is barely recommended, not great but decent.",Null,0,1,16 August 2014
Captain America: Civil War," A step in the right direction
","I thought it really was a lot better than I had initially expected. Despite it being swarmed with characters, it never felt overwhelming or bogged down in exposition or anything. The central political conflict was given a lot of weight and significance. The first half of it was simply brilliant, very reminiscent of The Dark Knight. Then some flaws started showing up in its second half. One of the things I've gotten so tired of with Marvel is the insistence of pretty much every film of theirs to be bogged down with comedy. That's something that I appreciated about the previous two Captain America films, even if only the 2nd one was good. Here, I never felt like humor started appearing... until the build-up and the first battle scene between the Avengers in the airport. All of a sudden, all of them started giving funny one-liners and sarcastic quips. Were the lines bad? Not at all, but with everything else going on, and considering they were now in a physical battle with their own friends, it just felt like a complete betrayal to the tone and the heft of the whole thing. I loved Holland as Spiderman, but an article that is floating online said is best- he was great in it and it excites me for his own films, but he had no business being in this film or being introduced at all. He and Ant-man, among a few others, just lighten the whole thing up at the exact moment when it should have gotten even more serious. Luckily, the film goes back on track after this battle scene. The battle scene itself isn't bad at all so I don't think it hurts the film significantly, but it does sort of try to change the tone and I don't think that was the right call. Overall, as flawed as it is and as someone who is not really a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe at all, this was really great.",Null,5,10,8 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Lovely
","I have to say that while watching it, I found it filled with flaws. There seemed to be many structural problems, some pacing issues, and it suffered from being a little messy. Definitely a lot of things to nitpick. However, it still fared very well with me. The experience was one filled with a lot of joy and wonder, which is what these films are supposed to induce. As flawed as it was, I realized that I did form an emotional connection to the film and to its characters. The main foursome is a really strong batch of characters and I would be glad to join them on any adventure. So after seeing several reviews where disappointment was the recurring theme, I actually found this to be a bit better than that. A great film? Probably not. But a very good one indeed and a more than solid start to this franchise.",Null,0,2,21 November 2016
Saw III," Wicked and gruesome entertainment! Almost as good as the original
","The Saw franchise gets so much hate. The films get hate for being 'torture porn', and while I liked it a lot, if I had to label any film that, it would be Saw III. The opening scenes, the one involving Detective Matthews, the one with the man in chains, and the one with Kerry's final scene, are all probably the most disgusting, gruesome, disturbing scenes ever in a horror film. I was flinching so much, and maybe the strong opening is what got a lot of critics mad, and from then on, they decided not to like it. I actually had that same attitude. While Saw was disturbing, but did not show much, and the sequel more gruesome, none of them ever came close to the torture scenes in Saw III, and so I was prepared to hate it. But as the film went on, I noticed how different it was from Saw II. I loved the mystery and tension in the original, and while Saw III does not compare, I actually think it comes close to being just as good. Saw III is actually a much better film than Saw II, which I would never have imagined. Saw II goes the formulaic way of horror films, with a group of people trapped in a scary house, each getting killed one by one. Saw III is not like this. It revolves around two stories, and giving us more information on Jigsaw and how Amanda came to be his assistant. It is all very interesting, and while I thought Bahar Soomekh was the weakest, I found Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell are very strong actors. They completely made these characters be what they are, and while we had already seen Tobin Bell's great acting in Saw II, we had not seen Smith this important before. She really creates a very compelling and scary character. Her facial expressions, her moods, she gives one heck of a performance, and good for her! Towards the end, the film does become more messy, but I loved it all! The signature twist did not disappoint, although we can hardly be shocked or surprised as much as in the original Saw because we know every time there is a Saw film, there will be a twist at the end. But props to this film, I can see the reason many critics hate it is because of the gruesome and bloody torture scenes, but the film does have central themes about human nature that doesn't make it a brainless horror film. Saw III is actually better than Saw II, and almost as good as the original! Now, I have to see the next installments!",Null,1,3,17 October 2009
Spirited Away," Fatastical
","Who hasn't heard about Spirited Away? It's commonly referred to as one of the best animated films ever, if not the best ever. Well, I expected a more formulaic film regardless and what I got here is like a series of really fantastic, wonderfully unique, colorful segments. The animation is beautiful but so is the screenplay, so vividly written with very memorable characters. It's definitely like My Neighbor Totoro in that respect. The dialogue is charming and sort of dark, as is the film, but there's many moments of subtle humor that never relies on too much gags or easy comedy. I really loved this and the hype was warranted, it just too me too long.",Null,0,3,13 January 2014
The Conjuring 2," Decent, but mostly forgettable
","I thought this was decent enough. It pretty much follows the same formula as the first film, but honestly, this did not need to be over two hours long. They overdo the set-up in the first hour. There's so much repetitiveness in its jump scares and horror scenes. By the time the second hour does come along, it also overdoes it to an even larger extent. A lot of scenes kept making me roll my eyes. It also seems that despite wanting to make Patrick Wilson's character more important, it managed to restrict Vera Farmiga's character. Despite following much of the formula of the original film, this still felt really cluttered and messy. It spins its wheels a lot. Despite the many criticisms I have of it, it did manage to entertain me. I don't think the original film is entirely greatness by any means, but it was still better than this.",Null,0,0,1 September 2016
Jackie," Mesmerizing, dreamlike, and powerful.
","I'm not really familiar with Pablo Larra√≠n's work. I hadn't seen any of his other films prior to watching Jackie. And yet I was still very excited for it because it sounded like something that was absolutely my cup of tea. Hearing reports that Academy members weren't liking it very much, and then hearing exactly why (because it wasn't your usual biopic and seemed to be more 'out there' than most biopics) just got me more excited. It didn't disappoint at all. It was basically everything I wanted it to be. One of the finest, truest character studies of the year, completely driven by explorations into Jackie Kennedy's psyche. That sounds kind of pretentious, but I do think this film more than any other of the year deserves to be described that way. I would absolutely not be surprised if the Academy doesn't go for this at all, but I do wish it was popping up in more critic awards than it has been. More than any other film of the year it rests completely on its lead actress. Portman is just completely engaging and mesmerizing, and she adds to the film's poetry-like storytelling. Having seen both Portman and Emma Stone, I would be surprised if they gave the Oscar to Stone simply because Portman is basically her entire film and she's also completely immersed into the character in a way that Stone doesn't need to be. The latter's role may just be too light. Regardless, it's a performance to be talked about and remembered. I appreciate when I leave a film feeling as though there's still so much left to unpack and to uncover about it, meaning that I wasn't able to completely discover all of its aims and goals in one viewing. To me that's the sign of a very well thought out film, a film that will leave a lingering impact. That's exactly how I came out of this. I'm sure not everyone here will take to it, but count me as one of its fans.",Null,65,99,25 December 2016
Tropic Thunder," Very disappointed
","The first 10 minutes of Tropic Thunder are hilarious! I mean, it had a great start. The film also had a lot of brilliant and funny scenes scattered throughout, but they were rare, and ultimately the film was a huge disappointment. I got the satire, but I expected a more effective execution of it, and the parody as well. What I got was a surprisingly pretty mainstream comedy with a lot of action in it. The first half at least felt somewhat entertaining. The 2nd half lost me completely. I was just waiting for it to end. It was that dull. Downey Jr. of course held up many scenes, but there's so much he could do. I hated Jack Black in it as always, and Tom Cruise was not nearly as funny as some people (including himself) make out his scenes to be. Overall, a heavy disappointment, and pretty mediocre when it comes down to it. Why can't more comedies (which I am not a huge fan of) explore and dwelve into more complex events, like for example the far superior and deeply underrated Observe and Report? I do want to say that I really liked the final 5 minutes though.",Null,2,4,6 November 2011

The performances are just fantastic, especially Brie Larson and Chris Evans in their sort screen time who sort of steal the show. This is just so much fun, manic and extreme to levels that most films these days wouldn't even begin to try to reach. Just fantastic stuff.

It could have been a disaster, and the whole over-the-top princess obvious tone could have gotten annoying, but Adams always remains likable. In that respect, she's the main reason to see this. The story could have used a little more cleaning up, and a lot of times the script feels like it's rushing to get to the inevitable finale. But there are a lot of great jokes and individual scenes throughout that makes it more than worthwhile. Check this one out with the whole family, you'll enjoy it.",Null,0,0,21 November 2012

I also get why he was under 'supporting' but I would consider him to be a lead. The film has some great music, and has a style that is very much pretty interesting to watch. Also, seeing Giancarlo Esposito from TV's Breaking Bad was pretty great.The twist wasn't all that shocking, but maybe that has to do with the fact that I had read something about it before.

","This was a joy to watch. The emotion is definitely there, mostly because it comes in a way that all of us can really relate to, in terms of specific scenarios that we are seeing play out on the screen and remembering when they happened in our own lives. This was a good film... but just one day later, and I'm liking it less and less. I think the overall theme and the beginning and ending is fantastic. But I think its second act proves to be really problematic. The film starts to have things happen for the sake of entertainment and humor, without really having a purpose to the overall storyline. This happens with all children's films, but for some reason it was more noticeable here. Some of the humor was kind of childish in a way that's more immature than anything.

It didn't help that I disliked Amelie... A LOT. So I had already started seeing this with low expectations, but it eventually grew on me, and I gave into its charm. The wonderful, BRILLIANT music had me falling for it, and the realism it had while they played. I wouldn't say this film is incredible, but the music made it work completely.

Saying that however, it's still a pretty fun film for what it's worth. Daniel Craig is better here than in Casino Royale and he's blended in to the role very nicely and has added more gravitas. I do think this one disappointed fans with good reason, and it's definitely just an action film and doesn't feel as mature as Royale, or as the new Skyfall.",Null,0,4,18 May 2013
Gone with the Wind," Truly one of the greatest films ever made
","Having seen Casablanca earlier and liking it enough, I decided to give Gone with the Wind a go. After all, tonight I had six hours to spare, and seeing how long it was, this would be one of the only recent times where I would be able to watch it in the comfort of my own home without anyone to bother me. Well, I put off watching it this long because it never seemed that interesting. As it turns out, I fell in love with it.The film's plot summary doesn't do it enough justice. This is really the tale of a woman in the turn of the Civil War and onwards. It is interesting to note that it's told from the perspective of her and many others living in the South, and the historical background of the film also gives it a deeper meaning. It's intriguing to see the different events in history take place, but also how they affect a small group of characters. But the film is essentially a character study of Scarlett O'Hara. Because of the iconic scenes already known all too well, even I knew the infamous ending line said by Gable, and also how the lead female was, 'unlikable', to say the least. But I thought a film with a female like this would center on the male, and then be about how he meets her. Much to my surprise, it is the female's story, and how she meets several people throughout this time. It is her film, and it's not until about two-thirds into the film that Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) becomes a lead character. Since I don't want to get into much of the plot and actual events that take place, I want to talk about the performances. The supporting cast is fantastic. Olivia De Havilland and Hattie McDaniel give the film the two most noble and giving characters, in their own ways of course. I knew McDaniel looked familiar, and sure enough she's the famous first- time African-American winner. She's fantastic really, nothing else to be said. But It's Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh that are the film's central power and focus. Vivien Leigh gives the single greatest female performance I have ever seen, and no, I don't use that term lightly. I have never seen her in any other film, but she's completely mesmerizing here. All of her flawed traits also make the character the best female character I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing on screen. One doesn't know if we should like her or not, but damn is she a joy to watch. She isn't merely 'acting' here, she embodies the character in a way that feels completely effortless. Because the film's script gives her a whole lot to work with, she injects humor, sadness, frustration, empathy, and even sympathy, maybe all at once. Every single facial expression, every single gesture is easily visible and perfectly portrayed. And really, it's not such an easy character to bring to the screen. In order for this to work, even if we don't like her all the time, we must still feel something for her and be intrigued by her. Leigh doesn't fail once. Clark Gable has a much more sympathetic character to work with, and he also does it naturally. His charm, wit, and humor mixed with the darker moments in his role create perhaps the best romantic male lead ever on screen. The way he sees Scarlett, the way that he communicates with her in the first two hours are refreshing and unique, to say the least.Like I mentioned before, the characters, and the script of course, are really grade-A stuff. Technically, it's also amazing. From the opening shot to the last, it sweeps you off your feet. You have probably seen many single shots of the film many times before, but all in the context of it they all work perfectly. It's really impossible to find any glaring flaw in the cinematography, or even the incredibly passionate and soaring music score. The editing is brilliant, and must be congratulated for making a nearly 4-hour film go by so quickly. I know someone saying that seems like an exaggeration, but it's really not. It's incredibly entertaining for the simple reason that it's just so incredibly interesting and intriguing.I did take a long time to see this, and normally epic films like this don't ignite anything in me, but this did... oh, it really did. The only other time that a classic film that was deemed among the 'greatest ever' left me speechless by the end was 2001: A Space Odyssey (which I do consider my favorite film). Oh, and what about that ending? One of the best endings ever, and that final line is as perfect as I could hope for. Don't put off watching it like I did, you won't regret it. One of the greatest films ever made, indeed.",Null,2,4,8 March 2012
No Country for Old Men," A tense and absorbing Masterpiece
","No Country For Old Men was deserving of all the praise and awards it got back in 2007. While I did root for other films of that year to win Best Picture, like Atonement or There Will Be Blood, with a repeat viewing of NCFOM, this is just under those films, if not right on par with them. The screenplay is very meaningful and thought-provoking as it is tense and thrilling. This is a Western thriller, a subtle but very absorbing film. The lack of a soundtrack really adds to the film's tension, and we are more concentrated on all of the little things that happen. The Coen brothers have only made one other film in the past that had really surprised me, and that was Fargo. While I still am not sure which is better, I think both are Masterpieces and deserve to be classics for years to come.The performances in the film are strong. Most notably, Javier Bardem. His performance won him an Oscar, and very deserved. He gives a creepy and subtly controlled performance, and makes a villain like no other since Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs (and since then, Heath Ledger has also joined that list). Kelly Macdonald and Tommy Lee Jones were also pretty amazing, the former giving one of my favorite supporting female performances of 2007. Josh Brolin is strong, but his role requires less of a big acting challenge than Jones or even Macdonald I would think. Woody Harrelson was great in his small screen time, and he made the best of it. The cinematography is perfect, as you would think from the guy who also shot the amazingly beautiful The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.What I also love about this film is that simple meaning of violence in this country. The film's opening monologue by Jones, and his closing scene proves that this really was his story, and also the reason for the unresolved plots. While I was one of the few that was frustrated by the final scene in the film, I can truly appreciate it now. No Country For Old Men is a great film, powerful and absorbing!",Null,2,4,2 October 2009
District 9," The key action Science Fiction film of the decade
","Distict 9 is a true cinematic treat. As the trailers show, it has a documentary feel to it. It has very fast editing, and that is what makes it intriguing from the opening scene. The creatures are amazing. The effects and realism that they bring is something that is rare upon films these days, and while this film does bring up some memories of other films like Transformers(effects-wise, not quality wise thank god) and Cloverfield, the effects in this film go beyond of those films. The story is a conventional action film, where you have your hero and then the side character, in this case the extraterrestrial, but the film executes the story in a more unique and rare way. The editing, the camera-work, and the documentary style all raise it up above other action/ sci-fi films of this decade. Sharlto Copley gives a great performance, and he creates a character we feel for. The sound effects in this film remind me of the sound effects of Cloverfield. AMAZING! And I think the sound effects in this film are even better, because of the sound of the alien language and their communication. Just amazing. This reminds me of those classic alien VS Man films, and it is sure to become a sci-fi classic.",Null,1,3,19 September 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A strongly acted, beautiful Cinematic Masterpiece.
","To start of with, I will talk about the film itself. It is not just original, and different than what we usually see, but it had hidden meanings to each scene. A lot of people first talk about how it is so 'slow paced', but I, for one, think it is one of the best paced films ever. It's pace allows us to dig deeper into the story, and to have more feelings and thoughts, and also to allow us to see the characters developing. The screenplay is very effective, and if I had to pick the most realistically talked film of 2007, this would be it. As the title says, the screenplay does take it's time to gather into more and more complex issues, and until the 'bang' finale.The screenplay is also helped by the strong acting in this film. As you can see in the awards page, Casey Affleck got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role. Well, let me tell you, when you are watching him, you cannot really tell if his performance is Oscar-worthy or not. The reason is not because he wasn't good enough, but because it is so realistic, it almost doesn't seem like acting. His performance is so subtle, and I can see he took brave decisions too. I am glad he got the attention he deserved, and I also think he deserved to win the Oscar. Another performance that was just as effective in it's own way was Brad Pitt's. His performance as a bandit leader is also so well done, it is hard to really ungrasp from it. I believe he was underrated, and he did not get the attention he deserved(especially since he has never acted like this before). Sam Rockwell, who plays Charley Ford, also stays on top.The reason this film is so beautiful is not only because of it's screenplay and acting, but because of its absolutely gorgeous cinematography. I believe it should have won the Oscar(even though another magnificent film, There Will Be Blood won). It's cinematographer,Roger Deakins, really knows how to keep an impact. This film is probably the first to open my eyes to cinematography. It is probably the best I have ever seen. It is that effective. Not only was the cinematography great, but the Original Music Score was just as great. This is an aspect that I thought it was also greatly ignored at in the Academy Awards. The reason it could not get an Oscar nomination, or even be in the running, was because it had two composers. That is a real big shame, because I thought that all the music pieces done are absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing, and only support the tone of the film.This film is not only a masterpiece of this time, but I think that when it came out, it never got the attention it deserved. The director, Andrew Dominik, must be one of the smartest I have seen. He made the film what it was overall, and I think that in 50 years, the Academy Awards will be looking upon it as their 'one big miss'. Not only will they look at it, but other critics and fans will look upon it too. It is a film that gets better with repeated viewings, and one that deserves enormous praise.",Null,3,6,21 May 2008
Toy Story 4," Absolutely fantastic.
","This was a fantastic, fantastic film. Although there are some more noticeable flaws than in past TS films (the handling of Buzz being the biggest flaw, as I thought it was a downgrade to his character), I think the highs of the film are up there with the highest highs of the entire franchise. The same trademark humor, dialogue, and emotion is in this film as we've come to know from the past, with perhaps even funnier scenes than in past films. The adventure at its core is handled brilliantly, and the new characters are incredibly well-developed and have some of the best arcs of the franchise (Gabby as an example). With that, however, comes a much smaller role with the characters from the past we've come to know and love, although this seems fitting in a way considering the way the film ends. This is Woody's story through and through, even more than in past TS films. Although many thought this would be un unnecessary films considering the perfect conclusion of the third film, this story that serves as an epilogue actually does feel necessary now that all is said and done. At least for Woody's character, it closes his arc beautifully, in a way that opens another chapter in his life. In many ways this really would be the final ending, but it could also serve as a new beginning for its main character and I could see them continuing the franchise (although I really, really hope they would stop).As another note, Bo Peep is such a great character but she also seems completely different from how we knew her in the first films (and I don't just mean after all of the years have passed, but even in the scenes that take place in the past).",Null,93,174,25 June 2019
Batman Begins," The darkest, deepest, most mysterious Superhero film ever!
","Well, I had heard great things about it, ans since I want to see The Dark Knight later in July, I decided to view it...Yes, it is based on a DC superhero, but this film is certainly anything but 'a fun action blockbuster'. The film starts off with a Bruce Wayne, and it keeps going, so as the audience can see a bit of Bruce's past. I thought these scenes, giving Bruce a lot of development as so we can care about him, they were very well done. They have a certain different 'tone' than other blockbusters, and certainly different than other great Marvel superhero films like Spider-Man and Iron Man. I cannot compare it to those, because I found those to be perfect blockbusters. They were fun and were greatly-written. This film, is really not just fun. From the beginning, it starts off deep. Bruce Wayne is certainly thought over before the film was made, and since I have never read a Batman comic before, I cannot compare it. This film is more about the meaning of one man. It is about self-discovery(reminded me of Spider-Man 2's theme).BUT it is not just about that. The film explores into a deeper meaning, among a huge city called 'Gotham'. The struggles that this city is going through, a certain 'depression', the film explores human motives. This is where the crime takes place. Never before had I seen this type of film really go into crime a lot. Unlike other Marvel films, there is no really 'one villain' that the superhero has to fight. There is more like interwined crimes taking place. The film explores crimes that go in a city, crimes that have to do with mind-manipulation and court orders. I found myself thinking about Tom Wilkinson's role in 'Michael Clayton'. I thought his role here was a bit similar. And just like in Michale Clayton, he gives a very good performance. As a matter of fact, everyone gives a great performance. Liam Neeson starts strong in the beginning of the film, and other criminals, that include Cillian Murphy, also surprised me. Cillian Murphy, I believe, is a very underrated actor. Christian Bale gives all his best for the role of Bruce Wayne. He really portrays his deep meanings and thoughts well, as his character changes throughout. Morgan Freeman does a very nice job, his character is sort of not as 'dark' as the others. The only person who I was spectacle about was Katie Holmes. She wasn't a bad actress, but in her first scene, her voice annoyed me. But as the film continues, I got used to it. She did a nice job, and we could really feel for her. Of course, the reason the actors are great is because of the amount of quality in the screenplay. Sure, it did seem a bit 'comical' at times, but hey, it IS based on a comic book, and it was still very dark oriented. I liked that this film had a lot of deep meanings. It stands out from other action films, because it really is about something else. It works as a thriller very well too. So many scenes rely on suspense. It is also a mystery, and the important thing, is that it keeps us hooked. And it does!!! It does not have a lot of unrealistic action scenes. All the action scenes are very well done. If the Academy Awards had a category for Best stuntwork(it should) this film would win it. There were really not many visual effects. I'm glad it did not rely on it so much. Films don't need so much of it to be good, as this film proves. All in all, this is one of the best action films I have ever seen. I have to say, it ranks up there with Spider-Man 2 as the best superhero film ever, and maybe, in terms of long terms, it might win after some time. After seeing this film, I cannot wait for The Dark Knight!!!! It looks even darker and deeper, and in this Batman world, that is really what me and more fans are looking for in terms of quality...",Null,2,2,21 June 2008
The Fault in Our Stars," Shailene Woodley is amazing
","Not as bad as I expected from the trailer, not as good as I had hoped after seeing the reviews. It's not all that great, but it's not bad either. It's shamelessly, even overly sentimental, totally unsubtle, but hey, it works somewhat most of the time. Probably the biggest reason for this is Shailene Woodley. I remember thinking she was really impressive in The Descendants, even in her limited screen time. Then I saw her in The Spectacular Now, and yes, I became a bigger fan. She's pretty amazing here, an actress completely capable of naturally selling the roles she plays, without making them ever feel artificial or contrived. I wish her a long, very successful career, and when it comes to certain things, she's better than the current it-girl Jennifer Lawrence. Ansel Elgort doesn't fare as well. He has some good scenes, but somehow he just comes across pretty unconvincing.",Null,6,11,18 August 2014
Climax," What a living nightmare feels like
","Wow, this was an intoxicating experience. It's by no means flawless. Some of the snippets of the conversations between the characters went on for far too long. I would agree with Jack that the character work wasn't very strong, but I also felt that it didn't need to be. We got a very surface level look into the characters and for this film that was enough. Amazing dance sequences, cinematography, and sound design. Some of the directorial choices (e.g., the opening 'end credits,' the name titles appearing in the middle of the film, the ending) I wasn't sure how to feel about, but it certainly made the entire thing even more interesting. Overall, it literally felt like the film experience of what a 'living nightmare' would be like. Certainly an experience to remember. Also, very strong acting. The entire cast was up to the task and they delivered.The only other Gaspar film I had seen was Enter the Void, and while I thought that was a worthwhile experience, it went on for far too long and is not nearly as enjoyable as this.",Null,0,0,17 March 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Fantastic!
","I was supposed to be be seeing either Flight or Argo today, but to my disappointment I missed both showtimes, and I was in a tight time frame where I could see anything. So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.Wreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how 'pretty' this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. Overall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it. Highly recommended.",Null,242,263,2 November 2012
Bridesmaids," Entertaining
","So after receiving rave reviews I decided to see Bridesmaids. It was a very good comedy. It was VERY funny and had some stand-out scenes. The comedy's success comes forward because of Kristen Wiig. I had already mentioned that she was by far the best cast member in Saturday Night live, but not only is she great at the comedy but she also gives a heartfelt character. Melissa mcCarthy was also enjoyable, as was Rose Byrne who was freakin HOT. Overall, I was pleased with this comedy. My complaints would be that while it is a very funny film, there is nothing that stands out as original in its storyline and it is rather formulaic when the plot is looked at. Still, definitely enjoyable and worth a watch.",Null,0,2,9 October 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Solid start
","I certainly wasn't expecting much of The Hobbit's first entry. Having a book be split up in three films and having that fact be the main criticism of many seemed like it would surely lag. To my surprise, I never really found any of the film boring. It just doesn't come close to reaching the film-making heights that any of the Lord of the Rings films reached. If anything however, this first entry does make us care about our new characters, in particular Martin Freeman. If there's one thing this is better in than any of the Lord of the Rings films, it's in its first lead character. Maybe that has more to do with Freeman being better than Wood, but he brings so much to the role. He's the MVP here and you quickly learn to love Bilbo Baggins in this stage. Solid first entry.",Null,1,8,2 January 2013
Before Sunset," Excellent film with completely engaging characters and dialogue
","Yesterday my Film Teacher at my university showed us the first 20 minutes of a film I had never heard of before- Before Sunset. Those first 20 minutes really had me engaged. I immediately sought out to see the film. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have created one of the best pairings I have ever seen in a film. I don't know if they are great actors, but their chemistry and connection on screen was completely magnificent. These were definitely great performances, and that's because it didn't feel like acting. The only other film I have seen that moved me this much was 2007's Once. It all feels natural and real, and some of the best dialogue I have ever heard in a film. Ultimately, this is a true example of a romantic film. Heck, not sure if I can even call it that, but as far as filmmaking goes characters and dialogue doesn't get any more intriguing than this. What a wonderful, wonderful film! I wonder if the original is this good? (also to know how incredible that this is a sequel and a perfect example of how sequels can work). That ending was perfect as well.",Null,0,1,19 October 2011

However, it suffers from the same thing the first did, and that's a pretty formulaic script, Sure, I'm not expecting something ground- breaking for a kids' film, but this one is just way too by-the-numbers. Still, it's very enjoyable and entertaining, even if it recycles some of the same themes from the first. It's 'bigger', but I'd still argue that the first film had more emotional resonance and a simpler, but tighter, script. This isn't better than The Lego Movie, but it gets the job done, and is rather underrated.",Null,1,5,1 September 2014
The Pianist," Shocking and well-made
","Polanski himself has had experiences with this event in history, so I'm just surprised he waited this long to have a film of an account. The film as a whole is intriguing from the start, with characters that I really identified with. The whole film is superbly-made, and the brutality is shocking and effective. I would be lying if I said that there weren't some moments that left me a bit bored, but the ending of the film makes up for a lot of that. Roman Polanski beautifully directs this with his own pace and tone that definitely helps this film. Now, to Adrienn Brody's 'infamous' Oscar win... very inspired, but personally I don't think his performance was anything incredible. Instead, it was subtly effective. It wasn't a transformation, but for this type of performance to be rewarded is pretty great, even though I myself don't think he was his that incredible or anything.

The distinct voice and style that he put in those films is very present here, but for some reason it just didn't connect with me nearly as much. The production design, the music, the visual imagery, it's all rather amazing, should get a ton of Oscar nominations in the technical categories... but while I did enjoy the film to a degree, it also felt detached. It felt like I was watching with a wall in between, so while I could very much appreciate it and even enjoy it, it feels like I should've loved it even more.

What a delicious delight!I'm not going to reveal any of the plot, but I highly recommend this one to horror fans. It's the most hilarious horror I have seen in quite some time, and it gleefully bounces off horror clich√©s to make them wonderfully twisted and so much fun. The cast is pretty great in that they know their purpose, they understand the humor in the screenplay, and they deliver it well. I strongly can't recommend this enough. It reminds me of the recent The Cabin in the Woods, but an even funnier version. It's so satisfying when a horror film comes out and amazes me this much.",Null,1,1,11 August 2012
Revolutionary Road," A beautiful, well-crafted Masterpiece. One of the best of the decade
","Revolutionary Road is not a very joyful film, or is it easy to watch. Instead of being simply entertaining, it achieves what not many films these days do. It wants to be a learning lesson.This film is superbly crafted, in both the writing and the amazing direction by Sam Mendes. After his great film 'American Beauty', he comes back with strong will to do this project. His direction is the best of the year for sure. It feels so professional, so alive. The writing, both of the characters, Frank and April Wheeler, I feel they are so open and 3-dimensional characters, but the screenplay wants to let us inside their lives, and it does so with great passion. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Frank with such intensity, with such force. Dicaprio gives his best performance here without a doubt, since I don't really think he has ever done something like this before. Then there is Kate Winslet. My favorite actress, and certainly one of the most talented out there. Winslet has surprised me before in a lot of movies, but here, she surprises me in a whole other way. Her silent, unlikeable, and sometimes human and cold portrayal of April Wheeler is one of the best performances of the decade. She gives the best female performance of the year, and I truly hope she finally wins the Oscar she deserves.The film itself is so beautiful, so alive, yet at the same time, so dark to what the film is about. The cinematography is amazing, as well as the costumes and the whole set designs. The music, the original score, was so unsettling, perfectly balanced to what each scene brought.Revolutionary Road is not a film for everyone. I can definitely see some critics will hate it, but it should certainly be respected, for its ambition, for the things it accomplishes and every thing it portrays. I think this is Mendes' masterpiece. I have not seen a better made film this year.",Null,224,345,25 December 2008
Foxcatcher," Fantastic acting
","I want to start off by saying that I don't think the descriptions of this being too 'cold' or 'detached' are warranted at all. I mean, for a story like this, how else did people expect it to be told? Bennett Miller's directing is fine, could be really predictable in some scenes and the way the music soars over them, but could be really inspired and precise as well. It's the screenplay and the psychological dilemma between these three lead characters that drive the film and make it incredibly compelling. All three main performances are fantastic. Carrell's could've felt like a complete gimmick, but he makes it work to unbelievably, but quietly, intense heights. Ruffalo provides the effortless naturalism that he's so great at, and Tatum works in ways I would've never expected. It's a very understated performance, and whether everything he did was thought out or just came off that way, it was truly great work from him. Very intriguing film overall, but definitely sort of difficult to truly and deeply love.",Null,1,5,29 December 2014
28 Days Later...," One of the best horror films ever made
","28 Days Later is simply put, a brilliant film. It holds so many idea and thoughts in itself about the post-apocalyptic world, and about human survival and human extinction. It has some really amazing cinematography and direction. Danny Boyle directs the film with passion, with skill, and with will. I think this is very much a director's film. The different settings are very amazing. The writing is great, it allows us into these characters' lives. The film is very scary at what points it is trying to make. It is scarier in a realism way, in a way that only haunts us in our nightmares. The acting is great. Cillian Murphy proves to be a leading man. The film is also very bleak and dark, not just because it is a horror film, but also just in general. It is disturbing in a way that other horror films are not. It is realistic, and very hard to watch at times. Overall though, 28 Days Later is one of the best horror films ever made, simply put. It might just be Danny Boyle's greatest film.",Null,6,10,17 April 2009

The human characters are a bit too thin for my taste, but her it doesn't matter much. This is Cesar's story. Andy Serkis has done incredible motion-capture work in the past, and here is another great job. The studio has been working very hard for a campaign for him for an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor, and I REALLY hope he gets it. He does a fantastic job (although honestly, he is Leading, not supporting, but still, for a chimpanzee at least supporting). Still, a very good film with great action pieces, although I wish that the big climax in the city had started a lot earlier, or at least longer with the film.

The performances here are outstanding, but more importantly, fully- realized and they really make an impact. The directing here is pretty amazing, such a great handle at such a controlled artistic vision, very much influenced films like Slumdog Mllionaire in its style.

Just like Filth, it also doesn't come together all that well to the point that I would call it a great film, but it's definitely entertaining (more so than other films that could be considered better by many). The biggest reason that the film works is Tom Hardy, who really does an amazing job with either character and who might give some of the best acting of the year in either character, let alone having two to really dive deeply into such range.

Avengers: Infinity War," Very entertaining and well executed.
","Avengers Infinity War: So I thought it was really good. My concerns before it came out were about the possibility that it would feel overbloated and overstuffed. For the most part the film is able to juggle its various storylines well, although not perfectly all the time and it's definitely flawed. It wasn't an absolute homerun but it wasn't nearly as messy as it could have been. The action sequences are entertaining and it does feel like there are real stakes, something which is rare for these films. Now for the spoilers section: I think killing a character like Loki in the beginning was the right move. The Gamora arc was well handled, but it also felt like it could have been given even more meaning. The Vision arc was also well done. As for the entire final sequence where 'people at random' were killed, it doesn't ring true. If you really want to hit home the point that some people will randomly die and some people won't, don't have all of the main, original avengers (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk) stay alive while a lot of the lesser characters and new avengers fade away. I feel like all throughout the film the stakes felt real, but once this happened they didn't because of that same problem: the obvious characters stayed alive while the lesser characters (and a few main new avengers didn't) and additionally because it's clear that they will be coming back somehow. Having seen it, I am now less sure about the risks the writers are willing to take.As for the individual characters, I loved that Thor got more screentime than Captain America. I think with Ragnarok they now know he could become one of the favorite superheroes. Hemsworth is the most adept at handling the comedy/drama balance I feel, and it's great to see him finally being used for his full potential. Tom Holland was again impressive (his final scene with Tony was so well acted). Zoe Saldana was also one of the strongest in the cast, and she will be missed. As for characters not used as well, Peter Quill/Star Lord was dumbed down and made to be too much of comedy relief, to a point that it was out of character. Peter Parker was his complete contrast in that he was used very well and the comedy for him works, but for Quill it did not. Or maybe it's just my dislike for Chris Pratt shining through, but he's so annoying. Oh, and what does Black Widow do again? I feel like both in Civil War and here she's just... there. Here in particular, she has one of the main spots in the poster and in billing and yet she has no arc and does barely anything of note. Even Wanda/Scarlett Witch seems to have more screentime and a better arc. It just seems like the writers, after so many films, have still not figured out how to write Black Widow, and it's a shame they're underutilizing Scarlett Johansson.",Null,3,12,29 April 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Fantastic
","It's taken me this long to finally watch this. Oh, I've known about it for like a decade, but only now that I am in love with Ang Lee did I finally seek it out. What a fantastic film. Lee is the master here, his directing giving us some of the finest fighting sequences I think I have ever seen. The story is solid, as is the writing, but it's Ang Lee's vision and beautiful markings behind the camera that give this that extra boost. It's a truly fantastic experience, mesmerizing and captivating. And because I haven't seen any of the other martial arts fantasies that have come out because of this, it's pretty original in the films I've seen.",Null,1,1,1 March 2013

Behind The Candelabra," Good, great performances
","I've never really known anything about the events that happen during the course of the film, or anything about Liberace in fact. But I had definitely heard all of the praise it got at Cannes, and I do think it's a good film, just not a particularly great one. I don't think there's anything that makes it stand out in any way, and the only truly fantastic aspect of it is Douglas' performance. I have no idea how the real Liberace acts, but that doesn't really matter. Douglas created a fully- living character. Damon starts off not particularly anything, but he gets better and better as the film goes along, and both him and Douglas make some of the rough patches in the script work. Again, despite being based on real events, the arc here is pretty much a common one. I do think this is very much a worthy entry, and Douglas deserves accolades for his role here.",Null,1,6,28 May 2013
Beasts of No Nation," Riveting to a point, not flawless. Great acting
","Well, not exactly... I did like it overall, if maybe liked it a lot. But there was some disconnect between a lot of what I was feeling. Visually and directorially, I think it's a great achievement. Fukanaga really knows how to carry a scene, and he doesn't milk anything for sentimentality. Technically, the film is a marvel. But something about it was also making me doubt how much I was liking it. I was getting lost in its world and something kept nagging at me, and it wasn't until it was over that I sort of realized. Elba is great no doubt, but by making his character be the central conflict in the film, I feel like the film forgets what the real horror here should be, which is the war. It definitely comes down to the screenplay. There's nothing inherently bad about it, it's definitely not a bad screenplay by any means. But it also works around what its themes should be too easily. There's such a clear structure and formula at play here, and some of it (like I said previously, mostly revolving around Elba's character and the conflict there) just seems to rise from obvious tweaks and manipulations in the script. Yes, all filmmaking is a manipulation, but the key is to not make the audience notice. The second half of this especially felt like it was playing it too conveniently. I don't know how to exactly word what I am feeling, but all I know is that, thematically, what it did concentrate on should've been able to hit harder because of a connecting link to the atrocities of war and humankind. instead, that's not how the film comes across by the end. Something. just. didn't. click. Not to any totally debilitating manner, I still like the film. But something here wasn't handled as well as it should've.Yes, Elba is totally supporting and that should be his Oscar campaign. He makes the role work wonders, hiding some of the script's weaknesses. Abraham Atta is amazing though.Never overdoes any of it and the film is all the better for it. I definitely need to rest up more on my thoughts on this film to see if I have less (or more) of a problem than the one I mentioned here.",Null,5,9,18 October 2015
Gone Girl," Extremely unpredictable
","I have to start at the beginning with this one. Back when I saw Fincher directing this mystery, I totally assumed it'd be another Zodiac/The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo type of mystery- pretty straight-forward, very moody and dark, very beautifully shot. Heck, even two weeks ago I thought this. I thought it was just a simple woman-gone-missing case, and so the fact that Rosamund Pike was getting so much attention for it, for a possible Oscar nod, really blew my little mind. It wasn't until around a week ago or so that I accidentally got spoiled, and a pretty big one at that- that Pike played a villain, and that she was psychotic. Since it was unintentionally spoiled, I couldn't really get all upset but it did suck that now I knew a lot about it. Had I gone into the film completely blind, I would've been extremely shocked at every revelation. This is a really twisted film, in a way I don't think Fincher has made since Fight Club. Whereas I expected a very serious, very atmospheric mystery, I got a thriller that took quite a lot of turns, and was also very often pretty funny and quite often super silly and just so much fun. I don't mean that as a negative, since I think it really made for quite an experience. The audience I was watching it with really took to all of it, mostly in a way I'm sure most of them didn't expect. On the downside, I'm not sure how well this will fare with rewatches, since it's very heavily plot-driven. But going by how most of Fincher's films I loved even more with time, I'm not too worried about that. Technically, I don't think this is quite as showy as Fincher's recent outings. I was actually pretty surprised by how it wasn't driven by atmosphere and mood through cinematography in a way his last four films have. It's nicely shot, but this is the first time I wasn't marveling at just how beautiful a Fincher film looked. Maybe it was all of the plot turns that didn't have me focus so much on that? Regardless, surprising in that way, not that it matters so much. The score is wonderful, but definitely not as present as the scores for Social Network and Dragon Tattoo were. The editing is also strong, but not nearly as showy as his last two outings (if that's a good or bad thing, depends on you). I've never been a big Ben Affleck fan when it comes to his acting (like most people) but he's never been awful either. The only time he really impressed me was in The Town, but I think this is quite easily the best I've ever seen him do. He really strikes a perfect balance with the character and the tone the film is trying to achieve, so much so that I think he's in the same league as Rosamund Pike. It's true that Pike has a hell of character to work with, something I definitely didn't predict before getting spoiled. I thought she did great, but I didn't find her nearly as amazing as many seemed to Between this and The Leftovers, Carrie Coon is really having an amazing year. And like a few people here, I felt that she might actually be the film's MVP, being able to bring such an authenticity to a character that could've felt like such a caricature and bringing loads of emotional investment in her. Kim Dickens isn't that far behind, really delivering the most of her role in a way no other supporting player besides Coon did. I also want to highlight just how tonally weird the film is in the first half. I'm just super happy that this was not at all what I had expected weeks ago (not that that would've been a bad film). The fact that it came off as this weird, pretty funny, campy yet also serious satire and thriller is to be applauded, because I haven't seen many recent films like this.",Null,2,11,5 October 2014
Django Unchained," Hmmm
","Inglourious Basterds is in my Top 20 of all-time, and while I have always liked Tarantino (the only one I haven't seen is Reservoir Dogs) nothing apart from Basterds had come close to amazing me as much. Django Unchained looked like it could start a streak that started with his 2009 film. It certainly looked as great, with a great cast. Turns out that it's just sort of disappointing. Tarantino films always have his trademark style, always homages to genres. This is an entertaining film no doubt, but it just lacks the extra spark that made Basterds work so much. This is in part due to some weak pacing. The film lags at certain points, most notably the last act. It all should work more than it does, but it somehow doesn't. There's still enough here to make it work though, and that's thanks to some of the performers. Jackson is fun here, but there's nothing incredibly special about his performance. Dicaprio is also fun but to a higher extent. He makes the role work wonders, and although you always see Dicaprio acting, it's still enough to remind me of his great work from years ago. Christoph Waltz is the clear stand-out though. I've only seen him in Basterds and last year's Carnage and I had already become a fanboy of his. He nails this role to absolute perfection. He's just able to perfectly deliver lines in the way Tarantino absolutely intends, squeezing all of its juicy potential and making yet again another truly great character. If there's one aspect of the film that deserves tons of nominations and awards, it's Waltz. It's also somewhat of a borderline category performance. He certainly has the screen-time of a lead, but the last half of the film certainly tells us that it's really the film of Django... and there's the problem. Foxx has absolutely no charisma, no glowing screen presence. The character could have worked with someone better, but with Foxx it's such a middling character. Disappointment? Definitely, but this is still very much worth seeking out. As a whole it's just nowhere near as tight and controlled of a film as Basterds was, or as well-directed. But two of its actors are working at a higher command here, one of whom gives one of the best performances of the year.",Null,0,4,4 January 2013
Get Out," Surprising in its unflinching social commentary
","I think the biggest surprise of this film is just how deeply it really digs into the social commentary that is at its core. That drives the film's themes and it's what makes the genre thrills and horror work. The biggest thing that stood out to me was the absolutely fantastic ensemble cast. The film needs a certain type of acting in its first two acts in order to give enough suspense and enough detail as to what it's about, and the actors have a very clear idea of what the tone needs to be. They're pitch perfect in their work. The film is also very well directed and paced, and it's a total blast to sit through it with a large group of people. Definitely recommended.",Null,11,31,26 February 2017
Drive," Drive is a fantastic experience that works in a visual and intellectual level
","So I had been highly anticipating this film ever since I saw stars from my two favorite current shows Mad Men and Breaking Bad. I was even more excited for it when I saw some of the reviews. I can definitely say that this is the stand-out film of the year and as of now the best. There can be good blockbusters, good action films, good mainstream films. Many films have proved that. But watching Drive really makes you wonder where real patience in films have gone. This is definitely not a crowd-pleaser, and as I heard people getting restless and start yawning in a movie theater I got a little upset. It just really got to me how restless people can be. The pace in the film was established from the start, so that throughout it remained consistent and flowed smoothly. In fact, this is probably one of the most quiet 'action' films I have ever seen, if not the quietest. The silence and the hypnotizing pace all works brilliantly, with the incredible synthetic soundtrack in the background. It all works because of the director. The screenplay is simple and great, but the director was the one who really gave the film a tone unlike any recent film I have seen. The basic vision and style he gave the film makes it work from start to finish, even some really incredible slow-motion scenes (coming from someone who hates slow-mo). He is helped by a brilliant cinematographer who captures some of the most memorable scenes in years. If anything, Drive should be analyzed from a technical stand-point because in that department is is incredible. Here the film has substance, but its style also becomes part of its substance. I don't want to discredit the performances though, which were all great. Bryan Cranston and Christina Hendricks really played to the most that they were given. Ryan Reynolds was able to play this character completely serious and completely sympathetic, and Mulligan was as charming as ever. I really can't see any other film being able to pull of the tone that this film gave, in that of a neo-noir and art-house film put together with a retro drama/action film. A stand-out, yet simple, film that really makes you wonder about the real ambition and respect that other films don't have.",Null,5,11,24 September 2011
Insidious," A fun, old-fashioned, Haunted House Roller-coaster!
","The first minutes of Insidious made it look like what I had thought it would be. A decent-made horror film with decent thrills, although not very original. By the end I sorta was in love with this film, and here's why...The film's basic premise looks like another ghost story, but its actually not like that. As it goes on different images and figures pop up, which I thought was better than just having ghosts. While it's true the basic plot of the film is not very original, there's something quite original about how the film goes about it. I mean, I have not seen a horror film like this, if I recall, in any past years with a climax this 'overboard'. I say that in a good way. Yeah, the final act has been criticized for going overboard, but I thought it made the film stand-out even more. It really does have the tone of a roller-coaster. It sorta reminds me of The Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland.Ultimately, I strongly recommend this film. If anything, it is loving in it's ability to play with loud music, creepy, if not scary, images. I didn't find the film scary to be honest, but I had a blast with it, and there are so many 'odd' scenes that years from now I will be seeing over and over again on Youtube. I am surprised that it has done as well as it has with the mainstream moviegoers, since I would have thought they would have dismissed it as 'dumb', especially in the over-the-top approach at the end.",Null,3,7,26 April 2011
The Theory of Everything," Felicity Jones gives some very strong work
","There could've definitely been a better film made out of this story. I'm sure any way you spin it, you would've come out with a film that feels like formula all the way through, but I do think that the script could've been better in actually giving the arcs more emotional power. As it is, it sort of just goes through the motions, while still highlighting its sentimentality in a really obvious and sometimes overbearing way (and some of this is also due to the direction). And yet despite that, it's such an easy film to like. I enjoyed it, and I think the two leads definitely give it its effectiveness. As good as I thought Redmayne was, he wasn't particularly surprising. If you've seen the trailer or any clip, you sort of get the idea. There's just no other way a role like this could be played, technically. The thing is, Redmayne does everything he needs to and yet I wasn't particularly affected by him on an emotional level. Despite how showy the role looks on the surface, he's just sort of there. Felicity Jones is who I really loved. Without any hint of artificiality or trying to chew up the scenery, she's just so effective and has such a warm presence. It's with her that I felt the heart and soul of the film, not Redmayne, and I think she should totally be in line for an Oscar nomination. Definitely the best thing about the film",Null,2,5,22 November 2014
Frozen," Wonderful
","I've been hearing great things from preview screenings about this film for some time. While I don't think it's quite a masterpiece, it's a pretty great film in its own right. The characters are a blast, and the interaction between protagonist and the antagonist (Elsa) works as a great contrast. The music is lovely too, really enjoyable and there's not one weak number. If I had a complaint, it's the 'twist' near the end and the whole revelation of a new threat that comes out of nowhere and seemingly put on for there to be an actual 'villain'. It could have worked without it, but as it is, still a great animated film, the only of 2013.",Null,1,2,30 November 2013
The Lives of Others," Pretty intriguing
","The atmosphere that The Lives of Others creates is definitely impressive, it mounts and mounts even when there's no on-screen action happening. It's all below the surface, and in many ways it reminds me of an albeit faster-paced Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, although I didn't like it as much. The performances here are strong, especially the lead actor (who looks a lot like Kevin Spacey, even down to the mouth structure). I do think the final act loses a bit of steam and it's surprising in the tone it wanted to end on as a film, but overall I recommend this for those interested in delicately-paced, intriguing but absorbing thrillers of the kind.",Null,0,4,11 September 2014
Room," Fantastic, powerful
","The subject matter for something like this is already reason enough to know how emotionally taxing it will be as a whole. The film is cleverly built in two different halves, and I think that the best way to make each half work is by having the other in the film. I have not read the novel so this is by extension something it did, but it still worked wonders. The biggest reason to see it is definitely for Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson seems to be the front-runner to win the Oscar, which I actually think is a bit surprising because it's such an understated performance. As great as she is, Tremblay impressed me even more. There's such a realistic, genuine heart to his work here. At no point does it seem like he's even acting a part. He deserves an Oscar nomination for Leading Actor.",Null,3,11,17 December 2015
Schindler's List," Steven Spielberg's greatest Masterpiece!
","Well, first of all, this is not my usual type of film. I don't like watching such realistic films, since they really depress me. But since this is a universally acclaimed Oscar-winner, I decided to see it.This is a very realistic film. It deplicits the horror that Polish Jews went through, and I have never seen a film with such power. The film, I was glad, did not start off suddenly with the Jews, and throughout the film, we are able to look into characters' emotions and minds. A lot of character are seen in this film, and they are given development, so we can actually care about them. There were a lot of actors involved in this film, and the main actors, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, all do great jobs. They each make their characters unique. They each give their whole into it.The film has a lot to deal with. It really is a 'grand' film. The productions and the cost of all the actors and stunts must have been hard. In those scenes, scenes that we are able to see how disturbing Jews lived, those scenes are amazing. There are a lot of powerful ones, and we can surely distinguish them. The cinematography is simply amazing. Some of the best I have ever seen, the use of the camera, and the pacing etc. This is a very technical achievement as well. It really did look like we were witnessing real persons being tortured.Overall, this is simply a masterpiece. Yes, I thought it was a bit long. I actually felt a little restless in parts, and sort of dull, but I still recognized the achievement, and although I couldn't really follow in all the dialogue, I still appreciated it. That is what a masterpiece is. A work or art, a work of realism to give the audience. Everyone should see this film. You cannot help but feel a little distraught for all these people. The ending scene, with the actors walking with their real-life character portrayals, was simply emotional. It really gets to you. It is simply Steven Spielberg's greatest work he ever made.",Null,9,13,2 July 2008
The Mist," One of the most powerful Horror films ever made
","If you had told me that The Mist would turn out to be not just a great horror film, but a great movie overall, I would have laughed. The trailer for this film was laughable, and it looked like a Sci-Fi network film. But it turned out to be a very powerful film. The plot itself is simple, and I loved that the film knew what it was, and it took all advantage of it. It has really well done suspense, and it has great action scenes. But it also has some morality and religious themes that shine through. The performances were all great, for the most part. Thomas Jane is effective as David, as is Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden. But to me the most effective performance was Marcia Gay Harden. She commands the screen as Ms. Carmody, a very religious and very obsessed woman. I think her performance really is a wonder, even award worthy I must say. The direction actually started a little bit off for me. I did not like the 'real' feeling to it, nor the camera-work. But as the film went along, I really came to appreciate it and love it. It really worked. The lack of music I also very much appreciated. I really got into the suspense and the action, thanks to the lack of music, which really had an impact on the scenes. The writing also started off a little bit weak, but I came to realize thanks to the smart script we were given a sort of simple, yet truly remarkable story, but there was some lines here and there that were bad, but some that were really great and well-written.Now we come to the extremely powerful ending. I had heard a lot about the ending of this film, and I thought it would have something to do with the creatures or the story behind how the mist got there. But I was entirely wrong. It turned out to be a very realistic, a very humane ending. Like I said before, the film already had a lot of religious aspects about humanity and human ways. There was even a certain scene involving the sacrifice of a soldier lead by Ms. Carmody (which I thought was one of the strongest scenes in the film). I thought the ending really was so sad, a true shock. It also marks everything that was wrong with most people. The people in the car, who actually wanted to fight for their lives and had courage enough to go out and try to flee, were the ones that got screwed in the end, while the cowards who stood in the store, just refusing to learn the truth, were the ones who got to survive, is a real downer. But I think the ending works in a lot of different ways, and gives the film a bit more of balance.Overall though, I was very, very happy with The Mist. I think it is one of Stephen King's best adapted novels-to-films. I also am sure this will become a horror movie classic.",Null,1,4,7 April 2009
The Elephant Man," An honest and devastating film
","The Elephant Man is the only David Lynch film so far that I have seen that is completely straight-forward, and his only really heart-breaking film. The film is simple, but it is written and directed with the highest level of skill. The film is a very sad story of a man who was mistreated, and of course, such a film will be criticized as manipulative. I am not a big fan of 'sad' films that play with emotions. I prefer the dark, edgy mystery/crime films or thrillers that play with your head and not your heart, but I cannot deny that The Elephant Man is the best you can do without pushing me over the edge. It is honest, and that is a quality to be admired these days. Overall, I very much respect that Lynch made a film like this, because I know that this is not his personal preference of film to make, but he managed to make the best of a story like this, and it definitely strung a chord in both my head and my heart.",Null,2,2,21 August 2010

There's also some mediocre moments of comedy. Mostly, though, it works like a charm, and there are some absolutely hilarious moments sprinkled here, many times hitting higher heights than the first. Hill and Tatum are still basically their old selves and it works, even if I enjoyed Tatum in the first more. Ice Cube's act was great in the first, but it gets old really quick here. I wouldn't mind if he was replaced in the third film. Overall, still really good entertainment.",Null,1,4,27 September 2014

Chris Sarandon and John Cazale are also really impressive. Lumet is both a story-teller and an actor's director, as has been proved with performances from Fonda (12 Angry Men), Dunaway, Finch, and Holden (Network). He really knows how to make the most of a character and the actor. I give Dog Day Afternoon an 8.5, and while very, very good, 12 Angry Men and Network are still higher.",Null,0,0,17 April 2011

It's a pretty leisurely paced drama, filled with character evolutions and growth that really take years to form. The performances are all fine, and while I like Murray Abraham a good deal in this, I think Tom Hulce is the film's MVP and I find his wildly varying portrayal to be more effective, and the obvious heart of the film. Perhaps he doesn't have the dramatic calls for in his role, but I did like him more. It seems like a fleshed out, fully iconic character and I'm surprised I hadn't heard more of his performance here. Overall, definitely recommended.",Null,0,2,1 August 2014

It has an intriguing premise that besides a great first scene of 'the game' being played, it goes nowhere with. It could've really been interesting in setting up certain scenes and scenarios, but it really didn't do much. Even Michael Douglas looks completely out of his element, looks bored or maybe that's just what he usually does with films like this. Either way, no a good performance.

Kick-Ass," A Stylish, Daring, and Gory Action Comedy!
","What Can I say about Kick-Ass. Well, for starters, it definitely lives up to it's name. It is also a very funny High School film that takes place in the world of superheroes (well, in their won world). The film has a clever and outrageous screenplay. It is daring and original in it's approach, and these days that is hard to come by. It reminds me of Sin City in it's totally unrated but fun tone, although in a lighter way. This film crosses so many different films, like Superbad, Kill Bill, Adventureland and combines them to this very entertaining and energetic film. I am not sure that every scene works, but that's because the film has incredibly contrasting tones at times. It is an action film, a comedy, a high school romance, and a crime film, and it succeeds in all of those genres. This film is definitely outlandish and will offend many people because of it's hard rating and the violence portrayed by kids and to kids. But this is a film that has ambition, and joins the ranks of the best comic book films in the last 10 years together with The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and Sin City, because like all of them, it is not merely satisfied with being your average Spider-Man film. Oh, and the soundtrack is KILLER!",Null,4,14,24 April 2010
Call Me by Your Name," Near masterful
","It's hard to put into words exactly the way I felt watching this film. Hours later it's hard to even begin to write my opinion on it. To put as simply as I can, the film perfectly captures its setting and atmosphere in a way few films do. The biggest credit needs to be given to director Luca Guadagnino, who is able to capture the smallest of details. Technically, the film is a marvel and I struggle to think of one flaw. It's beautiful, sensual, luscious in its execution, with absolutely marvelous pacing. In terms of pure directorial achievements, it's definitely one of the best of the year. The performance of Timoth√©e Chalamet is also a pretty perfect portrayal of the character in the novel, and a completely internal performance that is reminiscent of Rooney Mara's wonderful work in Carol. Armie Hammer is also quite strong in the role, although it's a tricky character to get completely right. The novel is told completely through Elio's eyes and so we only imagine and see Oliver from a distance. He's more of an enigmatic figure in the novel than a real, tangible person. So much of that is due to the writing and the way Elio sees him as, so in terms of difficulty, I can imagine how Hammer had quite a task on his hands. Due to the literal nature of film, it's a type of character that always had to lose some of its mystery to its translation from the page, and it's as good one as can be. I have so much I want to say about this but still can't find the right words, but the one thing I will say is that while the story here is pretty simple, the film really does capture, more than any other in recent memory, the feeling of that fleeting force of love and passion that can come to define one's life. It does so in a melancholic, beautiful way that makes it stand out from others of its kind. I can see why some people wouldn't take to it (and in fact the almost-unanimous positive reviews surprise me) because at the end of the day, the technical aspects work to create a film that can only be defined by a feeling that some people will experience watching the film and that others won't. All that sounds incredibly enigmatic, but it's a difficult feeling to pinpoint and considering the film, I think it's fitting.",Null,13,31,26 November 2017
The Hurt Locker," One of the best films of the year
","Just a few days ago, I watched The Hurt Locker, and to be honest I did not like it very much. Could it be because I was hardly paying real attention to it? It definitely was my fault. Ever since that day I have been thinking about it, and decided to rewatch it because it felt like I missed something. Boy, I missed a lot of things. This is a great film. The attention to detail and tension in the film is so real, so layered. The film offers the first real startling look at the Iraq War, and how dangerous it is. As much as it is a war film, it is also a character study. Jeremy Renner is perfect as SSgt. William James. He creates a fascinating and brave character that is sure to become one of the iconic heroes of this decade. Renner hits every note perfectly, as does his cast members Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty. The film has a good amount of humor, thanks a great deal to James. But the film also gives a painful look at lives of real men at Iraq and how hard it must be to cope with the tasks needed to accomplish, like disarming bombs. Kathryn Bigelow deserves an Oscar nomination for her directing, and honestly, at this point I would want her to win. She, and the screenplay writer Mark Boal, have created a devastating, powerful, but ultimately rewarding war/drama that deserves all the praise. One of the five best films of the year",Null,6,16,12 December 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Quite like nothing else I've ever seen
","I rarely see musicals and the recent Les Miserables got me thinking of seeking a lot more out. Moulin Rouge though, is a film from another canon. Right off the start it managed to be incredibly entertaining but so overwhelming. After getting used to it though, I was completely riveted with it in its first act. I found it completely giddy in its cinematic execution. Very, very theatrical and messy, but so, so much fun. It was also hilarious, and Kidman's 'Naughty!' line readings had me feeling like a ray of sunshine. But weirdly, after the first act, it keeps losing and losing steam. What exactly did it? Really, I can't be too sure with this type of film. It's not that I was overwhelmed like in the first few minutes. On the contrary, I found myself quite bored, and that's probably the least wanted intention Luhrmann had while making this. A big problem is that many of the songs just don't work. Some of them play out and I'm completely unaffected by them. The film managed to greatly recover in its final 20 minutes though, which are completely dazzling and exactly what I wanted from it.Overall, I'm still rather mixed on this. The inventive wit, humor, and just pure adrenaline running through this is completely unique to it and there's not many films I've seen that reach its energetic levels. A lot of it didn't work though, and a big reason is because too much of it completely desensitizes you. There's definitely a lot of ambition and creativity and fun, but it's also frequently quite terrible. When it is sometimes really terrible though, it's terrible in such a fun and entertaining way that you can't help but not look away (Like a Virgin!). But other times it's not exactly terrible, just extremely boring. And yet other times, you love it to such a high degree that you get caught up in all of it. So again, what exactly do I think of it as a whole? It's a mess, a sometimes beautiful, sometimes badly funny, sometimes just dull mess. That's basically it, and because of that I have to be completely in the middle on it. Once again, that's probably the least desired intention Luhrmann had in mind when making it.",Null,0,1,24 January 2013
Ex Machina," Atmospheric, contemplative, and cerebral. Visually accomplished
","The fact that this is Alex Garland's directorial debut is nothing less than impressive. The control he has here, every frame, every edit, every piece of music is able to fit together as a whole to give the film its defining atmosphere, and what atmosphere it is. It's not at all the really tense sci-fi the trailer showed, and it's all the better for it. Well, it is tense but in a very brooding, very contemplative way. The problem with films like these is that so many times their final act proves to undo so much of what made the rest of the films great. Here, it never tries to pretend to be anything too complicated. Don't get me wrong, it's playing with some really resonant themes, but it's also not convulted or complicated for the sake of being complicated. It's certainly a mind game though, for all of the three characters involved but it's also not predictable in the usual sense because there isn't any big twist that the film had been trying to hide all along. There's no 'gotcha' moment, and so the film's haunting quality persists throughout. The three performances are great, but it's Vikander who truly impresses on another level. She's just absolutely perfectAll in all, really fantastic and this deserves to maintain a cult following. Technically-wise, it's such a gorgeous film, and the script is really strong",Null,0,5,14 May 2015
The Illusionist," A mesmerizing and captivating film
","The Illusionist is a captivating film because it relies on the audience to wonder and guess what the 'illusion' is. Is it real or not? The film is mesmerizing in it's ability to engage the audience and make us wonder until the last minute. The performances are strong. Jessica Biel is beautiful. Rufus Sewell gives the best performance and he is amazing to watch. The cinematography and set and costume designs are wonderful and create a very well-done era of magic. The score is also brilliant. The twist at the end was not as frustrating as it could have turned out, but also not as 'magical' as I wanted. But both The Illusionist and The Prestige are two films that know how to hypnotize audiences.",Null,1,1,12 January 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A sweeping, visually enchanting Masterpiece!
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is perhaps the only film in recent memory that has exceeded all my expectations for it.Let me start off by saying that the story of this film is perfect in every way. I found it was old-fashioned in a way, the way a man's life is explained through a journal. The sweeping feel of the film, perfectly balanced with a strong backstory, makes this film just more magical. The screenplay is perfectly written as a modern day fairy-tale. David Fincher has proved that he is capable of anything. This is not only his best film, but also one of the best achievements that a director has ever captured on screen. The pure poetry verses and lines that the film has are to resemble themes about life, death, and love. They were all perfectly balanced to make sense to the story.As much as this is a director's film, it has fabulous performances. Brad Pitt portrays each moment in Benjamin Button's life perfectly. His subtle acting as an old, yet juvenile man amazed me. To a greater extent, Cate Blanchett gave another amazing performance. Her role was not too flashy, but I think it helped her. I thought that she also did an amazing job playing the different moments and stages in her life. You could really feel her sadness, feelings, regret, and love as time passed by. The supporting performances were all fitting to the story and feel of the film, especially Tariji P. Henson's role as Benjamin's protective and loving mother.This film is absolutely perfect in every single art department. It probably has the best art direction of the decade. The costumes were perfect for the era of the film. The make-up is so amazingly done. The special effects are so first-rate. You could not even tell when, and how, they made younger and older versions of both Blanchett and Pit, whether it was make-up or visual effects at times. The music score was just so brilliant and soothing. One of the best I have ever heard. The cinematography was beautiful, thanks to the set designs. Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is truly the single best film of the year. It is a film that is gripping, and one that is very touching. It is a tragic love story at times, a sad film at times, an enjoyable film at other times. This is a perfect film for adults too, and for children. I have not said this to any films this year, but everyone, praise Benjamin Button! This is one of the best Motion Pictures of all time!",Null,6,9,29 December 2008
Hidden Figures," Crowd-pleasing entertainment
","I think most people going to see this film would have an idea what kind of film it would be. It basically was what I expected it to be. It's a very crowd-pleasing film, one likely to appeal to the mainstream. It's pretty formulaic in its structure, with the usual Hollywood stylization. Nothing about it is subtle or subdued, as expected. But it's still a pretty good film. It does its job, is very entertaining, and it also has three very strong leads at its core. It's a story about important women in real life and even though it gets the very Hollywood treatment and doesn't go beyond that to become a great film, it's still hard to fault. It's definitely recommended.",Null,4,11,13 January 2017
Coco," Absolutely magical and beautiful. One of the century's finest animated films.
","It's rare for me to finish an animated film and think 'I want that to become a classic.' But it happened with this one. As a Latino, I can't put into words just how beautiful it felt to hear the music in the film. I don't remember the last time the music in a film was able to move me so much. That goes for the entire film. I had heard so much about how sad it was, but I honestly think this is one of the most genuinely happy films I have probably ever seen. There's sadness sprinkled in there, but most of the emotion derives from watching such lovable, magical characters convey themes so eternal and personal. A lot of films intend to teach you the importance of family and all that clich√É¬©d stuff, but this is that rare film that truly earns it and truly rises above others to make you get it. Maybe I connected so much to it because I am of the culture, but wow do I think this is a truly special gem, needed so badly in a year like this. After it was over my friend turned to me and said 'Don't you dare say anything negative about this right now because I won't be able to take it.' I'm sure there are flaws in there, but the whole thing conveys such power rarely seen in animated films, and as far as I'm concerned, power that even most Pixar films don't carry. I absolutely think this is one of Pixar's best works and I hope it receives all the recognition it deserves.",Null,2,4,9 December 2017

Lincoln," One of the greatest Historical dramas ever
","I'm not a huge fan of Steven Spielberg at all, and I've never made it secret. He's talented yes, but the sentimentality and formulaic mainstream tendencies are always present in every one of his films, to different extents. Lincoln turned out to be a really fantastic film though, and is probably Spielberg's best film since Schindler's List and probably one of the few ones I have ever loved from him. The reason the film works so well is because it has a really great screenplay at work. Tony Kushner writes this story like a pro, simply said. The dialogue is nearly always riveting, never dry, and is able to inject humor in all of the right places while still clearly defining so many of the characters that weave in and out of the story. It also wisely doesn't go to too many places and instead is clearly focused on one aspect of Lincoln's life and American history in general. Because of that, I would say this is a writers' film more than a directors' one, and in all honesty I am surprised Steven Spielberg chose it. There's not much indication that he's behind the camera, and that's great for me. Instead of feeling like a signature Spielberg film, it still manages to be tightly calculated and touching in all of the right moments because of his restrained directing. In the moments that do aim for something more moving, it feels more honest and doesn't feel hokey. I am incredible grateful for that, especially after the horrid War Horse last year.The ensemble here is magnificent. Sally Field seemed out of place at first, but I warmed up to her as it went along and her way of playing up the infamous Mary Todd Lincoln. Other great performances include David Straitham, with a gentle and compassionate performance, Gordon Levitt, who I've never liked much but was pretty great here, John Hawkes, Michael Stuhlbarg, James Spader, and Lee Pace among the best. But the film belongs to two men, Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. Lewis is magnificent here, invoking the personality that so many have heard of yet never witnessed. Regardless, it's a different type of performance from the one he played 5 years ago as Daniel Plainview, and because it's simply not as physically or emotionally commanding, it won't be the type of performance everyone can get behind for awards. But he was perfect, and as of now is the best male performance of the year (although I still have a lot to see). Tommy Lee Jones is probably just as fantastic, stealing every scene he is in and injecting a dose of power, warmth, and charisma to everything he touches. I have yet to see most of the actors in contention for Supporting Actor, but I would be ecstatic if Jones wins it because regardless, it's an incredibly compelling performance.Ultimately, I think even those who aren't fond of Spielberg can enjoy it. He gives material room to breathe and instead of forcing every dose of sentimentality into every frame of certain scenes, he makes the film work beautifully, showcasing the fantastic acting and tight writing. This is highly recommended, and one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the best historical films I've ever seen.",Null,7,16,27 December 2012
Sing Street," A lot of fun
","John Carney was surely someone who I very much looked forward to after creating the indie gem Once. Begin Again was solid, but a little inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. This is much more like it. Boasting a coming-of-age drama as well as a music film, he unleashes some really memorable and likable characters that carry us through this charming, sweet film. I don't think it does anything too extraordinary, and the music isn't to the same level as the music from Once (few music is) but it's really good and entertaining, not to mention very emotionally- investing. That final scene is also really magical and beautiful and surely to resonate with a lot.",Null,2,3,4 July 2016
Pi," An ambitious debut from Darren Aronofsky....
","Lately I have become a bigger fan of Aronofsky after seeing his great films like Black Swan, Requiem, and The Wrestler, so it was only fair that I would see his debut. It is a very interesting film, which I figured it would be. The first film that Pi automatically reminded me of was the debut from Lynch- Eraserhead. The worlds in which are created in the two films have the same sort of mood and tone, and if anything, this is a great feat for Aronofsky. The film is not hugely entertaining, and it is a hard film to love, but certainly hot hard to respect it. It is a hugely ambitious film with a lot of clever and unique ideas and scenes thrown in. It is also about the madness of a character, which Aronofsky's films always tend to be about. It works in a visceral level like most of his films, and it certain to warrant repeat viewings.",Null,1,3,22 January 2011
Children of Men," A visually stunning, science fiction masterpiece
","Let me start off by saying that Children of Men is perhaps one of the most visually stunning films ever made.Children of Men is Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece. He directs it with such will and force. His talent shines through, and thanks to the effects and the gorgeous and challenging cinematography, Children of Men remains to be the most important science fiction film of the decade. It has very serious deep ideas and themes about life today, and about the future. Certainly destined to become a sci-fi classic. It is such a brilliantly made film. The cinematography is some of the best ever captured. It has amazing long-shots, that really transport you inside the film. Children of Men is a visual masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi films ever made",Null,2,6,28 December 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Engaging and well-made
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a very good film. It had fantastic performances, a very engaging storyline, and some great cinematography. I expected it to be more obscure in the way foreign films are. For example, a foreign film like Let The Right One In certainly has a distinct style from an American film despite its subtitles. This doesn't. It actually has the look, mood, and feel of a film that could have been made here in America (by ignoring the subtitles part)... which is why I wonder why Fincher decided to remake this. I'm sure the material interests him but unlike Let The Right One In, this doesn't feel too un-mainstream for the general public. In fact, if one was to disregard that it has subtitles I would actually think it was made here. It was a very good film, but I I don't know how Fincher can expand or differentiate his film with this. That means I hope he does different things with it. Let Me In might have had like the same storyline and the same dialogue many times but it certainly had a distinctive tone and atmosphere that applied to itself only.",Null,1,2,14 October 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Pretty fantastic
","Sometimes it pays off being in a film class when you don't do anything else besides watch a film. Good Night, and Good Luck is a great one. Clooney's direction is astute, the pace careful and steady, and the editing exceptional. It's also worth noting that it's not so much a biographical film of a man, and instead a biographical film of an important key time. The entire cast delivers, but the real star here is David Strathairn, whose portrayal is that of a brooding, serious, yet charismatic man just trying to get the truth across. If I have seen Strathairn anywhere before, I certainly don't remember, and that's because it doesn't feel so much of a performance rather than the actual person from the time period. It's not a showy one, but at no time does he come across as anything other than Edward Murrow. Overall, a great film.",Null,0,0,2 October 2012

","Big Hero 6 is certainly solid, if maybe very good. It's extremely formulaic, maybe even moreso than I would've guessed or wanted, but it's solid entertainment. The animation is really, really boring, but it has some good comedy. All of the comedic scenes revolving around Baymax are gold, sometimes incredibly hilarious. Overall, good, but certainly nothing special, definitely not as great as some of the other animated films this year. Certainly not as memorable as the film I saw right before it. But then again, its ambitions were always going to pale in comparison, and I'd like to see how it fares when watching it on its own, maybe better.",Null,0,17,12 November 2014

I am prepared for the worst when I say this, but I had never watched a David Lynch film before this. Yes, it is crazy to say, but it's the truth. However, after having watched his first film, I am completely fascinated and mesmerized by it. I have watched confusing and surreal films before, like Donnie Darko and Memento, but this must be the highest anyone can go in terms of an interwined plot. The acting is great. Naomi Watts was robbed of an Oscar nomination, and this goes to show how great of an actress she is. In some of her scenes depicting lust and sensual feelings, she is completely captivating, I could not help but feel lust towards her. The direction is amazing. The film gathers a mysterious and dream-like vibe, with some amazing music and some great cinematography. The film cannot be described in terms of words, but one thing is for sure, it is a masterwork, and the definition of true cinema.",Null,4,7,7 January 2010

It's very well one of the best animated films I've ever seen, no question. The film also makes its intentions clear by showing these characters' fates in the beginning, and so we're not concentrated on hoping they survive or anything but just witnessing the deep pain and suffering that befell so many people during this time. Definitely a must-see film, one that isn't easy but very well reminds us o the tragedy that people went through and the human suffering, and how lucky the rest of us are for not having gone through it.",Null,3,4,22 March 2015

I know that the film was leading up to something bigger, and boy did the ending pack a punch! I saw this film in my school classroom and when the ending came everyone went silent. The ending was definitely great, but to me the rest of the film, while never really dull, is never that interesting to begin with. It does have some great scenes, however. The performances are also rich, especially Vera Farmiga, who is proving that she is an actress to watch out for!

As others have said, I do think that it's more flawed than The Force Awakens, and sometimes a little more boring, but other times it's also more intense and exciting. Overall, it's pretty standard and pretty much on the same level as TFA. I don't see how people could get so passionate about their annoyance with it though.

","I had heard a lot of mixed opinions on Brave. Perhaps no one had bashed it, but some found it satisfying while some just found it completely unremarkable. Because of the low expectations perhaps, I found myself really liking this. It moves quickly, and while it's completely formulaic and predictable from start to finish and the themes aren't anything nearly original, it was still pretty entertaining, and surprisingly, heartfelt. It actually moved me. I think some of the bad word-of-mouth comes because this is Pixar, known for making masterful animated films, and as good as this is, it just doesn't hit the heights Pixar usually does. But on its own, it is quite good and satisfying. However, this is the fourth animated film I have seen this year, and the other three are better and more deserving of the Oscar.Oh, and the three kid brothers, amazing.",Null,1,2,26 November 2012

","This certainly looked like a different sort of superhero blockbuster. In that way, it's disappointing that it's really not that different from most of them. The performances are really fine, and Chris pratt makes for an instantly likable, instantly charming hero, one that doesn't try too hard or even at all to make us like him, and yet he does. That all really lies on Pratt. Saldana is strong, as she always is in these sort of roles (first blue, now green, we can just wait for her to portray a red and yellow character). So yeah, ultimately not as memorable or as great as I wanted, but still really good, fine work. Also, Bradley Cooper is a joy to watch.",Null,2,5,11 November 2014
Evil Dead," Very worthy
","I've been anticipating this film for a very, very long time. I read the script a month before its release date, not being able to help it. I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy, and the trailers for this were absolutely amazing. Then when it came out and many seemed to have almost passionless responses to it (including may critics) my expectations lowered a bit. The film basically hit my lower expectations, if maybe not quite hitting them.Some of the dialogue here is clunky, especially the first time we meet the core five. It feels like necessary on-the-nose exposition. But still, I got over it. I want to say that I definitely did like this, but there's just something creatively missing in all of its execution. Truth be told, I expected some truly amazing horror pieces when I read the script, but if anything Alvarez never really goes all the way. I don't want to say much of it feels half-baked because I liked it a lot more than simply giving it that description, but I think much of it holds back. And maybe it's because of the pre-release talk of it being outrageously gory and brutal, but while there's definitely a lot of it to be found, it just never really has a truly effective impact. Again, always being disappointed with hugely anticipated films makes me come off a lot more critical, but I definitely did like this. It's completely entertaining, and while it's true that the brutality doesn't make as much of an impact as I wish, it's still pretty great to experience. The make-up here is amazing and the effort pays off, and the cinematography is quite brilliant, especially notable for a mainstream horror like this. The acting is hit-or-miss. Fernandez has a huge task and while he's never outright bad, he also doesn't have much screen presence and comes off bored. Blackmore as his girlfriend is easily the weakest of the cast and I think it's good that her character is very under-developed and has limited screen time before her craziness starts. Jessica Lucas is quite good in her small screen time, but the two who really make an impact are (unsurprisingly, since that's what consensus says) Pucci and Levy. The former is quite a hoot and he does his character more than enough justice, making up in charisma what Fernandez lacks. Levy is the star here and she delivers a truly chilling performance, completely believable in all aspects. She hits all of her notes with ease and while this is the first time I've seen her in anything, I'm already a fan.There's definite craziness and horror goodness here to satisfy many people. While it's true that my expectations were too high and it just hurts the film when it doesn't reach them, this is definitely still better than what horror remakes tend to be and it stands on its own as not just a mere remake. I also want to note that I was pleasantly surprised by the film's humor. It definitely doesn't really take itself too seriously and there's a sense of goofiness that comes with it (which is pretty much why the original managed to be funny and as the decades have passed has been lumped into being a horror/comedy when it actually never was).",Null,3,16,14 April 2013
The Imitation Game," Inoffensive, but just decent
","Even more formulaic, schmaltzy, and sort of uninspired than I had predicted. But... I didn't dislike it. Kind of hard to dislike such a competently-made film that's so inoffensive. There's really nothing wrong with it besides being formulaic, although the dialogue certainly can be quite mediocre at times. Cumberbatch started out really rough. He was so... technical in everything he was doing. He was technically good, delivering his lines, his expressions, everything in exactly the way you'd expect, but that was the problem. You could see everything coming, all I saw was an actor acting without making me feel anything and it was really distracting. After the first half hour, though, he became a real character and I grew to care about him, to the point that I really wish the film around him was better. Knightley is fine, if at times a little uneven, but awards nominations for this? Just no way... other actresses could've done a lot more with that role. This is kind of exactly the same as The Theory of Everything, both are among the most forgettable but still decent films up for awards, and neither should be getting anywhere near the mentions and nominations they've been getting. People kept comparing this to The King's Speech, but that was a formulaic, but rather great film with a lot more heart and a lot more excitement. This... is not that, and I really hope it doesn't beat neither Birdman or Boyhood for Best Picture.",Null,0,3,8 January 2015

Unlike The Exorcist and Halloween, The Evil Dead does not take itself too seriously, which is actually a great thing and allows Sam Raimi to shine. He gives the film suspense and thrilling sequences of gore, horror, and mystery. The characters are all well rounded, and the actors portray them with such foolishness, it is great that they were not aiming for anything more. But the stars here are the gore, the effects, and the zombies. It has some of the most wacky horror sequences I have ever seen, filled with thrills, suspense, but also hilarious to watch.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Masterpiece of action Entertainment!
","Well, I saw Kill Bill completely, and I have to say, it is a top-notch, action, martial arts extravaganza! I usually don't see films that are just of action. I like films that have something more, and aren't just for brainless entertainment, and Kill Bill was something sort of like a popcorn flick, but it was so much more than that. The film's opening is totally haunting. We are able to see a tortured human being, The Bride(played by Uma Thurman). The first fight sequence involving Thurman and Vivicia A. Fox is AMAZING, I mean that with the most emphasis I can give. It ranks up there with the best openings I have ever seen. The film grabs you, and never lets go. All of the martial arts fights are amazing. I have never seen a film that has so much entertainment, yet it is also because of the way they are done.The reason why the fights, and all the other elements of this film work is because of the screenplay by Quentin Tarantino. I have seen Tarantino films, classics like Pulp Fiction, and while I was watching this film, I could totally tell it was his film. It has his sort of prints in it. His screenplay tells a lot about morality and humanity, and the script ha s a lot of gags and so-called 'cheesy' dialogues, but knowing Tarantino, this is a factor that I love in his films. He is not afraid to have fun with both occurrences and dialogue in his films, and that is why this film also succeeds. For example, the action sequences all have a bit of emotion to them, especially us seeing what kind of character The Bride is. Her way of sparing young people drove us to see her as a hero, when in fact she is also a very murderous killer. Uma Thurman gives a lot to this character, and that is why we root for her and identify with her, and in an action film, we have to have this. The screenplay only lets us see all these characters, and giving each of them a little bit of humanity, as for us to actually care who dies and who doesn't.The film is also an artistic achievement. This film is one of the most music-influenced i have ever seen. There is a lot of bits of different music, and the music is perfectly added in scenes, as to give them more excitement and value. Amazing sound techniques to all the fight scenes, and almost every scene! The amount of gore and violence in this film is disturbing to some people, but it really is done in a sort of comical way. All the blood splattering, the heads popping up, it is all fun, and being a Tarantino fan, I love this factor! Overall, Kill Bill. Vol. 1 is a Masterpiece of martial arts/action fight films! It is one of the most enjoyable, entertaining, and in that aspect, quality-filled movies I have ever seen. For what it is, it does not disappoint, and I think it being such an original, refreshing, comical martial arts action film, it will be remembered for a long time! Hopefully, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is just as great!",Null,0,2,15 July 2008
Saw II," A bloody entertaining film, with shocks and twists all around!
","Saw 2 is a great horror film. It is not a great achievement or anything, but its has all the elements to make a great horror film, or a thriller. The Saw franchise, while being a lot of things, is clearly not brainless, despite some haters. The first Saw did have a moral theme to it, one that surprised me, and one that rang throughout the sequel. How much are people willing to sacrifice to save themselves? How much do people have to appreciate their life, or in how much danger should they be in before they actually start appreciating it? The film provokes a lot of questions like these, and while it is flawed, it is very entertaining. It has a lot of blood, and a lot of scenes are disturbing, a job well done! The editing is what makes the Saw films stand apart from others. The editing in this film is very flashy, very quick, and there are a lot of transitions every scene. At the beginning it makes the first scene be 'less' scarier than it should have been, but besides that, I like the editing. It makes the twist be what it is. The acting is good. Tobin Bell and Donnie Wahlberg deliver the best of their scenes together. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Shawnee Smith are also good, as is Beverly Mitchell. The guys are the problem. Franky G delivers a very one-dimensional performance, as does the rest of them. Some might not like this film because it is concentrated a lot of being shocking and repulsive, and thus why some call Sae films 'troture porn'.

From Dusk Till Dawn," Entertaining and wickedly funny
","From Dusk Till Dawn was a very entertaining film. It never once bored me, so props for that. I did like it, but did not love it.The film has moments of real brilliance in it's screenplay. I perhaps think that maybe Tarantino should have directed it. I am not saying Rodriguez did a bad job, just that maybe the film would have come together as something more with Tarantino behind the camera. Of course, the turn of events in the 2nd half would have been surprising had Dish Network not spoiled it in the summary info. But it didn't matter, I was hooked throughout. From the Tarantino scripts, this IS his weakest, but it doesn't matter. It's a blast to old gory cheesy horrors! In fact, the comedy really made me dig it even more! I would say that the other pairing between Tarantino and Rodriguez in Grindhouse (Planet Terror and Death Proof) is better but this is still a very entertaining and gory film!",Null,4,4,25 July 2011
Clash of the Titans," Definition of mediocre, but nice Opening Scene!
","As a film, Clash of the Titans does not succeed. The story is unengaging, and the direction sloppy. Some of the action sequences are entertaining and boast some nice visuals, but ultimately it is not worthwhile. As a 3-D experience, it completely FAILS! I am not one of those people who just want 3-D to see things pop out at you. For me, when 3-D is done right it transports you into the actual film, where films like Up, Alice in Wonderland, How To Train your Dragon, and to a greater extent Avatar succeeded. BUT this is my first unnecessary 3-D experience. The only scene that is actually amazing in 3-D and transports you to another world is the opening scene with all of the mythology and the heavens. It looks utterly amazing! That is actually the best scene in the entire film, and what a shame the rest of the film failed to live up to that one scene. Overall, the film is sloppy and predictable, but for those seeking out some (not all) nice action scenes and visuals, go see it, but please, do NOT see it in 3-D because there really is no difference. This film is the definition of mediocre, not good, but not entirely horrible.",Null,1,2,17 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," The most frightening film of the decade!
","There has lately been a lot of hype around this film, and where a month ago I had never even heard of it, many people saying it was 'so scary' and that some people fainted really brought the hype higher. I tried not to expect something so scary, because no film has ever really physically shaken or scared me that much, but this came quite close. Similar to The Blair Witch Project, it starts off slow and slowly gets under our skins. It had some realistic characters and they did some realistic things, so that is a compliment that is rare in horror films these days. The direction is impressive, as is the camera-work, and very effective. The moments in the night are so suspenseful, and what makes the film truly scary is how some people have had things like this happened to them, and how everyone at one point really thinks about the things that go bump in the night and stuff like that. The film is simple, but very effective, and the experience of watching it was scarier than watching The Blair Witch Project, just because I saw this at a cinema and I saw Blair Witch in a TV screen. I saw it yesterday night, and when I got home, and was alone, I was very creeped out. Props to this film, easily the creepiest film of the last 20 years next to The Blair Witch, and one of the best.",Null,1,6,25 October 2009
Cold War," Handsomely made

Prisoners," A really unmainstream crime film, surprisingly
","I don't know, I expected an extremely riveting thriller. Prisoners is a weird mixture of art-house sensibility and mainstream formulas. It's always verging on being contrived, and yet it somehow all works. It's extremely long, and yet I didn't mind the length. It really shouldn't work as much as it does, but somehow it does. Jackman is great, but Gyleenhaal is on another level with a less meatier role. This is his best performance since Donnie Darko back in 2001. The rest of the cast is solid, but Melissa Leo sort of overacts, yet again. This woman doesn't know when to tone it down at all. This is definitely recommended for all film fans.",Null,1,1,17 October 2013
Silence," Divisive, but powerful film
","I will have to let my opinions on this film really rest because as of now I don't know how to really feel or how to pinpoint all of my thoughts on it. Viscerally, it's a pretty powerful film. Scorsese knows that for so much of it to ring true he needs to really cut back on many stylistic flourishes and let the story speak for itself, and he's able to do that while still maintaining a strong handle on the whole thing. It's an incredibly ambitious film and I found myself immersed by it but also quite overwhelmed. I found the whole thing really effective as I saw it but an hour after it having ended I'm not really sure to what extent I like it. The acting is pretty great, although I do wonder if someone else other than Garfield would have been even better. The standout for me was Y√¥suke Kubozuka.",Null,3,7,12 January 2017
Logan," Very ambitious
","I think there are quite a lot of things that Logan is attempting to do that I don't think any other Marvel comics film has done. In terms of ambition, it definitely eclipses those others. I don't think everything in the screenplay always entirely worked. There are some rough edges that needed some refining for the finished product. And I also don't think the film is quite the masterpiece that it is being hailed as. However, it's an incredibly well-made, enjoyable, and really meaningful picture that allows us to experience these characters that we've know before in very different ways. The film should be congratulated for definitely trying something different and for mostly being successful.",Null,1,4,11 March 2017
The Dark Knight," Amazing sprawling, epic Blockbuster! A true Masterpiece of the decade!
","So today I finally went to see The Dark Knight, and my theater going experience was probable the best I ever had.The opening of the film is brilliant, a clever way to grab the audience. The sound in my theater was very loud, and the gunshots were very well done, the sound. Anyways, from the start of the film, it does not play out like a superhero film. I thought it was very complex, like an attorney or law film. It certainly grabs you into a world created only by Christopher Nolan. His screenplay lets you wonder into all this crime in Gotham. Every scene helps into characterization to all the characters. The cinematography is amazing. Nolan does not waste any beauty of Chicago, or 'Gotham', go to waste. He plays with the settings, and in a way presents us with beautiful city lights and skyscrapers, in a way that actually no film ever did. The action pieces are all well done, and actually, unlike Batman Begins, they are very well directed and the camera work helps. That's a huge improvement.Now to an important piece of this film, the acting. Of course, the key performance is Ledger, and what can I say, he does not disappoint at all. What he gives us here is a villain so menacing, so complex, so insane that it ranks up there with Hannibal Lector. Heath Ledger's performance is definitely in the top 5 of the decade, and it deserves to be remembered, and also an Oscar. His facial expressions, his grins, his chilling laugh, his tone, everything is perfect. The other actors also all shine. Performances that I think deserve some buzz too, are Aaaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman. Eckhart, who plays the district attorney Harvery Dent really surprised me. I think since Ledger has been given all the buzz, they forgot Eckhart. Well, he deserves some too, not as much as Ledger, but he really was great. Gary Oldman is an underrated actor, and I also think he shines. Christian Bale does another great job of the hero that people fear and have doubts about. Maggie Gyllenhall, does a better job of playing Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes, but she is not in the film as much, but does play it very well. Of course, brilliant actors, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman do great supporting performances with their limited time. All the other smaller performances playing cops, detectives, and thugs are all great as well.What makes this film truly gold is the amazing intense moments and the unpredictability. There are amazing action scenes, but the reason they shine so much is because of how well they are built up, and how all of a sudden they come. More frequently toward the last hour of the film, it takes a lot of deadly turns and places that not many films go too. First off, when Harvey Dent declares he is Batman, and how he is taken in the GPD car, and how The Joker just comes out of nowhere. All of a sudden, the Joker is in custody, and right after one of the most amazingly acted, most intense scenes I have seen in years(Joker interrogated by Batman) we find out not one, but TWO important characters are in danger, and the game Batman has to play is choose one. Well, me already knowing who would die, I was still so nervous, and a lot of viewers were too. They were so captivated and lingered, I wanted to use the bathroom but for an hour I could not stand up. That is the making of pure films. It kept us glued to our seats. The scenes with the two boats, I was so nervous, and in the final scene with Two-face getting Gordon's son and threatening his life, it was so intense, more intense than recent crime movies.Overall, this is not just the best superhero film ever made, but one of the best films of the decade. I do not think it is one of those films that need to be called masterpieces, because only time will tell, and some people have called it that, and some said it's not. The problem is that The Dark Knight does have some material, like too many characters, too many situations, some unimportant characters, that are it's flaws, but I truly believe that they helped us identify with Gotham more, and even though it has it's negatives, it really does not impact the viewer. The Dark Knight can be called a crime/thriller/mystery/horror/law/action epic blockbuster! It certainly has themes of all those genres, and the reason is because of one truly unforgettably character-The Joker. But the film by itself is also amazing. Probably the funnest, most intense experience I ever had in a theater. Having seen Memento last night, this film is just as amazing as that one in different ways. It is so ambitious, it is a good thing in this case.Deeserves some real Oscar mention, since its more than a superhero film!",Null,6,13,26 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A spectacular fantasy film, with brilliant performances and lean direction!
","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter film to date, either tied with or surpassing Prisoner of Azkaban. The new director, David Yates, is very lean and confident, and his direction helps make this new Harry Potter film more mature. It feels more like a regular film, while in ways that is a downside, but also an upside seeing as how sometimes the Harry Potter films might be seen as children's' films. It's cinematography and photography is handsome, but not in the visual way that Prisoner's was. It is more bleak, more moody as well. It has a certain gloomy feeling, while it might turn off a lot of viewers seeing as how how it is different (especially after Goblet of Fire's more cheery and happy tone), I find that an improvement because it demonstrates a feeling of growth and maturity, in both the characters and the film itself. The new screenwriter was impressive. He was able to cut a lot of things out, and still leave a lot in while still not making it sort of all over the place, a flaw that presided in Goblet of Fire. Daniel Radcliffe's performance here is actually quite good. It took him five films, but he is finally able to demonstrate all of Harry's emotions and feelings very well. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson play their characters well. But the performance to talk about here( or rather, performances) is that of Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter. Imelda Staunton delivers a perfect performance, identical to that of the book's character. She is menacing, villainous, arrogant, obsessive, controlling, and she plays that all with a bit of humanity. What a performance! The Oscars should have caught on. Helena Bonham Carter delivers that same presence, and she plays Bellatrix with such force. Every second she is on screen(which is not a lot, maybe a minute overall) you cannot help but look at her. I just wish her role was bigger, and I hope her role in Half-Blood Prince is larger. She definitely deserved a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination if she can conduct that much passion for a character. The effects and the production designs are all fantastic as always, and the score, ranging from happy tunes to gloomy melodies, is perfect! Both Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban and Order of the Phoenix are the two films of the franchise that manage to be amazing films. Two of the best in fantasy for sure, and I hope Half-Blood prince does not disappoint.",Null,0,1,7 July 2009
Into the Wild," A triumph in every way
","Into The Wild. What an excellent film. I saw it back in 2007, and rewatched it to keep it fresh in my memory. It truly is a very beautiful and very personal film. Sean Penn is to be congratulated for pulling it off. His direction is superb, the cinematography and editing are excellent for the most part (at times they get a little bit too flashy, but just a minor flaw). The entire cast is superb. Catherine Keener is brilliant as always. Kristin Stewart is proving to be one of the most talented young faces. Hal Holbrook definitely deserved that Oscar nomination. He created the most touching character. The pain he went through seeing Chris making the mistake of his life, and their final scene together was simply the best scene of the film. I do admire Chris for setting out to do something that he believes in, but at the same time, one cannot help but think he is in over-his-head in this self- proclaimed pretension he has of living free and without barriers. He was an intelligent young man, but deeply misguided, and I do not believe Penn is in his side or against his beliefs. He made the film for the audience to either take this journey with him or take the journey into his own self-destruction. At the end though, Chris did learn from his mistakes, as can be seen with the line 'Love is only real when shared'. For that reason, this film is a true achievement. It is a sad and beautiful, but wrong, journey.",Null,1,2,7 February 2010
Annie Hall," Pretty well-written
","I don't necessarily think that the film is close to what its reputation would suggest (I'd probably take some of Woody's more recent films over it) but it's still a mostly entertaining, mostly intriguing romantic comedy. I do like the editing and the narrative structure in which it plays with the scenes and the chronological order in which the leads' romance evolved (or devolved, depending on how you look at it). Allen and Keaton mostly have chemistry, but at times it strains to not work for whatever reason. I definitely recommend this to any film buffs or any film fans, but as for me, I didn't quite fall in love with it. Still, pretty well-written.",Null,0,1,29 June 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's dazzling and intriguing masterpiece. Quite simply, the best film ever made
","I have seen 2001: A Space Odyssey quite a couple of times over the years, and each viewing never fails to amaze me. Ever since I saw it back in 2008, I fell in love on first viewing.Stanley Kubrick is one of Cinema's most legendary directors, so it goes without saying that he has an impressive resume. However, I have never seen a director quite as ambitious or daring as Kubrick here. The opening of 2001 demands attention in the first second, and amazingly the film reaches out and grabs you with it's amazing use of music, cinematography, and images. The film has no dialogue until after the 20- minute mark, yet it always remains completely mesmerizing. The film is a journey, an exploration that only those who are really willing to will experience. The film's atmosphere and mood is what sets it apart. It is true that a film's plot is very important, but I think what comes before that is how a film makes you feel. Of course, what you feel might come from the plot, characters, or writing, but it also comes from the direction, the use of music, and the abstract structure that a film might have. In that aspect, the film has many memorable scenes, scenes that are sure to blow your mind away, despite you never really knowing what they actually mean. That is the definition of a true artistic achievement.I do not want to say more, simply because a film like this is meant to be discussed based on your own personal feelings and theories after your viewing. It is not meant to be explained before watching. Of course, a film like this is also warranted to attract a large number of criticism, maybe on the level of ambition or 'pretension' as many will like to call it. Yet, the fact remains that 2001: A Space Odyssey has fared well over time, and is one of the most influential films of all time with good reason. It still stands to this day as the best film I have ever seen, and I strongly doubt that any film will ever take that title away from it.",Null,2,6,8 March 2008
Midsommar," An unnerving nightmare
","This was a doozy. One thing that you can tell right off the bat is that it feels like an Ari Aster film through and through. To be able to make your distinct voice/vision be apparent with just two films is really impressive, but he achieves it. He's a great director. He knows how to frame scenes, what to shoot, what to capture on camera, what kind of feeling to give. He's an incredibly visceral filmmaker and his strengths are captured here. I don't think this is as complete a picture as Hereditary (that was a near-masterful horror film) as I do think the biggest thing weighing this down is its runtime and sometimes a less clear focus. However, even with that said it's an incredibly impressive film. It's perhaps even less conventionally horror than Hereditary (and if audiences hated that, they will absolutely hate this. My audience hated it) but the entire journey and ride is one very much worth taking. By the end, it also feels very much like Hereditary in both content and style, with an ending that does leave you with the same feeling as Hereditary. Florence Pugh is really great here too. She commands the screen, and it's interesting to see her play this kind of role after Lady Macbeth where she has to give off a very different screen presence.",Null,13,28,3 July 2019
Pride & Prejudice," Very good
","Surely, it took me a while to finally see this, but it's rather very good. I've always liked Keira knightley, if never been totally impressed by her. Here, she's just exquisite, really bringing a lot of charm and depth to her role and fitting into the period time like a glove (not all the actors are as successful). The supporting cast is also great, great seeing Blethyn, and also great seeing both Carey Mulligan and Rosamund Pike in roles before they got big and started giving acclaimed performances. Both are great here, as is Jena Malone. The whole film is great, it's definitely more of your typical period romance over something like Atonement, which its themes were very different.",Null,0,0,7 January 2015
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A film that really grows in your heart., and upon stands its own on time...
","Yes, like a lot of people have said, it does grown on you over time. It is a very wonderful movie. At first, i liked it, but when you think about it more and more, and see it again, it is very unique. It is nothing like other romances. It is also a science fiction movie. It's take on human relationships was really thought out. It raises questions that we today might try to answer. What will we do to lovers we hate now? What are we capable of doing? And I think, would we really want to erase our past lovers from our minds? Some of us might say we do, but keeping those memories alive, yes, even the bad ones, keep us sane. They keep us alive. That is what this movie is trying to tell us. It tells us about humans, and about two people, who we really just meet by random memories. But what memories they are too. Kate Winslet should have won the Oscar for her performance. Sometimes not too likable, sometimes quirky, sometimes funny, sometimes evil, and even heart-warming. This is also Jim Carrey's best movie to date. Wacth it. It is very entertaining too, and all the emotion and passion this little film has upon it's lessons and morals will blow you away. I think it is one of those films that deserves a special spot on the best films ever made. It truly stand on its own, and it gets more memorable as time passes...",Null,0,3,24 March 2008
Alice in Wonderland," Tim Burton's Alice is a Visual Masterpiece
","Let me start off here... Tim Burton's Alice could have been a true classic, but instead it is just a good, sometimes very good, visually- amazing film. I do get the mixed reviews, since it is FAR from perfect. First off, I thought the first 10 minutes with Alice in the family gathering in the garden was truly dull and mediocre. I was thinking if this was the way the whole film was going to be I would hate it. Thankfully, once she steps into the rabbit hole, it went uphill. We visit Tim Burton's reimagining of Wonderland, or in this case, Underland. It is amazing. The colors, the artistic settings and the extraordinary costumes, make-up, and visual effects make this a true enchanting place. The film also has some really good scenes, most notably the scene where she is trying to open the small door when she first gets in, and her meeting with the Mad Hatter at his dinner table. Scenes like those really make this a magical film, and for the first 2/3 of her stay in Underland, it is really good, but it then starts to get a bit messy with the plot of her having to finally slay the dragon. I thought the final battle sequence, although visually amazing, was so dull and lost my complete interest. Tim Burton had said that since he had never been emotionally connected with the original plot-less structure of the book and Disney film, he wanted to make this film have an actual purpose, which I think is it's downfall, not only because the actual plot turns out to be so clich√©d, but because what I think made the original so great is how it has no clear plot and Alice goes wandering from place to place in Wonderland. The performances are great. Mia Wasikowska really holds her own, while Johnny Depp is also surprisingly tolerable as the Mad Hatter. But I think Helena Bonham Carter once again upstages Depp (the first time being in Sweeney Todd) and created a very memorable and funny Red Queen. I thought she was wonderful. Overall, the film is not the masterpiece it could have been, but its not as bad as some say it is. I did enjoy it for the most part, and the performances and the vibrant world Burton has created demands a view, if just for the amazing visuals. I really hope this is a frontrunner for the Make-Up, Costumes, and Art Direction Oscars next year.",Null,2,7,7 March 2010
Avatar," Visually-stimulating! The best Cinema-going experience I have ever had
","Avatar is the new feat of film-making. I would never have though James Cameron would have been able to pull this off, especially after all the hype. It's safe to say he did. While the plot is similar to other films, and despite many reviews saying that it's screenplay does not hold up to the weight of everything else in the film, I disagree. It's true that the screenplay is simple, but I found that is was a lot better than Titanic's screenplay, which really turned me off. But like most said, the screenplay is the least important aspect in this film, in a good way. It sets off this whole new vision that Cameron wants to bring to us. He does magnificently. The creature designs, visuals, sound, colors, and depth that everything has in Pandora is amazing, and I have never been transported into another world like I have with Avatar. Seeing it in 3-D was spectacular, simply spellbinding, and unforgettable. Everyone in the theater was in complete amazement at everything in this film, and for that, James Cameron has succeeded very well. He is a great director, and I hope he gets nominated for the Oscar at the very least. Avatar is the new feat of visual entertainment. It is one of the best films of 2009, and one of the best action films ever made.",Null,11,19,1 January 2010
Frank," Melancholic and funny, fantastic
","Graceful, melancholic, and sweetly charming even while being very funny, a fantastic film. Very meticulous in its pacing, it's restrained and surprisingly atmospheric too. The performances play a large part as to why it works so well. Michael Fassbender is definitely one of my five favorite actors working right now, he's given great performances all throughout the last several years, and this may stand as one of his very very best. I guess it's going to be hard for many people to look past the fact that we don't see his face (especially when it comes to awards season) but what he does with his vocal expressions is pretty magnificent, and a total transformation. Most times it hardly sounds like the Fassbender we've all heard, if at times even not at all. The only other male performance of 2014 to rival Fassbender's here is James McAvoy's turn in Filth. Domhnall Gleeson is also pretty great in a less showier part, especially great in the film's last act. Maggie Gyllenhaal has also never been better, although I admit that I haven't seen a lot of her work. This is truly great stuff, sad and funny in a way last year's brilliant Inside Llewyn Davis was. This also has a scene that is to me the hardest I've laughed this year.",Null,15,28,23 August 2014
Drag Me to Hell," A Masterwork of both the Horror and Comedy genre
","Drag Me To Hell is simply the most fun I have had in the movies in a very, very long time. It is a guilty-pleasure, but actually a very well made film at the same time. It gives us old-school scares and humor that had me laughing more than any other film in the last five years. The story is simple yet effective, the performances from Alison Lohman and Lorrna Raver are perfect for this, powerful but also very comedic when they are required to be. The same goes for the rest of the actors in the film, all played their parts gloriously over-the-top, which really worked. The scares the film provides were many, some were scary, some were shockingly gross, and then some were just plain hilarious. The film will surely provide a lot of future references and homages to the over-the-top scenes, like the grave scene, the talking goat, and the dancing ghost. Drag Me To hell is without a doubt the best horror film of the decade, but also probably one of the funniest films I have ever seen. That is a true achievement, Sam Raimi's best film to date. But I do tell you this, please go see it with a large audience, because that will only enhance the experience even more.",Null,1,4,20 June 2009
Selma," Don't know what to grade...
","So, this is a weird case, especially after seeing such a typical, Oscar-type period biographical film. Much of the film really plays like a history lesson. In that case, I can see why it's gotten such unanimous acclaim, but I'm really surprised it got so many standing ovations. I'm not sure how audiences will react to it as a whole. It's sort of subdued for its subject matter ands what one would expect, at times I could even see many finding it sort of dull (I did a few times, mostly in the beginning). It could also be considered sort of 'dry', but I appreciated that it really didn't force its sentiment really. But it's also more admirable. As a whole, a lot less showy than last year's 12 Years A Slave, the acting as well. David Oyelowo completely captures Luther King's essence. Very unshowy role though, and I honestly forgot I was watching an actor and just the real thing. That's how natural and subdued a performance it is, and as much as I liked him, it's also sort of a hard one to really love. It will be interesting to see how the AMPAS takes to him. Carmen Ejogo is actually showier and has one big scene, something that Oyelowo never gets. She's fantastic in it, but it doesn't really leave much lasting powerI don't know what to grade the film. I certainly didn't love it, but I appreciated more. It's funny, in comparison to a more typical Oscar film like The Imitation Game, it's still harder to love.",Null,2,8,8 January 2015
Grindhouse," The most entertaining, fantastic, most unique experience you will have!
","Grindhouse is pure genius. First off, it is made up of two films, Planet Terror and Death Proof. Planet Terror is written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. Death Proof is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.To start off with, Planet Terror is one of the best zombie flicks in film history. It is so much fun, It has a lot of gore, and I mean a lot, but it is used so falsely on purpose, you can't help but laugh. The film is so horrifying and disturbing. It has a lot of very bad scenes, so bad that you can't help but say 'oh dear'!. There is a lot of explosions in the film, since basically a gas was let out that turned people into zombie-like monsters. The film is pure fun, very great fun, and it is such a joy to watch. It is so unrealistic, like a woman wearing a huge gun instead of a leg. wow PURE AMAZING The second feature in 'Grindhouse' is Death Proof. Unlike Planet Terror, Death Proof takes itself at a different angle. It starts off with a bunch of girls talking. A lot of people say the film is boring, but really, it's not. If you've ever seen a Tarantino flick, you know he uses great dialogue for character development and forwarding. In Death Proof, he uses too much, so much that you can't help but feel like you are right there with the girls. I felt that I was really emphasizing and understanding with the girls, and I felt really relaxed. Death Proof starts off with a group of girls, then those girls get stalked by a man called Stuntman Mike. Stuntman Mike is played greatly by Kurt Russel(who I believe really deserved some awards buzz for his supporting performance). Stuntman Mike is obsessed with these girls, so he decides to follow them. Well, let me tell you that his car is 100% death proof, and that throughout the film he manages to pull of crazy car stunts. Death Proof is so well built up too, it is one of those films you know is leading to something great, and when it does, in the end, you will not be disappointed. Some of the car chase scenes are one of the greatest in history, and the direction Quentin Tarantino uses is simply amazing. I think that Death Proof as a whole, is stronger than Planet Terror.Grindhouse also has fake trailers attached to the film itself. Before Planet Terror starts, and after it ends, before Death proof, there are a whole bunch of fake trailers attached that are simply amazing. For example, trailers like 'Machete'(which Rodrigues did). Other trailers are 'Thanksgiving'(probably the best, done by Eli Roth), and 'Don't' and 'Werewolf Women of the S.S.'(done by Rob Zombie). The trailers really help us to recognize the film as a 'grindhouse' experience. Throughout Grindhouse, there are missing scenes, called 'missing reels' attached(or more like taken out)purposely. It is just a part of the film that was done to make it look 'old' and 'antique'. There are also a lot of great actors, acting in Planet Terror was purposely done bad, as were old films back in the day. Rose Mcgowan has apart in both films, and Freddy Rodr√≠guez and Josh Brolin also have parts in the film.Overall, Grindhouse is a cinematic achievement. The most original and exciting film of the year, of the decade for that. It is too bad that is flopped in the box office, because it is guaranteed a cult status. Actually, it already has become a sort of a cult classic. A must-see for film lovers.",Null,0,1,30 May 2008
The Artist," Marvelous and completely enchanting!
","The Artist has been an awards favorite for some time. It's a silent film in the way of 1920's cinema, so what's there not to like about it? It's a very simple film, but all the more glorious because of it.The film is essentially about a silent film star who starts fading into oblivion when the 'talkies' start taking over. On the other end, he forms a friendship with an upbeat and cheerful Hollywood-hopeful, who starts becoming the new big thing. Even though the film has been critically praised, I've heard some criticisms about this film. I've heard some critics call it too light, too simple to be anything incredible or meaningful. Some even call this a gimmick in some sort. I had some reservations because of that, but I couldn't disagree more. The film may have a simple plot with a simple arc, but it's directed with incredible energy and talent. I never once looked away, and no other film this year has made me as happy or had me smiling as much as this. It's not just because of how happy it is, but it's such an amazing technical achievement. The art direction is fantastic, and the cinematography even experimental at times. The music is amazing, and it had me grasped in it's ever-changing tone and melody. The entire supporting cast is great, but it's the two lead characters who hold our attention. Bejo is charming and quite loving, but the real star here is Jean Dujardin. He commands the screen with his changing facial expressions and the pitch in which he performs. I haven't seen someone as charismatic in a very long time, and he has delivered what is the best male performance of the year. Believe the hype. I sort of expect some sort of inevitable backlash by some people for a film like this winning major awards, but it is quite simply, one of the best of the year. This is why we go to the movies!",Null,3,6,20 January 2012
La La Land," Charming and, yes, magical
","Oh yeah, the backlash is going to be huge with this one. Especially when it's up against more 'important' films like Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea. I definitely had problems with the film. I found its main themes and conflicts to be quite unoriginal. I also thought the screenplay at times didn't know where to go and was only really at its strength when it was building moments and scenarios for the songs. In that respect the film isn't unlike Whiplash, which also had a screenplay that was its biggest weakness. Unlike that film though, I think the screenplay is definitely more than adequate enough for building this world around the characters. I can imagine many people taking heat for preferring this film over many of the other Oscar contenders. I can see criticisms of it being too 'basic' and too 'simple'. On a pure filmmaking level, the film is gorgeous and so brilliantly-made, but I also think the two leads do a great job of building that emotional connection. Is the film complex? Not particularly, and that's going to be part of the backlash. Does it need to be? Not really, no. Only because it isn't complex doesn't mean that it's not a film worthy of praise for everything it accomplishes. I think it's easy to look past how utterly charming and magical it honestly is. I definitely had problems with it throughout but it wasn't until the last several minutes where all of my problems sort of dissipated, concluding in the final minute that made me more emotional than all other films I've seen this year aside from Moonlight's final scenes. It was at this moment where I realized how much I enjoyed it and how much of a connection I formed with the characters. I feel because of this, because it's not about particularly thought-provoking or cerebral themes and because it basically succeeds or fails on one's own personal experience watching it (all films do, but many of them don't highlight the personal subjectivity as much as this one) it's going to receive a lot of backlash. But what the film did make me appreciate and realize more is that we shouldn't take the little moments, specific moments in our everyday lives, for granted. No other film this year has taught me to become more mindful of the moment and to enjoy the present. In that respect, it's escapism at its most effective. For that the film should be celebrated and for that I deeply admire what it did. Is it my favorite film of the year? No. Will I be as enamored with it in the future? Perhaps not as much as now. But what an experience it surely was. But now having said all of that, do I think it's a particularly 'great' film? Not really sure.To now more specifically talk about the performances... Emma Stone is just an incredibly charismatic and charming actress. It's not a very dramatic role, but it doesn't need to be. I definitely do have a hard time seeing her win the Oscar though. Ryan Gosling is good and also has some of the same charm, but he suffers here from what I believe he has suffered in many of his films the last few years. He has a certain 'too cool for school' persona that gets infused into all of his performances. It works for certain roles (like Drive) but I honestly can't help but feel what another actor could have brought to the table. I think he's at his best playing alongside Stone, but his individual performance? Not really sure it should be up for any award nominations personally.",Null,3,7,22 December 2016
Saw," One of the most twisted and horrifying films ever made!
","Saw really is a modern horror classic. It is so original, and it really has something to say about the human condition. Im going to start off with the amazing direction by James Wan. He cleverly directed this film, and he really made the film be what it is. The suspense and the atmosphere the film has is so scary and disturbing, but at the same time you cannot look away. I thought the writing was really great. Sure, it did have some flaws in the script, but overall, it balanced great mystery and very well developed characters. The acting ranges from great to bad. For the most part, it is great, especially from Leigh Whannell, who is really strong. But Cary Elwes will be the actor people talk about. Why? Simply because he really gives a memorable performance. Do not get me wrong, I said memorable, not great. He does have some great scenes, but some of his scenes range from bad to horrible. But at the same time, I could not help but appreciate what he did. At least he gives different acting ranges, and this is a performance that really split me. I cannot say it was perfect, it was great at times, but I cannot say it was horrible, although it certainly bordered on bad. Michael Emerson is great for his small screen time. Tobin Bell's creepy voice really adds something to the film. The movie's lighting and editing were also very well done, very original also. The film at times even reminded me of other crime classics like The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. Truly, Saw is a very remarkable film. Like I said, not flawless, but it really achieves so many aspects that a lot of horror films never do. It manages to be gory, but also manages to get into your head. I really disagree with some of the negative criticism the film gets for being 'torture porn', because that is not what the film is. It does have a lesson to teach, as well as one of the most iconic characters ever put on screen, Jigsaw. Bravo to Saw, sure to become a classic in horror and mystery.",Null,0,1,8 April 2009
Mama," So flawed but beautiful
","There's so many conflicting emotions I felt about this film. Let's start with the negatives because there were quite a lot. The screenplay needed to be a lot better. Some of the plot developments feel completely forced, and the characters seem to make some truly stupid decisions. I usually overlook this in most horror films, but the fact that I found myself rolling my eyes several times at what the characters were doing is a huge flaw. Despite the screenplay not being all that good (or maybe decent with just way too many problems), there's an originality to its tone and to its final act that make it stand out among other recent horror films. Sure, it has several jump scares, and for people not a fan of that it might not work. But the jump scares were effective and always seemed creatively executed that it just made up for the other screenplay factors. Despite the writing not being very strong, the central plot here is. The backstory to the 'evil' is very interesting, and the climax is rather beautiful and very touching.The other thing that made the film work as much as it did despite being completely problematic is Jessica Chastain. She's already one of my favorite actresses working right now with only a few films that I've seen her in, but there's no sense of naivety or immaturity in her acting. She feels completely in the zone every time I see her in any film and this is no exception. And although the circumstances by which her character becomes the lead is one of the most contrived plot developments in the film, once she's the lead you really don't mind at all. Overall, the climax bumps my grade up even more. Definitely a creepy film with some truly fantastic visual imagery and a truly fascinating 'villain' that perhaps warranted a better film, but still works nonetheless.",Null,1,3,26 April 2013
Super 8," Fantastic!
","I cannot believe I waited this long to finally seen J.J. Abram's Super 8. The film brings to mind all of those classic sci-fi kids' films that are built upon mystery. It has so many things going for it. It has mystery, but it also has a real connection with its audience. I was fully connected with the characters, and the action sequences were amazing (the highlight being the train wreck in the beginning). This feels through and through like a film Spielberg would have made two decades ago. I also want to talk about the great performances from the kids. Seriously, they drive the plot. I want to specifically talk about Joel Courtney. He expresses so much with his performance so subtly. Not once did he feel awkward. He was able to give a very professional performance full of feeling. Like I said, Super 8 also brings back the nostalgia from when we were kids. Many films have tried to do this, but in all honesty, I don't remember any recent film that has succeeded quite like this. Super 8 is a charming, very entertaining, and completely satisfying science-fiction film that is sure to stay among the 10 best of the year.",Null,1,3,5 December 2011
Sinister," Surprisingly really great
","I've always been someone who's never really scared of 95% of horror films out there. Even when some horror films scare me, they only do it to a certain degree. So either I've turned into a total coward or this is one of those 5%, because I found myself quite unsettled and truly terrified for much of this film's running time. Much of that is because of the really atmospheric music score, which incorporates many sounds that only heighten the suspense. There hasn't been a horror score this brilliantly orchestrated or scary in a very long time.And while there are definite jump scares in this one, I think, for the most part, they truly worked. The suspense-building was unbearable at times, and the murder mystery at the core is also truly strong. You kinda see how the film will end 20 minutes before it's over, but it still had some more twists that surprised me. It does get a bit implausible, but nothing totally crazy or anything that kills the mood. This is definitely a very strong horror film backed by a pretty effective lead performance from Ethan Hawke.",Null,1,3,14 March 2013
Up," Another Masterpiece from Pixar
","Just like Pixar's other films, Up is an entertaining and heartwarming family adventure. It is so well done, the opening scenes are so touching and so engaging that it gives you memories of other Pixar films like this. Pixar is the best film studio in the world right now. Every year, they make another Masterpiece. This one is probably in the top three. It is also the funniest Pixar film to date I think. The beauty of the animation and the music all comes along so well, no one can do it as Pixar. It also surprised me in the amount of action it has. I think this is a more family-friendly film than Ratatouille and WALL-E(which, together with Up, make some of the best animated films ever made. Nothing more can be said about Up. Pretty much the perfect animated film. Go see Up!",Null,0,1,7 June 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Thought-provoking and Unique!
","I very much anticipated A Clockwork Orange. I consider Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey to be the best film ever made, and the only Kubrick film I have seen until now. A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant and very unusual work of film-making. I am sure many people, and critics, still dismiss it to this day of some sort of nasty piece of work, especially when taken out of context and because many will think Kubrick is trying to make us emphasize with Alex and his violent acts because of the different music, especially the ending titles. One can argue that the ending credits' 'Singing In The Rain's' cheery tone is meant to make us feel happy for Alex's transformation back to the way he was. It is true that A Clockwork Orange is a piece of futuristic fiction but also true that Kubrick tries to clear out it's themes in a satirical way. It even does not feel futuristic at all when thought about because it's presentation of ultra-violence can be seen in the present, even today. It is a meditation on society, and even nearly 40 years later that is still clear when I watched it. It is clear because of the dark comedic aspects of the film. A Clockwork Orange's themes are horrifying, because it then seems to first ask, then answer, the question about whether our basic human instincts, whether violent or not, should be respected and not tampered with instead of clarifying them to make a simple, clean solution. I have heard from many people, mostly young, that they love this film because they think it is 'cool'. Of course, the violence and the way scenes are filmed will surely please many audiences who really are not sure what to make of a film like this that, if done differently, would not satisfy them. It is all about style for some, and about what a film holds, but not about what a film means. If this is the case, then it would certainly be better if these people simply did not like this film and called it 'boring' or 'confusing', words that are given to many classics today. The film is taken out of context into something that is almost like abusing it's maturity, which can be seen in the actual film itself. A Clockwork Orange is truly a genius film. I can already foreshadow the time that I will set a date to rewatch it, since like 2001, it is a film that requires multiple viewings. The film is in itself a very disorienting and, clearly, risky film.",Null,0,1,20 February 2010
The Fly," Fantastic
","I saw the 1958 version of The Fly last week. That version was definitely good and way more faithful to the short story, but it's this version that sticks out even more. Much more effective, better made, overall more cinematic and much more memorable, this is body horror at its finest (or should I say, ugliest). The acting is great, Goldblum really sells the character even though on first glance he looks nothing like a scientist like that should. Davis is also effective. I've only seen a few of Cronenberg's films but this is easily my favorite of his, and you can see why it made him as famous as it did. This is strongly recommended to all audiences.",Null,0,1,6 November 2013
Reservoir Dogs," Pretty thrilling
","It certainly took me long enough to catch Tarantino's debut feature. I've grown to like him less with time. I still absolutely love Inglourious Basterds, and to a lesser extent, Death Proof and kIll Bill, but his others leave me cold. Yes, that includes Pulp Fiction. This is sort of like that. I admire it more than I enjoyed it, and I'm less attuned to his style of filmmaking now than I used to be. The turns in the story are refreshing and it was good that I was still able to be surprised at times. Overall, not a film I loved and not one I totally embrace, but one that I think is more than fine with some great performances (especially Tim Roth).",Null,0,0,25 November 2014
Love & Mercy," Sensitively done, with a certain charm and care
","There's something truly unique about this film. I hadn't seen looked at the reviews and at all of the praise heaped upon the film, so I just assumed it would be this formulaic average Hollywood feature. It's certainly not art-house, but it's certainly something different. There's a certain sense of melancholy and real sadness that permeates the entire film. On the surface it's very optimistic and it certainly starts off that way, but it's trying to reflect on themes that are more complex than what I would have originally guessed. I'm not a huge fan of Paul Dano, but he's just perfect here, and this is John Cusack's best role in quite some time. Elizabeth Banks also radiates such warmth and grace, and she's the emotional anchor in more ways than one. Definitely surprising, a sensitive, gentle, offbeat and humorous, but effectively powerful film that will grab you in more ways than one.",Null,3,5,30 August 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," A beautiful and charming tale! Ranks as Dreamworks' best
","How To Train Your Dragon was a very surprising delight. I certainly did not expect a film of this high caliber. The story and the characters are strong, the direction graceful, and the animation beautiful. It is an animated film that goes back to the classic animated films where, while the animation is enough to get people excited, it's writing is what grabs your heart and never lets go. The voice-overs are great, and the two main characters, Hiccup and Toothless, are probably the most thoughtful and moving animated characters since the duo in WALL-E. And in this time, where most of the films in 3-D really do not need it, the 3-D in this actually boots your excitement level and enhances you into the story a lot more. I think as far as 3-D in animation goes, this is the best I have ever seen. The music score is also amazing, and I loved listening to it, especially in the subtle scenes between Toothless the Dragon and Hiccup bonding.It has been a long time since Dreamworks has come out with a really great film, especially an animated one, but this is finally it! It surprised me, not only because it is Dreamworks, but because it is March and not the time of year to release a film like this. But BRAVO!",Null,6,11,28 March 2010
Rocky," Heartfelt and entertaining
","There are probably no people who have never heard of Rocky. But I surely had never seen it. I guess it was just one of those films that didn't appeal as much, but I watched it in preparation for Creed. I think it's a pretty entertaining film with its heart in the right place, and certainly more than just a 'boxing' film. I guess I never really considered Sylvester Stallone as much of an actor, but here he really shows such great natural charisma and quiet, sensitive strength. His resilience is noticeable and he really makes the character his own in a way that I don't think the screenplay did. Overall, I don't think it's a totally amazing film, but definitely very good and very pleasing, and I can see why its Best Picture win hasn't been begrudged by many.",Null,2,2,21 December 2015
Don't Breathe," Feverish, brutal, and so much fun
","I knew basically nothing other than hearing it was a 'home invasion' horror film. I intentionally didn't read anything on it or watch any trailers, and thank goodness. It safely continues the trend of great horror this year. Wickedly brutal, bonkers crazy, and so, so ridiculous. That last thing is said with absolute love and glee though. Like 10 Cloverfield Lane earlier this year, it knows it's basically a B-flick in every sense of the word and Fede Alvarez runs away with it. The film never actually turns into a comedy horror film because it's never that obvious, and yet you can sense the filmmakers laughing with glee while making it. The filming and directing itself is really well done. Although it doesn't hit the the genre highs that Green Room (a film that is also similar in its frenzied and feverish pacing and narrative) hit, it still does so much justice to this genre. The acting itself is also pretty good, with Jane Levy continuing to be the MVP and continuing her talent from Evil Dead. She and Alvarez make a great team.",Null,4,8,4 September 2016
Eyes Wide Shut," Stanley Kubrick creates a film that still stands out among his filmography... A Masterpiece
","1...2...3... Eyes Wide Shut! I always like to review films as soon as possible because I like to have a review that has been written right out of emotion after a film ends. It is only after time passes that I will see how my initial thoughts on it has changed or not. I don't even think that this will be put in effect here, simply because I doubt there will be much change in how I feel about this film as time passes by.Kubrick is known for succeeding in creating films in different genres. Yet, one can still see his signature in all of his films. That is also present here, especially in the opening 20 minutes. Yet, it also stands- out quite apart from the rest of his films I have seen. It never once left me feel unattached. It never lingered for me, it never became dull at one moment. First off, the acting. The only time I have seen a great performance by Cruise was in Magnolia (also the same year as this). I wouldn't call him a great actor because of one great performance though. This role demanded something different... and he was solid. It was not a great performance by any means, but he did well enough. Yet I can't help but think that maybe a better actor would have been more than capable of turning in a better performance. Cruise is out-staged by Nicole Kidman, who does have a lot of great performances under her belt, this being no exception. In fact, compared to her work in The Hours, The Others, and even Dogville, this performance might still be her finest yet. I don't like putting out sections of films apart, and I won't do that except for the section in the middle of the film that is perhaps some of the finest filmmaking I have seen. It is an eerie, moody, sort of horrifying and suspenseful sequence that reminded me a lot of David lynch. It's truly captivating and absorbing filmmaking, and even Kubrick should be proud of that. I am surprised to say that this is also a very ambiguous film, perhaps even his most ambiguous (yeah, I know, how is that possible when 2001 still exists). I think I can safely say that this is Kubrick's 3rd masterpiece (out of 6 Kubrick films seen, impressive!). I also recommend it to fans of Lynch (who is probably my other favorite director).",Null,1,5,11 June 2011
Sicario," Astute, austere, and technically marvelous
","This was not what I expected, but perhaps that's why it was so talked about and loved by many. A contemplative, quiet thriller that is technically marvelous. It starts off really solid, but it's only as it keeps going that it really grabs you and shakes you in a powerful way. On the surface, I was ready to call its main flaw being its thin screenplay, but it's definitely in its third act where everything seems to pay off in terms of what it was doing and how it was altering expectations of some sort. I don't think the reveal of Del Toro and Brolin is surprising, but it also didn't seem to go entirely like I had assumed it would It reminds me a lot of Drive in terms of its mood being its primary strength and the reason its screenplay seems to come full circle by the end. Like I said, visually marvelous without calling attention to itself. Its assured editing, score, and cinematography probably make it a stand-out in each of those categories. I don't think there are many more films as carefully-drawn as this one this past year. Del Toro should have been in contention for more awards and for an Oscar nomination, and Emily Blunt's 'Quiet, strong action heroine type', although it's threatening to become a clich√© by this point, is to its full effect here. I liked Incendies and Prisoners well enough (although the latter's screenplay drag it down quite a bit), but last year Villeneuve really showed his directorial skills, and they're just heightened here in his best film yet",Null,1,3,19 December 2015
The Descent," A tense and very well made horror film!
","The Descent was a very nice surprise. I thought it was very well-shot and directed, had some very good writing, and very tense at times. I loved the claustrophobic feel the film gave me, and how it was all done underground. It really made me appreciate how horror films like these can be, and how America cannot do horror films like these often. The acting was very good, all performances were solid. The creatures were very scary, and we really root of all of the characters. Overall, this is nothing too original, but the execution is, and there has not been a horror film like this in the decade. Very good film, and I recommend it to practically anyone who loves horror films, and those who do not will also get creeped out by it.",Null,0,1,23 August 2009
Pulp Fiction," A Masterpiece with the strongest screenplay and acting you will ever see!
","Well, the first time I saw Pulp Fiction I was kinda bored with the dialogue, but I still knew it was a 'quality' film(I saw it like a year ago). The second time I saw it with my parents, and I ended up hating it. The reason is because my parents were SO mad at me for seeing the film, they despised it, saying it had drugs, it was pointless, and the gay rape scene really shocked them. They told me to throw the DVD away. Wel, that hate has stayed on with me, but since I am making a top 55 list, I want to see where it places. I mean, if I hate it, then it wont be that high, YET I know it is a good film.I watched it for a third time, and I have to say, this time I enjoyed it the most. I watched it by myself in my room, just hearing the great dialogues. The screenplay is probably the best for someone to read. The way the film starts, and goes in unchronological order is simply well done. It was a genius idea. The memorable lines, dialogues between Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega, the great scenes between Vincent and Jules. Yes, it is very dark, not in a scary way, but in a comedic disturbing way, and that is probably why my parents hated it so much. I can say that it truly is a landmark of a film. It created a whole new path for films. It began great dialogue scenes between characters, and it is the mother of all 'character developments'. There are a lot of scenes that seem 'unimportant', but that is the beauty of Pulp Fiction. That is also the reason why a lot of people hate it, but to deny it's brilliance is so not understandable.The film says so little, yet so much, It is a film about god. That is what I believe, since Jules goes through revelations. The whole film is to show how cruel the world can be, having some of the weirdest, most shocking, disturbing scenes ever. A man talks to a child about how his father and himself had to have a gold watch up their asses for years... How insane! We see a man who is called 'The Gimp' and how he helps another man rape other men. We see a woman talking about how she wants a pot belly, and that she wants blueberry pancakes. We see A man talking to a kid who is sitting in the back of the car, then the kid is accidentally shot in the face... These are just some of the situations that happen. Not to mention really famous scenes that come from this movie, like an overdose, and probably one of the greatest hostage crisis in history, in a restaurant! Another aspect why this film works so well is because of the acting. A great certain of performances in this film look like they should all deserve Oscar nominations at least. The most notable must be Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield. His performance is so strong and exhilarating and out of the water that you can tell he got some buzz, and he should have actually won the Oscar(under leading, because he really had the same amount of screen time that Travolta had). Uma Thurman's performance as Mia Wallace also deserved the Oscar. Her acting was so fresh, she really made the character her own. John Travolta was also very good, but I think there were better. Amanda Plummer as Honey Bunny in the restaurant scenes, she really also deserves an Oscar nomination. Tim Roth also was worthy of it. Of course, the reason the actors are able to shine is because of the screenplay(the best part of the film). It is surely in the top 3 I have ever read.Pulp Fiction is a Masterpiece, whether you like it or not. It surely helped for a lot of film events, such as the unchronological order of scenes, the way dialogue is written, as well as mystery(what's in the case?) This is a force to be reckoned with.",Null,0,1,27 May 2008
Les Mis√©rables," Incredible
","Les Miserables had been my most anticipated for several weeks now. I've never seen the stage musical, but I did read the novel because of the film's hype. I also barely see any musicals, and the amount that I have seen in my life could probably be counted in less than two hands. I will try to put out all my thoughts on this, so please bare with me.I've heard countless of endless criticisms of two particular aspects. The first of them is Tom Hooper, and how uninspired his directing was, how sloppy, how dull, and how plain bad it is. The reason being because of the close-ups, of him allowing the camera to be way into the actors' faces, not allowing the material to breathe. I did expect it to be a little annoying, but I am honestly surprised at all of the exaggeration. The only real time it felt awkward was Valjean's Soliloquy. After that, it either worked very well or there really were no extreme close ups. Examples of some songs being unedited is Fantine's I Dreamed a Dream and Eponine's On My Own, both of which stay in the characters' faces. But the camera is never stationary besides very few scenes, and both scenes work extremely well. Aside from that, all of the countless criticisms of the camera not showing anything else besides close-ups is so not warranted. If anything, I think Tom Hooper makes the film work well, and he actually has more control of this than The King's Speech.The other point of criticism is one of the cast members, Russell Crowe. The biggest criticism is that he has a horrible voice. Again, I don't see many musicals, but I thought Crowe had one of the most satisfying voices of the cast. It worked extremely well with his character, and that's because Crowe plays Javert with such a stoic approach, but it makes Javert all that more menacing and sympathetic throughout the film's story. Completely fascinating and engrossing performance from Crowe, and probably the MVP of the film. I wouldn't have expected that at all. The biggest reason I bought into the hype for this film was because of Anne Hathaway. I admit, I have seen the teaser trailer and clips of her in the film countless of times, and perhaps that's why I was a bit underwhelmed? Don't get me wrong, Hathaway is great, but also gives the most calculated performance of the film. It's all rather, I don't know, obvious? Still, I feel completely wrong for even pointing out anything because as a whole, she's a success if anything. On the other hand, Samantha Barks gives a performance in a different vein to the rest of the cast members. There's a true sense of despair in her that doesn't feel rehearsed, a true sense of wonder and longing that she conveys in spirit with just one look. In a way you can tell she's not an experienced film actor but I think she helps her character's limited screen time very much, and as a whole is one of the most memorable and sympathetic characters. Redmayne and Tveit both have amazing voices, and both do their characters complete justice. Redmayne is completely heart- breaking and his solo one of the most powerful in the film. Cohen and Carter bring in a lot of much needed lightness to the picture, and I think their characters remain much needed in the span of it all. Hugh Jackman is also a force to be reckoned with, carrying the picture brilliantly and never missing a note in his acting, even when his singing occasionally falters.The criticisms of Crowe and Hooper aren't just incredibly bewildering to me after having seen it, but so are the countless of critical reviews. This has its fair share of detractors, with many of the criticisms calling it just completely bombastic and unshamelessly and endlessly sentimental, to the point that it pleads for emotion from the audiences. I had read the novel and knew the story and so I expected that, but while it's moving, it never feels as overbearing as many critics said. Overall, I already feel like I want to rewatch this, but it's definitely satisfying and one of the best films of the year, if not the best. At the same time however, there was so much hype and endless anticipation on my part that it feels like I won't be able to fairly grade it until a rewatch. Perhaps that's why I seemed to feel somewhat different to what nearly all were saying about the film, expecting exactly that what I had heard (for example, Hooper's direction and Hathaway's extraordinary performance). I somehow loved this a lot, but at the same time am fairly cautious on what I want to say about it as a whole. But it worked, incredibly engrossing film and a true movie experience.",Null,2,5,28 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Not as good as the first
","Do I think this film is a decent watch? Sure. Is it great? Not by any means, and that is why it's frustrating to see it get such a favorable reception with the usual audience. Marvel makes okay films, but they're all pretty much still being done within the same formula. Th jokes here don't always land, and it tries way too hard to be hip and cool. Despite that, there's still some good chemistry between the characters and some good acting to be found here. The film could have been a lot worse. It's just disappointing that it's not trying to go beyond the barriers set by the first film.",Null,4,10,13 May 2017
Titanic," The Masterpiece about the two lovers in the sinking ship.

I remember that at the end, when Jack dies, and Rose is left in the ocean that I cried a lot. A lot of people surely cried. In the last year, I have started to use IMDb, and I see Titanic gets a lot of hate. Well, I decided to see it again to refresh my memory.Let me start off by saying that Titanic gets a lot of hate because of its weak screenplay. Yes, the screenplay is the biggest problem. No, it is not horrible, but there are a lot of cheesy and badly written lines. Some scenes are very unrealistic(like Jack grabbing Rose when she slips in her red dress with only his hand). Also, like when Rose and Jack start to run away from water. Scenes like this make the film look bad, and some lines and dialogue seem unnecessary and poor. BUT let me tell you, that if Titanic wanted to give some emotion to its audience, then in that way, it does not disappoint or fail. The chemistry between Rose and Jack(played beautifully by Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio) is strong. Their love seems real, even though at times it feels too forced, and the way they met is unrealistic. BUT in having a romance story together with a real life tragic, it is done very well. The production design is very well done. The ship and the effects(i am sorry for saying the effects were bad, after seeing it all, they were not), well, they are magnificent. All the stuntmen and the effects done in the actual sinking of the ship is simply amazing. The last hour of the film is so intense, and it looks so realistic, visually, that you can't help but love it for that. Some scenes are so monumental, they are some of the most tragically horrifying scenes in cinema history. The costumes are also well done, for the period of 1912.Another great aspect of the film was the acting. Kate Winslet deserved her Oscar nomination, as did Gloria Stuart. All the actors were on par. The music in the film is simply heartbreaking, The original song by Celine Dion is just WOW. One of the best songs in film history, and its Oscar win is very well deserved. The direction is simply inspiring.Titanic as a whole is satisfying for every film lover. For people who like to be entertained, this is a great film for them, because even though it has some problems, it never fails to entertain, or to emotionally connect with. Yes, this film gets a lot of hate, but the honest truth, is, Titanic is a Masterpiece of its time. i am sure that it will be remembered in 50 years, simple because of how well a film it is. Yes, problems or not, the fictional film about two lovers in a doomed ship just has to be remembered, whether people want it to or not. 10/10",Null,2,3,29 May 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A thrilling, spectacularly epic film!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is perhaps the most complex of the Harry Potter films. There is a lot going on, and as an adaptation, it works for the most part. There are a few things changed, and some differences and flaws that I had trouble with, but overall, it is a great film. It has spectacular action sequences, amazing visual effects, and great set designs. The music score, while not as good as the score in prisoner of Azkaban, is still very pleasant. Daniel Radcliffe definitely shows an improvement over Prisoner, but still has some problems. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint play their character exactly how they are supposed to be, and I found that Hermione seemed much more bossy and over-protective in this film than the 3rd, which is more Hermione-ish from the books. Brenda Gleeson was perfect for this role! Some of the characters could have been further developed, like Fleur or Krum, but overall, a hugely entertaining and magical Potter film. The pacing, although fast, does not have the fluent steady tone of Prisoner's pace, or the wonderful cinematography or visuals. Prisoner's storytelling was much more developed and more interested with getting ideas across instead of rushing everything, and I think that is what makes it the best Potter film. But Goblet is still a great film",Null,0,1,6 July 2009
Three Colors: Blue," Good
","One is destine to see the plot for this and think that it's yet again one of those very slow, artsy foreign films. And hey, they may not be wrong, but this is a pretty good film (not as great as the reviews say though). I liked Binoche in it, but I somehow wish another actress could have taken the role and done even more soulful and deeper stuff with her performances. In a way, it seems like a wasted opportunity. There are some truly dazzling and visually amazing shots here, the cinematography really does give the film that murkiness of the pace and of what the director is trying to get across. Overall, I recommend this, although it's not perfect.",Null,0,3,6 July 2014
The Shape of Water," Beautiful, yet disappointing.
","I agree with the few here who have said that The Shape of Water is good, even very good, but somehow it doesn't reach greatness. Although I can pinpoint why that is. The film is very well directed, but it's working with a screenplay that is perhaps simplistic and dare I say it, pedestrian. The film should have been anything but unremarkable, but that's how so much of it felt. The romance at its core was too quickly developed for my liking, causing it to feel like the film was just going through the motions instead of stopping to let us bask in its magic. In addition to being very unremarkable, the screenplay is also filled with some questionable storylines and some unimpressive, if even dry dialogue. Visually it's on point, although I would disagree that the film's cinematography is anywhere near that of something like Blade Runner 2049, which is unfortunate because it could very well win that Oscar. The score is also very nice, although again it should have been so much more memorable. The acting is definitely the best part of it. Sally Hawkins is luminous, and although I'm not sure I would rank her as being better than McDormand and Ronan (for Three Billboards and Lady Bird respectively, all three vying for the Oscar) it's an impressive performance that is deeply heartfelt. The other biggest surprise is Richard Jenkins, who lights up every scene he is in. Stuhlbarg is fine, and Shannon is disappointing. The latter is such a talented actor, but he can only do so much with such a one-note character (again, the screenplay's fault).Overall, it's worth it but in a pool of much more impressive award contenders like Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, and The Florida Project, it's a film that could have been so much more.",Null,5,8,23 December 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Entertaining
","The Matrix Reloaded is a film that is successful in it's attempt at entertainment. It does suffer from some of the flaws from the first film, most notably that it is overstuffed with plot details and story lines. But it is a Matrix film, and the good thing is that it is always high on imagination. This film certainly has some really visually amazing scenes, especially one where Neo fights off many of the same enemy. Scenes like that make it worthwhile. I am not sure if it is quite as good as the original, but it certainly is no failure, so in that respect I congratulate it.",Null,0,0,20 October 2010
The Disaster Artist," Charming and feel good
","So the finished product is different than what I thought it would be when the project was first announced. Overall, it's a good film. A very good one at times. But it's also an incredibly safe one. It makes sense considering the novel it's based on, but the film was very, very kind to Tommy and Greg. It follows a very safe formula through and through, and sticks with it to the end. However, that's also probably a good thing. I was sure Franco would try something entirely crazy, but if he had, the film might not have been very good, let's be honest. Instead, the film sticks to the rulebook, sometimes being very funny throughout (although I honestly thought it would have been a lot funnier). Overall, it's decent, very enjoyable, and ultimately very light and feel good, which is sometimes all one needs. Franco did a great job. At first it seemed like a mere imitation, but he did try to go a little deeper to try to get at some core of the character. But the real star here is Dave Franco. He absolutely carries the film and gives it its beating heart and much needed grounded approach. He's incredibly charismatic, charming, and super likable. An underrated performance overshadowed by the showier one.",Null,0,0,16 December 2017
The Fountain," Visually spellbinding and powerful!
","The Fountain is an extremely ambitious film by Darren Aronofsky. It is the story of a man Tom, who is trying to save his lover, Izzie, from her last stages of death. It spans over two other stories, one that takes place in the past and one that takes place in the future. I would be lying if I said I understood all of it. I don't, and that is why the film requires multiple viewings. However, I honestly loved it. It is not perfect, but it has some of the most visually enchanting scenes of any film in recent years. The present part of the film is touching. Hugh Jackman is very good, but flawed in all of his three roles. Rachel Weisz, however, was fantastic. I have not seen many films from her, but from the ones I did, she has never stood out to me. Here, she creates a very vulnerable and compassionate woman, and it is easy to understand why Tom loves her so much. Weisz is perfect for this role and she really shines through. One of the best female performances of 2006, and she was snubbed of an Oscar nomination. The cinematography is also flawed, but mostly beautiful. In the scenes involving Tom and the Tree in the future, it is beautiful shot, but other times, the cinematography, mostly in the opening action scene, is not handled correctly. The costumes visual effects are amazing, and the whole production design was snubbed of any real awards consideration. Now lets get to the music score. Absolutely breathtaking! Easily the best score of it's year, and probably one of the best music scores of the last five years, along with Atonement and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. The final scene of the film was fantastic and powerful because it comes to prove that the film medium can become art. Overall, The Fountain is flawed, but is ultimately a touching, sad, and powerful visually spellbinding film.",Null,0,4,9 January 2010
Zombieland," The best Zombie film ever made!
","Zombieland is PURE ADRENALIE! Simple as that. I expected a horror/comedy along the lines of Shhaun of the Dead, and that is exactly what I got, but better. The screenplay is clever, very clever. It has a lot of jokes here an there, and gags also, and it is a great screenplay, whether horror or not. The characters of Columbus and Tallahassee are written with incredible wit and depth, and you cannot wait until one of them starts talking again. Jesse Eisenberg gave a very good performance and really made us feel for his character, and because of him, I loved the film as much as I did. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin were solid, and were also a lot of fun to watch. The zombies are wicked! The film has some of the best opening credits, and the cameo by Bill Murray was great. It was hilarious, and I was surprised how much I liked this film, but not only for the zombies, but for the comedy and characters. Overall, this is a film with strong writing, accomplished directing, and very good acting and characters, no matter the genre. I am pleased to say, this is the best zombie film I have ever seen!",Null,1,6,11 October 2009

It is a crowd-pleaser, a film that will be able to cross over to the mainstream crowd, but the good thing is that it is a great film, a critical darling as well. It has a great screenplay with mesmerizing performances from the entire cast, the highlight being Leonardo Dicaprio who has never been better. It is fast- paced, wonderfully shot and edited, and the finale is amazing and will have you waiting and hoping for more. It is a worthy Best Picture Oscar winner, and if you have not seen it yet, then you really have done an injustice to your film collection.",Null,1,4,2 December 2010
Psycho," Hitchcock's Psycho is shocking and thrilling!
","So I finally watched Psycho, what many consider the best horror film of all time. Does it deserve that title? Well, I love a lot of horror films, but I have to say is it very worthy of that title. I mean, it is good not try see classics with your mind set in stone that it will be one of the best ever, because it is over time that films develop fanbases and classic status, which I am sure this film was not nearly as acclaimed as when it first came out. The film is simple, but very effective. Hitchcock's direction is fantastic, and the writing brilliant. The performances from Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh are both fantastic and in their scenes together it is mesmerizing. A lot of people cannot see this film without knowing about it's infamous scenes, most notably the shower scene. But honestly, I had heard something about a shower scene but when it happened it really shocked me and scared me. The music score is fantastic and probably the best horror score ever composed, and if not certainly in the Top 5. It enhances the uneasiness built by Hitchcock very effectively. Overall, I was not disappointed by this film, and will definitely continue to pursue Hitchcock's filmography (this being my 2nd of his after The Birds, which was also almost equally as great but more underrated)",Null,0,0,15 May 2010
The Witch," Disturbing, discomforting, visually haunting
","The Witch really puts emphasis back into the word 'horror'. Very discomforting film, filled with such a large amount of disturbing images that haven't left my mind. It always keeps you at a distance to not fully grasp what is going on, but this adds to its lingering power. It honestly feels like a horror classic that has been able to stand ground with films like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. The entire ensemble cast is incredibly strong, being able to engage in this dialogue that could have felt inorganic but feels totally lived-in and natural. Not only are the adult actors strong, but the younger actors as well. This fits in well with The Babadook and It Follows as three legitimately fantastic horror films that all came out within the span of three years.",Null,2,7,28 February 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Well-acted, amazingly directed, and with an atmosphere all of it's own.
","Rosemary's Baby is perhaps the least violent 'horror' film I have ever seen.This is my first Roman Polanski film, and he does an amazing job. His screenplay is smart in really absorbing us into these characters' lives. The first half of the film can be seen as just a regular domestic drama in a way. He creatively directs the film so that by the time the climax comes it's just utterly fantastic. I won't say that the film was unpredictable though, partly in turns because whenever one sees a 'satan' film we hear about Rosemary's Baby. It's sort of like Psycho's big twist. It has had such a large legacy that it's shocking if you don't know what the film is really about.Saying that however, this is a meticulously detailed drama-turned mystery- turned thriller- turned horror film. It's also quite fascinating how little I got based on actual physical horror. I thought Mia Farrow was fantastic in this.",Null,1,2,24 April 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Truly exceptional film-making, Jessica Chastain becomes a star
","Zero Dark Thirty was one of my most anticipated of the year for many reasons. First, I loved The Hurt Locker and it's probably my favorite recent Best Picture winner. Secondly, Jessica Chastain, an actress that broke out in 2011 with several fantastic performances, was starring in it, her first true lead role. This would be a role that would, essentially, define the rest of her career. The film has been raved about quite a bit, but one thing was certain based on reviews, and that was that it was very much a journalists' films, presenting information and information about countless of attempts to get closer to Bin Laden. Because of this, I did expect exactly what I got from it and from Chastain. A film like this is definitely not going to be loved by the mainstream that want something a little more 'dramatic'. I'm quite surprised it's gotten the level of acclaim The Hurt Locker got, because fortunately, it stands on its own. This isn't the showy technical film Hurt Locker was, not the showy directorial film that was. But its gripping all the way through to the final act, which is among the best things I've seen all year. There's not much to say for it except that one has to surrender to what the film is and not ask for what it isn't. I already expected it would be what it was so I wasn't surprised or disappointed, but I can see many people dismissing this. I am quite surprised Chastain has gotten so many critic wins for this performance though. It's just not meaty in the slightest, meaty in the sense of drama or any real character-arc that defines awards. I wasn't even sure I would want her to win anything for this during most of the film. But in her last scenes, her performance comes together. I realized just how much Chastain had done with, arguably, so little. There are tons of supporting performances that have a lot more to do when it comes to dramatic stakes, but Chastain makes it work with her face. The best thing that can be said about her is that there are not many actresses that would be able to make this character work as well as she did. The emotional baggage she carries underneath without ever having anything to show in terms of dramatic satisfaction, and the way she lures you to the screen, proves that she has a powerful presence. Even with how detached the film is from her character in terms of not really digging into her most of the time, it's her film. It's her face that haunts you by the end of it when you realize just how much she did. If you weren't sure about it before, this marks the beginning of a true star.This is a film that I see haunting my subconscious more and more and that will refuse to leave my mind. Another jackpot for Bigelow and Boal? Definitely.",Null,27,81,4 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Excellent acting, fantastic writing, clever experiment
","Electrifying and riveting. Those are really the two words that encapsulate the film the best. I had heard about a three-act structure but I wasn't aware that it would be what it was. I found it clever and highly engrossing, and lent itself very well to Sorkin's style of writing. I have heard much about how Michael Fassbender's performance isn't the type to win. Yes and no. I think in terms of pure effectiveness, it was an immensely successful, fantastic performance. He really inhabited that character upside down. In terms of showiness? It's not particularly showy, and it's also not some transformation. I can definitely see it not being enough for some people, but what else did people expect? Kate Winslet's role is also not very showy in terms of it being too meaty, but she has a lot of screen time and she injects the film with its heart. I thought the script was particularly strong, but I felt like some of the directorial choices at times felt a little off. The editing at times would feel disjointed and awkward. It wasn't ever any significant problem, but I do see why some think the script is the star and not Boyle. Luckily for the most part he doesn't inject it with too much flash like he has for the rest of his filmography, and at times when he does it works, but a few times it doesn't. For example, deciding to have that loud, bombastic musical score playing during the climactic Jeff Daniels/Fassbender scene in Act 2 was a mistake. The writing of it was entirely fine for what it was, but the music really made it feel sort of like a parody at times. But I also do see it as the filmmakers showing exactly how dramatic these stakes are for these characters and also making fun of that world a bit, but if so, doesn't really fit.One problem I did have was that the ending was resolved way too quickly, and it seemed way too convenient. It felt like it wad decided to just not end in a bad note, and to give Jobs his humanity back. I don't think a 'happy ending' was needed for this at all, and regardless of how it happened in real life, it just didn't entirely click for me. Any others thoughts?Overall though, highly satisfying piece of filmmaking, very entertaining, fantastic work from the ensemble and from Sorkin.",Null,1,4,25 October 2015
Crazy Heart," Pretty good
","I never saw this back when it came out, it seemed like a career Oscar for bridges. Having now seen it, no way this performance would've gotten traction had Bridges not been known. it's not a very dramatic, very showy piece of work, and it's definitely such a surprise it was able to garner such enthusiasm from different people and from the Academy as a whole. Bridges is still great though, just not what you'd expect. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also really effective. Her character doesn't have a whole lot of notes to play but she does everything pretty well and while her Oscar nod came as a real shock, not totally undeserving. It's a nice performance, in a nice but unextraordinary film.",Null,3,3,30 December 2014
Mudbound," Flawed, but fantastic acting
","I don't know how to feel about this. There's so much to admire, the biggest being its cast. It's some great work by an incredibly talented cast, with Jason Mitchell and Garrett Hedlund being the best in show. They both deliver some truly fantastic work. The biggest shame is that the film is quite messy. It tries to juggle so much, or maybe in theory it could have worked, but it's brought down so many times by some really questionable directorial choices. The film's music is sometimes overused, the editing jumpy and sometimes prevents you from getting too invested, and the cinematography quite messy. Technically, the film is incredibly flawed. It seems to lack a real sense of rhythm and consistent pacing the more it goes on, even if weirdly the character story lines also become a lot more investing. The main plot summary or premise of the film, or what all sites had it as being, doesn't really kick into gear until the second half, which makes the thing even more confusing. However, the different perspectives through which the film is shown was a great artistic choice (definitely gotten from the novel, and sometimes it does feel very rushed as well). Overall, I'm going to have to sit a bit on this one. I want to like it a lot, but as it is it's a big ol' mess. The final scenes also seem to come out of nowhere, as if the film was in a hurry to end.",Null,2,6,21 November 2017
Love Actually," Contrived
","The thread for St Vincent reminded me I'd seen this on Saturday. So, why should I care about these characters? Most of them aren't well-developed, and even when they were, the film's following a clearly defined formula that nothing has any emotional impact because it feels exactly like a movie. There needs to be something grounded in reality for me to feel something, but there's none of that in here. Being grounded in reality doesn't mean not having magic, or fantasy, or supernatural etc, because any type of genre film could be created with some real sense of emotion. But every emotion the characters feel here are so clearly created for an audience to feel something that the complete contrivance of every moment feels like exactly that, a contrivance. There's absolutely nothing realistic here. Some of the situations that the characters find themselves here are things that could hypothetically happen in someone's life, no matter how cheesy... but the film failing to come across as anything other than a schmaltzy, overly-forced sentimental piece of fiction is really the only reason it fails, and a big enough reason to. Exactly the type of dreck I try to stay away from, and usually do until I'm with friends who won't see anything else like in this case. However, none of the actors are really at fault. Andrew Lincoln is super adorable and perfect here, and for the cast I can't say it totally fails",Null,1,3,29 December 2014
12 Years a Slave," Magnificent, powerful
","Yes, various things have been said about 12 Years A Slave already, too many things that I probably don't need to say. This is a really brilliant film in pretty much all respects. It's straight-forward and to the point in a way so that mainstream audiences aren't alienated, but the directing, writing, and acting are all spectacular. Much praise has been given to Ejiofor, Fassbender, and Nyong'o, and all deserve it. But I haven't heard much about Sarah Paulson, who I thought was despicable and so, so cold in all the right ways that her character needed to be Just like Nyong'o, she should be up in contention for an Oscar nomination.

Sausage Party," Better than expected
","The case for Sausage Party is a strange one. Although it got mostly good reviews, it seemed like many audience members really disliked it. All of the criticisms of it made me lower my expectations greatly. Perhaps that's why I found it to be a sort of fun, sort of entertaining, decent film. I think the jokes to go too far. The writers are interested in being progressive by a lot of the dialogue, yet by the same token make fun of a large group of people by using the same types of stereotypes. It comes off kind of conflicting. The narrative itself is the best thing about it, even though there are a lot of questionable jokes and scenes played simply for laughs. Not sure if to recommend it to everyone, but I do think there's a good film hidden underneath it all.",Null,2,5,8 January 2017
There Will Be Blood," The epic American Masterpiece of the decade!
","After a third viewing of There Will Be Blood, I have to say that this film continues to amaze and fascinate me even more! Paul Thomas Anderson created a work of art here. There Will Be Blood reaches amazing heights, and has amazing achievements. First off, this film is not for the faint-hearted. Those looking for an entertaining watch, it will completely blow you away. It is a tale of an oil-man, one who has a lot of ambitions and characteristics. He is very much greedy, he wants more and more, and he is also very complicated. He is a family man, one who manages to change his life in weird aspects.This film starts, and has you on watch. There are a lot of important aspects of the story, of every scene that viewers should keep in mind. This is very much a character-story. Daniel Day Lewis plays his character, Daniel Plainview, and completely transforms himself into character. His acting, every single scene, it's as if Lewis had to completely get into this mind and soul. It is seriously a performance of the decade. Daniel day Lewis proves he is the actor to beat. Paul Dano, who plays Eli Sunday(and Paul) also gives a very different performance. Some say he overreacted, but his character is that way too. His performance totally captivates the character, and the way his character lives. The script is seriously amazing!!! This film is a lot about religion, faith, greed, family, etc. It has almost everything that a film should have. It has moral lessons and themes, and very haunting scenes.From the technical part, this film succeeds. The set designs and the cinematography are simply first-rate. The musical score is simply WOW! It really defines a genre of music scores of the last decade, and it is so haunting! The direction that Anderson took is amazing. He had to really create passion and force to every single scene. Every single scene is driven powerfully, and you are never left wondering why it was done that way, but to just capture more to the audience.This film is perfect! There is no other word. It is in many ways a horror film, it is in many ways a life-lesson, and also a tragedy. It has one of the most intense and powerful endings in cinema history(if not the best!) It truly is the best film of the decade, and one of the best films ever made! A force to be reckoned with!",Null,4,7,9 July 2008
Joker," Well filmed but empty
","What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a 'masterpiece' have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.",Null,46,93,11 October 2019

It is a great American Motion Picture. The screenplay is so faithful to the classic novel, it is just brilliant. The performance by Gregory Peck is so powerful and surreal. He represents a true American icon. The acting by the young cast was also impressive. The court scenes are just so wonderfully shot and acted. The stand-out besides Peck to me was Collin Wilcox Paxton, who in a short scene plays Mayella Ewell. I thought she was absolutely fantastic and stole that scene completely. She was robbed of an Oscar nomination. The score and cinematography are so beautiful, even in black and white.Overall, this a fantastic film that needs to be seen.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Amazing
","It's taken me some time, but I've finally seen One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. An amazing film it is, with the entire cast doing incredibly strong work. I'm not going to do a long review, but there's such majestic beauty in this that amounts to a larger picture. The ending is amazing, and worthy of awe-inspiring chills at the same time. Nicholson is fantastic in the lead role, the best I've ever seen him and if anything now I'm more interested in seeking out the rest of his extensive filmography and acclaimed performances I haven't seen. Then there's the infamous Nurse Ratched, but I didn't get what I expected. She's the worst kind of villain, but also the most interesting kind, one where her actions aren't exactly what makes you truly despise her but the way she goes about her manners. Fletcher is amazing and is probably one of my all-time favorite supporting female performances now (let's be honest here. Just like Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs, category fraud at its worst). Brad Douriff also stands out from the supporting cast. Truly fantastic.",Null,1,3,15 March 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Decent
","I think the first half of this is easily better than the second. Oh sure, the second is decent enough entertainment, although it gets to be a little dull at moment. The less action-packed first half though, just provides more entertainment. It sets up the characters better, not to mention it has quite a lot of humor. The humor is what did it for me, really simple but very clever comedy that did have me laughing out loud more than once. Cruise is pretty effective in the lead role and he lens the humor a tone of ridiculousness that only makes the film more fun. This isn't anything great, if only decent, but it's definitely worth a watch.",Null,0,2,10 July 2014
Whiplash," Riveting, intense, passionate. Simply stunning.
","I don't think I've had this intense, this passionate, this wild and soaring a film experience since, yes, Black Swan four years ago when I first saw it. They should probably put a label before the film starts warning viewers because this is probably the best depiction of a roller-coaster ride as I've ever seen a film be. How funny though, months ago when first hearing about the film, thinking it was going to be sort of like a simple and sweet story of a young man learning how to play drums. Entertainment-wise, it doesn't get any better than this really. You get completely entranced into it all. I knew J.K. Simmons was going to play a tough instructor, but gosh, was never prepared for what I got. The film wisely plays into many of your emotions at extremely high levels. It's a terrifying and intense film, and the direction is why. How Chazelle isn't being considered a front-runner for Director is anyone's guess. The film is a crowd-pleaser through and through. A scary one, a perhaps too-demented one, but a crowd-pleaser nonetheless, riding on the audience's feelings from minute to minute. If Black Swan had so much success with awards and nominations, how can't this? When that was a genre film about ballerinas and this is about playing music? Baffled. J.K. Simmons, yeah... not much else to say really, everyone's said it already. What I found surprising is that he has a ton of screen time, and the film really is about him and Teller (okay, Teller and his obsession with his music but in terms of human relationships). It's all told through Teller's perspective, so there's no category fraud, but it could've been a case, certainly because the AMPAS has nominated way shorter roles in leading. Miles Teller, again, how he isn't in the awards conversation at all is baffling, baffling to me. His part is extremely meaty, and he knocks it out of the park, stunning you in awe. He doesn't go overboard at all either, he plays it exactly as it should for it to have a huge emotional impact yet still feel realistic enough to sustain that impact. As an experience, it doesn't get much better than this. However, the film plays so much on emotional momentum and intensity and passion, that I feel like it may not be a film that holds up that well in retrospect, whether it be in months or as the years go by. I know that probably doesn't matter to quite a lot of people, but I rewatch films quite often and to me the rewatchability/retrospect factor is a big part as to why my love for certain films is sustained. I feel like certain people will be less enamored by it over time (like Black Swan) and that just like Aronofsky's thriller, many might just see it as an over-cooked, silly, unrealistic and over-the-top drama. And, perhaps worse because Black Swan is seen as a genre thriller and this a 'music drama'. I have some of those concerns too, but, the heck does it matter now...",Null,0,2,6 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Pretty wild!
","I have to say, I'm rather surprised by the amount of controversy for this, somewhat. There is quite a lot of graphic material shown, but not to the degree that I had heard. Maybe it's just me? Regardless, I'm also surprised by the critical reception to this, it's something I would've thought is a bigger hit with critics. Maybe it's just because I absolutely loved it though. It's absolutely hilarious but it gets its point across pretty strongly. Some scenes in this are absolute riots and among the most memorable in recent history. As for the performances, outstanding all across the board. I don't think I've ever liked Dicaprio more. The runtime also isn't a huge problem, and part of that is due to the fantastic pacing.",Null,1,5,2 January 2014
Army of Darkness," Grand finale to the Evil Dead trilogy!
","Sam Raimi is probably my favorite horror filmmaker. The excitement and over-the-top humor he brings to his horror films is just so wickedly entertaining. Army of Darkness was funnier than the first two Evil Dead films, and had a lot more comedy. It was a slam bang from the opening scene, and a perfect ending to this amazing trilogy. Bruce Campbell shows that he is the man and now on the list of my favorite movie heroes. Sam Raimi knows how to make the perfect horror/comedy and he does not fail to deliver yet again a horror film that is perhaps funnier than most comedies out there. All in all, another spectacular entry into this trilogy, and I think even better than Evil Dead 2 and on par with the first for different reasons.",Null,3,4,3 July 2010
Scream 2," A Bloody Good Time!
","Scream 2 is probably one of the most successful horror sequels to ever come out. It has the same tone, the same tongue-in-cheek attitude, and the same love for movies as the first does. It has some great direction from Craven, and again he makes it a bloody good time to tune in to the blood and the killings, and the who-done-it mystery. Neve Campbell is again very good as the protagonist, as is David Arquette. Courtney Cox delivers once again in giving us an unlikeable yet ultimately loving character as the film progresses, and her Gail Weathers is a very complicated persona. Sarah Michelle Gellar has the best chase scene in the film, and probably the best chase scene in any Scream film (together in the same year with what I consider the best chase sequence of all time in I Know What You Did Last Summer). Overall, this is a more than satisfying horror sequel, and stands equally in the same bar as Scream, if not higher.",Null,1,2,16 May 2010

"Hail, Caesar!"," Really underrated. Very interesting
","I thought it was greeeeeeeat. Totally not what I expected, although it's the Coens so that was my fault. I thought the trailer was kind of unexciting and to me, didn't really feel like a Coens' film. I'm not surprised audiences hated it at all, but I found it endlessly interesting, exciting, and entertaining, and thankfully, definitely a Coens' film through and through. I had no idea where it was going at any point and for a comedy, that's really, really rare. I have to admit, in terms of following the plot, many times I wasn't really sure what was going on. But I loved every second of it. It's a film entirely made of the character moments (I'm thinking back to that scene with Alden Ehrenreich waiting for his date with his limo driver, or the absolutely hilarious scene with Frances McDormand). I got so much joy out of watching it that the plot became totally secondary. I'm not really that huge of a fan of stuff like Raising Arizona or The Big Lebowski and so perhaps that's why I'm so surprised by how much I loved this. I also don't remember Josh Brolin being this great since Milk (yes, he was better here than in Sicario). I hope this gets some love come Oscar time but I doubt it. I can't wait to rewatch it and this has the makings of a cult classic (audiences hated it though, so proooobably not)",Null,2,4,3 April 2016
The Reader," Very good, but no Masterpiece
","The Reader is a great adaptation of the amazing novel. The screenplay is of the highest caliber. It revolves around everything the novel focuses on, and it gives these characters some dimension and force. Of course, the main performances here are spectacular. David Kross is very realistic, and although at times he felt awkward to me, I think he still managed to make all of his expressions be fitting and work with his character. The tour-de-force here is Kate Winslet. What is possibly her best year, giving an amazing leading performance in her other brilliant film,Revolutionary Road, here she plays her character of a different caliber that she has never done before. Her acting is certainly of the highest rank, and she deserves all the recognition. Ralph Fiennes, a great actor, managed to pull it off very well too. We feel for him, playing the older Michael. The film has some amazing cinematography, costumes, set designs, and amazing make-up. It does come with it's flaws though. I felt that some of the small actors were not up well for their writing. They were not bad, no, but maybe too bland. The music score was brilliant, but I thought at scenes it was way too loud, and went on for too long. But of course, the highs of the film bring everything to another level. Quite brilliant film",Null,2,5,21 January 2009
The Wrestler," A truly remarkable Motion Picture
","The Wrestler is a truly remarkable film.The Wrestler is done with such skill and passion. Mickey Rourke gives the best leading male performance of the year. He is just so into character here, it is also done so realistically. His performance is one that will certainly enter the classic list of male performances of all time. I thought that Marisa Tomei also gave such an incredible and realistic performance. Her portrayal of a 'hidden' stripper is perfect. She deserves an Oscar nomination. I also thought that, with all the buzz on Rourke and Tomei, people forgot about Evan Rachel Wood. Wood proves to be one of the most talented young actresses of her generation. Her performance is perfect, she captures all her feelings and emotions so well. One of the best female supporting performances of the year.Overall, such a touching and gripping film, probably the most touching of 2008. It is done with such realism, this is sure to become a sports movie classic.",Null,2,3,28 December 2008
Dark Shadows," Good, but messy
","I was disappointed in the reviews for Dark Shadows, since I hoped for a home run for Burton. Still, I went to see this, and am glad I did. It's fun and entertaining for the most part, but incredibly messy. The main problem here is the editing and pace. Whereas Alice in Wonderland's problem was that it was just weak all around in the storyline, it at least did move more coherently. Dark Shadows never really has a central storyline or purpose going, and instead feels disjointed and random. But although it does feel messy, it still has a lot of great scenes mixed throughout, and I think as for the horror and comedic aspect, it was handled appropriately. I enjoyed the cast a lot, especially Depp. So I recommend it, but it sure has a lot of flaws. It could have been put together a lot better, and it also felt like it never went 'all the way'. But, I actually did find it funny many times, and although I have not seen the TV show, I didn't find that the ambition was lacking here. It doesn't exactly feel 'lazy' as Alice did, just a sort of mishandled film.",Null,2,7,15 May 2012
Inception," A mind-blowing and breath-taking epic!
","I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan. I think he is a genius, and Inception supports that opinion to a higher extent. Inception is everything you want from a film- it is a big event of a film, epic, but also smart, complex with interesting dilemmas and a lot to talk about after it is over. To start off with a film this big I have to start off with the plot at it's core. Inception is a dream of a film, literally, and the basic plot point that a viewer needs to know is that it revolves around a man who shuffles himself through peoples' dreams. The rest of the plot is better not to be revealed, because since I did not know much of the plot before seeing it, the reason why it works so well is because I did not know what to expect. The screenplay is definitely broad and clever, but also complex. This is a film that will need multiple viewings to fully understand it's grasp, but even though there is a lot to further look at, it is still understandable to the point of not frustrating an audience. The direction is brilliant, and I am one of those who was outraged when Nolan was ignored for an Oscar nomination for Directing for The Dark Knight. He needs one for this because I doubt that there will be 5 better directorial achievements than him this year. The performances are all great and professional, although I doubt that any will get individual attention, simply because it is not a film based on performances. Saying that, I think Dicaprio proves once again that he is one of the best actors working today, while Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page are great rising stars. The performance that impressed me the most, however, was Marion Cotillard. She commands attention when she is on screen, and the reason is part of her charm but also part of the way she is able to give a fully realized performance that, while short, does need a variety of different emotions. The visual effects are amazing, the action mind-blowing and there are certain scenes that will give many goosebumps... I know I did. On a final note, Inception will surely get a reaction out of you. It left me thinking about it, even to this moment hours after I have seen it. And that ending, the final scene, absolutely brilliant! I am sure this will stand over time as Nolan's masterpiece.",Null,1,5,24 July 2010
WALL¬∑E," An animated, science-fiction Masterpiece that will go down as one of the best in history
","Let me start off by saying, that my experience while seeing WALL-E at the big screen was one of the most enjoyable I have ever had. Pixar created another amazing animated film.First off, the way the film starts off, in this future Earth, this was a very dark and deep way to start a 'kids' film. I absolutely loved it though. I thought that it set its standards as a science fiction film well. Well, we are started off seeing how our planet has been trashed completely in the last 700 years. This 'Earth' that the filmmakers created is probably one of the most visually stunning and amazing set designs I have ever seen, both in animation and live-action. The first minutes, the way the music score sets off the mood, and the way we encounter WALL-E living, in his everyday life, is very well written. The next 20 minutes, as to when Eve comes into his planet, is amazing. It is simply spectacular, it works well as a silent film. The way we are able to care for both WALL-E and Eve, because of their actions, and the way they seem to have emotions, it is simply well done. I cannot simply describe the way it is done. Not just story-wise, but visually. It was so amazing to look at, we could even see the reflections clearly on Eve's surface. Amazing introductionThe second part of the film, when Eve is sent to her spacecraft, and WALL-E joins her, it transports us to another world, simply charming. The way space is reflected, with amazing colors and textures. The way the spacecraft is designed, very futuristic, and we are given a look at to what it really is. The story then transcends to what is a green plant, and how the plant might get all these overweight people to finally get to Earth. Throughout this portion, it is also very well done. There were absolutely no flaws, but a problem that some people might have, that I kinda had, was the change in the film itself. A lot of people simply really liked the first 20 minutes, on Earth, and the quick change to another plot in Space was a lot to handle. Yes, the human characters were not really given thought to, but that is because they weren't supposed to(although the Captain really was a great developed character for his screen time). I have heard some complaints, but really, it was not really a problem. The development to WALL-E and Eve keeps going here(like it is shown in a wonderful scene that the two laugh and play out of the spacecraft, out in Space with a fire hydrant). The way the plot changed, WALL-E and Eve trying to retrieve the plant so that the humans would get to Earth, and a little Autobot(which was done purposely to resemble a classic movie character/machine, HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey) tries to stop them, well, it was all done with grace.This film, as a comedy, really was an achievement. There were a lot of parts, parts that really were genuinely funny, scenes that really got to your heart, scenes that really made you laugh. This film, even though it does have a lot of kid scenes, is also very deep. For instance, the lesson it is trying to give, a lesson that I think it a classic one to learn(one that i also think it has similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey). This film managed us to look into how machines and technology can advance, and how because of that advancement, it might be bad to us(the fat, lazy people). It is also trying t give a simpler message, as in take care of Earth. It is not just talking about pollution and trash(it is the simplest way to tell kids)but also recent disasters that can make Earth worse, like all the inflictions we humans cause, particularly global warming. So, in that way, as a science-fiction film, it is also an achievement.The music score is simply amazing. It is so wonderful, and adds to the delight of the film. I also couldn't believe the sound. The sound effects, mainly with the non-use of dialogue, and with WALL-E and Eve's voices, it was simply the best I have ever heard in an animated film, and truly deserves to win all the sound awards it can get.This is a true Pixar masterpiece. I have to say, it tops with Ratatouille as my two favorite animated films. It clearly is one of the best animated films ever made, and is a huge joy to watch. It is perfect. It succeeds in story-telling, writing, and visually as one of the best film in years. I think it is time for the Academy Awards to recognize animated films as the best of the year(Ratatouille deserved the Best Picture nomination last year). This one, for sure, should stay on their minds. A perfect film for everyone. Not just one an high achievement in animation, but a high achievement in pure film-making period! A Masterpiece!10/10",Null,1,6,3 July 2008
Finding Dory," Definitely enjoyable, but a lesser effort from Pixar
","When I heard about this film, I thought to myself that it really wasn't needed, and that creating a film out of another character getting lost would be too similar and repetitive. As it is, I do give props to the filmmakers for not really repeating the same beats as Finding Nemo. In this one, it's not as much that Dory gets lost, but rather that she is on a mission of her own. Still, I never found it anything more than good. I think the script is a bit over-stuffed, and some of it just seems tired. I do like the message but I wouldn't consider this one of Pixar's best efforts by any means. The voice performances are great as always, and although there are some flaws and none of it really hits greatness, it is still a very enjoyable film that families can enjoy together. Definitely recommended.",Null,2,14,18 June 2016
Arrival," A science fiction gem
","Arrival was pretty much close to what I wanted it to be. The trailer made it look too much like an over-the-top thriller but it was so thoughtful in all of the right ways. I also think it's an amazing achievement, to be able to get a premise like that and make it work. This is probably the best leading performance that I have seen Amy Adams ever give. I was also hesitant on her casting but I would say that she was pretty close to perfect. I would say that the final scenes get a little too messy. It tries to reveal things that can already be deciphered but I feel like it panders to its audience a little too much. It had its heart and head in the right place, and while it's definitely not flawless, it's still miles better than what Hollywood usually offers.",Null,2,8,20 November 2016
The Blind Side," Entertaining and touching film that is sure to be seen as Sandra Bullock's finest
","I am not a big fan of big, 'hollywoodized' sports films, because, unlike the really great ones like Raging Bull and The Wrestler, they are always over-the-top and just want to pull at our heartstrings in a cheap manner. While it is true that The Blind Side does exactly that at times, it was still a film that did not need to be as good as it was. The writing and directing for the most part was bearable, and actually some lines were very well written, as well as some scenes. I though the film was actually not as melodramatic as others of this type are, and actually funnier and more entertaining than I would have thought. This is not an incredible film, but it does tell the incredible journey of Michael Oher very well. It was actually very moving at times, and for that, props since that is it's job. I actually thought the film had a lot in common with another Oscar-nominated film, Precious. The performances in this film are good, and this IS Sandra Bullock's film. I doubt she thought she would get any awards or an Oscar nomination for her role when she did it, and that is a good thing because sometimes some performances are just screaming 'OSCAR'!. While I would like it if Meryl Streep won her 3rd Oscar already, and while I do think she is the best of the nominees, Sandra Bullock would actually be a close second because she brings to life the incredible presence and personality of Leigh Anne Tuohy. I really did think she was remarkable, and I would not be angry at all if she won the Oscar for this. Overall, this is a moving, very entertaining and very likable film, and better and not as over-the-top or melodramatic as you would expect.",Null,0,1,26 February 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Bloody fantastic
","The film's been IMDb's #1 for as long as I can remember. That doesn't really raise my expectations, considering I don't agree with so many inclusions or exclusions. I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Yes, it's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best Picture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked it, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is fantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal.",Null,1,1,10 July 2014
Parasite," Absolutely riveting
","Wow. What a film. The experience of watching it is surely one to behold and one to remember. What is especially striking about the whole thing is just how well-constructed it is. A film like this, trying to do this much both narratively and thematically, could have easily fallen apart in the hands of most directors. Bong Joon-Ho is incredibly skilled in how he handles this script and his fantastic directing. Really amazing piece of work that I hope gets a ton of accolades.",Null,18,29,2 September 2019
Rango," Excellent
","Rango is quite simply excellent. It takes an animated spin on the western and combines some really great dialogue as well.I have been overwhelmed lately by Depp's performances. He seems to be playing the same characters all over again (Burton films), BUT here he is simply great. The story itself is rather simple and maybe too formulaic for my tastes, but it works so well because the film has plenty of action. The amazing animation designs and the sound effects make it rousing and make it a personal favorite of mine. Definitely is going to be a stand-out when the year ends as far as animated films go. Hooray for Rango!",Null,2,4,20 March 2011
Music and Lyrics," Romantic comedy made right!
","Music and Lyrics is nothing complex, it is just a simple, well-made light romantic comedy. Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant are very charming, and very likable. The scenes where they are making the song together are the most effective, because it hits right into the heart. The supporting players are also very well cast and rounded, and help make the film likable. It is nothing incredibly special, but the music is quite good, and by the end, you cannot help but feel touched by this film. Finally, a very good romantic comedy that mainstream audiences can enjoy with their lovers. For fans of this film, you might also take a look at Once, the 'independent' version of this film.",Null,1,2,12 July 2009
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Fascinating, maddening, a soaring experience
","The hype and acclaim for this was huge, and yet somehow the film still managed to surprise. I don't have a lot of time to give more detailed thoughts like I did Whiplash yesterday, but it's safe to say I agree with the board in its admiration and intense love for both. Unlike Whiplash though, this was a different sort of experience, definitely one I had to get used to. The film's 'one take' structure really does sort of push the film into the audience, to fully take the characters in and at times be overwhelming. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully immersed in it, but when I did, it functioned as a character drama in such extraordinary ways, and in ways that really hit me afterwards. By the time it was over, I was ready to watch it again, it's one of those films... I also want to say that it feels like such an instant classic. I don't think any recent film in years has felt this way, but this really does. I'm also surprised by how it's one of the two front-runners for awards, I wouldn't have thought as many people would be as open to it but I'm so glad. The ensemble is amazing, with Norton and Keaton being among the best of the year. I actually think that it's such a shame that both Simmons and Norton came out the same year because both would've made more-than-worthy winners. Seeing both Whiplash and this in the span of 24 hours is just, too much to contain. Too much greatness, I feel like I can't take it",Null,5,10,7 January 2015
The Big Short," An intriguing, fascinating, often exhausting and flawed tale
","Overall, a pretty great film that manages to work on both a story-telling level and on a character level, despite how busy it all is. The problem is in essence how busy it all is when it didn't need to. All of the side-explanations, the wink-wink, fourth-wall breaking stuff should not have been there. It was all meant for humor more than actual explanations, and that's fine in aim. It just wasn't funny and felt both condescending and just really annoying. The screenplay did a fine job of really telling this story so all of that was just distracting. I also think the editing at times attempts to show off just for the sake of it, but it also was able to provide the story with a much- needed pace. It's a conflicting editing achievement, no doubt. I think both Christian Bale and Steve Carrell provide some fine work, the latter in particular is more convincing here than he was in last year's Foxcatcher. Both are the emotional anchors of the story and they do very well. The entire cast is superb though, and really gives the Spotlight cast a run for their money.",Null,2,4,30 December 2015
The Conjuring," Really well-done and eerie
","I don't get scared often, or even really jump at most jump moments in most horror films, but The Conjuring delivers on its premise. It's not terribly original, but its scares don't hit you over the head and don't feel dumbed down. They're well-done, and the characters are well-written and so it brings in that extra dynamic to the table. The acting is also pretty great from all involved, Vera Farmiga being the stand out especially and unsurprisingly. Every time I see her I expect greatness and I get it, and I haven't even seen much from her. She's pretty fantastic and she gets some meaty material to work with and delivers the goods.",Null,1,6,19 July 2013
Scream," The King of 'Slasher' Movies!
","I am a big fan of the horror genre, and where Halloween reinvented the Slasher genre back in 1978, Scream reinvented it again in 1996. Scream is the best teen slasher film of the last two decades, and nothing will probably beat it. It is so entertaining, fun, gory, and just really great. It pays homage to other slashers, but it also makes fun of itself. There are so many scenes where the characters are talking about being in a horror film, and the 'rules' to survive in it and who the suspects are. There is a particular scene where Randy is saying that Billy is the killer, and I just love it because everything he says turns out to be true. The film plays with us, and the first time I saw it, I was completely shocked to know who the killer(s) was. Not because I thought it was original, but because the execution of it was. The killer was the first one suspected of doing the murders, but gets off the hook, and he turns out to be the one. The irony of it all makes it so great. In that form, Scream is very original. It also has some very good acting, for a slasher film of the 90's especially. Also, Rose McGowan's garage death is also one of the most memorable death scenes in a horror film ever. I am sure Scream will stay as popular as it is now, and even more iconic. I think it is Wes Craven's Masterpiece, and doubt anything will ever come close to it.",Null,1,1,26 July 2009
Prometheus," Horror sci fi done right, incredibly ambitious
","Prometheus has been my most anticipated for a while. The reviews were disappointing, to say the least, but also incredibly intriguing. Was it actually a prequel to Alien? Well, it shares certain elements to Alien, and I won't say more. The problem stems from the way people wanted, or expected, this to be like Alien. It's not, at all. It doesn't have the slow pace Alien had, or the slow-building suspense and atmosphere. Instead, it does quite a few things. I would be lying if I said the film didn't seem overpacked with story lines and ideas. As it goes on, one is able to see just how much the filmmakers were trying to do here. Yet it all works. I have heard people criticize the script, the characters and dialogue especially. I was surprised that I didn't find any serious problems with those aspects. Many of the minor characters don't get much to do, but I found myself incredibly captivated by some of the more important ones, specifically Fassbender and Theron's. Both give two great performance here, and they make their scenes all the more exciting because there's so much intrigue and mystery surrounding their motivations.The main flaw I would point out would actually be the editing. Although fantastic at times, the middle section of the film feels overstuffed. Perhaps better editing would have made it feel seamless and would have paced those scenes better. And, I am happy to say, the film has it's fair share of incredible excitement. There's several amazing moments here, and I am happy to say although it isn't the type of horror film Alien was, it still has its good amount of freak-out horrifying moments. Not incredibly scary, but still extremely disturbing and definitely had me on the edge of my seat. For all of the reviews I have read, I am rather surprised by what the film actually was. Ever since seeing the trailer I wanted a suspenseful, extremely well-directed, slow-building sci-fi horror. What the film actually is is an incredibly intriguing, fast-paced, sci-fi/horror mystery. It's not as simple as Alien in its narrative and storyline, or as moody, but still a great film nonetheless that, while flawed, is a roller-coaster ride no doubt. I loved it, and for that I am glad.",Null,3,8,10 June 2012
Halloween," The King of all Horror Films!
","Halloween is simply the King of Horror films. It is so suspenseful, has amazing long tracking shots that make it so scary and thrilling unlike any other film in history. The opening sequence, one that makes us see everything Michael Myers is seeing and we follow him through his point of view, it is so well done and one of my favorite scenes of film. What Can I say that has not already been said. Halloween (1978) is a classic, and no horror film ever will touch it's scare factor. There are a lot of other almost equally as great horror films, like The Evil Dead, but that in a milestone in horror/comedy, and ultimately different. One of my all-time faves, horror or not, Halloween proves a force to be reckoned with.",Null,1,4,3 August 2009
Wonder Woman," The film is a success due to Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's chemistry
","Much can be said about why certain films are a success. Do I think Wonder Woman is an entirely amazing or original film? Not at all. Do I think it has enough distinct features to succeed as what is easily one of the best superhero films of this decade? Definitely. It's great that here we have a film that actually tackles more relevant themes that include the brutality of war and humankind, rather than another generic Marvel 'Let's save the world from this evil supernatural guy.' The entire storyline and villains aren't a complete success, and sometimes there's some awkwardness to be found. However, the two leads of the film, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, are endlessly charming and have such electric chemistry. Truly a great duo. Their dialogue together make up the best sections of the film and they're fantastic together. For that reason the film succeeds as much as it does.",Null,5,14,10 June 2017
Paths of Glory," Pretty fantastic
","I actually don't ever hear much about this film, not like Kubrick's other classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey , A Clockwork Orange, or even Full Metal Jacket. To my surprise, this is pretty excellent. The story is intriguing, and a lot of moral complications arise, stuff that only Kubrick can so wonderfully get at and truly dissect. The performance here are pretty great, and Douglas gives so much to his character. One of Kubrick's undisputed heroes, no doubt, if not one of cinema's greatest ever. This might very well stand as one of the late director's best works, and am pretty struck that it took me this long to finally give it a go.",Null,0,1,5 June 2014
Despicable Me," Mostly charming
","Despicable Me's first quarter is average and didn't really hook me much. However, the rest of the film improves and throughout remains a very good animated film. Carrel is amusing, and the best parts of the film involve him interacting with the three orphan girls. We know what to expect from this film, but it still remains very satisfying and the end credits are a blast to sit through. The kids were laughing throughout the film, and it seems as of this is more of a film for them than us. There are also some very touching moments, so in that respect check this film out. It may not be as great as Toy Story 3 or even How To Train Your Dragon, but it is definitely a strong addition to this year as far as animation goes.",Null,1,1,2 January 2011
Carrie," Horrifying with a menacing tone
","Carrie's opening scenes are truly disturbing. From the get to, De Palma creates an atmosphere of true dread. It's high school but it is still presented very seriously. the scenes of Carrie and her mother are perhaps the scariest in the film, thanks in part to the direction, but also because of the performances. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie (who I liked seeing in Twin Peaks) are a tour de force here, and at times their scenes linger on true religious obsessions to the point of insanity. The film is never dull, and until the final climax it keeps you waiting. The slow- motion montage before the tragedy in the end is very suspenseful and makes you want to in a way be there to actually help the characters, and it frustrates. I am not sure if I liked the ending or not, but it remains that Carrie is obviously a very influential film and has one of the most unnerving tones I have seen in a horror film.",Null,3,5,6 January 2011

1408," A great and chilling thriller!
","1408 is based on the chilling Stephen King novel, and it is a very suspenseful and well-made film. It is very psychological, as is the novel. The atmosphere is great. The art direction of the hotel is very nicely done. The direction is superb for a thriller like this, and John Cusack actually gives a superb performance. His portrayal of Mike Enslin is very realistic, and he is able to capture his character the way King wanted to in his novel. The film has some certain scares for sure, and some very creepy moments. The film does fade in its second half a bit, and I actually very much liked the director's cut ending more than the theatrical version's ending. I thought it was more fitting. But overall, a very memorable, very well-made thriller with strong acting.",Null,0,0,7 April 2009
Raging Bull," One of the best films ever made!
","I just saw Raging Bull, and to say the least, it is a revolutionary film. I always heard buzz about this film, and I have not seen many Martin Scorsese films, but this is a true American movie! The screenplay is a true force to be reckoned with. It reminded me a bit of other epic films like Citizen Kane and There Will be Blood, the way the main character plays out is similar, but this film is different, as in the character Jake La Motta is based on a real person. Martin Scorsese really commanded the screen. There are truly some amazingly written and acted scenes. This is a boxing film, but a very much human film too. Robert De Niro really gave his best, and it turns out to be one of the best performances I have ever seen! His performance ranges from his bad times, to his guilt, to his madness and anger. It is all played out perfectly. Joey La Motta, his brother, played brilliantly by Joe Pesci is also a strong supporting character, who follows Jake through a lot. Another strong character is Vicky Thailer, played by the back then unknown Cathy Moriarty. What these three characters go through is amazing. This film is a joy to watch too. Certain scenes, some sensuality between Jake and Vicky are not really sexually graphic, yet have so much pleasure in them, the way Scorsese teases us. Scenes like where Jake suspects Vicky and Joey together, and in their fight all of a sudden are so well done and acted, I could not stare away.This film is from the 1940s through 1950s, so there are a lot of gorgeous set designs. The costumes, the cinematography are all beautiful too look at. The decision to make this film black and white really helps. There are amazing camera shots, amazing techniques that are used, and the sound in the boxing scenes is perfection.This film is a classic for a reason. It is pure entertainment too, and it is so well done and executed no one can be disturbed. It is one of the most enjoyable, amazingly acted films I have ever seen. A film that everyone should see, if not for De Niro's amazing performance, then for the amazing writing and directing!",Null,1,2,24 July 2008
The Iron Giant," Fantastic screenplay and voice acting
","This is classic cinema, a throwback to films that only relied on great writing and voice acting. The film is simple but incredibly well-told and effective, told in a period that is rare for animation. The film captures the distinct feeling of the Cold War and it's never immature or 'childish' while still being accessible to people of all ages.",Null,0,0,24 June 2018
Straight Outta Compton," Effective and sprawling, if overlong.
","Very ambitious project. Perhaps a little too ambitious. I appreciate all of the themes it tried to incorporate, but 150 minutes was just too long. By about an hour I already felt overwhelmed because the film had traced so much story. This is one film that really felt its length. I also think throughout many instances, the film just overplays its melodrama completely. Some dialogue is shoddy, and some of the narrative structure gets messy in its second half (which is definitely overall more problematic). I think the cast is really great though, and the film does get across its overarching, most powerful message about brotherhood and friendship. Jason Mitchell stands out as the MVP here, although everyone does fine work. I was really loving the film in its first half but yeah, it just seems too all over-the-place in its second, but I still liked it a lot",Null,3,29,11 September 2015
Mary and Max," Honest and True
","Mary and Max is one of the darkest animated films I have ever seen. It deals with certain issues that are rarely dealt with in films, let alone animated ones. This is certainly not a kid's film, but it is a learning film. It tells the story of a lonely girl named Mary who lives with her problematic parents and who creates a friendship with a man named Max who lives across the world from her. The writing is incredible and it gives us so much insight into each of these characters' worlds. Thanks to the narration and the visually-amazing stop-motion animation, we are able to care deeply for these characters. By the time the final 30 minutes roll around, it begins to get darker and more sinister, simply because it shows us that it is the way the world gets as you grow up. The ending is very, very sad, but it rings a chord in every viewers' hearts I am sure. All in all, this is an honest and very true animated film about the life of two uncertain people. It is better than most animated films hope to be, and it is better than Pixar's Up. See this film, but not simply for entertainment or humor because you will get more than what you bargained for.",Null,4,8,30 July 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," The greatest horror and mystery film ever made!
","I saw this film Saturday night, on A&E, and I have to say, it is a very good film. First off, the film is highly entertaining. This is a film that will please almost everyone. It is a crime thriller, but also very much a psychological horror film. The film surely gives us a classic movie character, Hannibal Lector. The acting in this movie is amazing. I have seen a lot of evil, psychotic characters like Lector before, and always an actor plays it in an evil, maniac sort of way. So when Anthony Hopkins acted this way, I was glad, but also kind of let down(since there are a lot of performances like this). But as the film goes on, we really identify with this character, and it did take a great amount of talent to pull it off. Jodie Foster kind of came as a one-one. Yes, she pulled it off too, like in personal moments that Dr. Lector figured out about her. You can really sense her talent, but sometimes I found her to come off a bit mono-tone. BUT I guess that is how her character was, and she did greatly act all her own to this performance. The man killer, Buffalo Bill, I think Ted Levine also did a great performance, and was underrated. BUT I found the story to be kind of unoriginal at all, yes, there is nothing really primarily wrong with the screenplay, but there were some very choppy scenes, and yes, it was a very good film. In the best horror films ever made of course, but I would have liked more from Dr.Lector and Buffalo Bill...I don't know, i just have that feeling. BUT it was a very well made film, so a solid.... 9/10",Null,1,1,30 June 2008
X-Men: First Class," Pretty good
","I liked it quite a bit, definitely more than the first two in this franchise. Still not without its flaws. The 'turning' of Angel and Raven irks me. Especially the latter, just leave Xavier and her friends just like that? I get they're following comic books, but there could have been better development. Still, I've heard a lot of bad things about Lawrence, but I thought she was quite good. I thought both Fassbender and McAvoy were aces, and their relationship incredibly satisfying. Now, I have no interest in The Last Stand so I suppose I will go straight to Days of Future Past. Overall, this is definitely recommended, although nothing quite amazing.",Null,0,0,26 May 2014
Win Win," Very likable
","Win Win is a great little film with fantastic performances and a brilliant screenplay. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, and in that respect it surprised me. As it goes along, I got really invested in these characters, and in the sharp comedic writing mixed with real biting drama. I was able to recognize Melanie Lynskey from her film Heavenly Creatures. Giamatti is a good lead, and Ryan and Cannavle both prove great supporting turns. Overall, this was a very good little film that never once failed to entertain and intrigue me. Expect serious awards consideration for the script, which is its best aspect. Definitely recommended.",Null,0,0,5 January 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," An epic and satisfying conclusion
","I had anticipation for TDKR, and yet not as much as one would have expected. When TDK came out in 2008, it was one of the biggest movie moments I had been through, with my anticipation off the roof. I also declared it a 'masterpiece' upon watching it like many others did. As the years have gone by though, TDK has been a victim of its own hype and the backlash that resulted because of it, and Nolan blockbusters in general. I still sort of love The Dark Knight, and I have seen it several times, but it's definitely not the masterpiece I had made it out to be. Then again, I have no one to blame but myself for giving it such heavenly praise, and in a way I sort of just jumped on the bandwagon. I consider myself a TDK fan to this day, but probably not a 'hardcore' fan, and so this time around my anticipation is different. Nolan films always seem to lessen on rewatches, even his independent films like Memento. I didn't hype this film for me nearly as much as TDK in 2008, and weirdly I wasn't going crazy about it. What did I think of it?A satisfying conclusion for sure. It pretty much has the same sort of flow and narrative style that TDK had. It's quick, epic in its action scale, and surely very entertaining. Just like TDK, the most thrilling moments are enough to have you on the edge of your seat and to give you chills, and TDKR definitely delivered on those fronts. But alas, it also has some of the same flaws that plagued TDK, and they come from the same comparisons I made. I've gotten to the point that these days, I really wish for quiet, character-driven moments in films, no matter what kind they are. The problem with Nolans' Batman films are that many times, there's never much space for that. I'm not saying we don't care for the characters, but it sometimes makes me wonder if all Nolan can add in his batman films are 'epic' moments of action and thrills, and when we find characters simply talking it all has to do with building up the tension. Does it work? Yeah, very much so, which is why this isn't really that big of a complaint. I am simply stating things that neither TDK or TDKR had. And should I complain? I mean, Batman Begins is certainly the batman film that is paced in a more careful, more resistant approach. The problem with that film is that at the end of the day, it really wasn't all that memorable, and the excitement of Batman Begins in no way reached the high levels of these last two Batman flicks. So again, I find myself torn about what to want in this.On a more level-headed approach, most of the new characters here are pretty interesting, with the exception of Marion Cotillard's character. The problem isn't that she wasn't needed, it was that she was barely given any real development, or reason to be significant. In certain revelations, I found myself merely shrugging towards her character. It also didn't help that Cotillard played her the exact same way she played her other character in Inception. Tom Hardy on the other hand, has a very well-written role, but something was off here. I found Hardy's voice really cartoonish at times. Threatening? Yeah, certainly, several scenes, but he also overdid it other times. Levitt is pretty great, and a great new addition. The true stand-out was, surprisingly, Anne Hathaway. I was also one of the many that didn't see Hathaway as Catwoman at all, and yet she naturally fell into the role pretty perfectly. It's her early scenes that make a real impact, and Hathaway nails it with charisma, charm, sexiness, and most importantly, vulnerability.The action pieces are incredible, although the sound effects and the score are sometimes way too loud and because of this, overbearing and obnoxious (yes, just like Inception). The score was actually pretty great, but less of it would have been more welcome.Overall, I liked it a lot, perhaps even loved it, and there seems to be more of an emotional pull at the core of the film, which was definitely sometimes lacking in TDK and was perhaps why it's not as great as I once thought it was. But make no mistake, this is a thrilling, epic, bloody gripping and crazy entertaining film.",Null,3,8,29 July 2012
Black Panther," What Superhero films should strive to be
","It really does feel like we've been waiting for a very long time for a superhero film like this, one that can be exciting beyond the usual fans of the genre. The action here is spellbinding, but more than that, the characters are very well developed. Boseman shines, and so does Michael B Jordan, who challenges us to root against him despite his charisma and character background. This is definitely one that is very much worth it.",Null,4,11,28 February 2018
Iron Man," One of the best Marvel films there is!
","As fans of superhero films like Spider-Man, I can say this is another nearly flawless Marvel adaptation...This film is huge fun. The film starts off great, and it continues to blast off. the pacing in this film is very well done. I have never seen an action film so well put together, scenes come and go, yet you feel you are so satisfied with what's on screen. The pacing allows us to really interact with this film. The screenplay is also strong. I have seen a lot of Marvel films, and many of them do not work. This film was a huge surprise, because I thought it was going to be ridiculously bad, and it was the opposite. The amount of 'cool' style this film has is why a lot of teens have loved it! It is so well-based, and I have never seen an action film so well received by fans. The great critiques and great fan reactions is no surprise. It was funny, light in parts, and the characters had great things to work with. The writing really allows us to see each characters for what they are, and the reason we are also is because of the acting in this film. I have to say, this film is probably the best acted superhero film I have ever seen. Robert Downey Jr. is a genuine surprise, and I think that his performance is really quirky yet magnificent. Like a lot of people, I was surprised he took on the role of Tony Stark, who is really a very money-based character. His performance only adds the great style of this film. His character has a lot of great moments on dialogue, together with Gwyneth Paltrow, who also shines when given the right wit. This film stays true to the comic books, which not a lot of people can really recognize. The action scenes are very well done. Even though there is not a lot, the film really can attract to a lot of people because of it's fun style. The special effects are also very realistic. i could not tell when i was watching the armor suit of CGI or the real one... I think this film has done enough to add to great blockbuster films. I have to say, it is as good of a film as, in my opinion, the best superhero film to this point Spider-Man 2, and a great introduction to what will become a great trilogy.",Null,1,3,16 June 2008
Mother!," Not what I expected going in, but what a ride
","Quite a lot has been said about Mother!, but what's most clear after seeing the film is that it knows exactly the type of film it is and what it's trying to say. People can say they're confused but dig a little deeper and the answer is there. So the question shouldn't be whether the film has specific themes in mind. It does, no doubt. The question should instead be whether the execution of those themes was successful. In my opinion, it is. Do I think it was a flawless film? I mean, obviously not. But at the same time I struggle to think of anything it did significantly wrong. The progression of slower- paced atmospheric thriller to full-blown horror insanity is very well done. The camera-work in the way its captures the singular perspective of the lead character is incredibly impressive, and the film continues to build its mystery throughout. It can get a bit repetitive, and I do think it could have been trimmed by about 15 minutes, but the film works spectacularly as a guessing game and then, once you've guessed it, works even better on a thematic and metaphorical level. The performances are splendid and fearless, with Lawrence showing all of us again why she became such a star in the first place, and the directing powerful. The screenplay very much works on a surface level, even if it isn't anything that is incredible, because everything it's representing is supposed to be under the surface (well, up until it's very much in your face about it). If there's one glaring flaw it is that the film's final minutes make everything incredibly clear and hammer the point home, but perhaps that's best for certain audiences. Overall, destined to be one of the most memorable films of the year and certainly another great horror film in a year already filled with them.",Null,1,6,23 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Definitely a big surprise for me
","Every once in a while a film comes along that I very much disagree with the majority of critics on. Last year it was Ryan Gosling's much-maligned directorial debut Lost River. This year, I guess it's Batman v Superman.I remember watching the trailer months before the film came out and thinking it looked like, well, not good. Then it came out and it was mostly blasted. Yet I still had interest in it. I still expected a completely bloated, overwhelming, extremely messy and awkward film that had glimpses of quality. Instead, I saw a good superhero film through and through. Yes, it had some stretches of being too busy for its own good, but it was nowhere near the mess I expected it to be. It reminded me of The Dark Knight Rises and The Dark Knight in many ways. Perhaps it does focus too much on CGI in its last hour (and perhaps some of the turns in the story, particularly between Batman and Superman in that last hour, are a bit too sudden) but it has that same driving force and energy and the same sprawling ambition. I can sometimes like Marvel films, but my biggest problem with them is that they always play everything for comedy and end up playing it way too safe. This is an example of a superhero film that goes a bit further than that and really raises the stakes. Even Jesse Eisenberg was a surprise. From what I had heard, I expected an incredibly cartoonish, over-the-top, embarrassing performance. Compared to what I had read and heard, he was pretty subdued. I never saw Man of Steel but luckily did some research before watching it so I wasn't lost much. However, I do think Henry Cavill limits how great a character Clark Kent could be. He has the look (oh boy does he) but compared to his other cast members, he's probably one of the weakest links. Still, doesn't drag it down significantly or anything.I did see the Ultimate Cut, so perhaps that's a reason... but I just didn't see the mess that reviews made me believe I would. Then again I'm a fan of Watchmen, so who knows. But this is definitely the biggest surprise of the year so far for me. I don't see how it's inferior to Civil War. In terms of some messiness, sure, but wow.",Null,4,8,2 July 2016
Blade Runner," Visually spellbinding
","It took me long enough to seek this out, after knowing about it since I became a film buff. Even though it took long, I always had high expectations. I can't say those high expectations were quite met, since I do think that the film is missing an emotional factor for me that would make me love it more, a more compelling or intriguing story. Saying that however, the story is good enough for such brilliant directing. Visually, it's amazing, with amazing sound effects and some truly wonderful cinematography. On a technical level, this is a masterful film and you can see why it's so popular. Only rewatches will determine just how much I like it.",Null,0,4,29 June 2014
Casino Royale," Saw this way back when...
","I saw this back when it came out, when I was just barely a teenager. Rewatching it I certainly appreciated it more and I think it's as adult- oriented as a Bond film can be. I definitely think it's better than Quantum, which I just saw for the first time, and on the same level as Skyfall. It's certainly the most well-paced one, and the opening 20 minutes are extremely riveting and suspenseful, everything a film like this should be. There aren't many complaints to be had, and Eva Green is also fantastic here. She lights up the screen. Perhaps Craig wasn't as comfortable with the role here and he certainly gets better as his films go along, but you can't go that much better than this.",Null,0,3,18 May 2013

I appreciate them, yes, but not really love. so I was hesitant about watching Toy Story 3, but I now realize that this is Pixar- they can do no wrong.This is a masterful film. Amazing characters, direction, writing, animation, everything. It is the rare film that crosses over and is enjoyed by everyone involved. I have really nothing else to say because it has been praised as much as it can be already. Oh, and that ending! Wow, that ending- this marks the 2nd time I have ever cried in the ending of a film, and I am not a cryer at all. I had not cried for anything in over three years, and this certainly did something out of the ordinary. Great film, a classic already and perhaps Pixar's finest film to date. If you cry easily, you should better not watch this with a group of friends or people.",Null,1,1,19 December 2010
Trainspotting," Extremely ambitious but hard to watch....
","Trainspotting is a fast-paced, uncomfortable, and very ambitious film about the heroin addiction of Mark Renton.Boyle is a great director and I have thought that of him for some time now. His films 28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire, and 127 Hours' strengths lie on his ability to conjure up real excitement and passion, and it always comes across perfectly. His direction is needed in this fast-paced script. The dialogue is pretty brilliant, and there is a lot of it, so a lot of it may pass over you without even knowing it. However, it's pace allows it to always be entertaining. The film is darkly funny, but it also disturbed me and made me feel uncomfortable in a way, especially in the most brutal scenes. I am noting that this is actually not an actual review, but at at this moment I don't have enough strength in me to write an actual review of the film. I don't think anything should really be talked about in terms of plot, and in a way time will be needed for me to fully grasp it. Surely recommended.",Null,1,2,12 May 2011
La Vie En Rose," One of the greatest performances in cinema history.
","I have seen a lot of quality moves that have had performances that were Oscar worthy, but never this amazing. Before this movie, I had never heard about Edith Piaf. Now I know a lot about her to know what kind of person she was. Marion Cotillard gives the best female performance of the decade. She truly captures each moment in Edith's life with simplicity, realism, but also melodrama that the real Edith Piaf went through. While watching the movie, I was completely mesmerized. Every stare, every facial expression that she gave was enough for her to win the Oscar. To know that this is the first foreign language Oscar win in all of history is telling a lot. The transformation that Cotillard makes is simple awe inspiring! Yes, The Oscar win for Make-Up also has to do with it, but the emotion and disasters that Marion Cotillard plays is because all of her acting skills! Some people even compare it so other classics performances, most notable Meryl Streep in 'Sophie's Choice' The film itself was very informative. I thought that the chronological sequence helped compare how Cotillard differed each scene. The Production and Art Direction are amazing. This is definitely a must-see film, if not for the film, then for Marion Cotillard's masterpiece of a performance!",Null,2,6,7 April 2008
Before Sunrise," A charming and very engaging romance...

Before Sunrise is a very charming and engaging romance, and along with Sunset fits in with the best and most engaging romance films I have ever seen.Maybe seeing Sunset first wasn't a good choice because he timeline is screwed. I know what's going to happen after this one, and I take in their events very differently. But it is still a very engaging work. Unlike Sunset, Sunrise takes the more known approach to romances. It's incredible how much the same sort of characteristics shine through here as in Sunset. If I had to choose I would choose Sunset because I did find he dialogue in that one better and execution of it more refreshing. It's definitely hard for me to separate them now, because together they make for a pair of a story that I will probably never forget.",Null,3,4,20 October 2011
Signs," Effective, creepy, and ultimately excellent
","This is not the first time I have seen Signs, but it is the first time I actually get to review the film. I saw it back in 2002 when I was just 9 years old, and it was one of the first horror films I ever saw. I remember being indifferent to it and remember me preferring the other popular horror of the year, The Ring. Having seen it again after 8 years, I can say it is a strong, effective, and emotionally resonant film.The writing in the film is superb. Shyamalan builds effective scenes with some great dialogue that only benefits the characters more. His direction is also impressive. He make the story itself be creepy and mysterious without showing too much, and that ultimately is what makes this a great film. At first I didn't think I would be able to say it was anything more than a good film, but it is great. The atmosphere and tension is first-class, and in that way it seems already as one of those old classic thrillers. The performances are also great, especially from the two youngsters. Abigail Breslin is of course an Oscar nominee now but still seeing her acting range at this age is marvelous. Rory Culkin also is very impressive, as is Phoenix. Mel Gibson I am mixed about and actually think was the weakest link here. Of course, knowing Gibson's reputation now does not help but I still say he was solid.Overall, it is a great film, and despite many saying it is not horror, it IS. It handled the subject of another alien existence in a very restrained and different way. The climax is done very well, but the visual effects and the fact that they somehow still did what we didn't really need them to do is probably a backtrack. But it still doesn't ruin the film as a whole. Shyamalan should not be forgotten for making this gem.",Null,0,4,12 January 2011
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," A perfectly-acted, Artistically sexy and romantic film
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is perhaps a new renovation for romantic comedies. The film has such an ambitious and artistic tone and atmosphere to it. The screenplay, perfectly written, shows true lust and romance that appears at some point in peoples' lives, in this case, Vicky and Cristina. This film does not follow usual 'love' routines, and that is why it really is not a very romantic comedy, but more of the type of romance that you can only dream about, the type of romance that sweeps you away, and the type of romance that cannot always be fulfilled. It breaks all the rules for love, and shows how it does not have to be real, or even lasting. The film's stars, Rebbecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson capture the moods and feelings of their characters perfectly. Javier Bardem plays Juan Antonio, and does a great job, as well as Penelope Cruz, which gives a tour-de-force performance here. The main talk will be Cruz, and that is because, in her few scenes, she completely electrifies the screen with her rambling, lunatic and haunting portrayal as Juan Antonio's ex wife. Her awards sweep has been greatly deserved. But I also thought that Hall has been greatly ignored. She does the best with her scenes, and she is very natural, and realistic. She also gives one heck of a performance.Overall, one very entertaining, artistic, and memorable film. Surely one of the films of 2007 that will be greatly appreciated with time, and very deserving too.",Null,5,11,18 December 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Not that bad
","The film received mostly negative reviews when it came out, and still has to this day. To my surprise, it's adequate, although fairly average, and not that far below the quality of the original. It benefits from having a more structured plot, and the storyline is more about rising action and a climax (unlike the first). Blanchett is also quite impressive and I actually expected to think she was over the top (like I feel she sometimes is) but I think she plays it brilliantly, certainly not a nomination or performance I dismiss. Overall, it's definitely not nearly as bad as reviews would make me believe and once again the best thing about it is Blanchett.",Null,0,1,11 May 2013
The Deer Hunter," Really good
","I don't think I'm quite in love with this as everyone else is it seems, but it's very much worth seeing. The ensemble cast is great all around, and it's lovely to see Streep as the beginning of her career, pretty literally too as this marked her first Oscar nomination. De Niro is strong as the lead, but in a way both Savage and Walken outshine him in smaller more supporting roles, and the latter probes to the the film's heart. The Russian Roulette scene is definitely the best in the film, very effective and not afraid to show the horrors of such mayhem in the war. As it is, I kinda wish the ending had been perhaps stronger, or ended on a more powerful note, but it's still very good.",Null,0,3,10 March 2013
Identity," Props to the most suspenseful and unpredictable film in years!
","If you have not seen Identity, please do so. It is the best horror film of the decade. Horror films these days are so clich√©d, predictable, and have no mystery. Identity is how every horror film should be.The film has a great and unpredictable script. It is not just great by horror film standards, but by any means. It has such well thought out murders, has great character development, subtle scenes, and the director, James Mangold, gives it a very chilling tone and atmosphere. The ensemble cast is great all around. John Cusack is such an underrated actor, as is Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet. They give humanity to their characters, as do the rest of the cast. You really get invested in the characters. And this film plays around differently than other thrillers. It requires full attention, since it has so many twists and turns. By the time the ending comes, you won't be able to stop talking about. It is carried on with such a well revelation. What helps also is that the original music score is so chilling. It creates the perfect tone the whole film has.Cheers for not just the best horror film of the decade, but also one of the best I have ever seen. Identity is a winner!",Null,1,4,9 November 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," Pretty emotional
","I have to start off by saying that I haven't seen Mary Poppins. And really, it's not needed. I thought on a purely emotional level, the film works quite well. The problem is that so many of the childhood/past scenes come off overly sentimental and are not that interesting. It's all so obvious in their execution. The scenes with an older Travis fare much, much better, and much of it is due to Thompson. She's the living heart of this, she's a little hard to take at first (the character as intended, of course) but Thompson plays this character so incredibly well. It's truly an amazing performance through and through, I just wish the film was more consistent. And I'm not a huge fan of Newman's score here, or rather, how it was used.",Null,2,6,23 December 2013

Fantastic Mr. Fox," A delightful and charming film
","Fantastic Mr. Fox was a very delightful and charming film. It is a film that perhaps young children will not understand or be interested in, but it has a lot of intelligence put into it. The voice performances were fantastic, as was the animation. At times though I could not help but admire the film more than enjoy it, since I thought that at times I was not entertained by it so much. But since it has some very quotable lines and upbeat music unlike any other animated film, props have to be given to it. I have only seen three animated films, this, Up,, and Coraline, and cannot rank any of them. To me, any of them are worthy of winning the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and I do hope they all get nominated. Overall, a pleasing film.",Null,0,1,17 December 2009
Son of Saul," Very well-acted and well-directed
","Definitely a technical masterwork. I had already heard much about its sound work, but its cinematography was also quite impressive. I can't believe that Geza Rohrig got no traction at all. Well, I can, since it's a foreign-language film, but shameful. As for the film as a whole though, I can't say I quite loved it. I did love the beginning and ending of it, and I loved how simple its actual premise was while being something so deeply personal to the protagonist in the grand scheme of everything happening around him. However, I also found that it was just a little too... busy? I felt that it got kind of repetitive in all of the running around and all of the back and forth. Not to dismiss at all what very well was a realistic journey for this character, but as a viewer it made me kind of numb to what was happening. I was emotionally invested up to a point, but then some of that investment was sort of lost. I'd say its minimalist script started off as a huge strength but by the end was perhaps the reason why some of it also came off as showcasing its technical aspects to the detriment of everything else. Still, definitely a good film while being kind of disappointing.",Null,1,4,1 May 2016
Lucy," Dear Christ
","I thought the commercials on TV for this made it look pretty good. When the reviews came in, I sort of lowered my expectations. Nothing could prepare me for how bad this truly was. From the beginning, it seems like the director is intent on overwhelming us with transitions and cuts from the present to all of these 'evolution' shots that, instead of feeling creative or intellectual, just feel incredibly stupid. And I'm not one to throw the word 'stupid' around, but... I don't know how else to describe how obnoxious and annoying I found the film from the get go. I don't care how scientifically accurate this is, no. I just care that the dialogue and directing really range from mediocre to atrocious. There are a few decent scenes, but few and far in between. The car chase is an example, like if it was a scene taken from another actually-decent action flick. I will say that the second half is at least a bit better than the first.Scarlett Johansson has been on a roll lately, and I'm a fan of her. But the reason it took me so long to warm up to her is because while I generally like her very much in her more subdued, quiet or more natural roles (Lost in Translation, Under the Skin) she has the tendency to just not be as convincing in more melodramatic, showier roles. Oh yes, she's pretty bad once her character here gets her powers, totally unconvincing at playing the emotionless aspect. She's supposed to play Lucy as if she has no emotions, but instead it comes across as her trying desperately to convince us that she has no emotions. But before Lucy gets her powers, she's also pretty bad, totally unconvincing and probably more laughably bad when she's trying to play a woman with fear for her life. What a misfire of a performance, although the girl tries hard enough and isn't nearly as obnoxious and as downright ugly as the film around her.",Null,43,89,30 July 2014
Am√©lie," Couldn't finish it...
","Quirky films sometimes win me over... sometimes they don't. An example of colorful 'Quirkiness' that won me over completely is the wonderful television series Pushing Daisies. That is what I would compare this film most with in its style and tone... and yet I didn't like it.NOTE- I don't like reviewing films that I do not finish watching, but I only saw the first 50 minutes of this film. My Film Teacher played it for us on a big screen. I was very excited for it. When it began I was liking it... after 10 minutes I felt it was rubbing me the wrong way. After 20 minuets the story was mildly engaging and I wanted to see where it went... As it went on I kept wondering to myself if I should leave... I even watch the worst of films. I left because I just saw no indication of the film grabbing me. Yeah,I guess it's well-made for the filmmakers intentions, yet for all of its style it never amused me. The lead performance was very good, but the film as a whole felt too calculated. Hey, I love visual films, but the visuals in this one seemed to be too artificial to me. And again, I loved Pushing Daisies. Yet this film's plot and execution wasn't grabbing me and was making me a little bored, so I left. I don't plan on watching the rest of it any time soon, and I don't think I will ever like the film. I get what the filmmakers were trying to do, but I simply didn't find it appealing. Since I didn't finish it I don't want to give it a negative score, but quite simply, I don't see the fuss about this film. I give it a 5 as it stands now. Did I mention that the dialogue was just... dull? Not a bad film per say by the standards in which it was made, just a VERY uninteresting and dull one, even with all of its colors and visuals.EDIT- So I decided to watch it in its entirety, mark the date December 9th, 2011. Why do I want to mark the date? Well, because I fell in love with it. This time, I wasn't surrounded by my obnoxious film class, and I really took it differently. I mean, I love Pushing Daiises, so I knew this was a film that would benefit from watching again, and this time as a whole. This time, I was hooked in it's storyline. I also want to say that this opened my mind a little bit more. It's very difficult to do fantasy, romance, and comedy in the right way that it engages me enough. It's always been harder for films of this type for me to love than the usual, gritty, well-made thrillers or dramas. Which is why this stands out in my mind. The cinematography is amazing (as expected, as Delbonnel had the best cinematography of 2009 for Harry Potter 6), as is the art direction. I also noticed the colors. Yeah, it has very vivid colors, but the color saturation as whole had a very greenish sort of look to it, which i thought was unique in itself. The first half is faster-paced and different than the second, but both work completely. I love very few romance films, but the romance here is just so delightful. This is a film that leaves you happy as can be, and I am very glad i rewatched it.",Null,5,9,25 October 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," Incredibly eccentric and charming
","The only other Wes Anderson film I have ever seen is Fantastic Mr. Fox, but this has, undeniably, the same tone and style in many ways. I think technically-wise, it's pretty amazing. The staging of certain scenes, along with the cinematography, editing, and music score are all wonderful (although I wonder how much of the score is original). The story is also told in a very charming, light-hearted way, but it isn't a 'kid's film'. There's really not much to say except that it's an eccentric, charming, wonderfully creative film that feels completely alive, and so, so different from the many formulaic films out right now. Or maybe I hadn't seen a film this great in a long time. Call it an actual original 'romantic comedy'.",Null,3,6,26 September 2012
The Sixth Sense," Pretty good
","Oh yes, I've heard a ton of stuff about this film and its twist ending, so in that respect it couldn't exactly shock me. Still, I'm surprised by how restraint it is. I've herd so many times throughout the years, about how scary it is that I really expected a horror film. I mean, I guess it is a horror film, but it's a very restrained, very subtle one. In fact, this is my biggest surprise with it. I expected some cheesy stuff, seeing as how Shyamalan later went on to become that sort of filmmaker, but this is some good stuff. Bruce Willis and Toni Collette are both pretty effective, but it's Haley Joel Osment who truly penetrates the mind and delivers some truly haunting, searing work.",Null,0,0,27 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Witty, vibrant, and so much fun.
","As someone who's a fan of the original trilogy (Episodes 4-6. I never saw the more recent prequels nor have any plan to) but who's not obsessed or in complete love with them, I went with this with good enough expectations but not expecting to be blown away. Those expectations were entirely met. Like the original Star Wars films (mostly A New Hope, which was always my favorite) this has a complete sense of fun and energy that vibrates not just with the action (and there's a lot) but with the characters and their interactions. In comparison to most Hollywood blockbuster, it's pretty standard in its structure. There's nothing here that is any huge risk, but then again none of the Star Wars films were ever incredibly challenging or unformulaic. Like the originals, this one just has such a positive energy and its formula completely works. They did such a great job casting the new characters, and in particular Daisy Ridley and especially Adam Driver (who steals every scene he is in) do some great work here. I don't think J.J. Abrams has brought anything distinctive or different in style than the originals, but I don't think that was his aim at all. He does a great job handling everything as a package, and that is no easy feat. In a time where Hollywood is filled with unimaginative, repetitive, dull blockbusters (Hello Marvel!) this joins Mad Max: fury Road as really standing apart from the flock, even if it's different to Fury Road in that it follows the formula a lot more. But if it works, don't break it, and this is surely one of the most purely entertaining, and lovable, films of the year. The praise is deserved.",Null,6,33,26 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A great conclusion to an amazing franchise!
","When it comes to Harry Potter it's pretty hard to be unbiased at times. This is a series that means a lot to me. I first saw Sorcerer's Stone at age 8 in the cinema, and since then have seen every single HP flick at the cinema. It has been 10 years, and the conclusion of this series couldn't have come at a better time. I just graduated High School and am ready to go to a University in a month, so these characters that I have come to care about saying goodbye is a bidding farewell that resonates with me as well.First off, this is a great finale. It's the action-packed conclusion that ends with a bang. It's fast-paced and very entertaining. Of course, there are many characters to keep track of, so only those people that have stuck with the series all these years will be able to point them out. I do wish the film had shown more of some characters, and this is where I come away with some problems I had with the film. I feel that a lot of characters come away in the film heavily-edited. As in I feel there was a lot that we weren't able to see. Since this is Part 2, it's definitely different in both tone and pace to Part 1, which was a slower-paced more moody film, where people nervously awaited the end. Here it is, and certainly action-packed, but I cannot help but feel as if it was anti-climactic at moments. This goes back to the problems with the book as well. Also, many unexplained things I felt were not given enough backstory. I feel that it would be certainly hard to follow certain story lines. For example, Draco Malfoy's resolution wasn't really seen. We see him go away with his parents then in the epilogue he is seen smiling. I felt this character in particular could have fared with a better farewell. I feel a little bit like that with a lot of characters, for example McGonogall, The Weasleys, Hagrid etc. These problems I had I cannot really determine as real flaws. For starters, I feel that a conclusion this big needs to be rewatched to be able to seriously analyze it further. But don't get me wrong. It's Harry Potter, so that in itself makes me love it. Yes, it's sort of biased, but it's the truth. Not to say this wasn't a well-made film, because it was. The cinematography is soaring and lets you dwelve into the various things happening (although nothing will beat the cinematography of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince). The music score was well adjusted and edited, although I can't really recall any really special themes. The visual and sound effects definitely masterful, as is the art direction (who this time around should FINALLY win at the Academy Awards!).People who have been waiting eagerly to see how the reveal with Snape was ('The Prince's Tale') won't be disappointed. Yes, the montage is heavily edited, but really, what other way could audiences finally understand the grasp of Snape's character. This goes back to the performances. Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes are the stand-outs here. None have been better (although certainly don't see either getting any type of awards recognition sadly). Daniel radcliffe is decent as always, although to a higher extent this time. I do think that both Grint and especially Watson have turned out better performances in this, and have proved to be the better actors.Let's talk about the epilogue... hated it in the book. Maybe it was the way J.K. Rowling wrote it, in such a cheesy and overly-sugary tone. Yeah, that complaint has been heard millions of times before, but it's the truth. But, to my surprise, it came alive much better on screen. What I especially loved about it was the way not much words have to be said between the original trio for them to know how much they mean to each other. The final shot of them smiling at their kids attending what might be the biggest part of their lives is a great ending. Ultimately, yes, I might have had problems with it, but at the same time I cannot feel that there might have not been a better way to end the series. David Yates has proved he was the best Harry Potter director, and the last three films of the series are near-masterpieces. I don't really want to over-analyze this reality that Harry Potter has come to an end, because I HATE getting emotional, but really, we have a classic franchise that will be remembered for decades to come.",Null,0,0,23 July 2011
Unbroken," Way too harsh a critical beating
","Color me shocked, but I found it an engrossing film. Not perfect, far from it, and the second half has a little more problems, but overall well-told with some good pacing. I think it's actually better than American Sniper. Jack O Connell is a true talent, hope to see him in the future. What amazed me most was the fact that apparently Zamperini chose to meet and make peace with his captors later on in his life... that's amazing to me. That's like 'real hero' stuff. But yeah, pretty good film. Wittrock was very effective in his limited screen time as well. Between this, The Normal Heart, and American Horror Story, I'm a real fan. Yeah, I recommend this, not deserved the unfair reactions.",Null,1,7,8 January 2015
Final Destination," Fun, Fun, and more fun!
","What is a better way to make a horror film than to constantly make people die in freak accidents by 'death' himself? Well in schlock horror cinema, not much. The film isn't a masterpiece, but for what it is, it is pretty darn great. It also helps that it builds tension nicely, not to mention how eerie and horrifying the plane crash scene is. I remember it giving me nightmares when I was a kid. This was my fav horrors as a kid but it still holds up pretty nicely and it was the time I was introduced to Ali Larter. Definitely a worthwhile film that actually builds up more and more as the franchise goes on. Strongly recommend this film and it is definitely better than the other popular horror franchise Saw (and even as the originals go this is better).",Null,1,1,11 August 2011
Rear Window," Hitchcock has done it again!
","This is the 3rd Hitchcock film I have seen, and like I predicted, it is a great film. The dialogue between the two main characters is smooth and engaging, and the mystery is riveting and suspenseful. Hitchcock is a master at suspense of course, and this film is no exception. The set design and the cinematography allowing the viewer to witness all of the different characters living in this neighborhood is simply amazing and unforgettable, and Hitchcock was able to really pull me into every scene. James Stewart and Grace Kelly are magnificent together and I loved how the film had just as much intimacy and romance as mystery. Outstanding film!",Null,0,1,22 May 2010
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the best horror films ever made
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is simply one of the best horror films ever made. It reinvented so many new horror ideas. It is one of the most original horror films ever made. It is gory, entertaining fun. I thought that the characters were all realistic, and I thought the acting for the most part was good. However, some of the dialogue is cheesy, and some of the acting at times is atrocious, but it really did not matter. It made me scream, it made me laugh, and for certain, one of the most enjoyable times I have had watching a film. This film deserves all of it's praise, but I cannot help but compare it to Wes Craven's other slasher film, Scream (1996), which I actually think is his best film of his career.",Null,0,2,3 April 2009

Jim Carrey gives a wonderful and heartfelt performance, and it is obvious why so many people watch him on TV everyday, he is very likable. Ed Harris and Laura Linney are also fantastic. When all is said and done, this film feels like it was from the mind of Charlie Kauffman, whose newer film Synecdoche, New York also has a similar idea. The ending is perfect, as is the final line, which makes you realize probably the central idea in this film. All in all, this is a great film and one of Carrey's finest",Null,0,1,10 July 2010
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Better than the first, easily
","I thought the first Hunger Games was a solid, albeit disappointing flick due to the inherent juicy apocalyptic-society material at its core. I just went by that, having never read the books. The sequel digs deeper into this societal factor, and because of it it's a much stronger film overall. The whole cast is pretty good, Lawrence once again seemingly natural and effortless in her performance, she remains the stable ground in the franchise and the biggest reason why it works so well. The action sequences are improved here, but as a whole, much stronger screenplay. This is definitely recommended and probably the best action blockbuster of 2013.",Null,0,15,30 November 2013

","The Matrix is a film that is style over substance, but that doesn't necessarily make it a dumb or bad film. No, it is never trying to be anything more. It does have a unique world and unique style an in that sense The Matrix works.The characters are strong, characters that you can root for. However, the real star here is the direction and visual effects. The effects in particular are amazing, spell-binding, and revolutionary, even more than ten years since it first premiered. The action scenes are intriguing and tense, and overall the film is never something other than engaging. In that respect is where the film works the best, and is sure not to disappoint. That is pretty much where the excitement lies, and in the world the film creates.",Null,0,1,17 October 2010
Godzilla," Decent, if unspectacular
","So this could have been way better. As far as big monster movies go, Cloverfield is way more thrilling and entertaining. Still, this isn't bad, it just seems like a big disappointment (although it also could have been way worse). The acting is good, for the most part. Cranston is aces, as is Elizabeth Olsen. Aaron Taylor Johnson, though, once again remains completely charmless and has no screen presence. Why keep casting him? Because he's hot, right? The character development in this really needed work, as did the screenplay. It's very ho-hum. The directing is adequate though, and the action scenes do hold up well.

Levitt's nose was distracting unlike Kidman's in The Hours. Willis was playing, well, Willis like always. I can see why it would get the reviews it did, for being a sort of mainstream sci-fi film like Source Code was when it came out.

I honestly thought 'I am your father!' would happen here, oh well. It certainly took me long enough to see it, but it's hard to resist this film. The characters really do make it what it is though, and the actual 'wars' is probably the least interesting part of it for me. It's a simply drawn narrative and plot, but it's a testament to the quality of the writing here that the characters are able to simply click and instantly give us the emotional satisfaction that they require. This is of course, a fantastic film.",Null,0,7,5 July 2014
50_50," Well-done
","50/50 was not what I expected it to be. It's not a great film, but it definitely wasn't cloying with sentimentality very much. In fact, there is music, but many times the film's most dramatic moments play out without music, and they also ring true. I do have to say, the film did a great job of balancing the humor and the more serious drama. I wasn't sure how it would do it, but it did it very well. It is not a comedy before a drama, but it isn't a drama first either. Both aspects are handled equal to each other, and sorry for the pun, 50/50.The screenplay is pretty well written, and there are a lot of great scenes in this. The cast only helps it. Bryce Dallas Howard is here yet again playing another unlikable bitch, but I mean she does it very well. But thing is, you want to like her, but ultimately she lets you down. Basically how Levitt felt. Anna Kendrick was sweet, and she captured her character well, despite being similar to her in Up in the Air. Seth Rogen started off annoying me, but I mean, he rises above with a good script (as was evident in Observe and Report). He also becomes very likable. The main reason to see this is for Levitt. This is definitely his best performance so far. In the film most serious scenes, he is fantastic, and he is the one swaying your your emotions.Overall, a very good film, and an example of how to make something memorable from this subject matter and still appeal to the mainstream.",Null,0,1,23 November 2011

The 'vampire mockumentary' plot is something that I don't think anyone eve dreamed of, but it's utterly devoted to making every comedy worth it and it succeeds. There are a few sore spots here and there, but overall this was a great time. Definitely something for moviegoers to seek out next year, it really does add a lot of the horror/comedy genre and I think it could be a real hit across nations. I strongly recommend it, and it has a great attitude about itself that won't turn people away.",Null,12,19,20 December 2014
Deadpool," Ryan Reynolds is great, fine film
","It was good. I enjoyed it. But I can't help but feel disappointed. Sure, it's a lot raunchier than the usual Marvel adaptation films, more violent. But at the end of the day, it really just felt like yet again another Marvel film- not bad at all, but just fine. Aside from the wink-wink self- awareness (which is also trying too hard at times), it's really just following the same type of formula any 'superhero' film follows. The longer the film goes on, the more predictable it gets and the duller it gets as well. I would say that I did like it, but a few hours after seeing it and I don't think it's anything memorable at all. For all of the talk about how 'shocking!' it was and all of the publicity, it's really not all that shocking. At the end of the day, it's just like the typical Marvel fare, just too formulaic for its own good.Sounds like I hated it but not at all. I do feel like it could have been something truly, truly unique but what can you do. Ryan Reynolds is definitely the best thing about it though. Could have easily been too much, but he hits the notes perfectly.",Null,1,7,27 March 2016
Cloud Atlas," Creative, ambitious, and incredibly entertaining

It managed to be entertaining and the stories always made sense in their own style. It wasn't the ambitious failure I expected, and that's because I do think the critics were hard on it. It's certainly no Dune, and if anything, I think it's better than The Matrix. I think the whole cast did a great job, and the film is full of memorable scenes and characters. It's definitely easy to forget a lot of what happens in each story, and keep track of everything going on, but for a first time viewing it's better to just enjoy it and immerse yourself in the experience. This is a film that I can see becoming a huge cult classic.",Null,4,7,22 December 2012

It shows a good sense and personality, one that belongs entirely to itself. The action is also quite shocking. I had no idea it would be rated-R, so when I saw the film I was pleasantly surprised by the type of violence shown and interconnected with some strong themes that the film is trying to play with. I think the lead actor is also very good, very charismatic and he is able to make the part work efficiently. The soundtrack for this is also quite fantastic.",Null,2,6,20 June 2015
Easy A," Great teen comedy with an excellent performance by Emma Stone

Emma stone had recently charmed me in Zombieland and Superbad, and here she shows that she is a great lead. She can really act, giving a performance that is the biggest reason to watch this film. She is perhaps the best young star right now of her age. The rest of the cast is amazing as well. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are hilarious as her off-beat parents, and Lisa Kudrow is great as well in her limited performance. All in all, there is no reason to miss this film. It is rewatchable, entertaining, funny, and best of all, intelligent. Have I mentioned how great Stone is here?",Null,2,4,22 December 2010
The Thin Red Line," Highly ambitious, but difficult...
","The thin Red line is the 2nd Malick film I have watched, and I am already getting familiar with his film style.The Thin Red Line is probably the most difficult war film to really grasp. I don't want to make it sound as if it's one of those films that is hard to get, because that sounds pretentious, but in all honesty, it was for me. The action scenes are easy to admire, and they are full of tension and are directed with great force. There are moments of real transcendence in the story that give the film real texture and beauty. This is one of those films hat one has to concentrate on and give their full attention to. I feel like I did, or tried to, for the most part. This is how I see it. I know that a film like this deserves my 100% attention, but when I don't, then when I end up admiring it a lot but not really enjoying it, I feel like then it's my fault and so a rewatch is in store. But why should I? If the film didn't grab me enough for me to be invested in it's storyline (unlike Badlands) then why should I say that this criticism in part is because of me? It sounds like I didn't like the film, but I did. I do recommend it, but I will say that what is probably it's biggest problem is the running time. Maybe in the future I can rewatch it, but not to try and like it more, just to see how it fares. However, just driven by it's ambition and for some really great moments scattered around, I will settle on a final score of 7.5/10.",Null,1,3,30 May 2011

Annihilation," Incredible in its ability to create awe-inspiring moments.
","So this isn't a perfect film by any means. It has some rough dialogue at times, some unnecessary exposition at times (were the interrogation scenes really needed?), and some much-too-often-used-stereotypes (studying psychology myself, I can't tell you how irksome it is to see films label characters as 'psychologists' and make various assumptions about them). The film also explains many characters by tragic pasts that are too clich√©d. But those are all flaws that, in the grand scheme of things, don't amount to negatively impacting the experience of watching this film, because this is a wildly ambitious, fascinating project. It's rare for me to watch a sci-fi film and experience awe while doing so, but this film does that. Technically it's very well-made. Although some of the visual effects are clunky, the cinematography, editing, and (especially) film score give the entire thing an incredibly mysterious, genuinely interesting atmosphere, one that many films could only dream of creating (perhaps only Arrival's is similar). It also includes some of the most visually memorable moments of this entire decade. The last 15 minutes are awe-inspiring in every sense of the word. They say originality is dead, but I don't think I have ever seen some of the things this film does. For that it should be congratulated. It may be more flawed than Ex Machina, but Garland may have created a film that, not only rivals it, but perhaps exceeds it in its greatness, definitely in ambition and scope.",Null,5,11,4 March 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Great performances
","I don't think this is necessarily a 'great' film, and I can see critics' hesitation with it, but it's just such an immensely entertaining, campy thrill ride. I actually expected something campier, more in the vein of a true children's' film (I guess seeing Kirsten Dunst in it made me think it was). Really, I saw it because her performance here had gotten so much praise. It was deserved. It's really astounding just how much she gave to the role as a child actress. She needed to be aware of its complexities or else it wouldn't have worked at all, and yet every shade of her character, every facet she perfectly conveyed. Really, it's kind of embarrassing thats he stole the film from her costars.",Null,0,2,3 January 2015
Jackie Brown," Simple but effective
","Compared to Tarantino's more bombastic, more outrageous flicks, this is like very subtle. As a film it's not at all, but just compared to his filmography. I can see why many would rate it among his lessor efforts, but I thought it was particularly engaging and well-paced. It's still definitely a crime film but one can see the disappointment in those people who wanted more of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction-like levels of intensity and narrative. The performances here are solid (although Jackson continue to stay in the same comfort zone that he's always good at, even if unoriginal). This is probably middle of the pack for me, but sort of underrated",Null,1,1,25 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A step down
","Bigger isn't always better. Clich√É¬©d, I know, but it's perfect to describe this. Dazzling action sequences and it's not really a big decrease in quality from the first, but some of the creativity and wit is gone, and instead it gets to be too much of an overload. Still, it's pretty entertaining for the most part, the characterizations are once again the best thing about it, and where it leaves the characters in the end is truly fascinating. Unlike A new Hope, I can't say that I totally get the acclaim this one's gotten as the 'best' in the franchise. Still, this is definitely pretty good and definitely doesn't add a bad taste to the franchise.",Null,0,2,5 July 2014
Incredibles 2," Really fantastic

Inside Llewyn Davis," A grand achievement. Perhaps the Coens' finest to date.
","The Coens have a lot of gems in their filmography, and honestly I haven't gone through much of it, but the few I have are wonderful. Before this I always claimed A Serious Man as their best, but now I'm eager to call Llewyn Davis their masterpiece. This is soulful, heart-wrenching, powerful filmmaking. My favorite film of 2013 was Before Midnight, for months, but now I think a new king has emerged as the finest of 2013. This is an amazing film, intimate as can be, and not surprised mainstream and general audiences are 'bored' by it. Oscar Isaac is a revelation, such sadness and longing in his eyes, and he's shown extreme talent here. This is highly recommended.",Null,1,2,16 January 2014
Sin City," The one and only Masterpiece of the comic book genre!
","Sin City is based on three different stories in a place called Basin City. The way the three stories unfold and collapse against one another is captivating to see. Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City is perhaps the first film ever made to really have the authentic tone and look of comic books. Even if you have not seen the film, you probably had heard of this film for it's original style and unique touch of black-and-white special effects. I thought this was one heck of a movie. I thought this was one of the few films to actually have a really powerful narration, which is done by the three main characters played by Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis. I thought the first third with Marv(Mickey Rourke) was one amazing story. I loved the beginning, and I loved this story the best out of the whole film. The second story which focuses on Dwight(Clive Owen) was to an extent different, although the same menacing feel is still there. Whereas Marv's story relied more on suspense and mystery, this part was more action-packed, which had really amazing uses of violence and gore. The third and final act, about Hardigan(Bruce Willis) was more similar to Marv's story, and also had the right use of violence, mystery, and action. I thought the ensemble cast was certainly one to marvel at. There are a lot of movie stars in this film, and some of them are brilliant, whereas some of them not so much. I thought Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, and Benicio Del Toro were the best of the film. They all delivered their best. Especially Benicio Del Toro, who really gave us a creepy and menacing villain. There were others who were not as great. Clive Owen was mixed. In some parts he was great, in others he seemed so dull. Alexis Bledel, Jaime King, and Jessica Alba also had some good parts, but in others they were all sort of bland or bad. But the biggest problem was Brittany Murphy. I thought Murphy was just horrible. In her only scene, she was just talking and acting so mediocre, did not like her one bit. I have seen her in other films, and I thought she was a good actress. Maybe something happened with her here, but she was by far the worst. The writing is also something to appreciate. It was cheesy in parts, but I thought everything, from the dialogue to the events, were all done as they would in a comic book, or in this case graphic novel. I especially liked the imagery and figurative dialogue and the narration that was used, and really enhanced the film to another level.Overall, Sin City is one of the most ambitious, original, entertaining, captivating, action packed, visually stunning and artistically magnificent films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I expect a lot of repeat viewings, and action films had never gotten better than this. A one and only film that needs to be watched, even if only for for its incredible style and ambitious craft.",Null,3,3,9 March 2009
Gangs of New York," So dull
","I mean, Martin Scorsese has come out with some truly amazing films, the best being Taxi Driver. But this? Aside from having amazing set designs and costumes, there's nothing much else to recommend. Diaz and Dicaprio are pretty mediocre. Only Daniel Day Lewis is something great of course, having so much fun with everything happening and turning scenes into greatness. But even then I don't know if I would recommend this film really. I mean if you want to see all of Scorsese's work, go for it just to be complete. But it's definitely one of his lesser works, if not the worst. And in fact, his directing here is sloppy as well. This is just an overbloated mess.",Null,0,4,17 January 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," The perfect deconstruction of Horror... hilarious, tense, unpredictable, and entertaining!
","I had been anticipating The Cabin in the Woods for more than a month. Why? Well, I only heard about it last month, and thank god I wasn't waiting for it for months or even a year like many others. I read the script as well, so I did know what I was going into. But I had to know the joy of watching this on the big screen. Boy, did it live up to my extremely high expectations.The film's opening immediately reminds me of a recent, but equally magnificent horror/comedy, and that is Drag Me To Hell. But whereas that film derived it's comedy from more gags and cartoonish moments, this one starts off with brilliantly written dialogue. From the start we see two guys dealing with some sort of task, and they must accomplish this task or else... well, I'll stop there. I do want to say that although this film is very funny, it also is pretty tense. The cinematography and the music especially drive the scarier scenes well, and they both do a great job of maintaining it's witty but also seriously-driven tone. People have said that this film makes fun of these types of films. In a way yes, but it's important to note that both Goddard and Whedon were able to come up with this because they love horror so much. Their love for the genre is apparent in all of the turns the story takes, but it's not a spoof. This film is meant to be taken seriously as a horror film. It isn't just here to 'make fun' of the genre as much as it is here to reinvent the genre and to make it that much more exciting. It's a blast to see this much love for the genre oozing through the screen. Since everyone has already talked endlessly about the satire and about the expectations the film toys with, I want to talk about the characters. When looking at what happens, it's surprising to see just how much we do care for them. Not just the main 5, but also the ones behind the 'experiment'. Bradley Whitford in particular stands out, with many different traits that make him the most likable of the bunch. His comedic timing, as well as his sense of regret and sadness at times, is brilliant. When it comes to the doomed 5, they all stand out in their own ways. Kristen Connoly is beautiful, with the sort of angelic face that stems from a more pure form of Uma Thurman. All of the deaths here are well done and quite brutal. The character that surprisingly has stayed with me the most was the first that got the axe, and I think that the first attack/death is quite effective in it's execution. You aren't just watching how 'cool' the deaths look, but in this case especially, it makes you desperately sad for that character. The acting from this actor in his/her first death is quite effective and haunting, and quite sad. The ending is spectacular, and as a whole was able to have a balance between witty and funny but also serious. The cameo is brilliant, and the final scene with the discussion is fantastic. People shouldn't be ready for a twist, because what the film does very well is hint at several clues throughout the film. There's never any real 'revelation' or twist, but instead the viewer is strapped to more and more information about what is really going on. The final minutes are again, rather sad. I was surprised by how much emotion the film allows the viewer to have, and in these final moments of the film is when that is more evident. Again, the film works perfectly for what it's trying to be, but despite that it still works on 'feelings' and to me that's what was most surprising coming out of it. I had read the script, but what I hadn't counted on was the amount of care and thought put into these characters and situations, despite how ludicrous and how extreme they were. All in all, definitely what I was hoping for really. I have not stopped thinking about the film, and to me it's pretty much the perfect horror film. I'm sure it'll remain among my favorites of the year, just like that little Sam Raimi flick in 2009 did. I never had any anticipation for The Avengers, but hey, bring it on!",Null,2,15,15 April 2012
Joy," Lively, charismatic, if broad, work from Jennifer Lawrence
","Joy itself was really disjointed and messy. American Hustle was messy too, but in a more substantial way. This was a decently entertaining film, very inoffensive, but without much effect or weight. The screenplay needed a lot more work because the ingredients to have made it work seemed to be in its grasp, yet it never fully came together. The cast is very good though and the reason it works at all. In particular, Jennifer Lawrence is a joy (sorry for that). Like always, she's extremely lively and and endlessly charismatic. She makes the film work more than it should, and she brightens the whole thing up. So, that's a positive. The problem here, and it's become more obvious with each new Russell-Lawrence collaboration... she seems to work in broad characterization. It was more obvious in American Hustle, but that character called for over-the- top mannerisms and performing, but it does seem like Russell is taking away so much of her nuance that she showed in something like Winter's Bone. I think it's a very good Lawrence performance here, and not many people I could accuse of being unsubtle and still really good. The reason she's so good is because of her energy and natural charisma, but I do think she relies a little too much on really obvious 'acting' at times. So as odd as this sounds, I kind of loved her here, yet I do acknowledge that I hope she and Russell either stop working together or tone it down. Odd, I know.",Null,0,6,27 December 2015
Moon," One of the best Science-Fiction films ever made
","I can definitely say that Moon is the film that resembles 2001: A Space Odyssey the most. Since I saw 2001 around two years ago, I have declared it the best film ever made. While I doubt any film will ever take that spot, no other film made me feel the way 2001 did besides Moon.Moon's plot revolves around one astronaut, Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), who works in Lunar Industries and is waiting until the day he sees his family again. However, after a hallucination causes serious implications, his whole plan changes. I do not want to give more away, because I think the less you know about the film before you see it the better. Moon has a solitary and somber tone to it, one that haunted me and amazed me. This is Duncan Jones' first project, and he proved he is a director to watch. The beautiful look of the moon and the cinematography were captivating. The colors supported the film's tone, and as did the great music score by Clint Mansell. While it is true this film owes a lot to other films, particularly 2001, it stands on it's own. Whereas 2001 was more about human evolution and technology, Moon is about the loneliness and despair of one man. It is a much more character-driven film than 2001. Sam Rockwell is brilliant. He plays his character with different depths and feelings, and I thought he was the perfect choice. Kevn Spacey voiced GERTY (the similar character to HALL 2000) with the perfect amount of emotion, or sometimes lack of emotion. The film was unpredictable, and as it went along you realize more and more about what the industries are about, and learn more about Sam Bell.Moon was a compelling debut from Jones, and I found it hard to believe that the budget was just $5 Million. Definitely one of my favorite sci-fi films, and probably the decade's best, along with Donnie Darko (if you can call that sci-fi). A beautiful and exhilarating film, the best yet of 2009.",Null,3,6,31 October 2009
True Romance," Pretty fun
","No doubt, perhaps there could've been more fluidity in this, but it doesn't matter. The two leads are exquisite, both injecting their characters with a lot of charm and humanity despite all of the things they are embarking on and doing. That's a real achievement. It's maybe not as great of a film as it clearly aimed to be, sort of similar to other classics of older eras or even classics of its own era, but it's remember rather well, and that's impressive. I really saw it because of Patricia Arquette, and she shines here surely. I think it's a film that will be very hard to dislike for most people, and it's something that will be so much fun to most.",Null,2,2,7 January 2015
Her," Amazing
","I've seen many 2013 films, but only two have touched me in deeply personal ways, and these two stand on another level to everything else I saw from that year. The first is Before Midnight, which I saw months ago. The second is Her, a funny, soulful, deeply moving film that, like Before Midnight, is about love, about human relationships, about the yearning to communicate with someone else. It's so easy for this film to fall into conventions, even with the sci-fi-ish concept. And really, its structure isn't too different, but it's so brilliantly written and directed, and above all else, acted. Joaquin Phoenix gave a tour-de-force performance last year in The Master, and he does yet again here. It's a moving performance unlike any other, touring over any other male performance of the year. The fact that he probably won't get nominated for an Oscar is a travesty because he should be walking away with it. Amy Adams gives her best turn here since Junebug. It's a small role, but she hasn't so fully immersed herself into a character, this deeply and realistically, since then. And then there's Scarlett Johansson, who, just with her voice, does some of the best work all year as well. I've never been a big fan of her, even in her most acclaimed performance (Lost in Translation) but she does things here that I never knew she was capable of. She and Phoenix touched my soul, truly. I sound cheesy right? It's true. I don't know what else to say about the film, but it's a masterpiece through and through and am awarding it the highest possible grade on my first viewing, which I rarely do.",Null,1,3,10 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," A beautiful, exhilarating, sweeping Motion Picture!
","Slumdog Millionaire is probably the most satisfying film in years.Slumdog Millionaire is such a fine film. It is so colorful, so beautifully told and made. The direction is amazing. Danny Boyle's finest work to date. He has created his masterpiece. This is a drama, an intense film at times, but such a warm and romantic film at it's core. The screenplay is marvelously written in such a joyful way to captivate the audiences. It truly is original, very ambitious also. Yes, it does follow a very simple love arc, but the journey getting there is so brilliant. The acting is top notch. All the actors are unknown, but they all deliver their best, as well as the many child actors. The editing of scenes is so well done, I hope it wins the Oscar, and the cinematography is just so artistically captured, all it's realism.I have to say, all the Oscar buzz surrounding this film is all greatly deserved. It surprised me a lot, it is an amazing piece of cinema, that is able to remain exhilarating and captivating. A must-see. One of the best films of the year",Null,2,5,27 December 2008
The Nice Guys," Really surprising
","I expected an enjoyable, run-of-the-mill buddy crime comedy film. I did not expect it to be so darn great. It's really funny but it's also quite dark in a lot of its humor, and many of the turns in the story are refreshing and surprising. Having a child actress get a role like that is really something else. Crowe and Gosling made an incredible team together. Overall, much more memorable than I initially expected and I'm surprised that it seems there isn't more hype or talk about this. I can really see it getting a lot of deserved Golden Globe nominations. I do think this is a great watch, although inevitably it will appeal to some film fans more than others and they will have to determine for themselves.",Null,3,7,24 July 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Bombastic, grandiose, intelligent and wickedly entertaining
","There aren't many action films that do much for me. Usually, the story itself isn't engaging enough for me, and sometimes the action just becomes way too overwhelming to the point that I become desensitized to it and lose interest pretty much. In fact, this is what happened to the rest of the Mad Max films. I think all are decent, but great? Not really. So I was super excited for this because of all of the acclaim, but also hesitantThankfully, this film really did it for me. In terms of narrative structure, it's pretty straight- forward, but the universe created here is nothing short of outstanding, and the themes it's presenting are grandiose and powerful. For all of its madness (and yeah, it's truly mad), there's a sensitivity to the film that I can't really pinpoint. It's one of the loudest, busiest films I think I've ever seen, but the fact that its heart shines through and it actually comes across as honestly trying to tell a story about human nature, and not just putting it for show because it 'needs' to have a story, is wildly impressive. Some of the dialogue is stuff to be expected, but the way the film paints these relationships without trying too hard really pays off. The film is able to maintain its madness and through it all actually resonate emotionally. That's a grand featBut in terms of the action, wowza. Don't really know what else to say. Whereas many action films, and with a lot less action I may add, suffer from the way the action is filmed, nothing here does. The editing and cinematography need to be praised for that alone. There is so much happening and yet every scene comes across cleanly without any glaring problems. The film also cleverly overwhelms its first act with as much action as possible, and in its own way calms down after that. This helps to let viewers know that the classic 'action film' structure will be broken, and it's done wonderfully. To say that this is my favorite Mad Max film would be a huge understatement. It's glorious and majestic, wickedly bombastic and entertaining. Easily one of my favorite 'action' films ever, and the only time I've been overwhelmed by an action film but was still able to enjoy it.",Null,4,9,15 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Well acted
","I pretty much found this film to be exactly what I expected. Very Hollywoodized, definitely concentrating on the emotional and sentimental aspects of the story with full force. But it's a good film. There's a certain backlash that has formed against the film for being so successful for the award precursors that leads to eventual Oscar nominations. I don't think it's one of the best films of the year, but that is unfortunate if it will keep some people from watching it. I do think Andrew Garfield's performance is worthy of praise. He really makes the total character work and he is really giving the role his all. Overall I do recommend it. It could have been something truly great but it could have been a lot worse.",Null,1,4,17 January 2017
Gladiator," Decent
","This isn't really my kind of film. At all. I mostly saw it for Russell Crowe, and while I think he was really good, I thought that Joaquin Phoenix stole the film. It's great to see the actor behind The Master and Her deliver such a great performance early on in his career, before he was as acclaimed as he is now. He makes the character never wholly evil, and you can understand where his pain comes from. It's a great performance, although at times his writing is sketchy (as is the whole film's). Ridley Scott does a nice job with he directing, and his work here is what stands out more than the writing. Overall, decent, if with some reservations.",Null,0,0,14 June 2014
Donnie Darko," A Masterpiece
","Donnie Darko is one of the most unique and fascinating films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I watched it for the first time around two years ago, and since then it has not lost it's power. Richard Kelly is a true genius. He has a lot of interesting ideas and he lets them through in his first film. His writing is incredible. He blends in a lot of ideas with science-fiction and religion. The reason I have such a special bond with this film is because of the characters. Theya re intriguing, and Kelly really explores every aspect of a human mind and every emotion there is, even literally. I thought the film had a lot of similarities with American Beauty, as in the strange guy and his relationship, and a lot of the family aspects of the film are similar. Sadly, only American beauty is the film that got the attention when it came out, but I am glad this film has such a strong reputation now. It is wonderfully shot, and it is one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen. While I also love Kelly's sophomore film, Southland Tales quite a lot, Donnie Darko will always be his best. The performances in the film are extraordinary. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a very eerie and special performance, and I thought Mary McDonnell's portrayal as the mother was the second best performance in the film. The scene where Donnie asks her how it feels to have a wacko as a son, and her response, perfect! The whole cast is great. I think the reason the film works so well is because it as a mood unlike any other film. It has a very slow, somber, mellow mood to it, and together with the creative scenes involving the Bunny Rabbit, it creates a sort of thriller sci-fi drama.Overall, this is one of the key films in my long list of films I have seen. In my Top 20 of all time, and just a powerful, very affecting film that will never leave me.",Null,0,1,20 August 2009
The Social Network," Revolutionary for our time
","When I first heard that David Fincher was making a film about the networking site Facebook, I was definitely very skeptical. Well, there was no need to be. Fincher took Aaron Sorkin's brilliantly clever screenplay and turned it into a film that highlights the best and worst moments of out technology-based life.The Social Network's first scene is brilliantly written and acted, and it sets the mood that both Fincher and Sorkin want to set for the rest of the film. The film is seen as the advancement of how Mark Zuckerberg got his world-famous website started. Now, I know that a lot of the film was exaggerated or fictional, but it does not matter. Sorkin and Fincher have brought us this really interesting character, who is brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg is one of the best young actors in this time, and while he has mostly done comedy until now, his role demands much more attention to subtlety and character nuances to move along. Last year Eisenberg showed us that he could create some of the most likable characters in films like Zombieland and Adventureland, and this year he proves to us that he can actually create a very flawed and condescending, but still sympathetic character that we may or may not end up hating. This was credit to his real talent. Andrew Garfield was also pretty much equal in terms of performance, and he was a true star next to Eisenberg's character. The rest of the cast are all fine, including Justin Timberlake that has proved over the years that he can actually act pretty impressively. On another note, the film might seem very different than Fincher's other films, which include pretty much all crime/thrillers and a fantasy (Benjamin Button), but I thought that he was able to leave his mark on the film. It certainly took itself seriously, which for a film like this is fortunate. The cinematography was also very impressive, but not showy, and very keen on the real focus of the film. Ultimately, The Social Network is a very hard film to dislike. However, I also know that it is not the type of easy-going, fun but forgettable film that many (including me) expected months ago. It is more profound, more meaningful, but it might not hit a nerve with all viewers, including the young that will only want to see the 'Facebook Movie!'. I think The Social Network has a lot of similarity to last year's Up In The Air. Both represent a dilemma about people's communications in the modern world, and both can be seen as perfect examples of what life in the 21st' century was like. The Social Network is about the many connections that we have with others, and it makes you feel the longing and loneliness that might come with it. It is David Fincher's best to date.",Null,76,146,9 October 2010
Macbeth," Fassbender and Cotillard are divine in an elegant, poetic, somber adaptation
","Now, call me uncultured or whatever, but I have never seen or read the actual play. I'm of course familiar with many of the plot elements of it, to the point that I knew where much of the film would go. Saying that however, I didn't expect such a melancholy, quiet film. I had especially heard much about Cotillard's portrayal of Lady Macbeth and how she did a different take on it. First of all, I would really appreciate if those who are very familiar with the play would tell me how faithful this adaptation is and how different the portrayals and everything are.While I've always had somewhat of a problem with Shakespearean adaptations in terms of the prose, I found that this film's reliance on its visuals really compliment the story and its themes and really brought a perspective that I wasn't really expecting. It has a lot of style, but I think it worked well as it did. The cinematography and directing here are really strong, and there's such a firm grasp on every aspect of the film. Did it leave me cold? Somewhat, but I expected it to. I think what really helps it aren't just its technical aspects, but the really fantastic performances by Fassbender and Cotillard. It seems like both performances have been very divisive on here (again, I would appreciate if anyone wanted to elaborate or talk about why they liked or disliked them), but I thought both stayed in the vein of the film's poetic tone. I certainly do understand if, due to the film's extremely low-key approach, it may have been underwhelming. I personally thought both actors gave powerful, intense performances in the different way that one would be accustomed to.I wouldn't say I've seen countless of Shakespeare adaptations, but from the ones I have I would say this is my favorite. Certainly worth it for the acting.",Null,1,3,22 January 2016
Goodfellas," A 'different' look into the Gangster life...
","Goodfellas is another brilliant picture from Scorsese. It blends in everything that makes a film great- entertaining scenarios, great dialogue, and a lot of climactic resolutions. Both Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci give incredible performances, and both veer into different types of characters. This isn't The Godfather in it's tone. It is much more energetic, more adrenaline-driven, and in a way more entertaining. De Niro is always great to have, but as far as his performances go this doesn't hold a candle to his best. The story all around is strong, although I wouldn't call it anything ground-breaking as far as other films of similar nature are concerned. But it does Scorsese's filmography proud.",Null,0,1,2 January 2011
The Great Gatsby," Surprisingly really liked it
","It's no secret that while I always wanted this film to be good, I never had high expectations. Those expectations were lowered with each new trailer, each new released clip, because it seemed totally opposite from what Fitzgerald intended in the novel. The film was pretty much what I expected in its complete theatricality, but what I didn't expect was to like it as much as I did. I don't think this is a great adaptation of the novel, or even a great film, but it sure is a highly entertaining one. As shallow as the film looked in the trailers, I thought it would all only work on the surface but have no actual understanding of the novel. Despite the style and it being as subtle as a hammer to the head, it doesn't completely feel misguided in its execution. That's because the novel's criticism of this same style the film has can be seen as some sort of underlying satire or even parody when it comes to the more over-the-top scenes. Whatever it is, it kinda works. The only other Baz film I've ever seen is Moulin Rouge and I thought that film lost a lot of steam as it went on, even though it does calm down. This one does too, but the source material is so much more interesting that I can't imagine someone making it completely boring. Quite a few scenes are ridiculous in their overbearingness, but they still manage to be a lot of fun.A huge reason why this works is because of the cast, and I actually didn't have a big problem with any of them. Maguire is the biggest mixed result here, but even then I expected him to be awful so I was pleasantly surprised. I also expected Dicaprio to completely butcher this character by the clips and trailers I'd seen, and that's the biggest surprise here. He gives Gatsby a lot of the original intrigue that carries us through the novel, and his presence always remains grounded, sometimes even contrary to how the film is. My problem with Dicaprio here, and with him in other films, is his inconsistent accent that does get in the way of his performance, and so many of his 'Old Sport' deliveries are cringe-worthy. But besides that, I think he did a really good job. The same with Edgerton and Mulligan, both who do the most justice to how I envisioned the characters in the novel. Mulligan's known for playing quietly sophisticated characters with hidden vulnerability, but she subtly gets to the root of Daisy and by the end of it I had the same feelings towards her here that I've always had towards her in the novel- contempt. She does a great job of exposing her for who she really is as the film goes on, but never as obvious as the film around her.So to everyone's surprise, I quite liked this film. As an adaptation, it's actually worthy because of the acting, and as a stand-alone film it's even more worthy for how entertaining and intriguing it remains, either in spite or because of all of the absurdity on screen.",Null,2,10,7 June 2013
The Birds," A macabre Masterpiece!
","I am ashamed to say this, but The Birds is my first Hitchcock film. Yes, it is true, so I was not familiar with the style that he was going to use, but dang, this film was spectacular! The writing and directing really captures your full attention. What I love was that the first 40 minutes or so there was nothing about it that was in any way horror, but instead gave all the characters perfect development and mystery. The dialogue was brilliant and clever, and the characters fleshed out strongly to make us care for them. When the horror started, it completely amazed me how Hitchcock could make the transition from such a light, and fairly romantic film to a terror and suspenseful film, but that is exactly what he does. The cinematography is brilliant, as are the performances. Suzanne Pleshette was the stand-out to me, creating a very mysterious and somewhat likable, yet at the same time very hidden and obscured, character. I am fairly certain that I will seek out more of Hitchcock's film after this!",Null,3,6,7 May 2010
Sully," Tom Hanks is great, like always
","Although this film got favorable reviews, it seems like many people were sort of lukewarm on it. It definitely didn't help that it reminded me of the atrocious Flight from a year years back. Maybe perhaps because of that I found this to be a very pleasant surprise. I do think some of the placement of scenes and transition from flashbacks to the present were a little awkward and disjointed, including the ending. It's not that the last scenes were bad, it just seemed like someone chopped off the last 15 or 10 minutes of the film and there's such an awkward fade-out that makes you really confused as to why anyone would choose to end it that way. Still, flaws and all I found this to be pretty absorbing and Tom Hanks is great, like he always is. A very nice surprise and I like how the film avoids being overly sentimental.",Null,0,0,20 December 2016
Princess Mononoke," Lovely
","I've only seen a few of the director's films, but the ones I have (Spirited Away, The Wind Rises, My Neighbor Totoro, and now this) i have enjoyed immensely. They all have a certain sensitive demeanor and tone, a very carefully realized world in each one. As it is, it's always a pleasure to get lost within those worlds no matter the circumstances. Here, I saw this one in an English dubbing but it was pretty great. The voices really lend something to the proceedings that is not that easy to really get at by reading subtitles, even though that is always the preferred method. Overall, this may not be in the level of Spirited Away but it remains an intriguing, fantastical journey of really coming into one's own.",Null,1,2,26 December 2015
Alien: Covenant," Kind of underrated
","So there are definitely many flaws with this film. It has some very noticeable clich√©s and some really dumb moments. However, I still believe it's kind of underrated, which is what I also thought of Prometheus. For all of its dumb moments (and there are a lot) it's still a lot of fun and is successful in moving this franchise even further. I enjoyed what it brought to this world, even if it doesn't do anything original in terms of its execution. The visuals are really well done and the action and thrills are exhilarating. For all of its problems, I think this is a worthy addition to this series.",Null,2,11,21 May 2017
The Wizard of Oz," After almost 70 years, still the most vivid and colorful film of all time!
","And knowing a little more about film, and about quality, I have to say, it truly is an unforgettable movie. I will start with it's visual styles. To this day, I have never seen a more colorful film in my life. To think that it was the year 1939, wow. The costume designs were so amazing. It had to use a lot, and the were so original and beautiful. The make-up done on the Wicked Witch, and a bunch of other creatures and being, just pure genius. Also, this is a film that when it ends, it leaves you in 'awe'. Like not really wanting it to end. It leaves you feeling for everybody.It's lesson is so simple, but I always forget it, along with others. Our families DO hold us together. It's storytelling is so pure and bewitching. The effects done on the twister are great. Every scene holds a visually stunning work of art. Great cinematography. And what really makes this film, it's amazing characters. Sure to stay with more generations to come. Definitely has to have a soft spot on everybody's list. How could it not?",Null,4,6,14 March 2008
The Martian," Great score, great editing, great acting
","This was a weird experience. I just expected it to be a pretty dark, serious film (along the vein of interstellar). I purposely always avoid trailer for fear of spoilers, and so I was not prepared at all for how light and humorous the film is. Upon checking the screenwriter being Drew Godard, it made sense, but i guess all the humor in a space film (just because Gravity and interstellar are so fresh in the mind) threw me off guard. I appreciated it as much as I disliked it. I felt like the humor was pretty off at times, and the film didn't warrant its running time. It tried to cram in a lot of characters. But on the flipside, there's such a genuine good-heartedness to the whole thing. It managed to make the earth scenes work, and of course Matt Damon's scenes are aces. I'm just not sure how much I liked it, but this is definitely less of a passion film than both Gravity and Interstellar. I don't see it making any big awards splash in a few months, it's just too light and dare I say it, disposable?",Null,5,65,3 October 2015
The Fighter," Great direction and performances make this an excellent film
","Do we have a lot of sport films where the underdog ends up winning and overcoming many obstacles along the way until the end? Definitely. Does The Fighter succeed? Very much so...For a film like this it is very difficult to make it completely unpredictable, yet while The Fighter is in a way conventional, it is also unpredictable many times. It has great characters to boot, but also a strong cast that is willing to give it their all. This is the best ensemble cast of the year,, many amazing performances. First, I start off with Mark Wahlberg, who has been the most under the radar, but he is definitely up for this. He is a great lead and I am surprised he was as good as he was. I am also very pleasantly surprised by Amy Adams. Not to say she is a bad actress, but I was always used to her roles all being similar and now she is in a completely different role for her, and to say she succeeds is an understatement. She is excellent, and is only made strong when sharing the screen with any other actor. Melissa Leo is also great, and I think she is on par with Adams. The difference between Adams and Leo is that Leo has the more award-baity role. Now we have Christian Bale, who I do think is the best. I have seen his performances and while he has always been good, he has never truly risen above others in his films, here he does. He is excellent, and he as of now deserves that Oscar.David Russel's direction is part of what makes this film so great, He soars scenes to unbelievable heights and I think that the screenplay in another director's hands would have came out with a merely good film. But here, we have an excellent film, perhaps better than 2008's The Wrestler, and one of the best films of the year.",Null,59,78,2 January 2011
Evil Dead II," Evil Dead 2: Exercise in non-stop over-the-top jumbles!
","I found Evil Dead 2 to be quite different than the original. While it does have the same basic plot, Evil Dead 2 goes for more over-the-top comedy and silliness. That is what makes it so good. I have to be honest, the beginning had me confused, but as the film goes along, I grew with it. Some of the scenes, like the hand scene, and the talking lamps and animals were hilarious. But I did not find it quite as amazing as the first. I could not connect with the other characters as much, and I did find it got repetitive in the end. However, it is a classic and easily one of the ten best horror films ever. Bruce Campbell was also stronger in this film and more secure",Null,2,3,12 July 2009
Up in the Air," A powerful and rich film. One of the best of 2009
","Up In The Air is a rich film. It is one of those rare films that manages to entertain, make you laugh, make you sad, and one that stays with you after it is over. I say it is that rare film, because although there might be a lot that try to be similar in a way, Up In The Air is the one-of-a- kind film of 2009, and probably the most satisfying experience you will have from 2009. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man that goes all around the country firing people from different countries. He meets Alex (played by Vera Farmgia) and both believe they have the same desires for their relationship, and nothing mutual. Ryan is forced to teach Natalie (played by Anna Kendrick) the ropes of the company, after she endangers his chance of achieving a certain number of flier miles. All three of these characters go through circumstances that reveal their true nature and true life. I have never been a big fan of Clooney, I have always thought he plays the same types of characters in all of his films. But in this film, I finally recognize how great of an actor he is. He achieves everything that is required from him, and his subtle expressions and thoughts are perfectly portrayed. I fully appreciate his character transformations now, and how subtle and realistic they are. Vera Farmiga is a natural actress, and she reveals her character to be mysterious and not what we expect her to be. Anna Kendrick is a charmer, and I believe that all three actors deserve to be nominated for Academy Awards. I have only seen one other Jason Reitman film, and that is Juno. While that was a good film, a very good film at times, I found Up In The Air a lot better- more charming, more real. He has incredible writing skill and his direction was very well balanced, and he never over- directs anything or allows it to feel unauthentic. At the end of the day, Up In The Air makes you think about your own life, and about everyone and everything involved with your experiences. It is one of the best films of 2009",Null,1,5,3 January 2010
Atonement," A Masterpiece about Love, War, and human Sins.
","I have to say, this film may not be for everyone. The reason is because the film jumps in time a lot, and the film has to be seen cautiously. This film presents a lot of characters in a lot of different perspectives. Occurrences happen a lot from different points of view. The story starts in the year of 1935, from the eyes of a young girl named Briony Tallis(played by Saoirse Ronan). Briony ends up changes her sister and her sister's lover's lives forever. She sees them in a close embrace that she misunderstands. Because of her sights, she accuses the lover, Robbie Turner(played by James McAvoy), and he is sent away. The story is then set to 5 years later, where we see Robbie Turner in the war, his forgotten lover, Cecilia Tallis(played by Kiera Knightley), as a retired nurse that lives alone after five years, and the mysterious and misguided Briony Tallis at 18 years old(played by Romola Garai), who has struck away from the family and is trying to atone for her past mistakes as a nurse. Eventually, Briony Tallis has to overcome what she had to face through all her life, ending the film in the close of the twentieth century.This film is spectacular because it tells about how a person's sins might change their lives forever. The film also shows how a relationship, one that was never really thought of, one that happened so fast, how it can grow stronger and stronger. The acting in this film is simply very strong. There is not much talking in a lot of scenes between the lovers, but both Knightley and McAvoy command the screen. I thought that James McAvoy deserved an Oscar nomination, and Knightley also did very well enough to get one. The breakthrough performance comes from Saoirse Ronan, who plays Briony at 13 years old. The reason her performance was under Supporting in the Academy Awards is because, even though Briony is really the main character, there are only about the first 45 minutes that she comes out in. Her performance, as a child actor, is really strong, and I am glad she got the buzz. The performance of Briony at 18 years old, played by Romola Garai, is also effective, and she really makes the film to go into the direction that Briony is now sorry for her sins and her lies that she made 5 years ago. The performance that was probably the most effective as a whole, was Vanessa Redgrave playing Briony Tallis at 77 years old. Even though she only has about 5 minutes of screen time at the end of the film, her revelations, her forgiveness, her honesty and her bravery that she conveys with emotions is just amazing. Some say the performance was too short to get recognized, but it did get recognized. Vanessa Redgrave was nominated for a Critic's Choice Award and other awards. Trust me, her acting will make you deeply emotional. Along with the acting, of course, the screenplay is also very strong. Very dialogue-less, it is able to capture a lot of magic, also because of the director Joe Wright, Joe Wright does a lot of tricks in this film. He is able to capture a 7 minute long shot that is one of the best of the century, and is said to be remembered along with others. The film definitely deserved a Best Director nomination. The cinematography is amazing, The sets are fantastic and realistic, the costumes only help the film more. The original music score, which was done by Dario Marinelli, is probably the most original piece of music I have ever heard. It is a score that is haunting, without being very melodramatic. It's Oscar win was very well deserved.Overall, this is a pure 10/10 film. It is superb, and it will emotionally shock you, because it has one of the most clever and revealing endings in cinema history. It is a film to endure, and one that I will definitely remember in 10 years, and one that should be classified, maybe as much as other classics like Citizen Kane. yes, it is that good, and it does revolve around one character, Briony Tallis, maybe more than you think...",Null,4,6,22 May 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Staggering in its ambition
","As a big fan of the Coens, I've always said that their comedies don't do much for me as their dramas (well, in this case their films that are more drama than comedy). This may be the exception though, it's probably the first of their comedies that I really love. The whole cast is fantastic, Turturro is once again MVP (he can do so much with his expressions, so talented). What has to be noted here is the incredible music, can't wait to hear the soundtrack by itself. The film keeps on surprising throughout, it's quite funny but also quite pleasurable. It's truly amazing just how much range the Coens have, and how much they can do with such complex ideas.",Null,0,0,30 May 2014
The Godfather," Excellent and Completely intriguing
","So I have finally seen one of the most iconic films of all time. How does it feel? Like I accomplished something. One has to be keen on not having huge expectations when one watches films of this grand respect and stature in history. How was it?The film does start slow, and from the first appreance of Brando to be honest I couldn't understand him much. However, over time goes by I was more and more interested in him. I was shocked when several scenes played out, and I am surprised that this isn't Brando's film. This is Pacino's film. Pacino is completely mesmerizing in his approach and character, and he is the one who has a transformation. He is somewhat of a bigger lead character than Brando. The entire cast is outstanding, and you really get to appreciate the script when you can really see the film with subtitles and realize how great the dialogue is.Ready for Part 2!",Null,1,3,12 February 2011
