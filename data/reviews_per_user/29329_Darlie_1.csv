Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A mixed feeling
","I don't usually go to movie theatre, but instead, wait 6 months and rent the videos. However, I made an exception for Episode I, because you need a cinema as big as possible in order to fully appreciate George Lucas' Sound and Visual Effects. And Mr. Lucas did not disappoint at all. The underwater world in Naboo, the Podracing, and the Senate chamber were all breathtaking. As much as I am a Star Wars fan, I do have to point out some of the disappointments: 1) The story opening with a dispute with the Trade Federation seems a little weak for a great Epic. 2) The general lack of depth in the dialogue. 3) The final sequence, in terms of style, was an exact replica of that in Return of the Jedi - the simultaneous battles in outer space, on the ground, and among the masters of the Force. This could have been an average movie but there was one surprisingly inspirational element: Queen Armidila. I was totally impressed by her. Her character had vision, leadership, and courage. and yet throughout the movie there was trace of tenderness and vulnerability. She will be the main reason that I look forward to Episode II.",7,0,0,4 June 1999
