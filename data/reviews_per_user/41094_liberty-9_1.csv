The Blair Witch Project," good for horror movie
","I usually don't like horror movies, but this one was good.  Pretty scary in a no gore kind of way.  I also liked the entire first person camera stuff. I was disappointed at the end to see a fairly massive production crew.  I was hoping this would have been a five person crew indi type movie.  Oh well.",9,1,1,3 August 1999
