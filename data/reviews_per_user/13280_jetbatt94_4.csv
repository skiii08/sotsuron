Alien 3," When you forget you're watching an Alien movie...
","It's got to be bad when your two thirds of the way through the movie and forget that it's an Alien sequel. The writing was so bad, in order to make the dialogue long enough for the two and a half hour borefest, the f-bomb becomes every other word. When you have no creativity, you resort to the lowest common denominator.
By the end of the movie, I couldn't care less what happens to Ripley. And with a $50M budget, they could have made better looking miniatures or alien costumes than the horrible CG.
This movie is pure garbage compared to the other two masterpieces. The end of Aliens is a fitting end, as this horrible sequel never needed to be laid down on film.",1,1,2,12 November 2019
Aquaman," Sigmund & The Sea-Monsters meets Thor
","After two hours of CGI overdose, this was my first thought:
'Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.'",2,3,4,21 May 2019
Dunkirk," Dumb-kirk!
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and was greatly dissatisfied. I've read history accounts and watched documentaries on the evacuations at Dunkirk, but this movie in no way represented what I imagined. 
I was not sure what was going on most of the time, nor who the central characters were. The individual stories kept cross-crossing And intersecting in some weird time warp scenario. It took me a while to realize I had already seen the same scene but from another character's perspective. Groundhog Day-Ja vu. 
At the end, I just didn't care anymore.

Midway," Forget the reviews and just enjoy the movie!
","Quit reading these reviews and just go see this movie for yourself. Don't try and compare it to the war movies of the 60's and 70's, just let it stand on its own. Nit pickers are never satisfied and wanna-be film critics only know how to be critical.
You don't have to be a history nerd to keep up with the story of the battles that build up to the battle of midway, because they're explained by the characters. Is the majority of the backgrounds and battle scenes CGI? Yes! But after a while, the intense action makes you forget.
It seems as though some of the stories were taken straight from the History Channel documentary 'Battle 360' on the USS Enterprise's role in WWII. Even some of the fighter scenes and dive bombings are reproduced in this film with uncanny similarities. But overall, this film is riveting at times and down right entertaining.",9,1,2,13 November 2019
