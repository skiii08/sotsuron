Raiders of the Lost Ark," 6/10
","Favorite Scene : After a serious battle in the bazar Indiana Jones clearly tired and still trying to chase after Marion, a swarm of villains move to reveal a boss like foe. Dressed in black and red with a larger sword this enemy stood out compared to the regular white and tan cloaked swarm. It looks like Indi is about to embark in a intense fight scene, but Indi pulls out a gun shoots him and moves on. Its comical, but also it brought realism to me of how Indi is in control and calm during these fights. I also enjoyed when Indi was terrified of the snake in his lap during the plane scene, a man who is seemly unfazed by everything around him scared to the core of a pet snake, it made the character feel some what human despite what he was going through.What took me out of the film : When Indi was fist fighting the bulky German man I couldn't believe he didn't get the pulp beaten out of him. Ill take the sword fights and some of the other fighting scenes with a grain of salt, but this seemed too fictional to me.Very enjoyable, and a need to see movie. A 6/10 due to somewhat unbelievable turn of events of plot and lack of suspense it felt somewhat predictable, but still very entertaining.",6,2,5,11 September 2019
