Child 44," A remarkable failure
","A best-selling book loosely based on one of the maddest true life serial killers ever. How could a film adaptation with Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman go wrong?Well, it did. Dingy rather than dark. Slow rather than tense. Ridiculous accents. Obvious goofs. Pretty much every nationality present except Russian. Then there's the actual plot. Leo and Raisa's relationship is totally 1D, which kind of undermines the entire story. The relationship between Leo and the killer, too.This pleases no one.Thriller lovers will be bored. Russians and slavs will find it hilarious and inaccurate. Fans of true crime will find it irrelevant. Fans of the book will be disappointed.",4,0,0,9 May 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," I'd rather kick a wall with cocktail sticks under my toenails than watch this again.
","I'm sorry to contradict the various pretentious black-and-white- photograph types who've bandied around such words as 'glorious' and 'a succulent extravaganza' and similar, but I felt I had to write a review to warn anyone with an IQ over 65.This film is just awful. The plot, summarised: pew, pew, PEW, BOOM, BOOM, sand, boom, pew. (Apologies for spoiling the surprise.)The acting: who's that again? What's the point of what they're doing now? Why are we supposed to care?The CGI: boom, boom, splatter, sandstorm, splatter, boom, growl, boom.Also, I have to mention that the 'motorcycles' and 'stunts' done on said motorcycles p'ed my biker husband off royally. Don't waste your time. This film is about as Mad Max as Jake Gyllenhaal was Prince of Persia. All budget, no actual substance of ANY sort - not even entertainment value, really.",1,14,29,30 November 2015
