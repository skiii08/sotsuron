The Ring," This Ghost needs Psychiatric Care.
","There is one common problem with Japanese horror films: the ghosts kill for no reason! This happens also in the Ju On(The Grudge) also. I mean, even Satan kills for a reason and not merely for pleasure, assuming Satan governs the underworld and set the code of conduct there. So this ghost must be very psychotic even in ghost's standard.But the funny part is that they want to do it the hard way. I can't understand why a ghost powerful as Samara has chosen to go through such trouble as making the video tape, promulgating it, giving the victims a ring, screwing up their photos, and squeezing through the small TV set to order to creep them to death. We have to be given a good reason to accept all these crap! And what's the rationale for being able to escape Samara's attack by copying the tape to someone else? Totally absurd! With all these unanswered, the rest of the film becomes meaningless and irrational. As Ju On 2 did not provide these answers to Ju On 1, I doubted whether The Ring 2 will do the opposite.Is this the culture with Japanese viewers: enjoy to be scared but don't care to know why??",5,3,7,28 August 2006
Spider-Man 2," Jerk or Hero?
","This film depicts how a jerk became a hero after his accidental bite by a strange spider.Yet he is still a jerk after-all, whenever he is not in his spider uniform.Instead of devoting his precious time in doing good to the world, this jerk chooses to deliver pizzas!And he is a total loser everywhere,not being able to get a decent living , or to support his aunt, or even to get a crump of cake from a party. It's difficult for the viewers to find these amusing!If you can manage to tolerate the first 20 minutes of the film, you will be able to meet the real villain, nothing more but a machine-possessed professor moving around clumsily with his heavy octopus claws, rather comical and not at all scaring. Not even the police has bothered to hunt him down, as if they knew even the jerk could do the job anyway.Surely, people can still try to defend Peter, admiring his love towards Mary Jane which had explained his under-performance in life . Afterall, 'love' had been so wrongly depicted and over-valued in so many films before.But the truth in life is: being able to do good to the world is much more important than the love between any couple, although the two are not actually totally exclusive of one another, as the jerk has finally discovered at the end of the film.",3,3,6,12 March 2006
Troy," Can I suggest a better ending?
","Despite the greatness and entertaining of the film, it leaves me with a very uncomfortable feeling-- the underlying notion of injustice that this film projects!Two very well looking couple felt for each other, they call it 'love'. It could override everything, things like care for fellow countrymen, devotion to own nation, love for own family members, etc.These can all be sacrificed because of 'love'. Thus the great couple finally made it and everyone else died, and in number of many thousands. They are noble men of highest integrity like Hector and Achilles, while the cowardice Paris got the pretty woman at the end , when they would continue their love affair for God knows how long( Paris had been fooling around before he met Helen, according to Hector)!This leaves me feel uneasy.In our own country China, in the old days such a couple would have been condemned to be drowned within a pig's cage for adultery.I guess the biggest breakthrough on this film is --- the bad guys do not necessarily die at the end, it's sometimes the good guys who did the dying, to the extent that the hero was killed by the coward.Question is : do people like this sort of ending?A better ending would be: Briseis blocked the arrow shot by Paris and saved Achilles' life. Before death, she begged Achilles to spare Paris. He did, and Paris fled to find Helen killed by angry Troyeans, blaming her for Troy's destruction. Both Achilles and Paris left with heart broken, deeply grieved with the hatred of wars.",7,6,12,3 January 2006
Collateral," The Top 10 'Don'ts' for a Professional Hit-man
","Among all its ridiculousness in this movie, the most unforgivable one is that the professional killer has chosen to involve a common cab driver in his job.Professional killers did their job alone, make as little noise as possible, and expose themselves to as least people as possibly can. Cruise must have gone insane to have chosen to do it the hard way, and in no circumstances be able to exercise any professionalism of a experienced hit-man.Because of this unprofessional-ism, he practically screwed up every kill he had attempted, ending up with a fallen body down the street, a massacre in a nightclub, an overturned vehicle, a missed laptop containing information of his intended victims, gambling his luck on a cab driver to convince the gang he's Vincent, be a protagonist in the hospital's CCTV...... The film should rightfully be named ' The top 10 'Don'ts' for a professional hit-man.' No wonder Crusie got killed eventually even by a common cab driver and a frightened attorney.They could have done the job better than Cruise!Unbelievable!",4,9,14,30 January 2007
Groundhog Day," Nearly Perfect!
","I have seen this movie at least 4 times from the TV replays and it has given me greater pleasure every time.During the repetitive viewings, I can really chew on it slowly and appreciate every details that the film transpires. The script, the acting, the directing, and even the music are all excellent. I cannot understand why there had been such little attention from audience to this movie and even the number of comments made are small in the IMDb.It is among my top 5 best loving movies I've ever seen and it really deserves an Oscar though it is regrettable that comedies are rarely considered for the award.It deserves a rating of 9.999 and so I gave it 10, just to round up. Afterall, no movie should be considered completely perfect, but it's nearly there!",10,7,11,4 July 2006
Signs," Attack by an alien? Try pissing....
","I have seen this film recently 6 years after it had been released. As the rating had been high all along I was kind of greatly disappointed at its plot, particularly at the twist that aliens can't stand water.Actually I have previously seen 'Scary Movie 3' which had exposed some of its plot lines but believe me, 'Signs' is funnier! How else can you imagine that when you are attacked by an alien, pissing at it can save your soul! It's equivalent to its release of poisonous gas at you.This is not to mention the stupid scene when the clergyman was on his way home, and was advised by the police woman to have a last word with the upper half of his wife while her lower half was dead.If flaws like these could be taken care of, this can turn out to be a much better movie.",3,6,11,13 October 2008
The Island," Could Have Been Better.
","It could have been a much better film than this.The plot was originally good, but unfortunately the story ended when Lincoln and Jordan found out from McCord about the secret of the utopia. This was just about the middle of the film, the rest of which is just left with some routine Bond story lines. Viewers' interest in the story has completely gone from this point onwards.The interesting part of the story should have been withheld until the end. More depiction can be made of how Lincoln and Jordan have probed around the real world in search of their counterparts which could be both dramatic and entertaining.The film is now good for the first 45 minutes and trash for the rest.HOW SAD!",4,2,5,8 October 2006
