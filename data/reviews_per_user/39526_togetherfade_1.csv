Black Swan," Favorite movie of all time.
","Remarkable psychological thriller with great, exquisite Natalie Portman. Very smart, sensitive film about sacrifice work to ballet. Perfect soundtrack, creepy atmosphere, and sexy Mila Kunis. Subtly but continuously, he builds tension. Turns the inner world of the character, making it a reality. And that of uncomfortable, because the character - not the average person with such average needs. She is talented and fanatical desire to unleash her talents. For me, the film is about how far a person can go in pursuit of desired. As far as deep inside it can look. It's pretty scary - to find themselves in the darkest, sanctuary, carefully hidden. Moreover - pull it out, give himself up this dark side.",10,1,3,27 March 2014
