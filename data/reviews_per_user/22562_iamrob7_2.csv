Angels & Demons," Parachuting Priests....er....
","I quite enjoyed the Da Vinci Code so I should preface this by saying I thought this was most definitely inferior to its predecessor.Ultimately it was a decent thriller, blighted by a few fairly major problems.Firstly the opening 30mins of the film involved far too much chasing round involving mutterings about various symbols. There was a lot of muttering about symbols and uninteresting historical figures. I love History myself but I found this all very uninvolving. Too much focus on a car skidding round with dramatic music and not enough focus on actual context.The film did begin to pick up as time went along, although not by much. Unfortunately I had guessed from the beginning that Ewan Ms character was going to turn out to be the bad guy. It was something about the way he was being acted and a few key things he said. The scene when the guards run in and shoot his would be attackers was fairly implausible and the moment Ewan said 'he is the one' just before the guy got shot kind of confirmed my suspicion that he was indeed the bad guy.But wait...what is this....they find the bomb and then Ewans character grabs the bomb jumps in a helicopter and then parachutes out of it leaving the bomb to explode 10000feet up in the sky. Ey? I was thinking, maybe I'm wrong, maybe he isn't the bad guy...I mean what kind of insane bad guy sets up a plot whereby he has to fly a helicopter into the sky with a bomb on board and parachute out with about 10seconds to go. That would be quite a risk for a bad guy to take, presumably he must have organised the chopper and the parachute...So I am thinking this movie is terrible if these are genuine heroics...a priest parachuting out of a chopper after flying it into the sky...seriously...it was just a little hard to swallow.However it quickly became clear thanks to a recording of the Papal offices that he was indeed the bad guy and just previous to the chopper flying he had branded himself with a red hot metal branding stick and faked the whole assault from the perceived bad guy.So...he was the bad guy behind it all and that helicopter thing was an elaborate plot he had setup to secure his place as the pope afterwards. BIT OF A GAMBLE...you might say...I mean not only the whole plot which was absurd in the first place with the bomb and the chopper etc etc...gambling that the two people who could have revealed his plot would be shot dead when they were discovered near him when he was branded...but to gamble that the conclave would then elect him pope for the whole chopper thing...I mean that is quite a plan...ambitious doesn't really say it does it...Anyhow there are many other implausible aspects to this movie which I won't complain about, It is not that I have a problem with implausibility in film...it is just that this film stretched it to the absolute limit...a lot of things made very little sense at all and the film was quite uninvolving for large periods.My advice is in future they slow the whole thing down, stop with the cars driving fast and the music and the largely uninteresting mutterings, give us some real depth of history and make the story at least mildly plausible.Note to the director - If you find yourself making a movie where a priest who is currently the acting head of the Catholic church parachutes from a Helicopter which has an antimatter bomb in it...just stop...stop what you are doing and rethink the whole thing...you have gone wrong somewhere...",4,2,4,18 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Why Danny Elfman...oh why...why oh why....why...oh god why...
","I'll try to keep this short and sweet.The performances of all the actors involved ranged from adequate to good, I did not find any problem whatsoever with Bales performance of Connor, in fact he was one of the better performers in the film.The plot for me was absolutely fine and could have worked out excellently had there not been some key issues...Firstly...McG...he didn't do a horrible job, the majority of the film was shot well, although I took issue with certain aspects of it and certain changes and ideas he brought to the franchise. Still those things could be forgiven. Why the small child with Kyle Reece though? I mean why? it was a pointless addition and distraction that added absolutely nothing to the film and took away something from the grittiness of it all. The child was one of several small things like that I believe he made an error with. I don't want to list them all.Here was the MAJOR problem I had with this movie...DANNY ELFMAN and the WORST SCORE I have ever heard for a movie such as this. It sounded like I was watching Independence day not a terminator movie. Every nuance of sound that came from this score took away from the performance, took away from the plot, took away from the atmosphere in general...any sense of atmosphere or emotion or anything at all was 'terminated' as soon as Danny Elfman parped in with his nonsense.It has to go down as one of the worst decisions in movie making history to employ this man to do the score...what the hell was wrong with the scores used by Cameron in the previous terminator movies? they were perfect, they had a darker more sinister feel.I am 90% certain that had the score been the T2 score or something similar most of the people who disliked this movie would like it much more. The score dragged the whole movie down and made everything seem worse.Seriously I cannot understand how professional movie making people could seriously think this score was in any way appropriate to this franchise.Please god McG release a DVD version with a completely different score. Otherwise I will hold you personally responsible for the travesty you have unleashed on us.I give this movie an 8/10 purely because I believe the basics of it are there, the actors are there, the plot is there...however if I fully consider the score as well I would give this movie 0/10. It really is that bad.",5,5,8,6 June 2009
