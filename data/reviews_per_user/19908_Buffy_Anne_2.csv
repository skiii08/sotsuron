Requiem for a Dream," the most beautiful movie ever made
","this is not a movie about drug addiction.  this is a movie about addiction to hope.  every character in this film had high hopes about where their life would lead.  sarah goldfarb wanted desperately to be on television.  and she became obsessed with it.  this movie is about expectations being shattered and thrown to the ground.  everything starts out so lovely and beautiful with people in love and old women losing weight but soon all of their lives come spiraling down around them.  nothing works out, everyone gets messed up and they all end up in worse states than when they started.  if you see this movie, please do so with an open mind.  do not disregard because it actually makes you feel real human emotions.  embrace it and tell all your friends to see it.  it should be required veiwing for every person.",Null,0,0,19 July 2002
The Doors," an incredibly pointless movie
",i don't have much to say about this awful movie except this: why was it called the doors when the whole movie was about Jim Morrison's sex life? and meg ryan? what the hell?  this movie was so bad and so pointless and taught us absolutely nothing about the doors.  like every other book or tv special or biography all it focused on was jim morrison and that is so not what the doors were.,Null,2,4,11 December 2000
