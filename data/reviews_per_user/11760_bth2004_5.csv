3:10 to Yuma," Wonderful!
","Finally, there is a modern day Western and it's good! 3:10 to Yuma is one of the best movies I have seen in a while.First off, the acting is simply superb. Great cast--Russell Crowe (in his second Western) is marvelous as the villain; Christian Bale is fantastic: if his career ever starts to tank, I'll call down curses from heaven; the other supporting actors who's names I can't remember except for Luke Wilson and I think Peter Fonda, all were top notch.Second, the action was fantastic. There was a lot of space between action sequences and Bale only is involved in one firefight, but everything was well done, exciting, ACCURATE (as in nobody shot forty bullets from the same gun without reloading), and none of it was mindless gunfighting for the sake of gunfighting (true, that kind of thing can be quite entertaining in a Western, but if there's a purpose for it then it's so much better).Also, the storyline was exceptionally deep for a Western. There is great character interaction and development driving the story along, something you don't get in your typical Western. Impressive.Trust me, YOU WANT to see this movie. The only reason why I don't give it a ten is something that I don't want to spoil for you. See this movie!",9,1,2,8 October 2007
Citizen Kane," A man to be severely pitied
","I have to sympathize with the people who hail this film as one of the ones worth remembering. Although the story is slow (quite slow at times), it is so profound. The underlying meaning of 'Rosebud' is one that truly will jerk the heartstrings and make the viewer feel a large amount of pity for Charles Kane. Makes one wonder just how much like Kane William Hearst was. Welles' performance was magnificent, absolutely deserving of an Oscar. Those who dislike the film are at least somewhat justified in their reasoning. However, someone with a real appreciation for a deep storyline is going to have at least some measure of praise for this movie. Approach this with the willingness to not be merely entertained.",7,0,1,15 October 2005
Radio," Phenomenal
","This is one of the best films I have ever seen! How anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination! First of all, Gooding's and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. That is the only way I can describe the acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off; then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, since it was based on a true person, it goes where the lives of the characters go. For all the action buffs, it might be a little slow, but then it's not an action film. I definitely give this movie a 10. It deserves nothing less!",10,24,31,25 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," What the first two should have been
","Finally, Lucas gets his act back together and puts out a film that truly does justice to the Star Wars franchise. Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were far cries from what they should have been--this is what they should have been all along.For starters, the acting is exponentially better. Something is still wrong with Portman and Christensen--their performances still lack vigor, at least at times. Still, they're far better than they were. McGregor is fabulous as Kenobi. Actually, he never really had a problem in this series, thankfully. Acting-wise, McGregor and McDiarmand steal the show--McDiarmand rocks as Palpatine.And finally--real Jedi/Sith combat! This is how masters of the Force are supposed to fight! No huge, slow, spinning cuts, no slow moves at all--fast, hard-hitting light sabers blurring in a frenzy of laser-blade sweetness! Combined with use of the Force to hurl everything from rocks to platforms to each other, we finally get to see what Jedi dueling is all about! YAY!! And lastly, the story is outstanding. Anakin's relationships with Padme, Palpatine, Kenobi, and the other Jedi masters; Palpatine's behind-the-scene work to undermine the Republic and the Jedi; the progression of the Clone War as a backdrop to the film; love, hate betrayal, loss, power-plays--every great plot device that you can think of is in this movie in good order and progression throughout the story.The only reason I don't give this movie a 10 is because of the still lackluster performances by Christensen and Portman. Since their characters are two of the central figures in the story, theirs should have been the best in the whole thing. Other than that, everything about this movie is spectacular. A must-see for pretty much anyone with any taste in film.",8,0,1,27 August 2006
Centurion," Very pleasantly surprised
","Let me start off by saying that the last period piece I saw before this movie (both of them on movie channels) was 'Valhalla Rising' and I was nearly sickened by the experience. So I was a little apprehensive going into 'Centurion'. Thankfully, it gave me a very enjoyable watch.Plot, I have to say, was not the most original thing; it wasn't that weak, either. After two very bad defeats at the hands of the Picts, a Roman officer and his small band of survivors have to survive in the wilderness of Britain as they evade a band of Pict trackers--on orders from their king to avenge the death of his son at Roman hands. The Picts hound the Romans over much of the isle of Britain, it seems, and are never far away, always finding them again and again, each time taking more Roman lives. The Roman party are sheltered by a local woman--an outcast from Pict culture, therefore leaving her with little loyalty to anybody; their mutual kindness and understanding of each other's situations makes room for some feelings to develop--no sex or anything, sorry boys. After a final confrontation with the Picts, the last 3 arrive at a new garrison the legion has established--the beginning stages of Hadrian's wall. One of the men is killed by garrison guards who thought he was a Pict; the other is killed in a fight with the centurion because it was he who killed the Pict king's son. After the centurion gives his report, he has to evade his own people who try to kill him in order to save face. So, being wounded, he returns to the British woman who gave him shelter earlier.Acting was really good the whole way through. The film doesn't allow for a whole lot of character development, but all of the characters are believable and well portrayed. Most surprising is the Pict lead tracker: a mute woman with a spear and a heart like a flaming tar pit. It has been a while since a woman was so scary on screen--and we thank her for it! Effects were well done, but not overdone. Some of the blood was done with CGI--mainly in the battle scenes, not so much with the small group fights; when they do physical blood effects, it gets pretty gory in a couple of places. Gorgeous cinematography and landscaping--you really feel sorry for the Romans traipsing about Britain in winter without furs to wear! All in all, a very good watch. I highly recommend it for anybody who is a fan of action and period pieces. It likely is historically inaccurate on a number of points, but that's OK; if you're a stickler, feel free to take notes. But definitely a good piece of work. Watch and enjoy!",7,2,5,23 December 2011
