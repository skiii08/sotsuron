Raiders of the Lost Ark," classic
","i just recently saw this movie, and despite not having the best of special effects, it's 1 of the best action adventure movies i've seen. it was funny, smart and witty. and even though the film is long, you'll get wrapped up on the different action sequences in the movie. although i did think that Harrison ford was a bit thin for the part. but all in all it was really good.Indiana plays a boring professor but an exciting adventurer outside the classroom. he seeks treasures and sends it to museums where he thinks these artifacts belong. in this adventure he's after the lost ark, which holds a great power to destroy. The Nazis are there to get this power. and instead of gaining the power, they are destroyed by it.Indiana the great man that he is, of course isn't destroyed, since he does not covet the power. Indiana in this movie is like superman. he does everything well and good and on top of that he's charming and smart. he's like the rugged James bond. he loves girls but he would never let anyone really come close to him.i just have one complaint though. Indy is always the one who leads the bad guys to the thing that they are after. if he just sit tight, the enemies would never find the power. oh well if that happened then there wouldn't be any movie right.",9,0,1,3 January 2005
Spider-Man 2," better development of characters *spoilers*
","i saw this movie and was surprised to find that it concentrated more on letting the audience get to know peter and may jane in this movie. This time mj doesn't just keep screaming, we actually see how conflicted her character is. What surprised me most is the revealing of spiderman as peter, i would have expected it to be on latter movies. overall though this movie is entertaining although less action than one would expect from a spiderman movie. this is already the second movie but i'm still not sure of the casting of peter, mh and harry. tobey seems too nerdish as peter. and harry seems too cool and handsome to be the more nerdish friend of peter. and mj here i'd glad to see finally uses 'tiger' to call peter, but kirsten is not that hot and more fun than she should be. but it'll do",Null,0,0,8 July 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," useless movie *spoilers*
","this is a useless movie. the plot was lame, there was really no story behind it. it fails to inspire someone to actually care on what is going on in the environment. one of the reasons might be that the script is half baked. it doesn't concentrate on one single aspect. it tries to show too many sides, the effects, father-son relationship, global warming, politics. you really have to ask: what is this film doing? there's really no build up to the disaster that is going to happen. It just happened. And really how can that many people survive in the end? it seems impossible especially when they were building it up as this huge tidal wave of a disaster. for me it's a shame because the idea is good, the actors are all good, but the execution... one thing that bothers me too is the mom, doesn't she care for her son? it seems she doesn't even care or worry about him. it's lame. after the movie, you'll think: what a waste of time.",5,0,1,31 July 2004
The Bourne Identity," great smart movie *spoilers*
","i was really surprised by how good and smart this movie. it's been a long time that i've seen a movie that actually had a good plot.first of all i love matt and franka in this. they both seem so anti-action heroish. meaning that they are not your typical action figures. yet that is the reason that they both come off as actual people with vulnerabilities which both make them so enduring. this movie explores the underground dealings and killings of politics. bourne is the one who actually does the assassins. however it catches up with him psychologically and he then has amnesia. emotionally he is so confused, yet that survival instinct and skill still remains with him. he is obviously very smart and is made to be this assassin. because he is very good. in fact as was revealed he initiated the assassination for treadstone.then comes marie. who is this confident woman who is confident and an equal to jason. it was so great that she was the one who initiated sex to jason. in fact she's the comic relief in this movie. which makes you kind of actually breath. because this movie is intense. the chemistry between both of them and the story. this movie is pretty much perfect.",10,1,2,19 November 2004
Man of Steel," Good Movie But.....
","First I would like to say that I did like this movie. As a movie it is far better than Superman Returns.HOWEVER for portraying Superman I much prefer Superman Returns as it is more accurate in its representation of who Superman is. What Superman represents and his spirit. He is not a dark character. He represents hope to everyone who sees him. I felt that in Superman Returns. In Man of Steel, Nolan made Superman a bit darker (10-15% Batman) so you never actually feel hope when you see Superman anytime on screen. You know what I mean chan chadaaaaaaan its Superman! you never feel that.SECOND, it reminded me of Startrek where a world has been destroyed and the person from that world is out to get revenge or whatever. Is there no other plot that can be made? It's a good plot but its already been done in the movies. If this came before Star Trek I will have no complaints on the story.",7,1,3,25 June 2013
Spirited Away," one of the great movies
","What can you say about this movie? It's one of the great movies. It's about discovery, love and adventure. What more can you really ask for? The movie really is simple yet is so inspiring and touches you to the core.Sen here used to be a self-absorbed girl yet this world that she finds herself in opens her eyes to so many things and finally giving her the strength to fight for what she wants and freeing her parents. She also finally does things for others. What an inspiring story. Good, really good. This is what a movie should be. it should inspire and touch people with the sincerity of the story. most movies now want to manipulate people's feelings but this one doesn't.",10,2,3,22 August 2004
The Incredibles," good enough *spoilers*
",the latest from Disney and pixar is good enough. but i was expecting more especially after producing great movies such as finding nemo and monsters inc. it was a little disappointing. it still had the comedic touch here and there. the story is interesting enough. with the father wanting to reclaim his old glory. he goes back to being a super hero blinded by his ambition that his family needs him and the bad guy is out to get him. finally he is caught and his family tries to save him. a great big family reunion with each one having realized their worth and the importance of their family.good enough story. however this movie fails to keep up the excitement. fight scenes are few and far apart. the bad guy here in the movie is not given his proper due. he was only there for about 20% of the movie. the scenes mostly gives scene after scene of how miserable mr. incredible's life was before and how he worked out to be this new man again. this is not an action movie but of self-discovery. but in the end mr. incredible just realized he has a good family and he still wants to be a hero. this is a good movie. pretty interesting and lovable characters. it was just not as good as the previous Disney pixar movies. but it is better than the shrek movies.,9,0,1,13 November 2004
Hero," technically good *spoilers*
","i just saw this movie after 2 yrs of its release. the reason was that i was afraid to be disappointed. the Chinese people i knew thought it was so so. while those that were not thought it was great. i saw this movie and i was surprised and yes disappointed. Surprised because as Jet Li said this was not a typical Chinese movie. the good guy (Jet Li) sacrificed himself for the greater good that chin shi huang ti should live. all the leads in this movie died. And most of the time in Chinese movies the emperor is the bad guy but this time, he's not. he is the savior, the one who will unite china and finally bring peace and end the war.it was technically and maybe it's robotically good. i mean that it was perfect, the story, the execution of the plot ... it was all done well. no mistakes. it was quite imaginative in fact. with the different story versions and the colors used in each version. those colors could be analyzed endlessly in a paper.yet what was disappointing about it was that in Chinese movies that i've seen especially that of Jet Li and the once upon a time series, there was always a heart in the story. something that connected you to the story and the character itself. the character was always the main point ... i think. the main character always connects the audience to him. and as the audience we share in his story and his development and goals. this movie lacked that heart. that connection with the characters. although the actress who played flying was very good in acting out her character, she had very little role and the audience can't really connect to her steadily throughout the movie. in summary technically perfect but ... lacks heart.",Null,1,2,31 October 2004
The Departed," Ripoff of a classic Chinese movie
","**SPOILERS** I can't believe this movie won the best picture category and martin won as the director when he just copied the original infernal affairs. And an inferior remake at that. All the scenes are the same except for some of the over violent parts like when Mark Wahlberg kills Matt. When I watched Infernal Affairs, it was violent, real and really had heart. It's message was it was better to live your life righteously rather than live a long unrighteous life that was why Andy Lau (Matt in the Chinese version) lives. This was actually the only difference in the movie. Everything was the same! Even when the 2 criminals are discussing how they know who are the cops. This film winning the 2 categories means that American cinema has lost its creativity and needs to resort to copying the exact same movie except making it inferior.",4,1,4,4 March 2007
Vanilla Sky," great story *spoilers*
","this film was very good. i hope i could see the original. the story was absolutely solid, there were no wholes in it. everything was explained. What i really liked about it is cruise was a man who was unable to face reality because of the consequence of his actions. he tries to blame everyone for his troubles. Even when he gets the perfect dream life, his fears and guilty subconscious gets to him and disturbs his life. it really is all on his mind.   i love the last scene. it was very powerful. he finally knows what he wants. he know the consequences of his actions and is able to choose wisely. to finally face the unknown where it won't be easy anymore because he's 100 years into the future, but that's reality and finally he can face it again. a second chance to do it right.   this film was very real. the only problem might be that in some scenes it was kind of awkward and boring. but all in all one of the most real and powerful movies.",9,0,1,22 August 2004
The Croods," Good Dreamworks Movie
","This was a fun movie to watch where you will not get bored from beginning until the end. It reminded me a lot of Land Before Time movie but less sophisticated. The voice actors are perfect especially Nicholas Cage, his talents are really underutilized. He captured the character's internal struggle to evolve and change with the times. It's really great that not only did he in the end embrace change but also experimented with creating new things and not just depend on Guy to do everything. I think it was a great reminder to us that we have forgotten how to be curious and be amazed about how new things come to us. Instead we keep expecting more and get disappointed when Apple does deliver new techs as we expect them to. :) Finally a great Dreamworks film with the exception of How to Train your Dragon, and no wonder the creators of Croods and How to Train are the same! hahahaa",8,0,0,5 April 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," great end
","SPOILERSi just saw this movie today and i had mixed feelings because i really wanted to see the conclusion yet i was sad that it was finally ending. even though i sat at the front row it was still worth it. it had the right mix of everything comedy and drama. and by the way how come none of the cast is even nominated for a golden globe? they deserve it. sam (sean)was really a standout in this 3rd installment, not that viggo or elijah's wasn't, but sean astin's performance was great in that his portrayal of the character was so relatable. this movie is the only one i can think of that did not disappoint me. its everything i expected and more. No need to elaborate on the visual magnificence of rotk or the great battles of all time.first all what i liked about this is the climax really when frodo went to mt. doom and he didn't let go of the ring. i was really shocked that he didn't throw it, because what did it mean? when someone like frodo, a hobbit with no wish of power to begin with is corrupted by power, what will happen if it was a man who was put into that task. did it mean evil was always triumphant? what was so great about this was that frodo redeemed himself, when the ring fell into the lava, he hang on. he had a CHOICE to follow the ring like gollum did or live and reach out to sam. and he did. the message was so subtle and yet so significant. furthermore peter jackson made this film so real because of the range of human/elf/whatever emotions and relationships that was forged in this film. there was real depth in the characters. as well as the dynamic change of the character of frodo. i was sad to see that frodo couldn't go back to the way he was. even after a long time had passed. yet that was a reality. when something happens or when you see things differently, you can't go back and be with people who don't understand that light/darkness/truth you saw.just a great great end to a trilogy",10,1,2,9 January 2004
