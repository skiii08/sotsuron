The Lobster," Tedious
","It's original, I'll give it that. Unfortunately I want more out of a movie than that. John C. Reilly is pretty much totally wasted in this and the movie is really weird just for the sake of being really weird. I hate leaving a theater feeling like my time was deliberately wasted like this.",2,4,7,26 July 2018
28 Days Later...," Very Good, Not A Zombie Film
","This is a good movie but it is not a 'zombie movie' which is how my friends described it to me, I guess knowing that I am a zombie horror movie genre nut. The movie starts when environmental terrorists break into a lab that contains diseased monkeys who have been exposed to a so called 'rage virus'. When they break the monkeys out the monkeys attack them and when one of them escapes the virus is on the loose and it's only a matter of time before it engulfs England and then the rest of the world presumably. Cillian Murphy is great as the film's hero who wakes up in a hospital (seeing this made me realize either it copied the Walking Dead comics (haven't read it so don't know for sure) or Walking Dead the TV show took the idea from 28 Days Later. It's great though and the director does a fantastic job building tension.I don't want to give away too much but it's a very engrossing movie and I think fans of any kind of 'scary' or psychological movie will enjoy it a lot. The ending also is very awesome and you're not sure what will happen or what choice the woman will make until she does it.... won't say more than that because I don't want to spoil it but you'll know what I mean at the end. Great ending, very good movie!",8,0,1,26 January 2014
