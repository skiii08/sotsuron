The Ring," horror of a film
",'The Ring' is a horror of a film.  Apparently a compilation of someone's nightmares with no effort to make the thing understandable. Have not seen Japanese original - hopefully it was a lot better than this waste of time.  GRADE = 'D',1,0,2,19 October 2002
Underworld," best thing - Kate Beckinsale
","'Underworld' tells the tale of a current day war in dreary Europe between the vampires and the werewolves, dating back centuries.  If you want a long overload of music, violence, guns, bullets, repetition, catatonic acting, and special effects, go for it.  The best thing about this film is its star, Kate Beckinsale in a tight black vinyl (scuba-like) outfit, moodily stomping around with her guns blasting.GRADE = 'C'",4,0,1,16 September 2003
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," old fashioned Hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity
","'Capt. Corelli's Mandolin' is an old fashioned Hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity, and supposedly no Americans.  The story takes place on a Greek island during WW2.  The Italians arrive to take over the island, but with German supervision.  There is a romantic triangle made up of a Greek couple and the Italian captain.  Nice performances by all the actors; Penelope Cruz's best work yet.",8,1,3,22 July 2001
The Day After Tomorrow," leave your brain at the door
","'The Day After Tomorrow' is an old-fashioned disaster flick with today's special effects and tells the tale of weather disasters caused by man.  Dennis Quaid does the best he can with a not-very-well written role. Don't expect any 'rocket science', Academy Award acting, or innovative plotting.  So, find a 'big' screen, leave your brain at the door, and enjoy this 2-hour summer adventure. For the Washington area crowd, there is local scenery and extra humor.GRADE = 'B'",7,0,0,28 May 2004
The Bourne Identity," like a zombie
",'Bourne Identity' is a film about zombie-like hit-men and you'll be feeling like a zombie before its 2 hours are over. You really don't care about any of the characters and you've seen it all before -- especially if you've seen the trailers (which contain most of the best scenes). GRADE = C+,6,0,1,15 June 2002
Radio," A 'C' from me
","'Radio' is based on an actual ongoing friendship in So. Carolina between a white football coach and a mentally disabled black man.  The story is good, but the movie is loud, sappy, and overdone.  It is good to see Debra Winger again, but not in the role of the homey coach's wife.  Cuba Gooding is better in this than in 'Fighting Temptations' or 'Boat Trip', but that is faint praise.GRADE = 'C'",4,0,0,23 October 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Camille - MTV style
","'Moulin Rouge' is the musical version of the Greta Garbo classic 'Camille' but MTV style.  This is a fast moving 2-hour film that uses modern music for a story set in 1900 Paris; some of the choices will make you laugh.  If you liked the musical numbers from 'Cabaret', you will enjoy this movie.  Don't expect a remake of the original film.",8,0,0,30 May 2001
The Last Samurai," the new Marion Morrison
","'The Last Samurai' is an epic 'eastern' with lots of blood, violence, and Mr. T.C. Mapother IV (Tom Cruise) trying to be the new Marion Morrison (John Wayne).  Overlong, overdone in parts, and predictable. The photography is excellent and certainly deserves an Oscar nomination.GRADE = 'B'",7,0,0,5 December 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Involving war melodrama
",'Enemy at the Gates' is an involving war melodrama which takes place in Russia during World War 2. There is an old-fashioned romance tacked on but it is very modern with a non-nude long simulated sex scene.  There is very graphic war violence. Photography and special effects are excellent. Acting is good but some of the actors normal accents are jarring.  GRADE is 'B'.,7,0,0,13 March 2001
