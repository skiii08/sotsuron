Sucker Punch," Just as you thought, you are unprepared- a film about the awesomeness of what is Action.
","I attended the midnight showing of the film last night and here are my two cents:Let's start out with the fact that I really enjoyed the movie. It was no forest gump, but looking at the Director's history, no one should be expecting that anyway. Having previously directed Dawn of the Dead, 300, and Watchmen, this one fits in pretty well in the mix. The style is more Watchmen-esque than 300, but man may there be violence, and much appreciated! Oh, and the costumes are just what the demographic ordered. Though from the previews I may have been predisposed to expect a more straightforward storyline, kicking and fighting it's way to a climactic finish (possibly a little twist thrown in there); I was happily dazed enough to enjoy myself. As I write this I am still trying to piece together the understory and back goings of the film. When I initially left the theater, though stunned in a sense of sheer awe, I was quite sure that I 'got' the whole idea: Pretty straightforward, classic Indie-esque Hollywood action film. Wrong. But as I lay in bed earlier this morning trying to gather my thoughts after waking up from a Sucker Punch of a dream, I realized that I had missed something: The morality of the film. It was deep, and the more I think about it the more I realize it. This film had more guts than I realize. It wasn't only great slo-mo, poster/wallpaper-worthy brilliance (Though that it was). It had real soul. In fact I'm toying with the idea of a second watch, sort of how you rematch the Matrix Reloaded just for that epic car chase scene; but hopefully here to also flesh out some of the ideals behind the whole thing. It was an epic struggle between hot chicks and bad guys, and worth the dollar for the big screen. And to boot, the film is on its way to passing my test: 'Occupies my thoughts for the next couple days'. And therefore I give it a burn-out and beat the Mustang-driving-teenager-in-the-lane next-to-you green light. If you liked Mr. Synder's (the Director) past films, you like action, or you like girls, or you're just a man; this is a good one. Go see it some night after your boss makes you sit through a two-hour meeting on Synergy. ...Then go home and change your wife's wardrobe for her. A",9,172,345,25 March 2011
Kick-Ass," Other films should call themselves 'Ass-Kick'
","A somewhat unlikely mating of Juno, Kill Bill, and Fight Club culminate in the ugly duckling brother of Watchmen. The rather cute and bloody sibling does not disappoint; and it's not what one would expect from trailers and previous movies about superheroes. The movie delivers an action-packed thrill ride, while breaking the mold of tried and true action films of past. Kick-Ass gets an 'R' rating, and though some scenes seem to pull off an almost Disney- esquire, feel-good vibe, it's not one for the kiddies. But if you can get a baby sitter and silence your prude inner-self, there's one hell of a smart and witty showing, within this fun, if slightly overcast, film.It begins with the typically troubled geeky-boy character (Aaron Johnson) finding himself as a superhero, Kick-Ass. In his new line of work he soon meets Big Daddy and Hit-Girl: two 'real deal' superheroes very capable and very lethal in what they do. He is drawn into taking down a New York City Mob-Boss (Mark Strong of Stardust), and struggles to simultaneously fight crime and keep his normal life in order. On the way, he also meets Red Mist (McLovin of Superbad), another superhero who is similarly struggling within his own life. Through the vertigo of his new life, Kick-Ass soon realizes that he's gotten himself deeper into the crime-fighting business than he ever wanted to be, and in life or death circumstances is forced to decide whether he wants to be a normal guy the rest of his life, or become a hero.Director Mathew Vaughn layers sadness, humor, and slightly startling violence within a story of growing up and taking down bad guys. Based on the comic book by Mark Miller, the movie carries over some fascinating cinematography, and exciting ideas. Kick-Ass, for example, is very in-your-face and brutally physical, and his scenes show it. The lovable Hit-Girl swears like a sailor and kills like 300's Leonidas; and as kick-ass as she is, she just isn't the cute little girl you somehow want her to be. And Big Daddy, while his SWAT-like movement and Kung-Fu fighting skills are awe-inspiring, his loving nature still brings a tear to your eye. All of the components of a typical action movie are present, but with all new characters and ideas blended together in a fresh fun take on the classic in this yummy-licious cut-throat-mocha frappe-jolly eccentric-cino. Kick-Ass leaves a nostalgic, almost melancholy taste in your mouth, and a longing for the earlier days when time was spent entertaining the idea of becoming a real-life superhero. It's got fantastic style, showered across fun characters and an engaging story line. This is the joy ride of the year, careening past inhibitions and breaking through limits; smiles all around. Though a parody of sorts of the very genre it assimilates to, Kick-Ass is a surprisingly good addition to the current superhero movie lineup. If only to compare to other superhero movies out there (Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man) and to the comic book days of old, it's worth a viewing just to discuss with the mates. Though not an instant classic, Kick-Ass looks like an abstract art gallery, sounds like a late-night comedy show, and kills like a video-game. A",9,1,9,4 May 2010
Green Street Hooligans," Great Film
","Green Street is one of these films that is just good. The fight scenes are great, very raw and straight to it. The acting is surprisingly good, and the cinematography is actually quite good as well. As some others have said, you need to like fight films or you're probably not going to like this one. Think Fight Club and Boondock Saints. Some bloody stuff here and there but it ain't too bad mate, just be ready for it. Enjoyable movie start to finish, with a good performance by Wood. It was quite cool to get a glimpse of football life in the UK. The locations were good, with the pubs nice. Some nice twists in the movie, but not too much just stupid stuff. My recommendation: It's a definite see, even if just to say you have.",10,0,0,16 January 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Looks and feels like childhood again, but too much extra...
","Alice brings a sense of Nostalgia to the viewer as they see their childhood favourite character at an older age. I will start by saying that the film looks very good. The characrters are well done and flow well; the cat in particular, well he really is quite good. The backdrops are fun and the characters are well integrated between real and CGI(except for the tea party scene- the windmill looks like a stage backdrop rather than a movie). If nothing else, it is pretty. Not Avatar pretty, but still very good. Now onto the story. I am afraid, it needed some work. I quite enjoyed most of the scenes and liked how the story was aranged. The 'real-world' scenes were quite enjoyable and fun to watch especially. But one scene in particular brings the entire movie down. I am not sure why, but it seems that every writer and their dog must put a dragon into their movie. The entire scene with the dragon and the armor and sword to fight the dragon was no good. The kitchen scene prior involving the armor was though. I know the climactic battle added length to the movie and strength to Alice, but it was boring and the same old same old. NOT timeless at all. But the rest of the movie on the otherhand deserves a first and second and even third viewing, and was well written. She (the writer) did a good job making a new story out of old material, and it will please both seasoned Hatters and little Alices. If you like drogons and not-so-great of battle sequences, this is a must watch. If you don't, it's still well worth it, but take a bathroom break when they get to the enlarged chess board.",8,2,4,6 March 2010
Avatar," Great story, great picture, great idea; nicely executed
","I went into the movie with some expectations. It seems as though every movie i've been to in the last couple years now has been disappointing. I go in with high expectations and it simply doesn't live up. It is only when I go in with very very low expectations and that it is decent that I think it was actually good. But all my friends and everyone I talked to about it ranted and raved about how good it was. And they said the 3D was amazing, the future of television, of video games, blah blah. I thought it would be pretty good, but doubted the level that they expressed. Boy was I wrong. If this is a great film then other great movies are simply cartoons. I was blown away. My mouth dried out from hanging open for the 2+ hour movie. I have to say it, this one is Perfect. The lush environment the story takes place in is amazing, the characters well portrayed, and the story itself very very well written. I was surprised it worked, what with some clich√© action movie moments. But it did, and nicely. It's one of those movies that you come out of in awe, that you wanna whoop and clap at at the end of. The one that you think about for a week afterwords and keep thinking about how it applies to your own life. This really is a different level of film making. A couple things for the future attender of this life changing experience: See it in theaters, and see it in 3D (and BTW, the closer you sit to the screen, the better the 3D).",10,4,9,27 December 2009
Up," A perfect 10 except for just two things...
","Up was I think a slight expansion for Pixar. Right Up in my mind. Their movies in the past hit home well with a wide range of audiences. But this one does even more so. A slightly younger crowd, as well as a slightly older one are easily captivated. This makes for an experience that is just simply amazing, across the board. A tear jerker of an animation, and one hell of a movie. But the expansion of audiences also invites some bad into their otherwise perfect work. I don't wanna give away too much but a high pitched annoying voice and some unexpected plane pilots caused an entire point off for this movie. Nearly two. This may please the younger crowd, but for the older I am afraid it hurt it. It hurt it bad. Besides breaking up the smoothness like a scratching record with this overplayed low-end television trick, it just gives you that gut wrenching feeling in your stomach: They obviously did not preview this movie enough. Now I'm no film critic, but my refrigerator could have caught that one. I mean come on. These moments, and a few more that I cannot seem to remember, leave a bitter taste in your mouth and a feeling of an unpolished work. But besides some absolutely gutter moments, the rest was extremely well done and absolutely a great watch for all ages. And I do mean all.",9,2,3,1 June 2009
