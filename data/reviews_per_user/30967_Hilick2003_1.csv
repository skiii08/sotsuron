Alien 3," Medium sci fi movie with a great ending
","The final scene of the film in which Ripley jumps while the alien queen is breaking out of her chest, is the best dramatic scene I ever seen. This scene alone covers the dull action. It's not as good as Aliens but still deserves to be seen by every sci fi fan in the world",9,0,3,10 July 2003
