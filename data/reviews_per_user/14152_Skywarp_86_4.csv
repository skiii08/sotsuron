The Rock," Not so much a film, more a way of live...
","This has to be one of the best Action Films ever made!!! Nicholas Cage's performance as Stanley Goodspeed, is one of his best, far better than that of Memphis in Gone in 60 Seconds...And Sean Connery? a true movie legend, when these two get on screen together the two have a perfect chemistry. Ed Harris also shines as the Good/Bad General who just wants a Burial for his Ex-Comrades, and he especially shines when he and Commander Anderson (Brilitantly played by Michel Biehn) have an argument in the now famous Shower Room Massacre scene, one of the best bits of the film...All in all, a very good Action film, with a truly wonderful cast!, A classic!",8,3,3,26 November 2002
Gremlins," Cute Little Monsters Huh?
","(Possible Spoilers)This film is brilliant, throughly enjoyable and definatly worth watching again. I've had this on video for an absolute age now, and still it manages to make me watch it again...it really does have that special something.Yes it does take a little while to start up, but it does set the Gremlins themselves up nicely, an example of this is Mr Flutterman (Dick Miller) who mentions that Gremlins used to get in tanks and planes in WWII...Zach Gilligan and Phoebe Cates do a very good job as the 'Hero and Heroine' of the film. In fact, the cast is very good, i can't find a fault with it...but...the real stars are of course, the GremlinsEverybody by now should know who and what Gizmo is.(if you don't, why have you been living under a rock?) Gizmo is the cute little Mogwai that starts of the whole disaster in the first place (dont judge a mogwai by its cover and all) But, for me the Gremlins themselves are alot better. The good thing is, no two Gremlins are alike, each is differant, and that itself is a testamony to the designers for such a good job. Stripe is brilliant, the lead Gremlin who constantly taunts Billy and Gizmo throughout the entire film.It's a brilliant film, a few little mistakes, but all in all..a very well made film 9/10!",Null,0,1,2 June 2003
Alien: Resurrection," Resurrection? the most ironic movie title ever...
","How could they? After the glorious sucesses of Alien and Aliens, and a slight let-down on the third film, how could they go and make this? it's with out a doubt, one of the worst films in a series ever! (and that includes Delta Force and Police Academy) Ok, so the special effects on the ships and the Aliens themselves were good, but what was with the New-Born at the end? ok, sure, they wanted to keep the samples of the Aliens and such, but to like 'cross-breed' it with Ripley? what the hell?! And speaking of Ripley, again Sigourney Weaver does a great job, even with a tired and limited script in front of her, the rest of the cast however, are either left in the black too much, like Michael Wincott's Elgyn, or are played waaaay over the top (more ham than a butchers shop) like Brad Dourif's Gediman, however, luckily for him, he went on to star in the Lord of Rings trilogy, Ron Pearlman went onto star in Enemy at the Gates, and Sigourney Weaver went on to star in Heartbreakers...ok, so two out of those three did well...but what about the Director and the film itself? well, in my opinion, both should be sent far out into space, and definitley, not as the title says, be Resurrected...Oh dear.",Null,0,0,14 January 2004
Aliens," For once a decent sequel...
","After a cracking first film, James Cameron went a hell of a lot better with Aliens, one of the best Sci-Fi Films ever made! again with Sigourney Weaver at the helm, this time supported by a brilliant cast...Michel Biehn, Bill Paxton, Carrie Henn, Lance Henrikson to name a few... this move starts fast, and never slows down!The scenes with Paxton's Hudson getting overly nervous, are one of the best scenes in any film ever! Hicks (Played by Biehn) is also one of the better Characters in any film ever, a brilliant character played by a brilliant actor...the film deserved more credit, but you can't have everything can you?",10,1,2,26 November 2002
