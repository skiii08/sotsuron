Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not such a menace
","A lot of fans were upset with this movie, but I wasn't one of them. After so many years of enjoying the original trilogy, this was a welcome return to the Star Wars universe. And yes, it had its share of flaws, but a lot of the things that bothered many people about it didn't bother me as much. Like Jar Jar for example. Yes, he was a horrible character, but he did get a chuckle out of me from time to time, even if it was just a stupid humor chuckle, and I didn't find him as annoying as other people did. And who knows, if people didn't hate on him so much, we might have gotten that rumored intended twist that revealed that his stupidity was an act and he was actually Darth Plagueis secretly manipulating everything and everyone the whole time.But lets talk about one of the big issues people had. Midichlorians. So many people hated this concept, claiming that it ruined the mysticism and magic of the Force, but I never saw it that way. To me, the midichlorians acted as a type of medium between a person and the Force, a middleman of sorts. So the more Force sensitive a person was, the more midichlorians gathered around them. The Force was still as mysterious and magical as before, this was just another part of it, so that never bothered me.One thing I didn't care for though was Anakin's character. It's just, I don't know. I know that this is Darth Vader as a kid, but I just can't see him being the type of person that yells 'Yippee!' when he's happy or 'Oops,' when he makes a mistake. And to be honest, his acting wasn't the best either, but this is common for many child actors due to inexperience and being so young, so I didn't really hold that against him, especially since playing young Anakin were some big shows to fill. It could have been worse though, so I decided to look at it as a glass half full scenario.And now lets get to the political portion of the movie, Yes, politics weren't the most exciting part of the movie, but they did move the plot along. And there were fun action sequences and amazing scenery that occurred throughout the film, like small battles, light saber fights, and the pod-racing. Come on, you have to really hold onto your prequel hate to say that the pod-racing wasn't awesome.And then we got Darth Maul. What a badass bad guy. And his fight with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan was epic. Really all the light saber battles in the prequel trilogy trump all the ones in the original trilogy, lets be honest. And yeah, Maul went out like a wimp, but he had thought that he'd beaten Obi-Wan at that point. And lets not forget the ground battle and the space battle. Yeah, Anakin supposedly blowing up the droid battle station by accident may have seemed like a bit of an eye roll, but whose to say that he wasn't unintentionally channeling the Force, or that the Force wasn't acting through him to an extent. Remember, what Obi-Wan told Han, there's no such thing as luck.",8,1,2,10 April 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," It was 'meh'
","While enjoyable for a movie, it falls way short of Star Wars standards. To be blunt, the movie was a pointless cash-grab. First, it was hard to even get invested in the characters, as it was obvious that none of them would survive since none were in any of the other movies. But perhaps the biggest issue the movie has is that it literally revolves around addressing a so-called plot-hole of A New Hope (something that isn't actually a plot hole if you think about it.)So, yeah, we all know about the Death Star flaw in A New Hope. Shoot a rocket down a shaft until it reaches the core and the whole station goes boom. This is the apparent issue that so many people had a problem with that they even going so far as to call it a plot hole. Apparently, it was such a big deal that Disney made an entire movie centering around it, but to me, it was never a problem. The flaw, while having big consequences, was so small and so outlandishly impossible to use against the Death Star that it took a space wizard to pull it off. Think about it, a single exhaust port only two meters wide required a small ship to fly down a trench full of guns to fire a torpedo in such a way that it makes a perfect 90% angle at the exact right moment and then travel down a thin shaft in a perfectly straight line, all while a moon sized battle station is expelling gas and exhaust, which should have pushed the torpedoes out if anything, or at least disrupt their straight line course. This movie makes it so this design flaw was intentionally built into the system, but that's far from believable. The shot was literally impossible to pull off unless you were a Jedi, which makes the whole idea that the flaw was actually an intentional trap built into it completely ridiculous and even more outlandish. That's not a trap, it's bait to a slaughter. This just made the whole plot of Rogue One completely stupid and pointless to me.However, this movie did give us that awesome Vader hallway scene. That alone made this entire movie worthwhile, even though it was a complete cash grab. Although that scene does now make the whole fight between Vader and Obi-Wan in A New hope seem that much sillier in comparison. I know this movie has gotten a lot of praise, but other than the Vader hallway scene, it was completely unnecessary, and I almost wish it didn't exist, as the trap rather than flaw in the Death Star's design is, quite frankly, really stupid.",5,4,5,10 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The best of the series, no matter what anyone else says
","This is it, the best of the series, and the original conclusion to the saga. It took everything great about the previous movies and brought it to unbelievable heights. I could go on for hours about what makes this movie so good, but I'll try to keep it short.Of course, there are those that have their complaints about the movie, some even saying that it's the worst of the original trilogy, and I'm left wondering if we even saw the same movie. Some people complain about the whole beginning with Jabba, and how it almost made it feel like two different movies, or that the first part was more of a prologue. That's a fair point, and I can sort of see that, but I didn't mind it, and actually found it very entertaining. It was a nice change of pace from what we've seen of Star Wars. And I loved the creativity and the creatures and stuff we saw. In fact, when I was much younger, this was my favorite portion of the movie because of all that. Not anymore, obviously, but I still find it highly enjoyable. And it also served to show us how strong Luke became as a Jedi since Empire.A lot of other people complain about the fact that the rebels needed to destroy another Death Star, calling it a rip-off of A New Hope, but that didn't bother me either. I don't remember people complaining about similar premises in other movies. For example, no one said anything when another Terminator had to be stopped in T-2. No one said anything about James Bond needing to stop another terrorist organization. No one said anything about another big car race in the numerous Fast and the Furious movies. Etc, etc. So this complaint is just a stupid nit-pick to me. Especially since the stakes have been raised a lot higher and the climax was much greater.And then there's the Ewoks. This was also another complaint that a lot of people had where they whined about how a bunch of primitive teddy bears took down the empire. I never had a problem with this, and it seems that people keep forgetting that they didn't take down the empire, this was just a very small portion of the empire's army, and there was also rebels fighting along side them. And despite the Ewoks primitive way of life, they had home-field advantage and superior numbers. It's just like how an army of ants can take down a much larger, much deadlier enemy like a tarantula or a scorpion with their overwhelming numbers. The whole thing also delved into the technology versus nature trope, but this was before that theme was used to death over the years. Overall, I didn't really have any issues with the movie and consider it a masterpiece. If I did have one real complaint though, it was suddenly revealing that Leia was Luke's sister. That really came out of nowhere, and it made a few other scenes between them from the previous movies a little... weird.But lets talk about the best portion of the movie. The big climax. I've always been a fan of a big, epic climax, and here we get not one, not two, but three of them. The space battle to destroy the Death Star, the ground battle on Endor to destroy the shield generator, and the light saber battle with Luke and Vader. That's a three way battle taking place at the same time, each one unique and epic. Actually, we even get more than that, as there's also the internal battles going on with Vader and Anakin, and the struggle between Luke and his temptation to the Dark Side. Seriously, what more could you ask for? And it all comes to a head at the same time with Han and Leia destroying the shield generator, Lando blowing up the Death Star's main reactor and then racing for the exit, and Anakin coming back to the Light and killing the emperor. Speaking of which, you know I've got to talk about this scene. One of the greatest scenes in movie history in my opinion. Luke accepting what he knows will be his death and completely rejecting the Dark Side, the emperor unleashing a power we've never seen before, and then Anakin's redemption when he casts off his identity as Darth Vader and comes back to the Light. Oh, I could watch this scene a 1,000 times and never get tired of it. Actually, I probably have.This movie really has everything. It takes all the great stuff from the previous films, rises it to new levels and new heights, and delivers us an epic and awesome movie that leads to a climatic finale that few movies can even come close to before bringing the saga to a satisfying conclusion. From my first time seeing it until now, Return of the Jedi always has been, and always will be, the greatest Star Wars movie ever made, and one of the best movies in history of film, no matter what anyone else says. I don't know what else to say but thank you George Lucas for not just this near-perfect movie, but for this series as a whole.",10,0,0,10 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Rise of the flaws
","Like The Last Jedi, this one seemed to divide fans, but not quite as much, as it seems to have gotten more hate. Though those that did hate it, really hated it, while those that liked it, really did seem to like it. Obviously, I was one of the ones who enjoyed it, but it did have its share of flaws. In fact, I'd even say out of all nine films, this one I had the most issues with, but I ranking movies on how much I enjoyed them, despite their flaws.As far as complaints go, one of the biggest complaints about this movie seemed to be about bringing back Palpatine. While I didn't have a problem with it, per say, I do kind of wish that they had done something else. Vader killing him back in Jedi seemed like the perfect end for him, and to suddenly and randomly bring him back like this and say he was behind everything felt a little too out of the blue, like there should have been more to this than simply telling us, 'Hey, guess what, Palpatine's back' in the scroll text. Even if they had, I still think a different final villain may have been better. Like what if it had been Darth Plagueis instead. Maybe Palpatine only thought he had killed him, but Plagueis, in his knowledge and quest to cheat death, had a failsafe in case he ever did die, and then they did the same thing that they did with Palpatine, just with him instead. But I was content enough with what they did do, even if I had preferred that his original death had been the end of him. Him having a cloned body for himself hidden away that he transferred his spirit into along with the spirit of every Sith before him was acceptable to me, especially since he had done this before in other Star Wars media.I also wasn't an overall fan of the so-called treasure hunt for the wayfinder. It didn't feel like a Star Wars theme, more of an Indiana Jones one. I could accept that only a Sith possessed one of these objects as a means of navigating to the Sith home world, but it still felt like a stretch. An acceptable one though. The part that I didn't like though and am openly opposed to was the Sith dagger. Engraving directions on a dagger of how to find a Sith artifact kept in the emperor's vault on the wreckage of the Death Star was a pretty hard pill to swallow, but I could swallow it. What I couldn't stomach though was the part where the dagger opened up to line up with the Death Star's remains if you stood in this one specific spot. That was not only incredibly stupid, but also completely unnecessary, especially since they could have just had Rey sense the Dark Side of the Force emitting from the wayfinder in the emperor's vault when standing in that spot instead, and then simply figuring out that that's where she needed to go. But still, one real bad moment against an otherwise enjoyable movie didn't affect it as a whole.I still enjoyed it overall, despite its flaws.
Having Rey be Palpatine's granddaughter though was a little, eh, for me. Not because it ret-conned her parents being nobodies by saying that they chose to be nobodies in order to hide her, it just seemed kind of strange. And yeah, I guess being the emperor of the galaxy, despite looking like a raisin, Palpatine would still be able to get laid, even if it were just from a concubine or something, but maybe having her be his great granddaughter would have made more sense time-wise, as Palpatine was already twice Anakin's age, but then I guess if that were the case then her and Kylo matching up as a Force dyad wouldn't have happened, and it did allow the plot line of Palpatine wanting to possess her to happen, unless that's just something that all Master Sith and their apprentices do. But then why tell Kylo to kill her at the beginning of the movie? Maybe he said that to manipulate him in some way? I don't know. I guess I just prefer the idea that she came from nothing special and could still rise to greatness to be better than the overused trope of her parents did it all to protect her, which wasn't as interesting. But it did give us a bit of an explanation as to how things came so easily with the for to Rey, making her less of a Mary Sue than she originally seemed, so that was good. And I like how she channeled all the past Jedi in order to destroy Palpatine once and for all.And then there was Kylo sacrificing himself for her. I kind of saw that coming, and that it would lead to his death ever since they first used Force healing. Speaking of which, I, unlike many, didn't have a problem with Force healing, since that's been part of Star Wars canon for years. But back to Rey and Kylo, I enjoyed their interactions with each other, and seeing how their Force bond grew over time. And the movie also confirmed Reylo to be canon, no matter what kind of BS back-pedaling Disney tries to do to claim that a clearly romantic kiss was just kiss of gratitude because some people kept claiming that the relationship was abusive. Pfft, right, like that's a thing. I was even content with Kylo dying soon afterward, although a part of me was hoping that he wouldn't be redeemed since we already saw that with Anakin.The movie also had other nice surprises. It was cool to see Lando again, and I'm surprised how much of Leia we got. And the big space battle at the end was pretty cool, especially with the whole galaxy united against the First Order, truly putting an end to it by showing that they wouldn't tolerate their tyranny. I totally called the Hux being the spy in order to get rid of Kylo though, and I did expect more from the Knights of Ren than what we got. So while the movie had plenty of flaws, I was still able to thoroughly enjoy it, and consider it a good conclusion to the Skywalker legacy and the episode series as a whole.",8,6,35,10 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the fans
","This movie is usually bashed the hardest of the prequel series. While it's understandable as to why fans were upset with it, I really enjoy the movie. But while Attack of the Clones does have its share of flaws, I wasn't as turned off by them as other people were. For example, a lot of people complain about Anakin being whiney at times, but, strangely, I don't remember them complaining about how whiney Luke was throughout A New Hope and Empire. You can't praise one character while criticizing another for the same thing, that's called hypocrisy.And yes, the dialogue wasn't always the best, and the romance could have been handled better, but you also have to consider the situation and the circumstances. Anakin is a Jedi, and romance is forbidden to him. He has zero experience in the romance department. He doesn't know what to do, he doesn't know what to say. Remember, he's pretty much been in love with Padme since he was a kid. Think back to your first crush, or the first time you tried to ask someone out. I'm sure you said and did things that you look back on now and wince at. Not only did Anakin lack experience, he knew he was doing something that was forbidden to the Jedi, and there was no one he could talk to about it because of this, not even Obi-Wan. So he tried to be completely open and honest, laying all his feeling out and being completely sincere. And yes, the dialogue was cheesy and cringy, but again, consider his circumstances.As for Padme, she's been a queen since she was very young, and then a senator after that. Unlike Anakin, she does have experience in relationships. In fact, she and Anakin even talk about it. But due to her position, she's probably used to all this higher up standard form of courtship, a lot of which probably involved fake things and putting on acts, a bunch of formalities, and a lot of other higher up nonsense. She was probably also put on a pedestal due to her position by a lot of courters instead of being treated like a person. She didn't face any of that with Anakin. He treated her like a person, not a queen or a senator. She always had a lot of affection for him, even when she was younger, and I think she simply responded to his openness and honesty, even if it was cringy. I'm still not saying the romance was handled the best, but seeing as there was a reason behind it, I was able to overlook a good part of what many consider to be some of the movie's biggest flaws.I will admit that there is also an overuse of CGI in the movie, and not all of it is has aged well, as people seem so fond of pointing out how fake something looks. But you know what, I don't recall people complaining about severally out of date special effects for old classics, whose special effects may have looked good over sixty years ago but now look ridiculous compared to what movies are capable of now. You can't praise outdated special affects that look bad now while bashing new, better looking but still outdated special effects. That's not how it works, and it's completely biased.Besides, the effects used in this movie provide some pretty cool scenes. The fight with Obi-Wan and Jango Fett was great, and the whole battle at the end with the Jedi fighting the droid army, and then the clones coming in, come on, that was pretty cool. We even get to see Yoda channel the Force and go all out. And yeah, it may look a little silly, but you have to admit that seeing Yoda turn into a badass Jedi master was freakin' awesome. But yes, the flaws this movie has did lower it in the ranking, but it also did well to keep me entertained throughout it, and that's primarily what I look for in a movie. A movie doesn't necessarily have to be good for me to like it or be entertained by it.",8,1,1,10 April 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Plot? What plot?
","Being the big Harry Potter fan that I am, I was really looking forward to this. However, I was immensely disappointed. There's really not much plot happening in this, and it's very obviously a cash-grab riding on the coat-tails of the rest of the series to get it anywhere. But then again, the writers did basically take what was essentially a Zoo Book of magical animals and tried to turn it into a movie. This was basically the whole movie: 'Oh look, a magical beast that escaped is over there. Lets go catch it. Look, there's another one. Lets catch. Look, another one. Lets catch it. By the way, there's some wizard kid over there who's getting abused and might be dangers. Oh look, another beast is over there. Lets go catch it.' That's pretty much the whole movie.Ok, so there is a bit more. They try and force this whole thing with Grindelwald being in the background with some BS magical investigation, but the whole thing is utterly ridiculous. Even the characters are underwhelming. Newt is an uninteresting, no-personality, oddball. Tina is this unemotional, pathetic, weak-willed woman who just sort of wanders around. Queenie is amusing, but is an over the top ditz who talks and acts like she's in a trance all the time. The only worthwhile character is Jacob, who's amusing, fun to watch, and full of personality.The best thing about this movie is the special effects. It really doesn't have much of a story, and is obviously just hoping that the Harry Potter brand will rake in the money. It also tries, and fails, to add to the Harry Potter lore by creating things that did not appear in any of the novels or anything Rowling ever created. When it comes down to it, this movie is just something to watch when you're bored and there's nothing else on to watch.",4,1,1,1 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Don't worry, it's good
","I was rather skeptical going in. After the 3rd movie, I felt it ended the series perfectly, and that continuing would only be a money-grabbing mistake that would ruin the series. So, naturally, I didn't set my expectations too high when I went to see this. However, I was pleasantly surprised. They did a good job, and in a way, seemed to close the book on Woody's story in an appropriate way. If I had to put it certain way, I'd say that this movie felt kind of like epilogue to the series. True, it wasn't as good as its predecessors, but they still did a good job that left me satisfied. If I had one real complaint, it's that we didn't see enough of the whole toy gang, as the story focused almost entirely on Woody and Bo. Even Buzz seemed to get pushed into the background a bit. Other than that, they did a good job.",7,0,1,24 June 2019
Aladdin," It looks good, but it ONLY looks good
","For live-action Disney movies, they've been pretty hit or miss for me. For example, I loved Beauty & the Beast, but I hated Maleficent. I was very excited for Aladdin though, only to be really let down. The special effects were awesome, I'll definitely give it that, but the acting was atrocious. I almost felt like I was watching amateurs who barely acted. There were also several scenes that felt very rushed just so they could move the plot along, but I could overlook that. The poor acting however, I just couldn't get past. Whether it sounded like they were reading a script, barely put any emotion into their dialogue, or overacted on certain areas, there was just so much bad acting that not even the special affects could save it as it was so distracting. I'm not saying the movie was bad, just that it could have been so much better if they actually had some good acting. In comparison, I give the original animated Aladdin a 9/10, but I only give this one a 5/10.",5,1,3,25 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The split in the series
","This movie pretty much split the fans, some saying that it ruined Star Wars, others saying that it saved it. For me, it was simply the next installment in the same awesome series, and I enjoyed it. But this movie suffered from a lot of stuff in the middle where it was just the rebels running away from the First Order, a lot of relationship development between Rey and Kylo, and a ton of exposition from Luke. Strangely enough, I don't remember people complaining about pretty much this same thing happening in Empire. You can't praise one while criticizing the other for the same thing. But unlike Empire, it had more action sequences and plot points in the middle of all this so there wouldn't be such long stretches of data dumping.And I was curious about the mystery surrounding Luke and how he ended up the way he did. And unlike many people who hated it, I didn't mind what they did to Luke's character. Yeah, I know what people wanted and hoped to see, I wanted to see it too, but this actually made sense from a storytelling aspect. Luke may be the most powerful Jedi, but he's still human, and seeing the way he contributed in unintentionally pushing Kylo to the Dark Side was interesting. Even his so-called out of character moment where he pulled his light saber on Ben after looking into his future, I don't think he was ever going to kill him. When I saw this scene, what I saw was Luke being startled by what he saw and reacting on instinct, much the way Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan did when their ship was shot. It was more of a reflex than an actual intention. Besides, he totally made up for any disappointment he showed throughout the film at the end when he Force projected himself halfway across the galaxy to distract Kylo. That was freakin' awesome.As for the complaints about Rey learning so much about the Force so fast, people seem to forget that Luke only trained with Yoda for like two or three days, so I was able to accept Rey's rapid progress as well. Again, you can't praise one while criticizing the other for the same thing.I was also far more invested in the relationship between Rey and Kylo, far more than I was with Han and Leia in Empire, probably due to me being older now than I was when I first saw Empire, but also because the complexity of it made it more interesting. And yes, I am a Reylo shipper, but no, I'm not one of those toxic shippers that obsess and freak out and make a big deal over it; it was just something I wanted to happen after seeing this movie, despite being a Finn and Rey shipper after seeing The Force Awakens.The only real problem I had with this movie was the whole casino side quest. It wasn't bad, it just went on for a little too long. I did admire the boldness of it though. In every movie, characters go on some quest to solve their dilemma, and they always succeed. But in this one, they don't. They fail on their mission, and then need to escape after having failed. Not only was this unexpected, but it was pretty ballsy. Like I said though, it went on for too long.And then here's another problem I had with the movie, the character Rose. I really didn't care for her. And no, it's not because she was Asian, or a woman, or any of those other nonsense reasons people are saying of why fans didn't like her. She could have been a white male, an alien, or a droid, and it wouldn't have made a difference. It was the character I didn't like, not the actress, who I think did a good job for the role she was given. And her self-righteous and judgmental attitude really annoyed me too. I would have loved her to have been present for the scene where DJ showed Finn that the very people she condemned for helping the First Order were also helping the rebels. And lets not forget how she doomed the rebels by preventing Finn's noble sacrifice, which would have ended in his death at the First Order's hand anyway had Luke not suddenly shown up. And yeah, maybe she knew him performing a kamikaze wouldn't stop the cannon and he would have died for nothing, but I don't buy that. And where the hell did that kiss with Finn come from? Because aside from her brief fan-girling when they first met, there had been absolutely zero chemistry and zero romantic interaction between them throughout the movie. Personally, I even prefer Jar Jar over her. At least he got a few chuckles out of me and helped move the plot along, and he contributed by getting the Gungans involved in the war, and then later by Palpatine manipulating him into convincing the senate to give him emergency powers. Rose didn't really contribute anything, and was only there for a side quest that went nowhere and ended in failure.Then there was also Holdo, who I didn't care for that much either with her holier than thou attitude. Yes, she was in a position of power where she had no reason to tell a lower ranking soldier like Poe anything, but her failure as a leader was not recognizing that people in a desperate situation needed a reason to hope. Instead, she continued to smugly talk down to Poe like he was a child and give him nothing, allowing him and the others to become desperate enough to pull a mutiny. That's something Leia would have recognized and prevented. It's been said that an explanation from Leia later on that they suspected that there was a spy would have fixed the whole secrecy thing, and I agree, but instead they just said that the less people who knew about the plan the better so no one would do anything reckless. But as much Holdo annoyed me, she did give us that light speed sacrifice. That scene was awesome, I don't care how many people complain that it 'broke Star Wars', saying how they should have been able to do that to the Death Star. Seriously, we're comparing crashing anywhere into a giant ship to pinpointing a two-meter wide spot and then crashing through miles of metal walls in the hopes of pushing through far enough to reach the Death Star's main reactor. It's not happening.So yeah, a lot of things that bothered people about this movie didn't bother me, especially not the fuel problem since fuel has actually been around in Star Wars for years. I didn't even mind them killing off Snoke, or revealing that Rey's parents were nobodies. To me, people were more upset that their expectations were so subverted that they took it out on the movie itself, and so found little things to criticize and nitpick at, even complaining how much of the movie was just a chase scene, but again, I don't remember anyone complaining about that in Empire.",8,3,20,10 April 2020
Joker," Kind of... Disappointed
","I was really excited to see this, but coming out, I felt rather disappointed. I mean, yeah, it gave us what it promised, Joker's backstory and how he descended into madness and became the Joker, but it was just... I don't know, I didn't care for how they handled it. I mean, I knew there would be some tragedy and I expected it, but I felt like they pushed that angle too much. I guess I was sort of looking for a descent into madness similar to how Jack Torrence in The Shining went crazy (minus the ghosts and supernatural) as opposed to what they did. And I'm not really sure I can even consider this a DC movie, since it had next to nothing to do with it. They could literally change the name of the Wayne family and change the name of the city from Gotham to something else, and it would have been a completely original, stand-alone, non-DC movie, that's how little involvement in it there was.But now for the big thing. Joaquin Phoenix's take on the Joker. Don't get me wrong, he did a fabulous acting job and was great for the role he was given, but that's just it, for the role he was given and the direction they took the Joker's character. But this just didn't feel like the Joker. It's like they just took some random character with a mental illness, slapped some clown makeup on him and called him the Joker. For sake of argument, lets just say they took the good Terminator from T2 and dressed him in a bat-suit then called him Batman, but he still acted like the Terminator. That's not Batman. Same here. Ok, maybe that was a bad analogy, but you know what I'm saying. This wasn't Joker. The character was far too anger, sad, pitiful, and fragile throughout the entire movie, even when he made his final 'transformation' into Joker, it just wasn't him. Now, I know that there's never been one true, clear-cut origin for the Joker, which is part of his appeal, and those that do have one are always different, but this, I just can't see this being who was Joker beforehand or how he became Joker along the way. Parts of it, yes, but as a whole, no. One of Joker's biggest/greatest aspects is that we're all just one bad day away from completely snapping, and that life is just one big joke, so you should laugh at it. But this is just some sad, angry guy with a mental illness who has tragedy after tragedy fall upon him until he finally gives up and decides to go out with a bang while trying to take down the oppressive upper-class. That is not Joker. Again, I think Joaquin Phoenix did great for the part he was given, but like I said, I was expecting more of a Jack Torrence going crazy kind of origin as opposed to what they gave us.",4,2,8,10 November 2019
It Chapter Two," A little disappointing
","I'll admit that I set my expectations a little high after the first one, but even then, there were several things about this movie that were rather disappointing. The first one was great, a true horror movie. This one was more of a dark fantasy, kind of like the movie 'Pan's Labyrinth'. One of the biggest issues is that for some reason, it kept throwing in needless and pointless humor. Sometimes it was a character making a comedic remark, sometimes it was just a scene itself that came across as comedic. This unnecessary comedy really underplays a lot of stuff in the movie, making scary scenes less scary and making serious scenes less serious and impactful (such as the random 'Angel Of The Morning' moment). I really don't know why they did that. Sometimes those comedic scenes were unintentional, but many were.I was also disappointed with some of the characters. Eddie, Ritchie, and Ben came across as bitter and angry a lot of the time. Ben especially, and he had this possessive, jealous air about him towards Beverly. Speaking of which, I didn't buy the romance between them, at least not on Bev's end. Ben was in love with her since childhood, which was fine, but Bev was completely in love with Bill since childhood, and even when they were adults. But then she suddenly and immediately falls for Ben because... she found out he wrote her a poem one time. All of a sudden, the feelings she had for Bill (even having known that he hadn't written the poem) suddenly disappear, and she's suddenly completely into Ben, whom she never once saw as a romantic interest, as a kid or as an adult. At least in the book it kept her feelings towards him ambiguous, but this came almost completely out of the blue on her end.They also added a bunch of stuff, like the characters needing to find tokens, which wasn't in the book or mini-series. This addition not only went nowhere, and therefore was completely pointless, it took up so much time in a movie that was already nearly 3 hours. They also completely omitted certain character roles that could have and should have played much bigger parts. I understand that cuts were necessary since the movie was almost 3 hours, but then why add unnecessary plots elements to begin with, especially when they could have filled them in with the characters and events they cut? And then there's was the climax. While not bad, it felt rather over the top, you know, just a little too Hollywood, not quite right for this type of horror movie.I know this may sound like I'm bashing the movie, but that's not necessarily the case. It was a passable movie that I enjoyed, but I felt like it could have and should have been so much more than what they did with it.",5,2,3,8 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 2nd best in the series
","Even prequel haters will admit that this is the one that stood out from the others, and for many reasons. For one thing, this was Star Wars as we've never seen it before. The fall of Anakin Skywalker. We all wondered how he became Darth Vader, and we all knew it was going to happen, but I don't think anyone was prepared for what we got. This movie was not only dark, it ended in complete tragedy. To see the Jedi getting wiped out, witnessing Anakin's fall from grace, his relationship with Obi-Wan and Padme falling apart, the Empire rising. It was all very bold, despite us knowing that it had to happen, and the movie did a good job of setting things up for A New Hope very well.Anakin's fall to the Dark Side was especially well done, and in a very believable way, and despite all the horrible things he did, you can almost understand. And while some people said that Anakin went all in to the Dark Side a little quickly, I viewed it that once he made his decision to do whatever it took to save Padme that he would really do it whatever it took, so he went all in. He knew he couldn't go back on his decision once he made it, and had no choice but to push on ahead, otherwise it would have all been for nothing. He was focusing entirely on saving Padme, not realizing that he was becoming more and more corrupt, and falling deeper into the Dark Side. And after Padme's death, he had no one and nothing left except Palpatine and his goal of conquering the galaxy since he had turned his back on everything and everyone else. And yes, some of the dialogue is cringy, but the acting is really good, especially the scenes where the characters didn't speak and simply relied on their expressions.But lets get this out of the way. Padme's death. Yes, I fully agree that the whole 'she lost the will to live' thing was stupid, but I don't think that's actually how she died. Childbirth is complicated and can be dangerous. Even the healthiest of women can die during it. Anakin predicted her death in childbirth, so we already knew it was, at the very least, going to be a very rough one. And after everything that happened leading up to it, she just gave up on everything, and that was why she died in childbirth, not simply because she lost the will to live. Medical experts will even confirm that people who are sick or injured who just give up will have their chances of survival drop significantly. And while I hated seeing a once strong female character brought down to this state, the circumstances make it somewhat understandable. Her husband fell to the Dark Side, betrayed everyone, and killed a bunch of children, the Jedi were wiped out, the senate was completely under Palpatine, a Sith Lord's, control, everything had just fallen to ruin. It's enough to break some of the most strong-willed of people.But whatever flaws the movie has, the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And lets not forget the most epic of light saber fights in the whole series. The battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan was more than awesome, but then we also got Yoda versus Darth Sidious. To be fair though, yes, the way Anakin was defeated was a little anti-climatic, but what they had given us during the fight more than made up for it. Everything in this movie took everything about Star Wars and cranked up the intensity and drama to levels we never saw or expected to see in the series.",10,1,1,10 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force repeats
","For this movie, lets start by addressing the elephant in the room right away, the fact that this is almost a clone of A New Hope. Yes, I noticed this watching it the first time around, as I'm sure most people did. But you know what, it kept things interesting enough that I was able to overlook that. I loved Poe's character as the snarky but lovable badass rebel. I was really intrigued by Finn being a defective stormtrooper. And Kylo Ren made an awesome introduction as the villain, who was the angry, emotional beast compared to Vader being a cool, unfeeling monster. Of course, Vader will always be number one, but Kylo was really cool. I mean, the way he stopped that laser blast, come on. It doesn't get much more badass than that. BB-8 was a nice new droid addition too, even if he was essentially R2's replacement.But lets talk about Rey. A lot of people hated Rey, calling her a Mary Sue, saying she was just a symbol of female supremacy, etc, etc. I didn't exactly see that. Ok, yes, she had a few Mary Sue moments, but what stops her from being completely Mary Sue is that there was a reason behind everything. How can she speak several languages? The same way many other characters can. How can she pilot a ship? The same way many other people can. How can she make such repairs on the Falcon? She grew up as a scavenger, taking apart ships and stuff, and so has knowledge of things like that, and was probably even taught by the junker she was sold to. How does she know how to fight? She grew up on a harsh planet where if you can't defend yourself, you'll die or get taken advantage of. How can she use the Force so easily? Well, we find out later why she's so strong in RoS, but she's also Force sensitive, she grew up believing the stories about the Jedi and what they were capable of, and so was more open-minded about the Force and what it could do, unlike Luke who was more doubtful, as seen in Empire. She also gained some knowledge, or at least an idea of what Force users were capable of when she invaded Kylo's mind; this was even confirmed in the novel. So you see there's a reason and an explanation for a lot of what she's capable of other than the plot simply demanded it. A Mary Sue can just do anything and everything just because, and with no explanation, like suddenly declaring that they had experience in something to allow them to accomplish a task, when there had never been any indication of this otherwise. Even when she beat Kylo in their fight, there was a reason for it. Kylo, who, don't forget, still hadn't completely his training, was distraught after having killed his father, he was shot by Chewie, he was wounded and tired from fighting Finn, who had also gotten a hit against him, he wasn't trying to kill Rey, while she was going all out and trying to kill him, and she caught him off guard by suddenly channeling the Force.See, plenty of explanation to dismiss the Mary Sue claim. But I also have another theory to explain her strength with the Force, that it was Rey, not Anakin, who the prophecy spoke of. Anakin was the result of Palpatine manipulating the midichlorians to try and create the chosen one for his side, but it was Rey who the prophecy actually spoke of. After all, even though Anakin killed the emperor, balance still wasn't restored, only temporarily stabilized. Palpatine transferred his spirit to his clone body, so the Sith weren't destroyed, and what was left of the Empire rose again as the First Order, and then Kylo appeared. So it was Rey who, when channeling all the past Jedi, actually destroyed the Sith and restored balance to the Force. And with the entire galaxy rising against the First Order and defeating them once and for all, the war truly came to an end and brought peace. So yeah, I didn't have a problem with Rey when taking all these things into account.I also didn't have a problem with Star Killer Base. I know a lot of people complained about it being just another Death Star, but that's not true. That'd be like comparing a nuke to a grenade and calling it just another bomb. And it wasn't a matter of destroying the main reactor and the whole thing goes boom. As a former stormtrooper, Finn played a vital role in taking it down. They weren't even trying to destroy it, just prevent it from using its weapon. It was destroying the part of the base that allowed the weapon to fire the energy it had gathered, which sub-sequentially caused the base to break down. As for the whole map to Skywalker part of the plot, it may have sounded dumb to some people, but not if you actually think about it. Luke didn't disappear but leave behind a map to where he was. He left with the intention to disappear into exile and not be found. Leia knew he went looking for the first Jedi temple, and that's where the map led to, not Luke. It was just called the map to Skywalker because everyone knew, or at least correctly believed, that he would be there. I will admit though, nostalgia likely played a part of me enjoying the movie, but it was still different enough from A New Hope for me to enjoy it as its own thing. But yes, a little more individuality would have been nice.",8,1,21,10 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The one that started it all
","This was it, or introduction to the Star Wars universe, where we met one of the greatest villains of all time. I'm still on the fence of whether I find Darth Vader or Joker to be the better villain though. But this was it, the movie that was so groundbreaking that it changed the movie industry completely. The movie that Disney Studios initially turned down, only to buy the series for six billion dollars decades later. Bet they're still kicking themselves for that. Like most fans, I prefer the original version with the practical effects before George Lucas went back and added all those unnecessary and pointless graphics and scenes, like that horrible addition of Jabba, and the same goes for the rest of the trilogy. Han shot first by the way.I had a rather unique experience when watching A New Hope for the first time. I watched it a few years before I saw Empire for the first time, so I was much younger than I was then. I don't remember why, but my father showed it to me in segments rather than a whole movie, so I initially thought it was a TV series like Star Trek until I was older. I still enjoyed it immensely though, even if I wasn't really sure what was happening throughout it plot-wise, and it will always hold a special place in my heart for introducing me to this world.Of course, the movie has its flaws, just as all movies do, and some scenes haven't exactly aged well, such as the fight between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, while seemingly really awesome when I first saw it, is basically just two old guys tapping sticks together. It really doesn't hold up well, especially when you compare it to the light saber fights in the later movies, particularly the prequel trilogy. And speaking of flaws, it seemed that so many people had a problem with the flaw in the Death Star, even going so far as to call it a plot hole. Apparently, it was such a big deal that Disney made an entire movie centering around it, but to me, it was never a problem. The flaw, while having big consequences, was so small and so outlandishly impossible to use against it that it took a space wizard to pull it off. Really, there's not much else I can say about the movie that hasn't already been said. It's just a great movie, and no matter which version of it I watch, I'll always find enjoyment in it.",9,0,0,10 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A unique point of view.
","I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but, to me, I found Empire to be the, shall we say, weakest of the entire series. I know that this sounds bad, but hear me out before you judge me; I have an explanation. I know that most people consider Empire to be the best in the series, but I always found it to be the, for lack of a better phrasing, least appealing. Better than the spinoffs (Solo and Rogue One), which I mostly found to be unnecessary cash-grabs, but still last place in the nine movie lineup. I still love this movie, but there were some key factors that kept it in the lowest position.The biggest issue I had with it is that it had a massive amount of exposition. Don't get me wrong, the battle on Hoth was awesome, so was the fight between Luke and Vader, but everything else in the middle was pretty much a bunch of data dumping, where Luke is learning about the Force, and Han and Leia's relationship is developing while they hide and try to repair the Millennium Falcon. And while I do think that things like world building, character growth, and relationship development are important, when your story is primarily that, it's going to suffer in my opinion.Now, as a kid, I had severe ADHD and a very short attention span, so all the stuff in between the exciting action sequences made it very hard for the movie to hold my interest. For me it was like: What's happening with Luke? Oh, he's still learning about the Force. Ok, what's happening with Han and Leia? Oh, they're still hiding and fixing the Falcon while getting closer. What's happening with Vader? Oh, he's still looking for the Falcon. Ok, lets get back to Luke. Oh, he's still learning about the Force. Rinse and repeat for again and again for over an hour. For a kid like me with a very sort attention span, it was very hard for all this to hold my interest. And sure, they had little tidbits like the giant asteroid worm, but it wasn't enough to hold my attention for long. There was also the cliffhanger ending regarding Han's fate, which my childhood self did not appreciate and was very upset about. Even what was arguably the greatest movie twist in history left no impact on me thanks to my own father, who told me that Darth Vader was Luke's father back when I watched A New Hope for the first time; something I will never forgive him for.Now that I'm older, I definitely have a deeper appreciation and understanding for this movie than I did as a kid, and scenes that I once considered to be boring I now find much more appealing, but the damage was done from numerous re-watches over the years from when I was a kid. So yeah, this is a ranking based a bit on circumstances, but unfortunately that's where it stands. Still a great movie that everyone should see.",8,0,1,10 April 2020
