The Blair Witch Project," The 'Bored' Witch Project
","The Blair Witch Project follows three teens (Heather, Mike, and Josh) as they trek out into the woods to do research behind the legend of the Blair Witch. They begin by interviewing several of the folks that live in the town near the woods, and almost everybody knows something about this witch. With the creepy tales of the witch swimming in their minds, they venture into the woods for what is meant to be just a three day camp out to shoot some scenes in the home of the 'fictional' witch. Once they enter the woods things start declining from there. The first problem is that the circle- walking begins. Classic in any 'woodsy' horror film. Because of the bewitchment of the woods, Heather, Mike, and Josh become hopelessly lost wandering in circles. While things definitely do get worse for them, the circle wandering is a very large chunk of the film. After they become lost in the woods, the film really has only 2 elements to it: wandering in hopeless circles in the woods, and listening to sticks crack at night. Are both of those things scary? Yes of course! Scary for an audience to watch for an hour and forty-five minutes? You can answer that for yourself. After they become lost in the woods, they begin to hear many strange noises and find mysterious, unexplained symbols placed all around them. Slowly the characters are forced to come to the realization that they aren't just lost. They are hunted. Josh is the first of them to disappear, then suddenly Heather and Mike are left alone to walk in circles and listen to sticks crack. Oh no! The film comes to what could be called a climax in the last five minutes when Heather and Mike venture out to find Josh, for the third time, and they are lead to an old abandoned house. Once inside, they follow his screams, and wind up in a basement where the film ends as you see Mike standing in the corner of the room. The camera goes black. After at least fifteen minutes of pure running, screaming and chasing, that is the end it comes to. Everyone dies. But are we really surprised?",2,4,6,21 April 2016
