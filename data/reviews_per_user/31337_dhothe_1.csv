The Avengers," The Best Superhero+Comedy movie ever!!
","i think this is a must watch movie. i am not a big fan of superhero movies. even tough i watched it because my friends dragged me to watch it and i must say i didn't get bored a single second of it. the action is awesome and the dialogs makes the movies one of the funniest movies ever. the credit should go to iron man and hulk who makes it all happen through out the story. just two words 'simply amazing'. there is no big difference in 3D and normal screens but i-max should make it look even better. my rating for the movie on a scale of 1 to 10, action - 9 comedy - 10 story - 9 overall - 10 (because it is an excellent movie). i would recommend you to watch the iron man, Thor, captain America movies before watching this. if you are not good at understanding English, then use subtitles because it would be a shame to miss a hilarious line in it",10,2,6,23 May 2012
