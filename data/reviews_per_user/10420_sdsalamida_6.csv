Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How bad would a movie have to be to completely RUIN the Star Wars franchise? This bad.
","I happened to be flipping through the channels and passed by HBO...lo and behold the Phantom Menace was being aired (HBO continuing its practice of showing mediocre to downright terrible movies...Twister anyone?).I decided to give the movie another chance...perhaps after 8 years my opinion may have changed. WRONG! I was a Star Wars fan, nay, Geek when I was a kid. I loved all things Star Wars/Lucas. That was until I was one of the 'lucky' few to see the first showing of the Phantom Menace (in my town).This was the Bill Buckner; wait, I'm a Red Sox fan. This was the 2004 ALCS Yankees of movies.George Lucas had 3 absolutely amazing movies (Episode VI was decent, before the 'special' edition). The Star Wars franchise was THE model movie franchise. Then, the most unlikely, unbelievable movie meltdown in history.Terrible Story. Horrible Acting. Lame Characters. Jar-Jar Binks. The only good part about this movie was that the music was done by John Williams and we will never (fingers-crossed) have to worry about a 'Special' edition coming out.Don't waste your time or money. Stick with the original trilogy. I really, honestly believe that George Lucas was trying to make the worst possible movie he could make. He succeeded. If that wasn't his intention, the man should never have been allowed to do anything movie-related ever again (too late).Indiana Jones 4? Be afraid, be very, very afraid.",1,43,84,1 June 2007
Blade II," Awesome Action scenes, decent plot, and plenty of blood...
","There's plenty of movies out that have to do with Vampires.  When Blade came out, I was hesitant to see it, after hearing about the Vampire's weakness to Silver (which generically isn't true).  After seeing the movie though, I was surprised, it kicked ass. Going into the theater to see Blade II, I was expecting something not as great as the original.  After all, the original was a 'break-out' hit, like Rush Hour.  Blade II not only exceeded my expectations, it blew me away. The action scenes are on par with the Matrix, and most are better than any in Blade.  The plot isn't great, but it didn't make you feel like they were just trying to make a sequel.  Some parts of the plot and story are spotty, but if you take it with a grain of salt, you should enjoy the film. Bottom line, If you liked Blade, go see Blade II.  If you didn't enjoy the story in Blade, but you liked the action, go see Blade II anyways.",7,0,1,23 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The movie Star Wars fans have been waiting their entire lives for...
","I grew up watching Star Wars.  Since I was 6, I absolutely worshipped the movies.  When I heard that Episode I was being made...way back in the day...like many other Star Wars fans, I was extremely excited.  The big day finally came and Episode I came out.  All of you fans should remember how exciting it was...waiting for the 'A long time ago...' to come up.  Then, it finally happened.  We sat through the movie...and when it was over...most of us felt...well, cheated.  'I waited X number of years for this!?!?'Episode II makes up for everything that Episode I wasn't.  Most fans waited their entire lives to see Episode I...and we were all let down.  Episode II is everything that Episode I should've been and more.  It may not be the best of the series...but...it's better than a couple of the others. Considering Star Wars movies, that's saying a lot.The story was strong.  Some parts were a little corny.  Overall, the movie was Amazing.  Not only did it fulfill all expectations for what I thought it should've been, it surpassed them.If you're a Star Wars fan...pretend Episode I never happened...and go see Episode II...",8,0,0,16 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," 'Revolutionizing' the term Mediocre, and Setting new Precedents for Dissapointing
","If you have an extra $8 to throw away...send it to me, just email me and I will give you an address.  Otherwise, wait for this movie to come out on video. Whatever you're expecting...you will be dissapointed.  The 2nd movie at least had 2 or 3 excellent action scenes, especially the High Way Scene. This movie...has nothing.  When I think of The Matrix Trilogy, I am reminded of a slacking student.  The first movie had all the effort, it was something special, something worth 'hanging on the fridge,' then the next 2 were just thrown together hastily to make it a 'Trilogy.' Do yourself a favor, save your money for Return of the King.",1,0,1,8 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Send a machine back through time and STOP them from making T-3
","The only good thing about this movie is that it's short.  The plot is terrible.  The story is forced and extremely poor.  The action is boring and unimaginitive.  The script is almost as bad as one of George Lucas' 'Gems' (Episode 1 or Episode 2).  If they had hired a 10 year old to write the script, I would expect dialog this bad.  'I'm back' says Arnold at an extremely lame point in the movie.  'Well, you shouldn't be.'  Save yourself the trouble and go download this movie.  Don't waste the $8.",3,0,0,16 July 2003
Event Horizon," Not for the weak-stomached. Lots of gore, and intense horror.
","After reading a few of the other comments, I decided to write my own. When you go to see a Horror movie, you have to accept the fact that you're going to see blood and guts.  It's not just a few bloody noses here and there. So for those of you who were 'disgusted' by the gore in this movie...maybe next time you decide to see something in the genre of Horror...make sure you know what you're getting into.  As for myself, and many others who saw this movie, there was plenty of gore (which is a good thing).  The psychological horror was intense, depending on how and where you watch it.  For example, I first saw this at 2 in the morning, with the Surround Sound way up, all the lights off...that added to the intensity.  Some of the plot is pretty corny. But for the most part, it's an original, good old fashioned horror movie. I mean, come on...a dimension that is the equivalent of Hell...what can be more horrifying, besides a sequel to Pearl Harbor? If you're a fan of horror and senseless violence, this one is for you.  If you can't handle blood and guts...go watch Bambi.",6,1,2,26 March 2002
