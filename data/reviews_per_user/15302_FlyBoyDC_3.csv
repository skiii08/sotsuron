Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Will the force be with yousa?
","A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...dissension grows restless within the Galactic Republic. Jedi Masters Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are on a mission to negotiate with members of the merciless Trade Federation (for some reason, these aliens enigmatically speak with Oriental accents). However, the malicious Trade Federation is not interested in making deals. Rather, they are more contented in conquest. The Trade Federation has decided to invade the neighboring Planet Naboo and enslave all of its inhabitants. When negotiations fail...the Jedi Knight heroes must take action...Princess Amidala (Natalie Portman), who is caught in the middle of the turmoil must align with the Jedi Knights in order to save her own people...and free the galaxy from the consummate forces of evil. Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) quarrel amongst themselves as they try to decide whether to step in and thwart this 'invasion' or simply wait...At the dark side of the galaxy, Darth Sidious along with his apprentice Darth Maul (Ray Park) plot the destruction of our heroes and the fall of darkness everywhere...Meanwhile, on the Planet Tatooine, a young boy by the name of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) has potential to be the next Jedi. With his quick reflexes and marvelous gifts, he may serve as either the savior of mankind, the disturbance in the force...or both. All hope very well rests on this boy...STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE is a most entertaining spectacle. Although this movie is hampered by quite a number of flaws, it is a once-in-a-while experience worth seeing at least a few times. Before I praise George Lucas for creating another sci-fi milestone, let me give an inventory of this film's weaknesses...The acting in this movie is for the most part, adequate. Ewan McGregor is a much better actor than all those Generation X teen idols. Liam Neeson portrays his character with plenty of aplomb.  Natalie Portman is beautiful yet strong-minded as a leader. Some of the best acting though, belongs to Pernilla August, as Anakin's mother. She displays the strongest emotional power in this movie. August portrays a modest and caring mother. She adds a touch of serenity as a genuinely loving mother who cares so much for the health and well-being of her son, Anakin. Despite some great performances, the acting is sometimes sub-par. Samuel L. Jackson's considerable talents are wasted in his tenuous role as a wise sage. Ray Park also deserved more screen time so he can fully develop Darth Maul into a menacing, devilish figure. Darth Maul may be an excellent martial artist, but he lacks a personality.  A few of the disappointing performances were not what I expected. Still, as an added bonus, look for Warwick 'Willow' Davis in an all too brief cameo appearance as a spectator at the Pod Race.STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE cannot avoid lapsing into its lethargic spots, especially the scenes in Tatooine. This film also depends too much on CGI special effects which may sometimes distract from the heart of the movie...With those statements said, this is definitely not as bad as critics have alleged, but the new STAR WARS flick contained serious rough spots. Luckily, these flaws have little or no effect on the film. I do disagree with the condescending critics' harsh reviews for this movie. Come on, it's entertainment people! Anyway, the spirit of the space opera is certainly celebrated. The action is stupendous and the invigorating special effects will enlighten your evening. Most of the action scenes are top notch and outstanding. The Pod Race is a felicitous event to watch with eye-popping FX. You can feel as if you were in the driver's seat at that moment! The extraordinary space battles, what can I say, are out of this world! The grand battle between the Gungans and the Battle Droids is impressive enough. Finally, the light saber battle between Darth Maul and the heroes has amazing martial arts choreography. To summarize, the special effects are majestic...Another prominent attribute in George Lucas's great film is the wide array of alien creatures. Although they look like they rely on computerized digital effects, these aliens are unique and they have their own personalities. Everyone who has already seen this movie knows about Jar Jar Binks and the controversy surrounding this odd creature. Jar Jar Binks does provide some much needed comic relief, but I admit that for most of the time, he is very fool-hearted. I also wished that Jar Jar Binks was a bit more comprehensible and coherent. I am aware that this eccentric alien can become intolerably annoying, but once you get used to him...he will bring a smile on your face. :-) Another minor character, Sebulba, has one mean attitude! Yoda, Jabba the Hut, C-3PO, and R2-D2 all bring back a sense of nostalgia to the STAR WARS series.STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE contains the most breathtaking visuals and set designs ever created. From the  awe-inspiring temples to the highly decorated underwater city, Lucas has managed to draw viewers into his fantastic, imaginative voyage. The concomitant soundtrack, especially the 'Duel of the Fates' orchestration by the London Symphony Orchestra is perhaps some of the most profound music ever.The new STAR WARS movie is a force to be reckon with. The plot is decent and the characterization is moderately solid. This movie may not become an instant classic, but it will be recognized for its show-stopping special FX. Is STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE worth seeing? Absolutely. I anxiously await to see Episode II of this memorable saga...

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A remarkably powerful and moving motion picture.
","I remembered seeing this movie in the theater back in the day.  It was probably one of the best, most thrilling experiences ever!  Back in 1991, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY ruled the box office!  Yes, this movie was the summer hit of that particular year.  Of all these science-fiction epic blockbusters that I have seen in my life, no film can match the impact of TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. This is absolutely the best science-fiction/action film that I have seen!  The mind-blowing special effects and stunts, plus unbelievable action place TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY on the top of my all time favorite movies.
In the future, 2029 A.D., the fate of Planet Earth must be determined once again.  The T-101 model (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in a rather sentimental performance) has been sent through time to protect young John Connor (Edward Furlong) and his mother, Sarah Connor (role reprised by Linda Hamilton) as well.  The 'good' terminator, the T-101 must stop another assassin, the T-1000 (character actor Robert Patrick), a 'bad' terminator from eliminating John Connor.  If the T-101 fails, thus, the consequences are unspeakable, plunging the human race into eternal extinction.  Dr. Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) is also implicated into this whole predicament. In fact, he holds part of the key from the past that may lead to the future fate of the human race... TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is undoubtedly a winner. The special effects are the most visually stunning sequences put onto the screen, and this film has introduced to the world, the ever-popular 'morphing' effects.  The action in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is riveting, fast paced, and pulse-pounding with some of the most breathtaking choreography ever. This movie is simply an electrifying, crowd-pleasing fun.  The performances by several of the main characters deserve plenty of praise for their accomplishments. Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Morton are all great but the T-1000 steals the show.  Newcomer Robert Patrick earns points for portraying a reticent but sly adversary.  Also, the musical score by Brad Fiedel is marvelously exquisite.  Once again, director James Cameron has created another winner. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is Cameron's ultimate masterpiece.
TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY transcends beyond the usual special effects extravaganza and action with a very cathartic and touching story-line. Here, this film shows the relationship between the young John Connor, and his 'surrogate' father, the good terminator. Rarely in action movies do we see a bonding relationship between two people of different dimensions.  This is not talking about perfunctory friendships.  Rather, this is deeply discussing the concept of people from two different 'worlds' sharing their culture, understandings, and even similar interests, if any. Another moving scene in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is Sarah Connor's frightening dream, or rather, a premonition she had of a burning holocaust of global proportions. This scene had definitely scared me when I first saw this movie in theaters. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY offers many insights on the main characters, just like in its predecessor. Character development is just as much of a spectacle in this film as for the obviously awesome visuals.
I have no regrets owning my own copy of TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and I think that this movie will appeal to everybody. It is one of the very few films that makes you want to see the movie over and over again, even if it is just for the amazing metamorphosing effects. This is one film where you can truly say that you do not have enough seeing it just once.  Very few movies can attain the high caliber of TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY.  Of course, this film deserves every bit of respect from me...   
Yes, it's true.  This film rules by all accounts!  A GREAT plot, tremendous action, breakthrough special effects and excellent production values make this film one hell of a science-fiction landmark!  RATING: **** out of ****.",Null,1,1,29 July 1999
The Deer Hunter," A mesmerizing epic about shattered innocence and lost faith.
","Several steel mill co-workers from Pittsburgh are celebrating their last days of friendship and independence.  For three of these people, Mike (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steve (John Savage) are going to serve their country by enlisting as soldiers.  These men will plunge right into the heart of the Vietnam War...Mike, Nick, and Steve will shockingly discover about the horrors of war and how the images of violence and anguish will scar their lives forever. Through tumultuous and gut-wrenching predicaments such as their imprisonment at a Vietcong Camp, these mortals must understand the meaning of the word 'survival.'  The human spirit must learn to triumph over all adversity. To be headstrong, is to win...The costs of the Vietnam War for each of these three individuals is unremitting.  One of these men's minds becomes off balance.  Another becomes a cripple. It is also sad that one of these souls may not return home as a hero...THE DEER HUNTER  is an absorbing and manipulative piece which overpowers the viewer.  The direction is taut and the performances are so splendidly real and commendable. From De Niro to the underrated John Savage, each actor does a superior job convincing the viewers about why he behaves this way and what compels him to make each decision. The viewer is also made to feel as if he/she could interact with the characters on screen.  Many scenes, such as the unbearable Russian Roulette scene and the imprisonment camp, are brilliantly captured on screen.THE DEER HUNTER  is such a symbolic movie.  For example, when looking into Mike's eyes just before he aims to shoot at a hapless deer, the viewer can see the remorseless, yet he can see the concentration Mike has as he tries to hit his target.  This only shows how over-competent Mike can be before reality sinks in...  The wedding scene in the beginning shows how much friends give a damn about each other.  Last, the transitions with the characters from a happy-go-lucky nonchalant attitude to a state of mental disillusionment and non-stability will stagger the human mind...THE DEER HUNTER  is a profound portrait of an American's perspective of the Vietnam War...and the aftermath.  Each of the three characters learns only too well that there is no real glory in war, only suffering.  THE DEER HUNTER  does a magnificent job showing the individual effects of war on each of the main characters involved.What makes this film even more remarkable is that unusually, THE DEER HUNTER does not focus on the atrocities of the Vietnam War itself even if the film shows the unthinkable violence of the Vietnam Conflict.  It is not a tale about heroism either.  Rather, THE DEER HUNTER  is a story about courage, and the ability to stay strong.  They (Mike, Nick, and Steve) learn that their sanity must stay healthy in an insane world.  If a soldier is unable to maintain his composure during war, then he will most likely feel the effects of this war, even if it is already over.  As noted before, keeping faith in oneself is a necessity to surviving.  THE DEER HUNTER  offers more than a standard war story.  It is a compelling, complex study of the human being under pressure.  THE DEER HUNTER  deals with emotions.  The souls who cannot stay cool under any situation will eventually breakdown afterwards...
Another theme in this movie is that a person must cope with the choices made.  The person has to live with the decision he has selected, regardless of the guilt that may overburden him subsequently with the judgment chosen...There is so much to recommend in THE DEER HUNTER.  The poignancy of this movie will torment your own conscience forever.   The tension is always prevalent in this fierce motion picture.  There is a lot to be learned from this movie, but the important message is that amid all of the chaos and violence that may exist in this world, the ones who can learn how to stay mentally stable will prevail.  Enduring hardships will only make you a stronger person...  See it, but be prepared...THE DEER HUNTER  has won five Academy Awards in 1978 for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Director (Michael Cimino) and Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Walken).RATING: **** out of ****.",Null,0,0,12 July 1999
