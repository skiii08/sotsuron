First Man," Disappointing
","Very slow plot. The movie puts Armstrong and his family in very unfavorable and strange light focusing more on his depression instead of his accomplishments. Also putting today's political issues into 1968. such as Gay rights, insurance for all and immigration was just silly Hollywood propaganda. People from around the country, including myself, were captivated with the Apollo program and the pride it created amongst the american people was strong at a time when Vietnam was ripping the country apart. This movie fails to show this. It makes the viewer feel that most Americans disapproved of nasa which wasn't the case. And to strip the fact that it was an solely an American accomplishment was the cherry on the top of this failure of a movie. I expected better from Ryan Gosling. Sad it should have been a great movie but it was a waste of time.",3,4,9,17 December 2018
