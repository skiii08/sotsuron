Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A very good and enjoyable film, but the weakest out of the franchise
","In my opinion, this film is really good. It had many enjoyable scenes. The planets and landscapes were awesome. Naboo is the first planet we see in Episode I. It's totally beautiful, the beautiful landscape, for example the great grass plains which we see later in the movie. The fantastic buildings and especially the palace on Theed. The including of Otoh Gunga, the underwater city was brilliant, and Otoh Gunga is really an awesome city too. Not a bad idea to have an underwater city in a Star Wars film. Then it's the return to Tatooine. I don't know if it was Mos Eisly Spaceport that we saw in this film, but that city looks so much different from Mos Eisley in Episode IV. Tatooine is the home planet for Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker.Coruscant. The whole planet is one big city. And actually it's one of the most interesting and best planets in the SW franchise. Here we can finally see the Senate, which was mentioned in Episode IV (but it became an the Imperial Senate later). Also the Jedi Temple is on Coruscant. The main bade for the Jedi Temple, where young lings get trained up to become Jedi Knights in the future.Characters: This film brought new characters into the SW universe this film also showed us the younger versions of some of the characters from the three original films. The best examples of new characters this prequel showed us are Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul. Qui-Gon Jinn is, as everybody knows a Jedi Knight. He's Obi-Wan's master. In my opinion he's the best character in this movie and he's also a wise character who wanted to protect Queen Amidala from the Trade Federation. Then there's Darth Maul, a brand new Sith. With his face like a devil and his double red light saber, he's just a bad ass. He's the apprentice of Darth Sidious (later known as the Emperor). We also met Darth Sidious, later known as the Emperor. Then there's Yoda, in a younger version. The original TPM Yoda from 1999 is terrible and will always be, but the 2011 change(Blu-Ray disc) was perfect. We must also remember R2 and 3PO. R2-D2, as shown in this film, is an astrodroid made on Naboo. That was surprising, but no problem. We learned where this one came from. Also C-3PO is introduced in this film. I can't believe that 3PO was made by Anakin Skywalker (the future's Darth Vader). Is it correct to say C-3PO is Luke and Leia's sibling. But I liked that 3PO wasn't finished, because it would have been better with giving him cover later, since TPM is 32 years before A New Hope. It would have been to early to complete him. The Mos Espa Podrace and the arena: The Podrace sequence is one of the best in this film and one of the best in the Prequels. The arena (where the starting line) is amazing. The public was huge, many people who watched the pod race. The pod racers were awesome. Every single pod racer was an alien, except Anakin. They all had funny faces and they were a bit funny theirselves. The scenes were some of the racers for example got shot by the sand people/Tusken Raiders or when they collided made me laugh, because it was so funny!The duel and the Battle of Naboo: The Battle of Naboo was splitted up in three parts; The battle inside the Theed Palace, The space battle and the Battle of the Great Grass Plains. All three parts were enjoyable, but the fight inside the Theed Palace was the most enjoyable. The battle on the Great Grass Plains was good too, with the Gungans fighting the Droid Army of the Trade Federation with their traditional weapons, for example those big blue electric balls. The Gungans actually lost that battle and they would have been all arrested if the Trade Federation control ship wasn't destroyed right after by Anakin. The space battle was a bit boring, except from when Anakin Skywalker arrived at the battle and used some of his good pilot skills, and destroyed the control ship with firing at the main reactor when he landed inside.The duel, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn vs. Darth Maul: A fine duel. Darth Maul, in my opinion, actually played with the two Jedi Knights. Two Jedi Knights against one Sith, and they couldn't kill him. Darth Maul was powerful anyway. This fight was enjoyable and we see the three main light saber colors in one fight, and we see three persons fighting instead of one vs. one. Flaws in this film: I don't see any mistakes or flaws done with this film. I don't have any problem with Jar Jar either, but this film is enjoyable, has many awesome scenes and awesome characters, both new and characters from the Ep. IV-VI in younger versions and awesome locations. I'd give it a 7/10",9,2,3,23 May 2014
