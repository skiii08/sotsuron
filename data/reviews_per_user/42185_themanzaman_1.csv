Scarface," One of the greatest movies ever made
","This movie is without a doubt in my top 5 and in terms of brilliant film-making, is very close to mine and IMDb's #1 movie; The Godfather. Everyone should probably agree that it has one of the greatest acting ever witnessed in film history in Al Pacino's perfect portrayal of the ruthless Cuban crime boss Tony Montana. How it didn't win best acting Oscar could probably be explained by the fact that unfortunately Ben Kingsley near perfect and riveting portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi (also one of the best in cinematic history) happened to be in the same year. How it wasn't nominated for an Oscar is a mystery I guess we'll never solve. And regardless of unappreciative acts committed by the Academy in the past, this movie needs and must be in the IMDb Top 250. By my standards, Top 10, but I'll be happy to see it in the Top 250. Critics who didn't like this movie should realize that the violence and gore was used as a tool for effective storytelling, and to derive deep emotions out of the viewers, and not just to produce a gangster flick. This is one of those rare 3 hour movies that after you have finished watching, you say to yourself 'Whoa! that was 3 hours, it felt more like an hour'. In my opinion, this film is almost flawless in every aspect. Rating: 10/10",10,12,22,22 July 2004
