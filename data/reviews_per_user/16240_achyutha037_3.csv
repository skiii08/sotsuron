The Avengers," Here it is, the masterpiece we've been waiting for. :)
","I was eagerly waiting for this movie. But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and Incredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor. Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities.As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt. I will say that, this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1Billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films in the film history. Verdict: 10/10 stars, A+++++, EXCELLENT.",10,37,69,27 April 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Expected level reached, another gr8 film starring Robert Downey Jr.
","After watching the first film, released in 2009, i became a die-hard fan of the franchise. I was watching those highlights from the movie which were stunning. I was EAGERLY waiting for the sequel to come. Expectations were high, and unlike other people who thought this sequel would be no-match comparing to the 1st part, i had faith in both the Director and Especially Robert Downey jr. I was not at all disappointed. The Chemistry between Sherlock holmes(RDJ) and Dr.Watson(Jude Law) is shown in a more detailed manner. RDJ once again proves himself that HE IS Sherly. The cinematography is perfect. The entire movie has Breathtaking action sequences. His dialogue delivery, action scene fluency and facial expressions were SUPERB. RDJ steals the show.The film does not have any moment of boredom but continues to entertain the audience which is the HUGE plus point. Mycroft(Stephen fry) was hilarious, he did his role without mistakes. Professor Moriarty(Jarred Harris), the antagonist, did it greatly. Simza (Noomi Repace) was brilliant.On the whole, the film is Stupendous. It will entertain you to the core. Don't miss this film. On my consideration, 'Game of Shadows' is amazing and better than 'Mission of Impossible 4' I give this film 10/10",10,0,1,29 April 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Awesome but kinda Disappointing *Spoiler free review*
","First of all, I am not a Marvel/DC fan-boy. I watch films of both MCU and DC movies. So lets get to the review. This will be a spoiler free review.The movie has action right from the beginning, but those scenes are NOT at all memorable compared to Avengers 1 or Winter Soldier. For the first time(or maybe I am wrong), I have seen a Marvel movie not show some of the action scenes properly and was kinda blurry whenever there was an Iron man vs. Ultron fight. Unlike Avengers 1, there are some really good emotional scenes in this movie for each and every Avenger. But I was really disappointed with the screen time Ironman/RDjr got in this movie. All he did was create ultron and later HM something similar to that. Plot is good(for an Avengers movie), but the execution was not proper. I really don't blame Joss Whedon(He's a brilliant director) for it as he had too much pressure to outdo the first one and as we all know, it would have been difficult for any director to outdo his own masterpiece. Highlight of the movie is easily the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene. It surpassed my expectations and was really entertaining. That will compensate for the other *bad* action scenes(There are some REALLY bad action scenes in this movie).Now lets get to the new characters/Avengers and the Antagonist- Ultron. Personally, I liked Ultron. But he was way underused. His plans are clichéd and are there just for the sake of the movie. But that doesn't mean he was not a good antagonist. Just saying that he could have been better. Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver were good, but their superpowers were not explained properly(Especially Scarlett witch). But they were really good. *BUT* the movie would have been the SAME without their involvement and they had nothing much to do except for the first few scenes and the final battle of course. Final battle could have been worse but a special character saved it and I am sure each and every one of you will love that character.Action: 8/10 A superhero movie must have some good action scenes and this movie delivers. Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene steals the show, as expected. But the final battle is very similar to that of A1 and it is exhausting to see the SAME thing happening again and again. I really was hoping that it'll be a 10/10 when it came to Action sequences.Plot: 7/10 Clichéd and very similar to the first Avengers movie. But, it was really entertaining and the concept of AI was good enough. So, I will give it a 7/10.Characters: 9.5/10 This was the best part of this movie. The already familiar Avengers like Thor, Hawkeye, Cap and Black widow are well written in this movie. But the only complaint is that Iron man did not have enough screen-time. Ultron was good, Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver were better than expected.Ending(Special mention): 10/10 Was quite emotional. Deserves the mention.Overall: Trying to outdo Avengers, which was easily one of the best Superhero movies, led this movie into a somewhat clichéd attempt. But it delivered what was expected. Don't expect TOO much or disappointment is guaranteed. Just sit back and Enjoy. 7.5/10",6,1,6,27 April 2015
