The Legend of Bagger Vance," Good movie despite its shortcomings
","This movie succeeded as a fantasy even with its shortcomings. The ending was great and only at the very end could a viewer guess how it would come out. Perhaps because I can relate to much of the movie, I can appreciate it more than some. I grew up in the depression. I caddied for Ben Hogan in one tournament. I lost my whole platoon in Korea so I know the depression Captain Rannulph Junuh was experiencing though unlike him I didn't quit though I knew other officers who had the same experience as Junuh just quit. And I have always been a avid golfer.But the movie had its weaknesses. Captain Junuh gets the Medal of Honor but he didn't do anything in the movie to justify a medal of any kind. Thirteen years elapses between the time he is in combat and when we see him again and we are left with a blank for that period in his life. We are supposed to believe that his wealthy and beautiful fianc√© just waits during all this period of time without knowing anything about what's happening to him. In real life she would have married and had children by the time he returned.And then there is the South in the 1930's and blacks. At that time Savannah was as racist as they came. Bagger Vance, who is a black, would never been allowed to caddy much less even get near white folks. Blacks were not allowed on golf courses then, especially a private course. And Captain Junuh would not have been playing poker or even drinking with black men. Whites, especially white trash, did not socialize at all with blacks although they thought nothing of raping black women.The acting in the movie was rather ordinary but sufficient to tell the story and it was a good story as many myths are so long as the viewer isn't taken in by its lackings and fallacies.",7,1,3,23 October 2001
Walk the Line," Way overrated
","If one wants to learn about Johnny Cash they would learn much more by watching the documentary about Cash on PBS. After watching that, this movie just doesn't do it. Reese Witherspoon is no June Carter who was a splendid singer in her own right. Phoenix does a reasonable imitation of Cash but in no way does he capture either the personality or the unique voice of Cash. It is like watching the musicians on the Lawrence Welk show imitate Cash or any other great musician. No true fan of Johnny Cash would enjoy this movie.It's what might be called a 'poor man's Grand Ol' Opry.' There are much better ways to spend one's money than watching this flick. After seeing all the rave reviews (by people who obviously were never Cash fans, I was sorely disappointed and wish I could have gotten a refund.",5,6,17,5 December 2005
Black Book," Sex, sex, and more sex.
","This maybe an interesting movie to the mindless but it has some serious problems. It is supposedly based on true events but the story itself is a combination of a number of different events that occurred during the occupation of the Nehterlands during WWII, which were unrelated. There was a story of a Jewish woman who became the mistress of a Gestapo officer. There is a story about how the Gestapo stole from Dutch Jews, and there are stories about the Dutch Underground. This movie attempts to tie all these stories together but it just makes the story a bad piece of historical fiction. The connections don't always work and appear to be fabricated. For example, the house in which the Jewish refugee is hiding is blown up by an American bomb while she away from the house with a man in a sailboat. Supposedly, the Gestapo find her Jewish identity card in the house wreckage. But in reality, if she was a Jewish refugee, she would have destroyed her identity card. And secondly, the Gestapo nor the police are going to investigate a house blown up by an American bomb. And because the house was in the countryside, it was unlikely that a firetruck would arrive at the house at all, much less within five minutes of the bombing as depicted in the movie.Another flaw is that nothing happens to the heroine's girl friend after the war. She was a prominent collaborator and instead of being punished, she celebrates the end of the war. These are only two of the inconsistencies in the movie.The movie is more about setting up a platform to depict nudity and sexual activity. It is more porn than truth.",3,3,16,23 December 2007
We Were Soldiers," A Good Piece of Historical Fiction
","When the producers state in their advertising that a movie is based on a true story, they are telling you that it is historical fiction. That is the case with this flick. It was NOT the first big battle in the Viet Nam war. There were bigger battles prior to this battle but the battle that the film is based on resulted in a change in the strategy of the Viet Nam War. Unfortunately the film fails to note the significance, which was that Gen. Westmoreland, lacking any common sense decided that the US would win the war by attrition. The only problem with his theory was that the US would have to kill 400,000 North Vietnamese every year.For the sake of Hollywood the film attributes some of the actions to the wrong participants; events occur in the wrong order, and events are distorted. Any veteran of the War will criticize the movie because of its placing soldiers in the open when in fact there was no open space in the heavy jungle.But all in all, it is a picture well worth seeing. It shows soldiers in the positive aspects, if there is anything positive about war, instead of deliberate distortions as has all to often happened in Viet Nam war movies (such as Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter). This film is the best film ever made on the Viet Nam War and viewers will better understand how the war was fought and how tough it was. For those who have been in combat no movie can even get close to what it is like on the battle field, but this movie does as good a job as any. Mel Gibson does an excellent job of portraying the battalion commander.",8,0,1,7 March 2002
The Aviator," Over-over rated waste of time
","This is supposedly about the life of Howard Hughes, a tall thin man who I met a couple of times. There have been better movies made about his life than this. This one is not very accurate and the casting is bad.Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't resemble Howard Hughes in the least and never really captures his character. Even worse is Cate Blanchett playing the part of Katherine Hepburn. Hepburn was a rail thin beauty with a special marvelous voice and Blanchett is just the opposite, unattractive, average build, and with nothing special about her. The way she played Hepburn was a travesty, particularly to Hepburn fans. But then the relationship between Hughes and Hepburn was fictional and never really happened as shown in the movies.The movie focuses on Hughes' foibles but for the most part they are overemphasized or taken out of context or even contrived. Hughes' life was a long and complex story which unfortunately is too abbreviated in the movie, such as omitting his marriage to Jean Peters",3,3,8,12 February 2007
The Bourne Identity," An enjoyable thriller
","This movie has a very interesting plot which kept me on the edge of my seat until the end. While ending was not unexpected the path to it took many unexpected twists and turns. The movie did have its shortcomings. I didn't like the performance of Julia Stiles. She didn't seem to fit the part. There were also problems with realism. When Matt Damon is picked out of the sea, he has no clothes. Yet when he leaves the boat, he has a set of perfectly fitted clothes and shoes. Near the end, there is an explanation of how he wound up in the sea but the explanation was not clear and I never understood why and having a DVD and replaying it, I still could not figure it out. There were a couple of scenes cut from the movie that should have been left in to improve the continuity. Otherwise, it was enjoyable and worth watching.",8,0,1,14 March 2004
Cold Mountain," mostly fiction, historically inaccurate
","One would think that the setting of this movie was in Kansas with Quantrills Raiders and the Jayhawkers, not North Carolina. This movie is full of brutal atrocities that never happened in North Carolina and to some extent not during the Civil War.For example is the rogue Southern militia rounding up deserters and punishing all they believed helped them. Deserters were not executed by the militia as depicted in this movie. They were turned over to the nearest Souther Army units and then sent back to their units where they were court martialed and executed as example in their own units.Another example was the incursion of a Union patrol into the North Carolina mountains in 1864. That did not happen but members of this patrol attempt to rape a widow with a baby. Never happened. One of the atrocities that didn't occur during the Civil War was rape. The entire scene was unreal. A patrol might scavenge for food but the soldiers would have most respectful to the woman, particularly since she had a baby. They would have been solicitous of her welfare.And then when the widow escapes from the soldiers, she finds a rifle that did not exist in the Civil War and shoots a naked soldier running for his life in the back. Pure nonsense.Then the Southern deserter has the horses of the Union patrol available to ride to his destination but instead of using the horses he continues walking across the mountains. Could he be that stupid? Nicole Kidman was completely miscast in this movie like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Even her costumes are too well tailored for a mountain girl.And her acting left a lot to be desired. Renee Zelwigger fit her part perfectly which was that of a homely mountain girl.All in all, this movie didn't bother with the facts. It was much more interested in titillating its viewers with sex and violence and any success it had was in doing that.",2,4,6,1 October 2005
Heartbreak Ridge," Breaks the hearts of every Marine
","Another fantasy movie about Marines. Any resemblance to the truth is pure coincidence. First, recon platoons are not part of regiments or battalions. Recon platoons are part of the Division Headquarters. Recon platoons are made up of the best of the best and no recon platoon would have ever looked as sloppy as this one did in the beginning.Second, companies are commanded by captains, not majors. When the major reported to the colonel as 'Graduated from the Naval Academy, 1971' would never happen. The colonel already knows the major's background.Also every Marine knows the Medal of Honor ribbon and every one seeing the Gunny with the ribbon would have immediately recognized that he was a Medal of Honor winner and would have immediately given him the highest respect, including the Major. The Major would have been so glad to have the Gunny in his outfit that he would been kissing his butt.As for the Gunny firing an AK-47 at his troops to get them accustomed to hearing it fire - pure fantasy. He would have been busted out of the Marine Corps if that happened. What he would have done is take his troops to a firing range and under controlled conditions fired the weapon down range. This is done often with units to familiarize them with the sound of enemy weapons.As for the accidental firing on the shooting range, unlikely. By the time a Marine is selected for a recon platoon, he is already highly trained in weapons and he is not likely to make a boot camp mistake.
I could go on and on about what a crappy movie this is but enough is enough.",2,33,59,10 August 2003
Collateral," Jamie Foxx only redeeming feature
","The only redeeming feature in this movie is the superb performance of Jamie Foxx. It is the only reason to watch it. Otherwise, it should never have been released. The plot is bizarre and it gets more bizarre as it goes along. It is a predictable plot. Boy meets girl. Boy also meets killer. Boy will survive and meet girl again. The suspense is how will he wind up with the girl and the path the story takes is contrived and unreal. As the movie goes on it makes less sense and less sense.Foxx is nominated as the Best Supporting Actor in this flick but he should have been nominated for the Best Actor for in reality Tom Cruise, who supposedly is the principal actor, supports Foxx. Cruise plays his usual self, a tough cocky guy and as usual he doesn't do a good job. There was always a sort of Tom Cruise in every high school and no one ever liked him. But Cruise is rather small and he is not always convincing as a tough guy and he wasn't convincing in this movie either.For viewers who live in Los Angeles, there were often very familiar scenes although sometimes a viewer familiar with the turf would wonder how the characters got there. There is one scene where they are driving by the Beverly Hills Hotel at night and a coyote walks across the street in front of them. Why they were at that location made no sense, what the coyote had to do with the picture was not clear, and the coyote walked across the street, which coyotes don't do. They run, not walk, when vehicles approach.",4,0,1,24 February 2005
Dunkirk," Has its moments but definately not worth an Oscar
","Given all the fluff about the movie, it was disappointing. It has its virtues but not enough to win any awards, It shows only a very small portion of the battle for Dunkirk and it doesn't always get it right. The battle for Dunkirk is seared in my memory. As a boy, I first heard of Dunkirk on the radio news but when I saw the newsreel footage and the photos in Life magazine, it became indelibly impressed in my memory. While a professional military and battle experienced officer stationed in Europe, I spent a weekend in Dunkirk and the surrounding countryside studying the battle. If anyone wants to really learn about what happened at Dunkirk they should watch the PBS NOVA program 'Great Escape at Dunkirk.' In one hour, a viewer will 
learn far, far more about Dunkirk than depicted in the movie and have a much better understanding.Unfortunately, the movies shortchanges the viewers by not taking a few minutes to provide the setting. Inaccurate.y, the film begins with the French and British defending against the German attack only a few hundred yards from the beach when in fact, the German lines were still 20KM from the beach on May 27 which is about when the film begins and a 1,000 KM from the beach when the British and French surrendered on June 4.The story about the Spitfire crash landing on the beach is incorrect. To begin with, the pilot gliding his plane without fuel and shooting down a German bomber is nonsense. Then he crash lands his plane on the beach and burns the plane and surrenders to the Germans. In fact, a Spitfire did land on the beach but the pilot was not taken prisoner nor was the plane burned. In fact, it was eventually recovered long after the war and restored and it is flying today.What was bothersome, is that the story starts out by focusing on a Britsih deserter and follows him through the film. That does not do justice to the real heroes of Dunkirk, the soldiers in the rear guard to fought valiantly to hold back the German advance until the rest of the Army escaped, and then surrendered and were put in German prison camps for the remainder of the war.The ending doesn't tell the story. We find the British Admiral in charge of the evacuation saying he is staying for the French. In fact,123,000 French troops were evacuated. But the story is not clear when Commander Bolton at the end says 'I'm staying. For the French.' But most of the French had already been evacuated so what he probably was referring to over 26,000 French soldiers that were evacuated on the last day.The story was fuzzy at times, even confusing. That was in part due to poor editing which switched back and forth and scenes often were not in chronological order. Often switching back and forth between night and day and back again. Some like that style but I found it annoying. At times the story was not told well. Apparently, the reason the story focused on the deserter is because the story of how he survived was unique. He survives a shipwreck in the movie the significance of that incident is not clear - until I saw the NOVA version.A plus for the film was its realism. The scenes were real. The dialog was real. The acting was very good. It did not get maudlin. Nothing romantic. No gore and it could easily have been gory. It is the type of movie I don't mind children watching. But not it is not a history lesson.",6,2,3,20 February 2018
Pearl Harbor," Fiction, Fiction, Fiction
","Lots of special effects but as to historical accuracy, forget it. If you want historical accuracy, get a video of 'Tora, Tora, Tora!' Because I was an 11 year old living just west of Honolulu where my Dad was stationed at the time of the attack, I have vivid memories of Pearl Harbor. My father was on duty on Ford Island at the time so when I raced out to our front porch when I heard all the planes and saw bombs falling on Ford Island, I was very fearful that something would happen to my Dad. Fortunately, he only suffered a strained back from jumping from the top of a hanger just before it was hit by a bomb. But I had a front row seat. So I saw this movie more out of nostalgia but it so distorted everything it lacked any nostalgiac value. Moreover I got bored. The romance had nothing really to do with Pearl Harbor and shouldn't have been part of the movie. And I could not understand why if this was a film about Pearl Harbor, why did it have to go on and on after Pearl Harbor.Basically the movie does not square with my recollection of what happened nor with most historical accounts. Alec Baldwin was badly miscast as Jimmy Doolittle. He not only did not resemble Doolittle in the slightest, he did not match him in character or dialog. And he was not the only one. I was not impressed with Affleck or Cuba Gooding. If you like special effects, maybe it is worth seeing, but don't accept what you see as what actually happened.",3,0,0,25 May 2001
Pearl Harbor," Love Story, not History
","This movie is much more a fictional love story than historical fiction. Consequently, history and authenticity frequently suffer in order to bend the story around Pearl Harbor. Fortunately, the early reviews of this movie panned it and so I didn't pay to see it until it was on TV.It starts off with the two heros meeting with Lt.Col. Doolittle a couple of years before the war. Doolittle, a WWI veteran, returned to active duty in July 1940 where he was assigned to implementing war production. He did not command any squadron until he formed the B-25 raid on Tokyo so he could not been involved with the two heros. Secondly, when Doolittle formed his squadron he used already trained bomber pilots. The two heros were experienced fighter pilots and would never have been transferred to bombers.
The movie further departs from what happened on the Tokyo raid. First, it states that Japanese patrol boats were sighted 400 yards away. That didn't happen and no enemy  boat would ever have gotten that close to the American Fleet. In fact it was Japanese fishing boats spotted four miles away. The decision to launch the raid early did not come from Doolittle as shown in the movie but from an overly cautious Admiral Halsey. The movie shows the Doolittle planes flying in formation as they bombed Japan. In fact, each plane flew separately to different targets in Japan. The surprise was so great that unlike in the movie none of the planes were fired upon by Japanese anti-aircraft guns. One plane did encounter Japanese fighters but the fighters flew by. At that time the American insignia included a red meat ball in the center of a white star, similar to the meatball on Japanese planes and the Japanese who believed that it was impossible for American bombers to reach Japan probably thought they were Japanese planes.Further, no two planes landed close together as depicted in the movie. For viewers who want a more authentic version of the Doolittle raid, see '30 Seconds Over Tokyo' or watch the History Channel.If one wants to see a more accurate movie about Peal Harbor, see 'Tora, Tora' which focuses solely on the Pearl Harbor Raid. Unfortunately the movie 'Pearl Harbor' gives a shallow overview of the attack and what preceded it and it lacks accuracy. The special effects showing the attack are superior to that of Tora, Tora, but we have such inaccuracies of using air cooled anti-aircraft machine guns on the ships when the guns were water cooled. The two heros did not fly from Hickam Field as shown in the movie but from Ewa Field which was not under attack. No fighter ever got off of Hickam Field.Generally speaking authenticity went to hell in this movie and so did the movie with a silly love story.",3,0,1,9 February 2004
Remember the Titans," Exceptional movie
","Being a former white athlete and coach I am sick of sports movies where the story involves a team eventually winning a championship so I passed this one by when it first came out. Big mistake!! Like 'Hoosiers' this one was an exception and what an exception. Remember the Titans is in my top five movies of the past ten years. Denzel Washington, as the coach, gave another of his consistently outstanding performances.Like 'Hoosiers' this is a true story and it is not just a story about sports but a strong story about race. I probably appreciated it more than most because of my background I connected to the movie. During the 1940s I attended schools which were well integrated and students of different races and cultures existed harmoniously. To a large degree, it was because the high school had a very successful football program in which unlike almost all of the other schools, minority athletes were welcome. In my junior year we went undefeated and won the State Championship and the team is still considered the best high school team of all time. The only time the team came close to defeat was in the State final when we played another well integrated team.Consequently the community while generally middle and upper class except for its minorities was well integrated. As a result although I knew racism existed, I never encountered it in my community. But then I began to see its ugly head. First, the All-American end on our team, a superb athlete, was denied scholarships both to USC and Stanford because neither school accepted minorities. I had always wanted to go to USC but because of what USC did to my friend I turned down its offer of a scholarship the next year as I did to Stanford which I considered a snob school then as I do today.But my college was cut short when the Korean War began and I was in the service. I was sent to bases in the South and I spent much of the next thirteen years in the South witnessing how bad it was for the blacks and I was involved in the civil rights movement in the South which got me into a lot of trouble with my military superiors.During my tours in the South I became head coach of a football team at a Southern base. Filled with ex-collegiate stars and some pros, we regularly played Division I colleges and universities. However, because I had black players on my team I couldn't schedule games with any white southern colleges. Instead we scheduled one black college and several state universities in the mid-west.Some critics have compared the summer camp at which Washington as Coach Boone brought the blacks and whites together as a team as like a Marine Boot Camp but everyone missed the subtlety of this. I went through Boot Camp at a time when the military was just integrating and we had southern blacks and whites as well as a mix of races from other parts of the country in my platoon as well as all classes. It didn't take very long for us to become as one unit. The first part of boot camp is sure hell and the reason for it is that it reduces everyone to the lowest common denominator of misery and you quickly learn that the only way to escape that misery is to work together. This is just the way Coach Boone made it work.What I liked about this movie is that it showed how all this played out. Most moviegoers today are not really aware of how bad racism was in 1971 but this movie illustrates it well. Even though the movie has a few corny moments and the actors playing the roles as football players look old for high school, these faults are minimal and do not detract from the power of the film.",10,105,130,13 March 2006
Seabiscuit," Best Movie of the Year
","I am a movie cynic but I found this movie to be the best of the year. It told the story of Seabiscuit extremely well. The only shortcoming of this movie was the overuse of vulgarities which were very uncommon in the 1930's For one who grew up during the depression the movie took time to show how brutal the depression was. And there were many poignant moments. One scene was of a group of people standing around a car listening to the race on the car radio. It was common in the late thirties for that to happen. One example I remember were the Joe Louis fights. Rarely have I seen a movie that so realistically depicted both the scenery and the moods of the times. One exception was the scenes taken in the Los Angeles Union Station. In the background was a lighted sign. That sign is in the present  Union Station but it was not in the Station during the 1930's and 1940's.Viewers who did not grow up in the Great Depression might not appreciate this movie as much as they should and Seabiscuit, the horse, was a great symbol to the common person in the US in those days and the movie brings this out quite well.The acting while not spectacular, was more than adequate. If this movie had been cleaned up, it would be a great story for children as well as adults but unfortunately it wasn't. But still it is a great story well told and well photographed.",8,0,0,28 December 2003
Good Will Hunting," A Gem
","This story about a tough orphan who is an absolute genius struck a familiar note for me because Hunting (Matt Damon) reminds me of my father. Born at the turn of the 20th Century, his mother died after his birth and his father became such a drunkard and tyrant that my father left home at age 11 and did not complete school. A roughneck, stevedore, prize fighter, lumberjack, gun slinger, cowboy and rodeo rider, he finally married at the beginning of the Great Depression at the age of 30 to society girl and concert pianist who gentled him down. After I was born he sought a more stable and safe occupation and became a carpenter. He took correspondence courses to complete his education eventually getting his degrees in civil and construction engineering,I knew he was smart in mathematics but I didn't know how smart until I took a geometry class from a teacher that was a retired professor from the University of California. One day he gave the class an problem that had never been solved. I took the problem home and asked my father if he could help me with it. Within an hour he had solved it. My professor was amazed. He gave me two more unsolved problems and my father solved both. Like Hunting he was an absolute mathematics genius. Nothing more came of it. My father was a brilliant construction engineer and that was his calling.So the movie had a tone of authenticity to it. It was a good story although at times it was a bit contrived. I am not a fan of Robin Williams but his performance in this movie by itself made it worth watching. If there was a negative it was Minnie Driver who was miscast. Because she is an ugly duckling, perhaps that is why she was chosen but her acting and her accent were atrocious and I had to knock off a couple of stars on its rating. Otherwise, it is well worth anyone's time to watch.",8,0,2,25 May 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Bad Mixture of 19th and 21st Centuries
","Most disappointed. This film does not measure up at all against its 1952 version starring Jose Ferrer as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Trying to mix the 19th Century with the 21st Century is like mixing oil and water. The 19th Century music in the original film was far more interesting than the music in the 2001 film. The plot seemed contrived just as opera plots are contrived to make the music fit in. It was an attempt to immitate the 1930's-1950's musicals which often did not make sense and were boring in their own way. This as boring, not in the same class as South Pacific, Carousel, and Show Boat. One reason is that Nicole Kidman, really miscast in her role, is not the caliber of singer that starred in the great musicals. Her singing was better than most actresses but the great musicals used great singers.",4,0,1,21 May 2001
1917," NOT A BET FILM - HITORICALLY INACCURATE
","While 1917 may have its attributes, it has a serious problem. Although based on a true story, it deviates so much from the story that the film is more fiction than fact. As a combat veteran of two wars and a military historian, I find the deviations ridiculous and misleading. If viewers believe that the film is realistic reenactment of a battle during WWI, they are badly mistaken.As the reviews stated, the story was about two soldiers who were ordered to send a message to a regimental commander whose Brigade was deep behind enemy lines and was about to lead his troops into an ambush that would have caused the loss of 1,600 men. The messengers were to tell the commander to call off the attack. One of the two messengers was the brother of an officer belonging to the endangered regiment.In fact, there was only one messenger and he was not a brother of any of the attackers. Furthermore, the actual orders given to his company commander were,'Should the enemy counter-attack, go forward to meet him with fixed bayonets.' Nothing about calling off an attack. The messenger's task was to locate three other companies and pass on the order. That necessitated him traveling through no-mans land which at most was a mile deep.As the film tells it, the Germans withdrew to set up a trap. In fact they withdrew to eliminate a large bulge in their lines. From Feb. 23 to April 5 of that year, the Germans were moving their troops to the Hindenburg Line. The Germans withdrew along a 27 mile front and caught the British completely by surprise. As a result, the British were very cautious in moving forward which negates the film storyline that the Brigade was isolated. In fact, the entire British line moved forward, not just one Brigade. The story of 1917 takes place on April 6 (which incidentally us the day the Americans entered the war.)The first noticeable flaw in the film is that the messengers are told to proceed southeast to find the Brigade. That would have sent them behind their own lines. Because the messengers had to travel westerly through their own trenches to reach the point that they jumped off into no-mans land, they had to be at a point at the easterly end of the bulge in the German lines. So they had to travel in a northerly direction. Also, they figured it would take them at least a day to get to the Brigade so the Brigade had to be located a considerable distance from the front lines. The day was cloudy and there was no sun or landmarks to guide the messengers and that was compounded when nightfall fell. However, in the true story, the messenger was in fact, much closer to the missing companies.Otherwise, the film realistically depicts the WWI battlefield conditions and it does the best job of depicting a man dying from a wound that I have seen in any film. But what keeps this film from being a best film is its failure to realistically depict the manuevers involved. It could have been told better.",6,3,10,28 January 2020
Rules of Engagement," A Must See Movie
","While this movie is very contrived and unrealistic it is a 'must see' because it shows that officers must make very hard decisions in combat which are necessary for them to complete their missions. Ironically this movie was made before 9/11 and the Iraq War yet our troops are now constantly being put in positions where terrorists are using innocent civilians as shields.	The story is about a Marine Colonel who is put in such a position. Being a retired Marine officer and a combat veteran who participated in many court martials and who became a lawyer after retirement, I understand the point of the movie but I also see how unrealistic it is. When I was an officer candidate, I went through a screening interview where I was asked what I would do in various combat situations. One involved women and children. If the candidate's final answer was that he would not kill them, he failed the course and was not commissioned. The Marines were looking for officers who could make the hard decisions necessary to successfully complete their missions. 	Later I had to make one of those hard decisions on the battlefield. Fortunately, it did not involve innocent civilians but people had to die because of it. I had to throw away the book and that is what Col Childers had to do when he was a lieutenant in Viet Nam when he killed the radioman. While that scene was unrealistic because killing the radioman would never have caused the Vietnamese Colonel to stop the battle, it illustrated that sometimes it is necessary to throw the book away in order to save the lives of your troops.	The court-martial was a farce. While the movie showed viewers how court martials are formed, it was otherwise bad fiction.  To begin with no general court martial is going to trial two weeks after charges are served on the accused. Another movie 'High Crimes' does the same thing. There is a long pre-trial investigation and hearing in which the accused is represented by counsel. Secondly, Col. Hodges, the defense lawyer would never have taken the photos in Yemen by himself because he cannot testify about the photos at trial. He would have had another person do the photos who could testify at the trial as to their authenticity and as to what they showed.	Samuel Jackson is a very credible actor in this film.",8,0,2,1 March 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A timely and accurate commentary
","Many will accuse George Clooney of using this film as a statement of his left wing views. But as a person who lived through the McCarthy era, I found the movie not only to be very faithful to the actual events, but startlingly timely in relation what is happening presently. While the movie is outstanding, it does not really bring out how bad McCarthyism was. It only hints at it and viewers unfamiliar with how radical the anti-communists were between the end of World War II and 1954 will never fully understand or appreciate the story this movie tells.What happened during the McCarthy period is of particular interest to Hollywood because so many in the film industry suffered as a result of McCarthyism in that for many years they were barred from the industry as a result either of their association with communist movements or because out of principle they refused to rat on their fellow members.It is not that I was a liberal or even a leftist during this period. I was a staunch anti-communist and a veteran of two combat tours in Korea. However, I was never afflicted with the paranoia that gripped America after WWII. I never saw American communists as a threat and I was well aware that many of those that associated with the communists prior to 1946, particularly during the Great Depression, did so out of a mistaken idealism, and that almost all disassociated themselves with communism after the Iron Curtain fell over Europe when the utter brutality of the Soviet regime and its failures became obvious. Almost all of those tarnished during the McCarthy era were very loyal Americans and it troubled me greatly at the time that the America I was fighting for could be so cruel to them.This movie is about Edward R. Morrow, who had the guts to stand up against McCarthy, and until recently I have always been a fan of CBS News for showing the way. But in firing Dan Rather CBS yield to the extreme right and it has lost the way. It is no longer the network Morrow made it to be. Fox News and radical right talk show hosts now are the McCarthys of the 21st Century and people like Bill O'Reilly and his ilk are today's McCarthys. If you watch or listen to these McCarthy disciples they follow his precept of constantly attacking the press as 'liberal' or 'far left' just as McCarthy and his contemporaries attacked any newsman who dared challenge McCarthy. An example was depicted in the movie when CBS news analyst Don Hollenbeck committed suicide because of the attacks on him.",10,1,1,11 April 2006
"Girl, Interrupted"," Pointless mess
","The movie seemed pointless.  Was the story about how sane people get railroaded into a mental institution? Was it about the incompetency of mental hospital staffs? Was the point that anyone who enters a mental institution should cooperate from the beginning even though they are sane?The plot became obvious leaving only a few questions as to how it gets from point to point. Everyone knows how it will end and it ends that way.The acting was atrocious. Angelina Jolie plays a sick bitch but that is easy for her to do because that is what she is in real life. Doesn't require any skill. Winona Ryder as the heroine is unconvincing in her role. While she should generate sympathy, she never does. She is a tramp and sometimes you believe that what she gets is what she deserves.I am glad I got to see this one free because I would have felt real bad if I had wasted money on this boring flick. And it did get so boring at times that I walked away from it.",3,3,9,27 May 2001
The Legend of 1900," Very entertaining
","If one is willing to give great liberties because the movie is  a fairy tale with a message, then it is entertaining though overly long. One of the things I liked about the movie was that there was no nudity or sex or foul language only to discover that it was rated 'R' for language. I watched it on the Bravo channel so I must have watched a cleaned up version. That was fortunate because if foul language had been used, it would have destroyed the fairy tale quality of the movie. During the period from 1900 to 1940 when the movie took place, foul language was rarely used and it would have detracted from the aurora of authenticity that made the movie go. Had I seen the foul language version I would have rated it much lower.But it is only an aurora and not reality. The ship, which was built before 1900, would have been out of service by 1920. Coal burning passenger liners were too inefficient to compete with the more modern oil burners, both in cost and speed, and the luxury lounge which was the center of the movie, would have been empty since anyone who could afford to travel luxury class would have travelled on the more modern ships.The movie needed to be shortened. One scene that could have been left out was the scene when Max and 1900 were careening around the ballroom while playing a piano during a storm. I don't think the scene added anything to the movie and it was too realistic. Anyone who has been on a ship in a storm would find the scene too unbelievable. In the first place Max and 1900 were sitting on a piano bench and the bench and the piano moved in synchronization as if they both connected, which is never going to happen. The much heavier piano is going to leave the bench quickly. Secondly, the piano gracefully swings around pillars. In reality that piano is going to go in a straight line until it crashes. Eventually it does but instead of traveling from side to side of the ball room it goes straight down the center of the ship. That would happen only if the ship made a 90 degree turn into the wind. But the whole point of the scene was to set up a conversation that Max and 1900 have shoveling coal as punishment. The movie did not have to go through that much of a contortion to set up the conversation.One of the best scenes in the movie is near the end when 1900 tells Max why he never left the ship. It was the highlight of the movie but took too long to get there.The scenes with Jelly Roll Morton were comedic and really part of a fairy tale because no black musician no matter how famous he was would have been allowed to mingle with the luxury class on either an American or British passenger liner.",8,1,3,18 August 2002
The Legend of 1900," An Entertaining Fantasy
","Although it is overly long and drags at times, I found the movie very entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the music. The cast is made up of no names who previously played only bit roles. It is a low budget movie but the scenery is usually authentic. Because the story is a fantasy, viewers have to overlook the unrealities. Such is how did 1900 learn to play the piano as well as he did without leaving the ship. My mother was a concert pianist and a music teacher and I learned to play the piano. To play a piano as well as 1900 required some extensive music lessons in order to master the keyboard as well as he did.
I have to hand it to Tim Roth. He did a marvelous job of playing the piano although it is unlikely that he actually played the music.
It was good enough that I watched it twice.",8,1,4,18 August 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Another Hollywood War Failure
","Having been a sniper instructer in the Marines and being familiar with the story of the legendary sniper, Vasily Zaitsev, I looked forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, I only recently had the opportunity. I was very disappointed.Although the movie is based on a true story, it deviates considerably from the true story. In true Hollywood fashion there is much more fiction than truth in this movie.Right from the beginning, it deviates from the truth. It shows Vasily as a 5 year old firing a high powered hunting rifle. It don't happen that way. I fired my first rifle when I was five but it was a cut down .22 using short rounds. It was all I could handle. Just the recoil from the type of rifle Vasily was shown using would have hurt him. He may have started hunting at the age of 5 but not with a high powered rifle. I went with my father on hunting trips starting when I was 5 but I wasn't allowed to use a high powered rifle until I was 15 when I was physically able to use it. But before that I learned much from my father about hunting.Second was the scenes following when Vasily was in the boats crossing the   Volga River in BROAD daylight. The history of the battle of Stalingrad is that the Soviets never crossed the Volga during daylight because of the German planes and artillery observors. They only crossed at night.Next, was the futile attack by Soviet soldiers, many not armed. At that stage of the battle for Stalingrad, the Soviets were not wasting troops attacking the Germans. The strategy was to defend the City at all costs. It was to make the Germans pay dearly for every inch they took. So it was ridiculous to show a futile charge by the Soviets and then Kruschev telling the general in charge of the failed attack that he should commit suicide. It would be more realistic if the general fell out of failure because his troops retreated from a defense position.Next, Vasily's story never included a love story. That is pure fiction. It detracted from the true story of Stalingrad which was the ferocious defense the Soviets put up. The movie would have been more interesting if the makers had made that the central theme.At times the movie makers did do some good battle scenes and at times they did show how snipers really worked at their trade but at times they botched it. A sniper never wore a helmet. Helmets by their shapes or silhouettes are dead giveaways. That is why Marines started wearing camoflaged covers on their helmets during WWII to break up the silhouette.Nor did snipers ever carry anything that was shiny, that would reflect light such as a nickle plated bolt handle on their rifle or a badge on their hat or uniform. Reflections were dead giveaways.Lastly, was the way the movie ended. Since the story of Vasily Zaitsev is legendary and has been broadcast many times on the History Channel and in other documentaries, many persons are already aware of how the true story ended. But for that reason I have no qualms about telling the true story of how the German Major who was their top sniper was killed. Those who I talked to about the movie all said that they knew Vasily would eventually kill the German sniper. The only suspense was how it would be done.Vasily and he were faced off against each other. As the German Major, who hidden, was trying to spot Vasily, Vasily saw the reflection off of the German's telescopic sight. Vasily aimed at that reflection and just as the German spotted Vasily, Vasily fired and killed the German.But the movie had the German sniper walking in the open when Vasily shot him. That never would have happened in reality. Snipers just did not walk out in the open because it was suicide to do so.",4,1,3,7 July 2003
The Departed," OverRated Piece of Bad Fiction
","Ironically, this was the only Best Picture nomination that I not viewed so I rented the day of the Acedamy Awards and played it after it had received the Best Picture Award. I was quite disappointed. If this was the best movie of 2006 then 2006 was really a down year for the movies, which it was. This movie is a piece of very distorted fiction like all of Scorsese movies Perhaps I lost my respect for the movie because the story began so badly. It was unreal as was much of the movie and hence it had no credibility which is often a characteristic of Martin Scorsese directed movies. It begins when Colin Sullivan who is fresh out of the police academy is immediately assigned as a detective. That doesn't happen in real life, no matter how good a cadet is. Police officers routinely spend at least one year and in most cases two years on probation as patrol officers so that they can learn the ropes. They are rookies. Making it worse, Sullivan is promoted to sergeant shortly after becoming a detective. Again, never happens.The same is true of Billy Costigan, who graduates from the Police Academy at the same time as Sullivan. He is immediately assigned as an undercover cop. Never happen. Until he learns the ropes as a patrol officer, he is not going to find himself undercover. And while undercover, he shows an exceptional amount of sophistication that only an experienced police officer would show.Next dumb thing, is the Police Captain in charge of Costigan goes to meet him alone, without any backup. If he was that stupid, he never would have made captain.And Mob Chief Frank Costello executes two people on the edge of major airport runway in broad daylight where everyone on airplanes landing or taking off can see him. Yeah! Since when do Mob Chiefs do the executions? But it is a typical Scorsese scene and there are several such unreal scenes in the film.I think that if anyone but Scorsese had directed this film it would have been a better film. My thought is that for sentimental reasons, the Academy wanted to give Scorsese an Oscar as director and that the voters had to give the movie an Oscar to justify the director's Oscar.",6,1,3,1 March 2007
The Green Mile," Good Movie, but way too long.
","It is a great story with good acting throughout but it drags on too long. It is obviously a piece of anti-death penalty crap and the gruesome execution of Eduard Delacroix was not necessary. In fact the excruciating detailing of the execution routines could have been and should have been edited out as surplusage. My feeling is the director was so smitten with his work he left little to the cutting room floor. There was much attention to the period detail except a large roll of cellophane tape, which did not exist during the depression years, was used to tape a mouth closed. It also seemed strange that there were so few men on death row at a time when many more people were sentenced to death than are now, although executions were carried out much more swiftly in those days.",7,0,1,6 March 2001
The Terminal," Entertaining even though unreal
","Another enjoyable Tom Hanks movie even though the plot is a typical fairy tale as is often the case in a Hanks' movie. Basically, Hanks, a foreigner, arrives at a New York airport but due to no fault of his own, his passport is revoked but because of a revolution in his home country he cannot be returned. He is not allowed into the US so he is confined to one terminal. One of things that makes this movie unreal is that Hanks can't speak or read English yet the Airport authorities never get an interpreter and talk to him only in English, which is fine for English speaking audiences and doesn't waste time doing translations in the movie but would never happen in real life. The story revolves around his life in the airport terminal and the suspense is whether or not he will ever get out of the terminal and if so, how.The subplot is his romance with an airline hostess, Catherine Zeta-Jones. Unfortunately, she adds nothing to the movie. Her acting was par for her which is sub-par and she doesn't really fit. While Zeta-Jones is not beautiful she is too glamorous for today's generally homely hostesses, And for an airport which is usually full of hostesses she is the only one that appears.But despite its flaws, the movie keeps moving and it is entertaining if one ignores its unrealities. The ending though is weird and not particularly satisfying.",6,0,0,18 February 2005
Wonder Woman," If you watched the Carter original, you will be sadly disappointed.
","Anyone who saw the original Wonder Woman movie, as bad as it was,wlll find the original far superior to this piece of crap even though the newer version is full of cinematic gimmicks which the original did not have.Lind Carter was not the greatest actress but compared to Gal Godot, Carter was by far the best Wonder Woman. Besides Carter is beautiful, Gadot is very unattractive. I suspect that those who exalt this film are feminists.And compared to the original movie, this one is badly directed. It lacks cohesiveness and credibility. It is as others have noted, a badly flawed flick. If you go to watch it, don't have high expectations because you will really be disappointed. The flick got a lot of undeserved praise.The only reason I went to see this flick was to take my 14 yr. old granddaughter and my 17 yr. old grandson. My granddaughter loved the movie, my grandson was bored by it, thought it was a waste of time. But I can understand why anyone who is still a juvenile at heart might enjoy this fantasy. Also, why viewers who were not old enough to watch the original Wonder Woman had nothing to compare the latest flick with the original. It is like the James Bond movies. The original Sean Connery versions were by far the best but as the movies went on and new actors became James Bond, they couldn't match Sean Connery. Likewise Gadot is no Lynda Carter. And I don't mean to compare the James Bond movies with the DC movies because the DC movies including the latest Wonder Woman are not even close to being in the same class as the James Bond movies. It is like comparing the Untouchables with the Brahmans.Another thing that one has to wonder. Wonder Woman was not released until June 2, yet there were so many reviews written prior to that date. So is someone stacking the deck in order to get people to watch the flick?",1,57,120,2 June 2017
The Queen," Splendid film
","When I first heard that Helen Mirren was playing the role of Queen Elizabeth, I shuttered. Mirren has had a very sleazy career and certainly her abominable life style is far beneath that of the Queen, who I have admired since she was a child. However, despite my reservations about Mirren, she did a superb job of playing the Queen and looked remarkably like her. Her performance was really a highlight of 2006 and the performance was hands down the best of the year The movie only briefly touches on Queen Elizabeth's illustrious reign and that is the period immediately following Princess Diana's death. The story has been so exhaustively reported on and in our recent movie, that the story is very familiar. For many there are no surprises. In reality, the movie is really just a docu-drama.The movie clearly depicts the disrespect that the Royal family had for Princess Diana. She was in fact a tramp, and a glory seeker. Unfortunately, too many in the public didn't understand what was going on and they idolized her for all the wrong reasons. That is not to say that her ex-husband was any better but clearly both failed as royals in their relationship. However, her conduct was such that she did not deserve any respect as a royal.For many, the movie gives a somewhat inside view of the life of the royals. It makes a hero out of Prime Minister Tony Blair who handled the situation in a most judicious manner. Unfortunately, because of his pushing England into the Iraq War, which has made him extremely unpopular in England, his moment in the sun will probably be forgotten although this film will certainly keep it in the spotlight.The movie is so well done, that even though I am giving it only nine stars, it will remain a classic. The writing is just as superb as Mirren's performance and it wrings just about as much out of the story as could be done. The subtleties are magnificent and it is a movie is one I will watch again and again. My only reason for not giving it a ten was that some of the supporting acting wasn't as strong as the film deserved.",9,0,0,23 May 2007

Saving Mr. Banks," Marvellous Movie
","Delightful story perfectly told by Disney - a show suitable for everyone. Not a great movie fan but this was top notch. Didn't even recognize Emma Thompson and though not her fan, she did a superb job. Hanks was also great but occasionally, he sounded like Forest Gump and that may have cost him the Oscar. But all the actors and actresses in the movie were tops and contributed to the film's success. Perhaps it is the Disney magic. Mary Poppins was a stellar motion picture so it made 'Saving Mr. Banks' even more interesting. But it wasn't just a story about Mary Poppins - it was a story not only about its author but also a story about Walt Disney and it told a lot about the man and why he was so successful. That in itself made the movie a winner.This is a movie I would like to see again and again. It is a classic.",10,1,2,5 February 2015
Midway," A BAD REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL MOVIE OR AS HAMMY AS THEY CAN GET!!
","This film should win the Raspberry Award for the worst film of the year. It is a cheap remake of the 1976 movie of the same name but which had real actors in the cast which this film did not. The cast consisted of would bes that probably were extras in high school dramas. The original film had a cast of Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, Glen Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum. James Coburn , Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert just to name a few. The best this film could come up with was a hamWoody Harellson who never could act his way out of a wet paper bag and is horribly amatuerish in this film.I have a special interest in the Battle of Midway. As a youngster, my father was stationed on Midway when the war broke out. He survived a shelling on December 7 which was nothing compared to the pasting Midway took during the Battle of Midway while he was there. It was a very tense time for my mother and her children at this time.About all the makers of the film achieve is some degree of accuracy in the details of the equipment shown in the film. The film uses a lot of special effects that were not available in the original film but the original film depicts the events more accurately and it was much easier to understand. One of the problems with this film, is it tries to go to far back to tell the story by trying to make an intelligence officer seem more prescient than he actually was. The film also tends to exaggeration in trying to make its heroes bigger heroes than they were. That was unnecessary because they were great heroes without any exaggeration.One inaccuracy was the depiction of the Japanese killing a captured American aircraft crewman
by throwing him off a ship tied to an anchor. In fact, the Japanese would never have wasted a useful anchor and actually tied him to water filled fuel cans. Except for the execution, the scene like many in the film, is fiction because the only record of the execution was a brief entry in a ship's log. All three of the captured American airmen were similarly executed.While the Battle of Midway was the beginning of the end of the war, one thing that is ignored in the film is as decisive as it was, it still could have been disastrous for the U.S. in that after the carrier warfare ceased, the Japanese had a very strong armada that could have easily taken Midway even though the Japanese no longer had any carriers. Even though the U.S. had two carriers left, neither had enough aircraft or crews to do anything to deter the Japanese had they chosen to continue their attack on Midway.My recommendation is that people who want to watch a movie about the Battle of Midway should watch the 1976 version.",1,2,3,30 March 2020
The Matrix," Watched whole movie but never saw the point.
","Good guys (humans) against bad guys (robots). Story made no sense and it was old hat. Supposed to be in the future but everything was late 20th Century. Ending was fairly predictable, only suspense was how they got there. Special effects very ordinary considering today's standards. One thing that did not make sense was that transporting could only be done by regular telephones and not by cell phone. Acting was pedestrian. Reeves has a long way to go.",4,2,5,5 September 2000
Windtalkers," So-so war flick
","The only thing that this war flick has to offer is that it makes viewers aware of the Navajo Codetalkers. Other wise, it has no redeeming value. It fails completely as a story of the battle of Saipan and the use of the Codetalkers in that battle. It is amazing how the producers went to great lengths to use authentic equipment and uniforms but that is about all that was authentic about this movie. Like in one scene in Hawaii where the Marines were having a party and were singing the Marine's Hymn. Every one was dressed in authentic Khaki but one individual was wearing a barracks hat rather than a garrison cap as all the others wore. When Marines left the states, they did not take barracks hats with them.Any resemblance to the actual battle for Saipan and the movie is purely coincidental. One example was the foliage in the movie. Saipan is a tropical island yet in several scenes it looked like it was shot in an autumn with trees that are not on Saipan and with yellow leaves.The Japanese never charged in daylight. All their charges were at night and they did not charge the first days of the battle. Unlike in the movie Japanese defensive positions were well dug in, mostly heavily reinforced bunkers and caves, so that they would not be vulnerable to air strikes. In the movie Japanese positions were wide trenches and some lightly covered gun positions, something one would never see in war.And Nicholas Cage was supposed to protect his Navajo Codetalker. Instead he constantly exposed him to imminent danger. Codetalkers were rarely exposed to close in fighting. They were communicators usually working in headquarters. Early on Nicholas Cage, a sergeant, uses his Codetalker to direct Naval gunfire from the battleship U.S.S. California (which actually was there) onto enemy positions. Sergeants do not call in naval gunfire. That is done by specially trained officers. The same was true of directing artillery.A battalion commander walks up to Cage and gives him a medal. Never happened that way. Medals were never awarded during a battle. They were always awarded after the battle was over in ceremonies where all men in the unit were present so all could see their comrades rewarded.The civilians on Saipan were Japanese and they were so frightened of the Americans most committed suicide. It is highly unlikely that Marines ever had an opportunity to have contact with Japanese civilians because they all would have fled their villages.In one scene Cage and his unit advance in a convoy on a recon mission. Never happened. Saipan had to be taken inch by inch and any vehicle that even got near the front lines (except for a tank) would have been destroyed by enemy fire.I could go on and on about the inaccuracies in the movie. It wasn't worth the price of admission. Being a former Marine I thought it would be interesting but it was just another John Wayne war flick.",3,1,1,23 December 2002
Gladiator," Overhyped movie, entertaining but mostly fiction
","Many critics blasted this film yet Hollywood fell in love it. Because of the critics I did not watch it until it was shown on HBO. I was appalled with its historical inaccuracy.Basically, Russell Crowe plays the role of a General in the Roman Army under the Roman Emperor Ceaser Marcus Aurelius, who many historians consider as one of the greatest Roman emperors. Marcus died while in Germany in 180 AD. His son, Commodus became the full emperor and made peace with the Germans.
It is at this point that the movie departs from history. In the movie, just befor Marcus Aurelius died he was going to appoint his successor. The fact is that he appointed Commodus co-emperor in 177 AD, three years before he died.The movie makes the point that Marcus Aurelius had no confidence that his son was suitable to be emperor. That much is true and the movie asserts that he tried to appoint someone else to succeed him. That is untrue. If he considered Commodus unfit to rule, why did he make him co-ruler? Because if he hadn't, under Roman custom, his son had to die if he was not made the successor.The story gets more bizarre as it goes on. Russell Crowe escapes execution by Commodus and his family is slain by Commodus, who does not know that Crowe is not dead. As cruel as Commodus is, it is unlikely he would have killed the family of Crowe. It would have served no purpose. In the process Crowe becomes a slave gladiator and winds up in Rome fighting as a gladiator before Commodus. So highly unlikely.I won't give you the ending but it is pure fiction. However, I will tell you what really happened. In 182 Commodus' sister Lucilla conspired with a group of senators to assassinate him. The plot failed, and Commodus retaliated by executing a number of leading senators. Thereafter, his rule became increasingly arbitrary and vicious. In 186 he had his chief minister executed in order to appease the army; three years later he allowed the minister's successor to be killed by a rioting crowd. Political influence then passed to the emperor's mistress and two advisers.Meanwhile, Commodus was lapsing into insanity. He gave Rome a new name, Colonia Commodiana (Colony of Commodus), and imagined that he was the god Hercules, entering the arena to fight as a gladiator or to kill lions with bow and arrow. Finally, when Commodus announced that he would assume the consulship on Jan. 1, 193, dressed as a gladiator, the public became incensed. On Dec. 31, 192, his advisers had him strangled by a champion wrestler.",5,4,9,3 June 2001
The Great Gatsby," Don't Waste Your Money or Your Time
","The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite novels. It was required reading in American Lit. However, the movie is mockery of F. Scoot Fitzgerald's novel. The novel left much for the imagination with its powerful imagery. This movie sucks. It is like a comic book version of the original novel leaving nothing to the imagination. It is only what the movie maker imagines, not what Fitzgerald had in mind. As for the cast, the last person that should have been cast as Gatsby is Leonardo DiCaprio. He not only doesn't fit the image of Gatsby, trying to make him Gatsby is like trying to drive a square peg through a round hole. And he doesn't even come close to acting like Gatsby.If a viewer had read Fitzgerald's book and then walked into this movie without knowing that it was supposed to be based on the novel, one would not have recognized the movie. Perhaps a viewer would have believed it was some sort of sequel.While the earlier Great Gatsby with Robert Redford was not perfect, at least it strongly resembled the novel, which this last version does not. So if someone wants to see a movie version of the Great Gatsby, watch the Redford version. Don't waste either your money or your time on this wacky version. Best yet, go read the book which I am doing again. That is the only benefit I got from watching the movie. It got me to read the book again which after this stinking movie, made me realize how good a writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald was.",Null,25,70,9 May 2013
Cinderella Man," Best Movie of 2005
","The best picture of 2005 and Russell Crowe should be the Best Actor. This story of former heavyweight champion Jim Braddock is superbly told with remarkable accuracy but it also is a history lesson. Most viewers don't have a clue as to how bad it was during the Great Depression but this movie will give them a clue. It would have been better except that a very revealing scene wound up on the cutting room floor during the director's cuts.In that scene, Braddock joins his family who are standing in a soup line. The significance of the scene is not that they are in a soup line but that Braddock has his boxing shoes hanging around his neck. After Braddock goes through the soup line, he then goes to his old gym to sell the shoes. He tries to get a dollar for them but he is so desperate he ends up selling them for a quarter. But the scene is also significant for another reason and should have been left in the movie.When he sells his shoes, his manager is lurking in the background and sees the sale and he knows Braddock is giving up fighting. Later, the manager is able to get Braddock a fight and when Braddock, who needs the money desperately, agrees, the manager gives him a pair of shoes. Because the earlier scene was cut, viewers are left guessing as to how the manager knew that Braddock needed the shoes.Another directors cut presents the same dilemma. Early in the movie, Braddock breaks his hand during a fight and the fight winds up a draw and he does not get paid. He is flat broke. Yet when he gets home his hand is in a cast and the cast is significant in the movie. The viewer has to wonder how did Braddock pay for the cast when he is so broke? What was cut was a scene in which after the fight, we see Braddock's manager prepare a splint and bandage up the hand for a cast. That scene should have been left in the movie.Director Ron Howard made few mistakes and these were two . But he was smart enough to get former heavyweight boxing manager Angelo Dundee not only as an adviser but a role in the movie. It improved the realism immensely. And if the viewer has watched the actual films of Braddock's championship fight, the viewer can see how realistically the fight was duplicated in the movie. For a rank amateur Crowe did a superb job of boxing.I am not a fan of Ren√©e Zellweger. I usually can't stand her but she was perfectly cast as Braddock's wife and she plays the part exceptionally well.One omission in the film. Max Baer, the heavyweight champion Braddock defeated, always wore a big Star of David on the left leg of his boxing trunks. Baer did this to show support of the Jews who were being badly persecuted in Nazi Germany at the time. It wasn't seen in the movie. The movie makes Baer out to be a very obnoxious person and possibly Howard was concerned that it would be considered anti-Semitic to make Baer look like a loud mouthed Jew.In a way this movie is nostalgic in that I grew up during the Great Depression. However, I was too young to have heard the Baer-Braddock fight. Besides like many at that time, we didn't have electricity so we didn't have a radio. Moreover, Jim Braddock was kind of an in betweener among heavyweight boxers. In between Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney and Joe Louis. Champions such as Primo Carnera, the Argentine Bull, and German Max Schmelling were more famous and Braddock was a forgotten man until Ron Howard and Russell Crowe resurrected him in Cinderella Man.",10,2,3,6 February 2006
