Mission: Impossible III," 1000 times better than the first 2
","This movie really leaves the first two in the dust. I have some friends of whom didn't want to see the film because they were afraid Tom Cruise would be... Tom Cruise. Anyway! I can proudly announce that the entire cast acts their butts off in this flick and they do it well, but Philip Seymour Hoffman really stole the show. He was bad @$$ with a capitol A, and I never thought I'd say this, but he was kinda sexy too. It's so refreshing to have a villain that does what he says he's going to do and doesn't monologue the hero to death. Not to mention that the writers were realistic in this one: main characters get hurt.I've already seen Mission Impossible III twice; So it's safe to say that this movie is worth paying full price for a seat at the Big Screen.",10,2,5,24 May 2006
Capote," Enjoyable
","This movie felt really slow at times, but all in all I enjoyed the film as a whole. It's a good story, told well. Hoffman definitely deserves his award for this one. I don't know why but I've been watching a lot of Philip Seymour Hoffman movies lately and noticing him in films I didn't realize he was in before (i.e. Twister). I was expecting a biography of Truman Capote's life from birth to death, but this one pretty much focuses on what he went through to author 'In Cold Blood.' Even though it's not as biographical as I assumed it would be, I learned a lot about Capote just by watching this picture.I know it's no longer in theaters; So, I suggest that you rent it if you're ever in the mood for something a little depressing.",8,0,0,24 May 2006
American Psycho," Kinda Funny; Kinda Scary!
","American Psycho was a little too dirty. I didn't enjoy seeing so many nude shots with the prostitutes or the bed scenes with that pot-head chick Bateman was having a affair with, Some of that could have been cut out or shortened, but for the most part I enjoyed this movie. Some scenes were really funny. I feel bad for thinking that Bateman's behavior was funny, because the film isn't categorized as a dark comedy, but there are plenty of scary scenes. Bateman is charismatic, intelligent, classy, and frightening. I applaud Christian Bale for taking on this role. Lately he's been casted as sadistic, scary characters that audiences can't help but take an interest in. I can't wait to see him as Batman. He'll play it deliciously. I hope he plays the sadist again - he does it so well - not that I don't love his singing, dancing, Disney side (because I do).",7,1,3,4 September 2004
