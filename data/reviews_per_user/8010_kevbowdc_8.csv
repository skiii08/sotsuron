Changeling," Do not Do No listen to the critics
","Although I have to say that this isn't the best movie I have ever seen, I can say that this is a very good movie and one of the best of the year. Clint Eastwood continues to prove that he is a director that is large and in charge, and one can see that in the direction of this movie. In my opinion, there weren't any standout performances except for ANGELINA JOLIE. She made sure that she was the standout and that she is a force to be reckoned with. One could feel her pain and anguish as she goes through the trials of looking for her son. She totally captured the role and trust me it deserves an Oscar nomination. I don't know if she will get the win, but she definitely deserves the nomination. Her compassion and pain can be felt by the viewer and if you can't feel it while watching this movie, then you have no feelings. The movie did get off to a slow start, but once it picks up, it continues to bring on the excitement. Some scenes were hard to watch, but Clint's excellent direction keeps the viewer engaged and one can't help but go through the emotions. Overall, a good film, but there were a few glitches that could have made this movie 'excellently superb.' I recommend seeing this movie.",7,15,28,1 November 2008
Lone Survivor," Great Movie.... Wrong Star
","I had the privilege of attending an advance screening of Lone Survivor and I must say that it is one of my favorite movies of 2014. So far, it is currently in my top 10. It's a movie based on the true story of Seal Team Members that went on a failed mission to capture a Taliban leader. The beginning starts off slow but once it picks up, you are left on the edge of your seat... biting your nails... squirming (falling down the mountain scenes)... and then overall emotional. I was highly impressed by the performances of Emile Hirsch and Taylor Kitsch. Emile played hard and tough but when the defying moment came for him, he turns into a softhearted human that captures the essence of the role. Taylor remained strong in such a tumultuous ordeal and his courage really inspired me. I could never imagine what the real soldiers went through but Taylor's commitment to the role brought tears to my eyes. Again, the movie has all of the thrills that you expect from a war film and it's doesn't sugar coat anything. Some scenes are gruesome but nothing you would lose your stomach over. The only misstep was MARK WAHLBERG. Don't shoot me because I think that he is a good actor but he plays the same character in all of his movies (personality-wise). Not once did I feel like he was playing another character but he was the typical Mark that we have all seen before. I must applaud his commitment to the role though because I'm sure that it wasn't an easy task. He was sorely miscast. Just a minor bump in a great film.If you're emotional, bring the Kleenex because the movie does pull at your heart strings. If you're a strong man like myself, you'll be okay but you're not human if this movie doesn't move you. It is a must see because it reminds you of the hard work and the sacrifices soldiers have provided for us. This is powerful a film and I am in debt to all of the lives that were sacrificed for our country. 8/10",8,2,10,9 January 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain of the Marvel Sequels
","So, let me start out by saying that I walked into this movie with the lowest of expectations. After the credits, I walked to the nearest Bakery and purchased the biggest slice of humble pie. This movie exceeded every expectation and was well worth the wait. After the okay sequel of Thor, I expected the same for captain America. Not only was this a great movie, but the best sequel from the Marvel franchise.So just a quick synopsis: 'Captain America' struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles a new threat from old history: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. Captain America delivers! His action was subtle in the first movie but they took it up quite a few notches in this one. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. And I am so proud of Chris Evans who successfully transitioned from a comedic to a more serious actor. His performance didn't blow me away but he fits well into his CA role. He doesn't take it too seriously but gives a performance that's efficient for the role. You can tell that not much CGI was used in this film compared to the other Marvel films... but that's what makes it so great! It all felt so real that it could be too real at times. Especially the non-stop action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If only I could rewind some parts of the movie to review the fighting sequences because they were exceptional. The acting: All around well done. Scarlett is awesome black widow and Samuel L Jackson delivers what you expect. But I must point out the newcomer Anthony Mackie who deserves a spin-off as the falcon. I've always been a fan of his and it is about time that he is being shown in a huge blockbuster. He rocked as the falcon and I see great potential in his character. Finally, the Winter Soldier was an exceptional villain. He was a bad-ass, very-well constructed and well written. He was a formidable foe against CA and the audience will be pleased with what they see. In conclusion: go and see this movie. It was money very well spent and it gives the marvel franchise justice. My only issue with the movie was with the 3D. I really do not think that it was needed. Some of the shots were dark and with the glasses made it darker and harder to see. The movie is just as great without them. I hope that Marvel continues to deliver good films like this one because I can now say that Captain America is my new favorite character.",8,4,8,4 April 2014
American Hustle," American Struggle
","Okay... let me be honest... this movie was not good. It wasn't bad though... it was just... OKAY! I really do not understand where the plaudits are coming from. I wish that I can explain the movie but I can't. It was quite confusing. My guess is that it was based on the 70's of two con artists that become enamored with an opulent lifestyle, parties, and money? I don't know... again, it was not good. I wish that I can find something great about this movie but the only thing is I'm glad that I didn't purchase popcorn because of all of the money that I would have wasted. I really do want my money back! LOL but I digress... The Writing: The story line was all over the place. I feel as if the writer was trying to take on a 'Martin Scorsese' route but failed miserably.The acting: I would have to say that the best actors were Jeremy Renner and Bradley Cooper but that's not saying much. I honestly believe that if they were given a better script, they would have been dynamic. I wouldn't be surprised if Bradley scored a Best supporting actor Oscar nod because his role is 'out there' but there really isn't much to choose from. Christian and Amy were okay but their roles were dull because of the writing. And Jennifer Lawrence... OMG talk about over acting. Some parts were good but some were just juvenile (i.e. the Microwave scene.) There's a lot of Oscar talk around her performance and that's okay.. but to win would be a travesty! She just won last year and the performance is NOT worthy of another one. I thought that the movie would pick at some point and it never did. I take that back... it did once the credits started to roll. Overall, I am very disappointed in this movie because I was really looking forward to seeing this all year. I really do believe that the critics are too terrified to speak up and say how dull this movie was. I honestly think that because the Oscar season has some controversial films (12 years a slave: which is perfection, and Wolf of Wall street: great movie) they are looking for something that plays it safe and makes people happy. That is the only reason why this movie is getting good reviews and it doesn't deserve them. I would be more forgiving and less cruel if I could get my money back, but I can't. This movie should have been released straight to DVD and it's something that you watch when you are cleaning up your house and there's nothing else good on. 5/10",5,6,10,9 January 2014
Paranormal Activity," I'm sorry, but this movie SUCKETHS!
","This movie is just proof that sometimes you cannot listen to the hype. I went into this movie with such high expectations and expecting to be leaving half way through the movie due to the terror. I actually wanted to leave half way because I wanted my money back. This movie was the pits. I'm sorry but Quarantine had the same camera like effect and although that was just a good movie, it was MUCH better than this Paranormal clump of whatever. I cannot believe that people lost sleep over this movie... that same night I slept like a baby. I've seen much more scarier movies than this (The Exorcist and Amityville Horror LOL.) Man, talk about total letdown. Please do not waste your money on this movie, because you will have WTF moment and beg for your money back. :-(... I would rather watch Catwoman and Gigli over and over again than to ever see this mess... That TV show BEYOND BELIEF was scarier than this... Uggg!",4,3,6,20 October 2009
The Dark Knight," This movie was not good....it was EXCELLENT...great is even an understatement
","Usually when people pump up a movie, you go in and see it and you are thinking to yourself, 'What such crap.' But the Dark Knight is absolutely an exception. This is one of the rare movies that stands in a league of its own. For those that say that this movie has flaws needs to realize that every movie ever created has it flaws, but every single element in the Dark Knight outshines anything you see to be flawed. I walked out of the movie saying, seeing it once is just not enough. Trust me I am going back to see it at least two more times. Maybe even more. Christian Bale does a great job as the Batman. He is probably one of the best Batmans in the series. I have to admit, his Batman disguise voice was funny but hey... he could not be found out. He embraces the character very well and he does the Batman character justice. The only character that I found forgettable was Maggie 'Gyllenhal.' She did her job and there was nothing special about her character but just a pretty face. Don't get me confused now she did a good job but she did not have a standout performance. The two face character was well played. He would be a great addition to the next sequel of the Batman franchise. Last but not least, Heath Ledger's performance. For those who said he was great as the joker were mistaken. He was INCREDIBLE as the joker. I could not keep my eyes off of him in the movie because his role was soo captivating. Every time the movie went to another scene, I was saying 'where's the joker? when is he coming back on? we need more of the joker' I have to admit, after watching his performance, I wanted to go home and cut my face and put on some clown makeup (LOL) but I would be absolutely shocked and disgusted if he does not gain a posthumous Oscar nomination. He was sooooo incredible and he has to be the best villain ever played in a movie. It's just sad that all of that talent went to waste because judging by this performance, Heath was destined to be something so great. I could go on and on about the movie, but my words don't do the movie justice. GO AND SEE IT. This is the one movie that I have ever given a 10/10 on and if I could go higher I would. Trust me, after seeing it, you will want to go back for more because one is just not enough.",10,3,7,23 July 2008
Pineapple Express," Pretty cool plot for action but not that great
","I saw this movie at a free screening in Hunt Valley, Maryland and was very excited to see it. Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow make great movies such as 40 Year old virgin, knocked up, and SuperBad. Although this movie had a pretty good plot of witnessing a murder, being on the run from the bad guys, and finally having a confrontation with the bad guys, there wasn't really anything new I haven't seen before. There were the same ole gags of a guy getting high, making funny comments every sentence he utters just because he is high 24/7. I do believe that it was a good idea to mix in pot and action, but I was just expecting something a little different. Although I think the movie could have been better, Seth did do a pretty good job acting although he seems to fall into the same story line of being a slob working odd jobs. There really wasn't anything special from his performance, but just like his other movies, he provided the laughs while being serious at some moments. The standout actor to me would have to be James Franco. He did a pretty good job transforming from a superhero villain to a Pothead. LOL But he embodied all of the characteristics of one who smokes weed. His mannerisms, his speech, the way he moved his facial features, his droopy eyes, attire all fit the characteristics. It wasn't an Oscar nominated performance, but I wouldn't be surprised if he gets like a MTV award or something. Overall the movie was cool, but nothing to go crazy about. If you are a huge fan of 40 year old virgin, Superbad, and Knocked up, you might walk away a little disappointed. But for the outrageous fans, you might just have a good time depending on the atmosphere. Although I was a little let down, I will still continue to see future Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow movies. Hey, all of your film series can't be perfect.",6,9,49,31 July 2008
The Great Gatsby," After a year of waiting.... I am soooooooooo disappointed
","Having read the book back in High school and being a fan of the Robert Redford version (yes I know it was flawed but I still enjoyed it), I was overall disappointed with the new Great Gatsby. The director was more enthralled in the visual spectacles that he forgot about the heart of the story and character development. The movie was dull and the character's roles were feckless (i.e. Myrtle: I forgot she was in the movie until the pivotal scene at the end). Isla has great talent and her role wasn't handled very well. Mulligan was great as Daisy and I must say that she outdid the great Mia Farrow (I still love her! I mean, have you seen Rosemary's Baby? Smile #Great Acting) I digress... Leonardo is a great actor, but I believe that he was OVERACTING in this film. Especially in the scene when he screams at someone SHOWN IN THE TRAILERS!!!!!!... the yell was over the top. Also, the scene when he is about to meet Daisy for the first time was a little forced and unbelievable. Honestly, the Great Gatsby is such a profound story that it is challenging to translate into film. Luz has jumped the shark with the film and although I've been waiting for over a year to see this movie, I was left extremely disappointed.",5,22,48,8 May 2013
