The Blair Witch Project," Do you want to be scared?
","It's about time someone reinvent the horror film. For too long, the tired recipe for thrills has left an under appreciated genre dull and listless. Finally a film that leaves something to the imagination and keeps building upon our own primal fears. Let's just say it will be some time before I can go camping again, thanks to this long-awaited welcome addition to the non-slash horror film. I would rank it with The Exorcist and Halloween.",10,1,2,3 August 1999
Batman Begins," The Dark Night Personified
","I have read reviews from several prominent critics who do not seem to appreciate that Batman Begins is a return to the roots of the Dark Knight; a remiss from the slapstick, pun-endured tailspin into schlock that the previous series became. I will say that I enjoyed this film so much more because it had a very serious tone. Sure, there were a few situationally humorous moments -- but all in all, we're talking about a tormented figure hell-bent on making things better. There's just not a lot of laughs in that.To me, falling back on the campy, slapstick style we've seen in the past would have been a huge mistake. Maybe some of these critics should at least flip through a few of Frank Miller's pages to see that this was pretty damn good, and much better than what we've been handed before. I didn't miss the Prince dance sequences and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was exceptional.Overall, I appreciated Nolan's film more because it was based almost solely on the story -- I never found myself getting caught up in the eye candy; everything was cohesive. The set design, effects, costumes, soundtrack... everything was supportive of the story. Honestly, I didn't care for the bat-mobile at first, but I can appreciate that it's something that he acquired through the means he had available, rather than something that was just sitting in the Bat Cave. One criticism that I do not agree with concerns panning the pacing of the first half of the film. I felt it made for a complete story, rather than 'You know there is a dude named Batman, and here's another day in the life...' with a few flashbacks thrown in almost as an afterthought (okay, Burton did a good job with that, but this was better).Moreso, I appreciated the lack of contrived sound bytes ('Your entrance was good, his was better.'). The film had a very organic feel to it, and I never felt myself questioning the motives of any person. I barely even realized that Gordon was Gary Oldman -- he was that good, especially for a part so far removed from what we usually find him in.The most pleasant surprise was Scarecrow. I remember seeing images before the movie came out and thinking, 'That's our antagonist? Are they going easy on the Bat for the first flick?' The sequences involving Scarecrow were very well done; and, to a point, not overdone. That dude scared the hell out of me.I can't wait to see what they do 'next'. Something tells me it will be good... damn good.",10,3,4,15 June 2005
