Requiem for a Dream," Great and powerful film!
","It was one of the best I have seen in a long time. I found myself loving and empathizing, but at the same time hating and despising the characters. This is a portrayal of what addiction (not just drug, but all addictions) can do to a person. It displays how desperate and hopeless addiction makes up. I love that it stayed gritty and unapologetic about the situations. There was no happy ending and I like that. There is no glorifying the addictions, it is real and haunting. The visuals were potent, the characters appearances deteriorated as the film progressed. The actors all did a wonderful job as they each found their characters falling deeper into the depths of insanity brought on by their own vices.",9,2,4,20 April 2007
Twilight," Not as Good as the Book!
","The movie was good but not as good as the book which I completely expected. It felt a bit rushed and it left a lot out, but I understand how hard it is to squeeze 500 plus pages in to a two hour movie.The movie really didn't touch on any of the supporting characters, which was a disappointment since some of those characters are my favorites and make up a big part of the books. I think all the actors did a great job, but it would have been nice to see more of the Cullen family and the 'human' friends.I like the look and feel of the movie. It had a kind of cold gloomy look. The locations were beautiful, but I am from the Pacific Northwest and I am slightly biased to the lush green landscapes here. I enjoyed the movie, but as with all book adaptations I was hoping for much more.",8,26,54,21 November 2008
