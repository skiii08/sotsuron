United 93," A Story of Courage like no other!!!
","I watched this movie last night on the fifth anniversary of 9/11, and have never been so affected in my life by any movie quite like it. I was literally shaking and convulsing nearing the end; the highlight of the hijacking scene. Probably what added to my physiological state was crying my heart out in a frenzy of watching all the coverage on t.v., all the documentaries, all the comments of the victim's families during the day, and then to end the night by watching this movie.I opened myself to the raw emotions that seemingly these heroes (the passengers) must have felt. The raw emotions of horror, hurt, pain, dismay, anger and finally determination. They were determined not to surrender to the evils of these religious fanatics (the hijackers). Can anyone be any more courageous than that? Despite the destined danger they were all in, they collectively became a force that symbolized honor and pride. That is what no terrorist could ever take away.... our will to defend, to protect and to do what's right!One thing that really defines a moment of controversy, is that both these different groups, the passengers and hijackers were praying. But praying for different reasons. I wonder what the (true) Almighty God thought on that very day. I can't help but bring him into the picture, I guess I'm just angry that he could allow a situation of this magnitude to occur. But I know I'm stirring up unnecessary pain by having views like this. Deep down I know that God in his own time, with his infinite wisdom will bring all these men with evil hearts to justice.I just pray right now, for peace in all our hearts. And for these wicked ideologies, regime, propaganda and erroneous beliefs to be relinquished. It may not happen in our generation but for the path of the future, may there be hope! Anyhow, the cinematic and directive aspect scores high, but I guess because we know that this is a reenactment of the real thing, that even the second-rated acting is very real and believable.All in all, it's a movie that deserves high recommendation and for everyone to see it, but only if they're ready to deal with the emotional impact it delivers. Consider it as one positive thing that derived from this whole madness; the valiant heroes of United 93!",9,0,1,12 September 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," AND ROEPER GAVE this a thumbs up???
","I'm not a prude or an angel, but the swearing really got to me within 15 minutes of the show. It's sad that movies now have to be so saturated with profane, obscene and vile language so as to make it to the 'Box Office'.Coincidentally right after I watched 'The 40-yr. old Virgin' last night, 3rd Feb., ABC's 20/20 had a segment on rudeness and how society is failing morally. It was such a juxtaposition of the nature of these two shows, but confirmed the depiction of where 'life' is heading; indisciplined, fowl and thoughtless behaviour. Yes.. welcome to the age of uncencorship.For the most part, I tried to make it through to the end of the movie and was glad I did. I felt I had to scrub my ears from the dirtiness. Especially Gerry Bednob's character Mooj's expressions. OMG!!! I couldn't believe an old guy could talk like that.I think Steve Carrell was feeling a bit anxious in building his acting career, and was desperate in acting, writing and producing this movie so as to establish himself on the big screen and move away from small screen roles. Anyway, he's the one laughing all the way to the bank, huh? Don't get me wrong I love him in 'The Office' but think that he has such a potential to grow beyond the 'the immature, tyrannical, high-school prank roles'. He has a similarity with the likes of Ben Stiller in these off-the-wall comedies, and could excel to dynamic Oscar-grabbing stardom!!!! STill a fan of his though! I think the movie would have done better if most of the cursing, swearing and sick slap-stick dialogue was deleted. It was o.k. and funny, but you just have to endure the profanity.",4,2,5,4 February 2006
